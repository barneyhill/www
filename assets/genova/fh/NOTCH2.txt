# NOTCH2

## Overview
The NOTCH2 gene encodes the notch receptor 2, a transmembrane protein that is a pivotal component of the Notch signaling pathway. This receptor is integral to numerous cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, across various tissues. The NOTCH2 protein is characterized by a large extracellular domain with multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that facilitates signal transduction. The receptor's activation is tightly regulated through ligand binding, which triggers proteolytic cleavages, releasing the intracellular domain to function as a transcriptional activator in the nucleus. NOTCH2 plays critical roles in immune system development, vascular biology, and bone metabolism, among other functions. Mutations in the NOTCH2 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, such as Alagille syndrome and Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain cancers (Lee2009Gain‐of‐function; Kamath2011NOTCH2mutations).

## Structure
The NOTCH2 protein is a member of the Notch receptor family, characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The extracellular domain contains multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, which are involved in ligand binding and receptor activation (Stephenson2015Mutational). The intracellular domain includes RAM, ANK, and PEST sequences, which are crucial for signal transduction and regulation of protein stability (Stephenson2015Mutational).

The secondary structure of NOTCH2 includes beta-sheets within the EGF-like repeats, contributing to the protein's ability to interact with ligands (Stephenson2015Mutational). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to facilitate ligand interaction and proper receptor function (Stephenson2015Mutational).

The Notch2 negative regulatory region (NRR) contains a heterodimerization (HD) domain, which plays a critical role in maintaining the receptor in an autoinhibited state until activation. This region includes three Lin12/Notch repeats and a heterodimerization domain that prevent premature signaling (Gordon2009Effects). The HD domain is resilient to structural changes, even when the S1 cleavage site is altered (Gordon2009Effects).

Post-translational modifications of NOTCH2 include glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage, which are essential for its maturation and function (Gordon2009Effects). Splice variants of NOTCH2 can lead to different isoforms with distinct functions, contributing to the diversity of its roles in cellular processes (Stephenson2015Mutational).

## Function
The NOTCH2 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. In the immune system, NOTCH2 is crucial for the development and function of specific cell types, such as marginal zone B (MZB) cells and splenic dendritic cells (DCs). It also plays a role in intestinal immunity by regulating the development and localization of intestinal DCs and mast cells, as well as the differentiation of helper T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (SakataYanagimoto2012Notch2).

In endothelial cells, NOTCH2 signaling influences apoptosis by negatively regulating survivin, a protective molecule, thereby sensitizing these cells to apoptosis (Quillard2009Notch2). In vascular smooth muscle cells, NOTCH2 acts as an anti-proliferative factor, inhibiting proliferation in response to platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) (Baeten2015Differential).

In bone cells, NOTCH2 enhances osteoclastogenesis by interacting with nuclear factor (Nf)-kB, promoting the transcription of Nfatc1, a gene critical for osteoclast development, thus playing a role in bone resorption (Zanotti2016Notch). These diverse roles highlight the importance of NOTCH2 in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis across different systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NOTCH2 gene are implicated in several genetic disorders, most notably Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and Hajdu-Cheney syndrome (HCS). In ALGS, mutations in NOTCH2 account for less than 1% of cases, with the majority being due to mutations in the JAG1 gene. These mutations in NOTCH2 can lead to a range of symptoms, including cholestatic liver disease, cardiac defects, and skeletal abnormalities, with variable expressivity among patients (Kamath2011NOTCH2mutations). Functional analyses of these mutations have shown decreased Notch signaling, suggesting a loss-of-function effect (Kamath2011NOTCH2mutations).

In contrast, HCS is associated with gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH2, particularly those affecting exon 34, which result in the loss of the PEST domain. This leads to a longer half-life of the NOTCH2 protein and increased signaling activity. Clinically, HCS is characterized by severe osteoporosis, acroosteolysis, and craniofacial abnormalities (Majewski2011Mutations; Zhao2013Mutations). The gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH2 are also implicated in certain cancers, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where they contribute to the pathogenesis by altering normal cellular signaling pathways (Lee2009Gain‐of‐function).

## Interactions
NOTCH2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It binds to DSL (Delta/Serrate/LAG-2) proteins, including Delta1, Jagged1, and Jagged2, which act as ligands. This interaction induces cleavage of the NOTCH2 transmembrane subunit, releasing the intracellular domain that translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator (Shimizu2000Binding). The binding of these ligands to NOTCH2 is calcium-dependent, and the process involves hyperphosphorylation of the intracellular domain (Shimizu2000Binding).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), NOTCH2 in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is crucial for activating Wnt signaling in CLL cells. It inhibits GSK3-β, preventing β-catenin degradation, and regulates the expression of complement factor C1q, which stabilizes β-catenin by activating the Wnt co-receptor LRP5/6 (Mangolini2018Notch2). NOTCH2 also influences the expression of N-cadherin, which stabilizes β-catenin through interactions between CLL cells and BMSCs (Mangolini2018Notch2).

In erythropoiesis, NOTCH2 interacts with Jagged1, mediating stem cell factor (SCF) signaling. This interaction is crucial for SCF-mediated erythroid cell expansion and differentiation (Zeuner2010The).
