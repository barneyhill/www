# SLC22A4

## Overview
The SLC22A4 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 4, commonly known as organic cation transporter novel type 1 (OCTN1). This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 22, which is characterized by its role in the transport of organic cations and zwitterions across cell membranes. OCTN1 is a transmembrane protein with 12 predicted alpha-helical transmembrane domains, facilitating its function as a transporter. It is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, skeletal muscle, and heart, where it plays a crucial role in the cellular uptake and excretion of compounds such as ergothioneine, choline, and acetylcholine. The transporter's activity is modulated by sodium ions, and it operates through mechanisms such as facilitated diffusion and exchange processes. SLC22A4 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, due to its involvement in inflammatory pathways and cellular homeostasis (Koepsell2013The; Volk2013OCTs; Yee2021Emerging).

## Structure
The SLC22A4 gene encodes the OCTN1 protein, which is part of the solute carrier family 22. This protein is characterized by a common membrane topology that includes 12 predicted alpha-helical transmembrane domains (TMDs) (Koepsell2013The; Volk2013OCTs). The structure features a large extracellular loop between the first and second TMDs, which is glycosylated and contains conserved cysteines that may form disulfide bridges, playing a role in oligomerization (Volk2013OCTs). There is also a large intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh TMDs, which contains phosphorylation sites for protein kinases involved in regulation (Volk2013OCTs).

The substrate binding site of SLC22A4 involves multiple TMDs, with a conserved glutamate residue in the 11th TMD crucial for substrate binding (Volk2013OCTs). The protein operates via an alternating-access mechanism, where substrates bind to the outward-open conformation, inducing a conformational change to an inward-open state for substrate release (Volk2013OCTs). SLC22A4 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, skeletal muscle, placenta, heart, and prostate (Jacobsson2007Identification). The protein is involved in the transport of organic cations and zwitterions, functioning through facilitated diffusion, cotransport with Na+, and exchange for H+ (Volk2013OCTs).

## Function
The SLC22A4 gene encodes the organic cation transporter OCTN1, which is involved in the transport of various organic cations and zwitterions, including ergothioneine, choline, acetylcholine, and tetraethylammonium. OCTN1 is expressed in multiple tissues, notably in whole blood, and functions as a sodium-dependent transporter, facilitating the intracellular accumulation of ergothioneine, an important antioxidant (Tamai2012Pharmacological; Yee2021Emerging). The transporter exhibits a complex mechanism that varies with the direction of transport and the charge of its substrates. For instance, the influx of ergothioneine is sodium-dependent, whereas the influx of acetylcholine is inhibited by sodium (Yee2021Emerging).

OCTN1 is localized on the apical membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells, where it acts as an organic cation/proton exchanger, contributing to the excretion of cationic compounds into urine (Tamai2012Pharmacological). It is also expressed in the small intestine and liver, playing a role in the absorption and hepatic disposition of ergothioneine (Sugiura2010Functional). The transporter is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress by regulating ergothioneine levels (Nakamura2008Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC22A4 gene, which encodes the organic cation transporter OCTN1, have been linked to several diseases. Variants in SLC22A4 are associated with Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Specifically, the L503F missense substitution and other polymorphisms in the gene form a risk haplotype that increases susceptibility to Crohn's disease, particularly when combined with CARD15 gene variants (Newman2005A; Peltekova2004Functional). These genetic changes can affect the transport function of OCTN1, potentially contributing to disease mechanisms (Peltekova2004Functional).

SLC22A4 mutations have also been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, with certain SNPs showing associations in specific populations (Fisher2006Direct). The gene's expression is regulated by factors such as TNF-alpha and transcription factors, which may influence its role in inflammatory diseases (Koepsell2013The).

In addition to inflammatory diseases, a specific missense variant, p.C113Y, in SLC22A4 has been identified as a cause of hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss in North African populations, suggesting a founder effect and incomplete penetrance (Chiereghin2021SLC22A4).
