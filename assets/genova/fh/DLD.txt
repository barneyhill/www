# DLD

## Overview
The DLD gene encodes the enzyme dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial flavoenzyme that is integral to cellular energy metabolism. As a member of the class I pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family, this enzyme is involved in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and the oxidation of dihydrolipoamide, functioning within several α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes, such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. These complexes are crucial for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mitochondrial respiration, underscoring the enzyme's role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Fan2023High; Chen2024DLD). Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase also acts as a mitochondrial respiration-dependent copper ion carrier, influencing processes like cell death regulation (Fan2023High). Mutations in the DLD gene can lead to metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Ciara2016Difficulties). Additionally, variations in DLD expression have been linked to cancer prognosis, suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Yang2023Comprehensive).

## Structure
The human dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (hLADH), encoded by the DLD gene, is a mitochondrial flavoenzyme that plays a critical role in several multienzyme complexes. The primary structure of hLADH consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a functional homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the catalytic activity of the enzyme (Szabo2023Structural). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common in proteins with such enzymatic functions.

The tertiary structure of hLADH is compact and globular, facilitating its role in catalysis and interaction with other components of the multienzyme complexes. The enzyme contains specific domains, including the FAD-binding domain and the NAD+/NADH-binding domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Ambrus2019An). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a homodimer, where residues from both monomers are essential for the enzyme's function. The redox-active disulfide bond (Cys45-Cys50) is located in one monomer, while the catalytic base His452 is part of the adjacent monomer (Szabo2023Structural).

Pathogenic mutations in the DLD gene can lead to structural changes that affect the enzyme's stability and function, often resulting in severe metabolic disorders (Szabo2023Structural; Ambrus2013Molecular).

## Function
The DLD gene encodes dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, an enzyme that is a member of the class I pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family. This enzyme plays a critical role in mitochondrial energy metabolism by participating in the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and the oxidation of dihydrolipoamide. It is a component of several α-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and glycine decarboxylase complexes, which are essential for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mitochondrial respiration (Fan2023High; Chen2024DLD).

DLD is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it contributes to maintaining redox balance by catalyzing the reduction of lipoamide. This activity is crucial for ATP production and cellular energy metabolism (Chen2024DLD). In healthy human cells, DLD's function in mitochondrial metabolism is vital for the production of energy and the regulation of metabolic pathways. Its activity influences the levels of downstream metabolites in the TCA cycle, which are important for cellular energy homeostasis (Fan2023High). The enzyme also acts as a mitochondrial respiration-dependent copper ion carrier, playing a role in cellular processes such as cell death regulation (Fan2023High).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DLD gene, which encodes dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, are associated with several metabolic disorders. One such condition is dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency, which affects the E3 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This deficiency can lead to a range of symptoms, including neurological issues, lactic acidosis, and liver dysfunction. In a study, a patient with Leigh syndrome exhibited symptoms such as delayed psychomotor development, involuntary movements, and elevated lactate levels due to a homozygous mutation in the DLD gene (Ciara2016Difficulties).

Alterations in DLD expression levels have been linked to various cancers. High DLD expression is associated with poorer overall survival in cancers such as breast cancer (BRCA) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), while it correlates with better outcomes in colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) (Yang2023Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also related to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint regulation, suggesting its role in tumor immunity and potential as an immunotherapeutic target (Yang2023Comprehensive). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DLD in both metabolic and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) is involved in several protein-protein interactions within multi-enzyme complexes. In the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, DLD interacts with the binding domain of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2BD). This interaction is characterized by the formation of a complex where one E2BD associates with one DLD dimer, burying 1457 Å² of surface area. The interface is stabilized mainly by electrostatic interactions, with residues from helix H1 of E2BD forming salt bridges with DLD (Mande1996Protein–protein).

DLD also interacts with proteins E2b and E3BP. In the E2b-DLD complex, salt bridges are formed between specific residues, such as K135 (E2b) with E437 (DLD), and E142 (E2b) with R414 (DLD). In the E3BP-DLD complex, interactions include R130 (E3BP) with D444 (DLD) and R136 (E3BP) with E437 (DLD) (Tabolacci2022Identification).

Phosphorylation of DLD at residues T412 and S441 can influence these interactions by increasing negative charges, potentially stabilizing the protein complexes. These modifications may create new interactions or alter existing ones, affecting the protein's functional dynamics (Tabolacci2022Identification).
