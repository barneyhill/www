# PSMC2

## Overview
PSMC2 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 2, a crucial component of the 26S proteasome complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. This protein is categorized as an ATPase and plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis by facilitating the breakdown of misfolded or damaged proteins, thereby regulating various cellular processes. The proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 2, is implicated in several cancer types, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Research has demonstrated that PSMC2 interacts with various proteins and pathways, influencing cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in oncology (Zheng2022PSMC2; Liu2022PSMC2; Duan2021PSMC2ITGA6).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
PSMC2 is implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels. In glioma, PSMC2 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis. Its knockdown in glioma cell lines inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor growth and survival (Zheng2022PSMC2). In gastric cancer, PSMC2 is also overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration, and its knockdown reduces these effects while increasing apoptosis (Liu2022PSMC2). 

In ovarian cancer, PSMC2 is highly expressed and linked to poor patient outcomes. It regulates cell proliferation and migration, and its knockdown results in decreased tumor growth and increased apoptosis (Zhu2021PSMC2CCND1). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PSMC2 expression correlates with poor survival rates. It promotes cell cycle progression and tumor growth, with knockdown leading to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis (Liu2021PSMC2). 

In breast cancer, PSMC2 is upregulated and associated with higher tumor grades. Its knockdown inhibits cell growth and migration, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Wang2021Overexpression). These findings highlight PSMC2 as a potential therapeutic target across various cancers.

## Interactions
PSMC2, a component of the 26S proteasome complex, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PSMC2 interacts directly with ITGA6 (integrin α6), forming a regulatory axis that is crucial for HCC progression. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, which demonstrated a physical interaction between PSMC2 and ITGA6. The knockdown of either PSMC2 or ITGA6 results in mutual downregulation, suggesting a reciprocal regulatory relationship (Duan2021PSMC2ITGA6).

In gastric cancer, PSMC2 is involved in the regulation of the RPS15A/mTOR pathway. It upregulates RPS15A, which in turn activates the mTOR pathway, promoting cancer progression. PSMC2 also interacts with the microRNA hsa-let-7c-3p, which targets both PSMC2 and RPS15A, indicating a competitive binding mechanism that affects cancer cell behavior (Liu2022PSMC2a).

In pancreatic cancer, PSMC2 interacts with ASPSCR1, a gene involved in chromosome stability, and forms a complex with other proteasome subunits such as PSMC1, PSMD2, and PSMD5. This complex is essential for protecting cells from the anti-proliferative effects of PSMC2 suppression (Qin2019PSMC2).
