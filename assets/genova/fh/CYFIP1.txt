# CYFIP1

## Overview
CYFIP1, or cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity. The CYFIP1 protein is a key component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which is crucial for actin polymerization and cytoskeletal dynamics, impacting neuronal connectivity and plasticity (Abekhoukh2017New; Biembengut2021Cytoplasmic). It interacts with the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) and the translation initiation factor eIF4E, forming a complex that modulates synaptic translation in response to neuronal activity (Napoli2008The). CYFIP1's role extends to maintaining dendritic complexity and stabilizing mature spines, with implications for synaptic stability and plasticity (Pathania2014The). Alterations in CYFIP1 expression are linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (OguroAndo2014Increased; Biembengut2021Cytoplasmic).

## Structure
The CYFIP1 protein is organized into three distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 57-632), the central domain (residues 633-921), and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is the largest and is characterized by a compact globular shape mainly composed of α-helices, containing most of the binding site for RAC1 (Di2015MD). The central domain has a planar shape with several α-helices of different lengths, including helix H8b, which is involved in binding to eIF4E (Di2015MD). The C-terminal domain also has a globular shape and interacts with NCKAP1, along with the central domain (Di2015MD).

Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CYFIP1 undergoes a conformational change from a planar to a more globular form, which affects its binding affinity with eIF4E and RAC1 (Di2015MD). This conformational flexibility is crucial for its role in different protein complexes, such as the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) and its interaction with eIF4E (Di2015MD). The protein's structure includes regions that facilitate its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics, with specific structural changes in helix H8b enhancing its interaction with eIF4E (Di2015MD). The secondary structure elements, particularly the α-helices, remain stable throughout simulations (Di2015MD).

## Function
CYFIP1, or cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 1, plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity. It is a component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which is essential for actin cytoskeleton dynamics and the activation of the Arp2/3 complex, facilitating actin polymerization. This function is vital for dendritic spine formation and maturation, impacting synaptic connectivity and plasticity (Abekhoukh2017New; Biembengut2021Cytoplasmic).

CYFIP1 interacts with the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) and the translation initiation factor eIF4E, forming a complex that represses translation at synapses. This interaction is modulated by synaptic activity, allowing for activity-dependent regulation of mRNA translation, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and the proper functioning of neuronal networks (Napoli2008The).

In neurons, CYFIP1 is involved in maintaining dendritic complexity and stabilizing mature spines. It regulates actin dynamics within dendritic spines, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and stability. CYFIP1's role in actin regulation is linked to its interaction with Rho GTPases, such as Rac1, which are involved in dendritic branch dynamics (Pathania2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CYFIP1 gene are linked to several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. CYFIP1 is associated with intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and schizophrenia. Changes in CYFIP1 expression can lead to synaptic plasticity issues, as seen in Cyfip1 haploinsufficient mice, which exhibit presynaptic dysfunction and abnormal dendritic spine formation (Biembengut2021Cytoplasmic). Overexpression of CYFIP1 has been observed in ASD patients, leading to increased mTOR activity, which is implicated in the disorder (OguroAndo2014Increased; Biembengut2021Cytoplasmic).

The gene is located in the 15q11-13 chromosomal region, associated with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Alterations in this region, such as deletions or duplications, can result in severe effects, including developmental delays and cognitive impairments (Abekhoukh2014CYFIP; Chung2015Parental). CYFIP1's interaction with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is significant, as its absence can affect CYFIP1's role in mTOR signaling, contributing to conditions like Fragile X syndrome (Abekhoukh2017New; Biembengut2021Cytoplasmic).

CYFIP1 is also involved in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, processes crucial for behavioral flexibility and learning. Changes in its expression or function can result in altered brain white matter and myelin thickness, leading to behavioral issues such as compulsive eating and learning deficits (Biembengut2021Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
CYFIP1 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various complexes that regulate translation and cytoskeletal dynamics. It directly binds to the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and the translation initiation factor eIF4E. This interaction is crucial for translational repression, as CYFIP1 forms a complex with FMRP and eIF4E at synapses, which can dissociate upon synaptic activity to allow protein synthesis (Napoli2008The; Schenck2001A). CYFIP1 competes with 4E-BP1 for binding to eIF4E, indicating a specific interaction site (Napoli2008The).

CYFIP1 is also part of the WAVE Regulatory Complex (WRC), which includes proteins like CYFIP2, WAVE, NAP1, ABI1, and HSPC 300. This complex is involved in actin polymerization, linking translational regulation to the actin cytoskeleton (Abekhoukh2017New). CYFIP1 interacts with the small GTPase Rac1, which is involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization, particularly in neurons (Schenck2001A).

The interaction between CYFIP1 and FMRP is mediated by multiple regions of CYFIP1, suggesting a complex binding surface (Schenck2001A). CYFIP1 does not exhibit RNA-binding properties, distinguishing it from other components of the FMRP-containing mRNP complex (Schenck2001A).
