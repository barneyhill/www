# EFNA3

## Overview
EFNA3 is a gene that encodes the protein ephrin A3, which is a member of the ephrin family of proteins. Ephrins are membrane-bound ligands that interact with Eph receptors, a class of receptor tyrosine kinases, to mediate cell signaling processes crucial for developmental events and cellular communication. Ephrin A3, in particular, is involved in various biological processes, including neural development and cancer progression. It plays a significant role in the auditory system by interacting with EphA4 and EphA7, contributing to the development and function of the cochlea (Hoshino2021Ephrin‐A3). Additionally, ephrin A3 is implicated in cancer metastasis, where it facilitates tumor cell movement through interactions with endothelial cells (GómezMaldonado2014EFNA3). The expression and function of EFNA3 have been studied in several cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with tumor progression and prognosis (Huang2022A; Deng2021EFNA3).

## Clinical Significance
EFNA3 (ephrin A3) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), EFNA3 expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with worse overall survival and shorter progression-free intervals. It is associated with advanced tumor stages, higher pathological stages, and vascular invasion, making it a potential prognostic predictor in HCC (Huang2022A; Papadakos2023Unraveling).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), EFNA3 is upregulated and linked to poor overall survival and progression-free survival. It is associated with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced TNM stages, serving as an independent prognostic risk factor (Deng2021EFNA3). EFNA3 also influences immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint therapy efficacy in LUAD, suggesting its role in the tumor immune microenvironment (Deng2021EFNA3).

In gastric cancer, EFNA3 expression is correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints, indicating its role in modulating immune responses. High EFNA3 expression is associated with better overall survival and disease-free survival, although this varies with clinical characteristics (Zheng2022EFNA3).

In bladder urothelial carcinoma, EFNA3 overexpression is linked to advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for tumor progression (Wang2023Clinicopathological).

## Interactions
EFNA3, or ephrin A3, is known to interact with a variety of Eph receptors, which are a class of receptor tyrosine kinases. These interactions are crucial for cell signaling processes. EFNA3 primarily interacts with EphA receptors, including EPHA1, EPHA2, EPHA3, EPHA4, EPHA5, EPHA7, EPHA10, EPHB1, and EPHB3, as well as other proteins like phospholipase C γ1. These interactions suggest EFNA3's involvement in various signaling pathways that may contribute to the progression of bladder urothelial carcinoma (Wang2023Clinicopathological).

In the auditory system, EFNA3 interacts with EphA4 and EphA7, which are expressed in the cochlea during development. These interactions are essential for the development and function of the auditory system, particularly in maintaining tonotopic precision and auditory processing (Hoshino2021Ephrin‐A3).

EFNA3 also plays a role in cancer metastasis. It is involved in mediating attraction and repulsion signals between cells, facilitating tumor cell entry and exit from blood vessels. This is achieved through its interaction with endothelial cells, where EFNA3 transduces a repulsive signal, aiding in tumor cell extravasation (GómezMaldonado2014EFNA3).
