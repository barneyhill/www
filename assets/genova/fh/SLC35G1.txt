# SLC35G1

## Overview
SLC35G1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member G1, which functions as a transporter protein. This protein is primarily involved in the transport of citrate across the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, acting as a chloride-sensitive citrate/Cl- exchanger. It plays a significant role in the apical-to-basolateral transcellular transport of citrate, crucial for maintaining physiological citrate levels without affecting intracellular accumulation (Mimura2024SLC35G1:). Beyond its role in the intestines, SLC35G1 is also implicated in the transport of nucleotide sugars and is notably expressed in the human brain, suggesting additional functions in neural processes (Wang2021De). The gene's expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and keratinocyte cancers, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (El2023Differential; Liyanage2019Combined; Wang2021De).

## Function
SLC35G1 is a gene that encodes a transporter protein involved in the basolateral membrane transport of citrate in the intestines. This protein is characterized as a highly chloride-sensitive transporter, potentially functioning as a citrate/Cl- exchanger. It is localized to the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells and facilitates the apical-to-basolateral transcellular transport of citrate, without affecting intracellular citrate accumulation. This suggests that SLC35G1 acts as an exporter under physiological conditions (Mimura2024SLC35G1:).

SLC35G1 is highly expressed in the digestive tract, particularly in the upper small intestine, and plays a crucial role in mediating intestinal citrate transport at the basolateral membrane, working in conjunction with NaDC1. Its activity is significantly inhibited by extracellular chloride at physiologically relevant concentrations, making it the first known transporter on the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells to exhibit such sensitivity to chloride ions (Mimura2024SLC35G1:).

In addition to its role in the intestines, SLC35G1 is also involved in transporting nucleotide sugars and is enriched in the human brain, suggesting a potential role in neural function (Wang2021De).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC35G1 gene have been implicated in several conditions. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD) without developmental delay or intellectual disabilities, two mutations, K120fs and A310P, have been identified in unrelated male patients. The K120fs mutation is a frame-shifting variant that leads to premature termination of the SLC35G1 protein, while the A310P mutation is predicted to be damaging. These mutations suggest that loss-of-function variants in SLC35G1 may contribute to ASD, particularly in high-functioning autism (HFA) without developmental delay or intellectual disabilities (Wang2021De).

In epilepsy, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), SLC35G1 is downregulated and targeted by upregulated miRNAs such as miR-15a-5p and miR-195-5p. This downregulation may be linked to the disease mechanism, indicating a potential role in epilepsy-related pathways (El2023Differential).

SLC35G1 has also been associated with keratinocyte cancers (KC), where it was identified as a significant gene in sun-exposed skin, suggesting a potential role in skin cancer development (Liyanage2019Combined). Additionally, SLC35G1 has been highlighted in the context of cannabis dependence, potentially through its involvement in calcium signaling pathways (Sherva2016Genomewide).
