# APEX1

## Overview
The APEX1 gene encodes the apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APE1), a critical enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA lesions. APE1 is a multifunctional enzyme that not only cleaves the phosphodiester backbone at apurinic/apyrimidinic sites but also acts as a redox coactivator for transcription factors, thereby playing a role in gene expression regulation and cellular defense against oxidative stress (Vascotto2009APE1Ref1; Xue2022Knockout). The protein is characterized by a conserved four-layered alpha/beta-sandwich core structure, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Balasubramanian2015Structural). APE1's functions extend beyond the nucleus, as it also contributes to mitochondrial DNA maintenance, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis (Kim2023BackUp). The gene's significance is further highlighted by its involvement in embryonic development, with knockout studies in mice demonstrating embryonic lethality (Xue2022Knockout).

## Structure
The APEX1 protein, also known as apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1, is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the DNA base excision repair pathway. Its primary structure consists of a single polypeptide chain with 318 amino acids, resulting in a molecular weight of approximately 35.5 kDa (Ataya2012Molecular). The secondary structure of APEX1 includes a combination of α-helices and β-sheets, forming a globular α/β-rich protein. Specifically, the camel APEX1 (cAPEX1) has 9 helices and 11 β-sheets, which is similar to the human homolog (Ataya2012Molecular).

The tertiary structure of APEX1 features a conserved four-layered alpha/beta-sandwich core, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Balasubramanian2015Structural). This structure includes a helix-hairpin-helix motif important for DNA binding. The protein contains conserved residues for divalent cation binding and redox activity, with the N-terminal domain regulating AP endonuclease activity and the C-terminal domain being more conserved (Ataya2012Molecular).

APEX1 does not typically form quaternary structures but interacts with other proteins in DNA repair complexes. Common post-translational modifications include acetylation and phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and stability (Balasubramanian2015Structural).

## Function
The APEX1 gene encodes the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), a crucial enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. APE1 is responsible for cleaving the phosphodiester backbone at apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, which are common DNA lesions resulting from oxidative or alkylative damage. This cleavage is essential for creating a suitable substrate for DNA polymerases to fill in the gap with the correct nucleotide, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Kim2023BackUp; Xue2022Knockout).

APE1 also plays a significant role in modulating gene expression by acting as a redox coactivator for various transcription factors, including p53, NF-κB, and AP-1. This redox activity helps maintain these factors in their reduced, active forms, contributing to cellular defenses against oxidative stress (Vascotto2009APE1Ref1; Xue2022Knockout). APE1's activities are divided between two distinct protein domains: the N-terminal region, which is involved in redox activity, and the C-terminal region, which is responsible for enzymatic activity on abasic DNA sites (Vascotto2009APE1Ref1).

In addition to its nuclear functions, APE1 is also active in the mitochondria, where it helps maintain mitochondrial DNA integrity, further contributing to cellular homeostasis (Kim2023BackUp). The essentiality of APE1 is underscored by its role in embryonic development, as its complete knockout in mice results in embryonic lethality (Xue2022Knockout).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APEX1 gene are associated with various cancers, including head and neck cancer (HNC) and breast cancer. In HNC, specific mutations such as 13T > G, Ser129Arg, and Val131Gly have been identified, with APEX1 mRNA expression levels correlating positively with tumor size, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis (Mahjabeen2013Genetic). In breast cancer, several mutations, including Glu101Lys, Ala121Pro, Ser123Trp, and Ser129Arg, have been linked to the disease. These mutations may affect the DNA repair process by inhibiting the redox and repair activity of the APEX1 protein, contributing to breast carcinogenesis (Ali2014Germline).

APEX1 polymorphisms have also been studied in relation to other conditions. For instance, the rs1760944 polymorphism is associated with a reduced risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, particularly in non-smokers (Lu2017Association). In eye diseases like keratoconus, specific APEX1 polymorphisms have been linked to altered DNA repair capacity, potentially influencing disease development (Wojcik2015Polymorphism). These findings underscore the clinical significance of APEX1 in various diseases, highlighting its role in DNA repair and its potential as a marker for cancer susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
APEX1, also known as apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1, is a key enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate DNA repair. APEX1 forms specific interactions with DNA polymerase β (Polβ), as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid analysis and in vitro experiments. These studies show that APEX1 binds to uncleaved AP sites, forming a ternary complex with Polβ and AP-DNA, which enhances the excision activity of Polβ (Bennett1997Interaction).

APE1 also interacts with other BER proteins, such as XRCC1, PCNA, and PARP1, which stimulate its activity. These interactions are influenced by specific amino acid residues on APE1, with substitutions affecting the efficiency of DNA repair (Kladova2020Modulation). Molecular docking models suggest that BER proteins tend to interact with APE1 surfaces near the DNA-binding site, with residues like Arg221 and Arg237 playing significant roles (Kladova2020Modulation).

APE1's interaction with DNA involves recognizing and binding to abasic sites through a hydrophobic pocket, stabilizing the DNA conformation and facilitating repair synthesis (Mol2000DNA-bound). These interactions highlight APEX1's critical role in maintaining DNA integrity.
