This transmembrane cytokine is a bidirectional signal transducer that acts as a ligand for TNFRSF9/4-1BB, which is a costimulatory receptor molecule in T lymphocytes. This cytokine and its receptor are involved in the antigen presentation process and in the generation of cytotoxic T cells. The receptor TNFRSF9/4-1BB is absent from resting T lymphocytes but rapidly expressed upon antigenic stimulation. The ligand encoded by this gene, TNFSF9/4-1BBL, has been shown to reactivate anergic T lymphocytes in addition to promoting T lymphocyte proliferation. This cytokine has also been shown to be required for the optimal CD8 responses in CD8 T cells. This cytokine is expressed in carcinoma cell lines, and is thought to be involved in T cell-tumor cell interaction.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008].", "symbol": "TNFSF9", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1420821"}, "unigene": "Hs.1524", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P41273", "TrEMBL": "A0A0U5J8I0"}}
