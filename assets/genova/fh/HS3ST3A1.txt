# HS3ST3A1

## Overview
HS3ST3A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 3A1, which is a sulfotransferase involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS). This enzyme specifically catalyzes the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues within HS chains, a modification that is crucial for the binding of growth factors and the formation of receptor complexes, such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b) (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified). The activity of HS3ST3A1 is essential for modulating growth factor signaling pathways, impacting cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and tissue regeneration (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified). Dysregulation of HS3ST3A1 expression has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and infectious diseases, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Denys2019The; Atkinson2012Genetic).

## Function
HS3ST3A1 encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a complex polysaccharide involved in various cellular processes. The enzyme specifically catalyzes the 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues in HS chains, a modification essential for the high-affinity binding of growth factors and other proteins. This sulfation is crucial for the formation and stabilization of receptor complexes, such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b (FGFR2b), which is important for cell proliferation and survival (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified).

In healthy human cells, HS3ST3A1 is involved in modulating growth factor signaling pathways, particularly those dependent on FGFR2b. The enzyme's activity enhances the formation of the FGF10/FGFR2b signaling complex, promoting the proliferation and expansion of progenitor cells, such as KIT+ epithelial progenitors in the submandibular gland (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified). HS3ST3A1 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies HS to facilitate these interactions, impacting processes like organogenesis and tissue regeneration (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified).

The enzyme's function is also implicated in the regulation of cellular responses to growth factors, ensuring rapid and specific signaling necessary for development and cellular differentiation (Patel2014Hs3st3Modified).

## Clinical Significance
The HS3ST3A1 gene is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and genetic variations. In cancer, particularly chondrosarcoma, hypermethylation of the HS3ST3A1 gene leads to its silencing, which contributes to tumor cell growth and invasiveness. Re-expression of HS3ST3A1 has been shown to reduce the proliferative and migratory properties of chondrosarcoma cells. Similarly, in breast cancer, HS3ST3A1 is epigenetically repressed in most cell lines except HER2+ types, where its re-expression reduces cell proliferation and tumor growth, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Denys2019The).

In infectious diseases, genetic variations in HS3ST3A1, such as the SNP rs28470223, are associated with susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia, a condition related to malaria. This SNP may alter gene expression, affecting the binding of P. falciparum antigens to host cells and influencing the immune response (Atkinson2012Genetic). Additionally, HS3ST3A1 is linked to increased risk of infections like HSV1 and plays a role in the immune system, particularly in T lymphocyte activation, suggesting its involvement in immune response regulation (Ouidja2022Variability).

## Interactions
HS3ST3A1, a heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase, interacts with heparin and its derivatives, showing a preference for structures containing 2-O sulfated iduronate and either 6-O or N-sulfated glucosamine. The enzyme's interaction with heparin involves specific sulfation patterns and conformational compatibility, as demonstrated by competition assays where the removal of sulfate groups reduced heparin's effectiveness as a competitor (Su2022Analysis). 

The enzyme also interacts with suramin, a known inhibitor of sulfotransferases, which inhibits GST-HS3ST3A1 binding to heparin in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that suramin competes for the sugar acceptor site on the enzyme, supporting its role as a generic sulfotransferase inhibitor (Su2022Analysis).

In the context of cancer, HS3ST3A1 expression is often dysregulated, with hypermethylation leading to its silencing. Re-expression of HS3ST3A1 in certain cancer cell lines has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and tumor growth, indicating that changes in heparan sulfate structure due to HS3ST3A1 activity may affect interactions between growth factors and signaling receptors (Denys2019The).
