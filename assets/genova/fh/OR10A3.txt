# OR10A3

## Overview
OR10A3 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily A member 3, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the sensory perception of smell, functioning by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to odor perception (Lee2018Therapeutic). Beyond its traditional role in olfaction, OR10A3 is expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin and brain, where it participates in various physiological processes. Notably, in human dermal fibroblasts, OR10A3 is activated by suberic acid, promoting collagen synthesis through the cAMP-Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for skin health and repair (Kang2022Activation). The receptor's involvement in tissue regeneration and its transient upregulation during wound healing further underscore its diverse functional roles (Ohshima2024Timecourse). Additionally, OR10A3 has been implicated in several health conditions, including atopic dermatitis and certain cancers, highlighting its potential significance in both sensory and broader physiological contexts (Tamari2017GenomeWide; Hou2023A).

## Structure
The OR10A3 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs. The primary structure of OR10A3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as a receptor. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs, facilitating their integration into the cell membrane.

The tertiary structure of OR10A3 involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to interact with specific ligands, such as suberic acid, which has been shown to activate OR10A3 and promote collagen synthesis in UVB-irradiated dermal fibroblasts via the cAMP-Akt pathway (Kang2022Activation). While the quaternary structure is less common in olfactory receptors, the functional role of OR10A3 in signaling pathways suggests potential interactions with other proteins or receptors.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may occur, influencing the receptor's stability and activity. These modifications are typical in GPCRs and can affect receptor function and signaling efficiency (Kang2022Activation).

## Function
OR10A3 is an olfactory receptor that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, traditionally associated with the detection of odor molecules in the olfactory epithelium. This receptor is involved in the sensory perception of smell by binding specific odorants, which initiates a signal transduction pathway leading to the perception of odors (Lee2018Therapeutic).

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR10A3 has been identified in non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin and brain, suggesting additional physiological functions. In human dermal fibroblasts, OR10A3 is activated by suberic acid, a natural ligand, which promotes collagen synthesis via the cAMP-Akt signaling pathway. This process is crucial for maintaining skin health and structure, particularly in response to UVB-induced damage (Kang2022Activation). The receptor's activation enhances the expression of transcription factors and genes involved in collagen production, indicating its potential role in skin repair and anti-aging treatments (Kang2022Activation).

OR10A3 is also transiently upregulated in the periodontal ligament during wound healing, suggesting a role in tissue regeneration processes (Ohshima2024Timecourse). These findings highlight the diverse functions of OR10A3 beyond olfactory perception, contributing to various cellular and physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
The OR10A3 gene has been implicated in several health conditions through its association with genetic loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), OR10A3 has been identified as a novel susceptibility locus in the Japanese population, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis (Tamari2017GenomeWide). The gene is located at 11p15.4 and is part of a region that may be specific to Japanese individuals, indicating ancestry-specific genetic risk factors for AD (Tamari2017GenomeWide).

In prostate cancer, OR10A3 has been noted for having a differentially methylated CpG site in patients with an unfavorable prognosis, although no significant changes in its expression levels were reported (Kobelyatskaya2020Differentially). This suggests a potential epigenetic role in cancer prognosis.

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), OR10A3 is highly expressed in high-risk groups, correlating with poor prognosis (Hou2023A). This highlights its potential involvement in cancer progression and prognosis.

While OR10A3 is primarily an olfactory receptor, its genetic and epigenetic alterations may have broader implications in immune-related and oncological conditions.

## Interactions
The olfactory receptor OR10A3, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, participates in several interactions that facilitate its function. OR10A3 is activated by suberic acid, which leads to the activation of the cAMP-Akt signaling pathway, crucial for collagen synthesis in UVB-irradiated dermal fibroblasts (Kang2022Activation). This receptor interacts with accessory proteins such as RTP1S, Ric8B, and Golf, which assist in its translocation to the cell membrane, highlighting the importance of protein-protein interactions in its functional expression (Kang2022Activation).

The activation of OR10A3 by suberic acid results in increased intracellular cAMP levels, which are essential for the downstream signaling events that lead to collagen production. This process involves the phosphorylation of Akt, a key component of the PI3K pathway, and the subsequent expression of SP1, a transcription factor, and its target gene COL1A1, which is involved in collagen synthesis (Kang2022Activation). The use of siRNA to knock down OR10A3 expression has shown that these effects are significantly reduced, indicating that OR10A3 is necessary for these interactions and signaling events (Kang2022Activation).
