# EPG5

## Overview
The EPG5 gene encodes the ectopic P-granules 5 autophagy tethering factor, a pivotal protein in the autophagy pathway. This protein is primarily involved in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes or late endosomes, a critical step for the degradation of cytoplasmic material and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. EPG5 functions as a tethering factor, interacting with the GABARAP subfamily of ATG8 proteins and acting as a Rab7 effector to mediate the specificity of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. The protein's structure, characterized by an elongated 'shepherd's staff' shape, facilitates its role in autophagic processes. Mutations in the EPG5 gene are linked to Vici syndrome, a severe multisystem disorder, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Wang2016The; Nam2021Insights; Hori2017Defects).

## Structure
The EPG5 protein is a large autophagy tethering factor composed of 2579 amino acid residues, with a molecular mass of approximately 290 kDa. It adopts an elongated architecture, reminiscent of tethering factors in other membrane trafficking pathways, and is characterized by an extended 'shepherd's staff' shape with a rigid round 'hook' and a more flexible 'shaft' (Nam2021Insights). The protein is predicted to be predominantly helical, as suggested by secondary structure prediction algorithms (Nam2021Insights).

EPG5 contains tandem LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs, which are crucial for its interaction with the GABARAP subfamily of ATG8 proteins. These motifs are located near the junction between the hook and the shaft, facilitating the binding of EPG5 to autophagosomes decorated with GABARAP (Nam2021Insights). The interaction with GABARAP involves a 'two-factor authentication' model, where LIR1 initially binds to a noncanonical site, triggering a conformational change that makes LIR2 accessible to the canonical site (Nam2021Insights).

The protein's structure was studied using negative stain single-particle electron microscopy, revealing that EPG5 is monomeric and has a distinct curvature at one end (Nam2021Insights). The Q336R mutation associated with Vici syndrome does not affect the overall architecture, stability, or GABARAP-binding ability of EPG5 (Nam2021Insights).

## Function
The EPG5 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the autophagy process, specifically in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes or late endosomes, which is essential for the degradation of cytoplasmic material and cellular homeostasis (Wang2016The; Nam2021Insights). EPG5 acts as a tethering factor, ensuring the specificity of autophagosome-lysosome fusion by binding to members of the GABARAP subfamily of human ATG8 proteins through tandem LIR motifs (Nam2021Insights). This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of EPG5 to mitochondria during PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy (Nam2021Insights).

EPG5 is also identified as a Rab7 effector, mediating the fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes by interacting with Rab7 and VAMP7/8 on late endosomes/lysosomes, and with LC3/LGG-1 and the STX17-SNAP29 Qabc complex on autophagosomes (Wang2016The). It facilitates the assembly of the STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 trans-SNARE complex, which is crucial for membrane fusion (Wang2016The; Nam2021Insights). In healthy cells, EPG5 ensures the specific fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes, preventing non-specific fusion with other endocytic vesicles (Wang2016The). This function is vital for maintaining the efficiency and specificity of autophagic and endocytic processes, which are essential for cellular health and function (Wang2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EPG5 gene are primarily associated with Vici syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder. Vici syndrome is characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, cataracts, cardiomyopathy, combined immunodeficiency, developmental delay, and hypopigmentation. These clinical features are linked to defects in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, a critical process in autophagy, due to mutations in EPG5 (Cullup2012Recessive; Hori2017Defects). The mutations often result in truncations or profound dysfunction of the EPG5 protein, leading to non-functional proteins and null alleles (Hori2017Defects).

Vici syndrome is typically fatal in infancy or early childhood, with severe infections and progressive heart failure being common causes of mortality (EbrahimiFakhari2015Congenital). Neurological manifestations include brain malformations, intellectual disability, motor impairment, and seizures, with a neurodegenerative component suggested by the loss of previously acquired skills (EbrahimiFakhari2015Congenital). The EPG5 gene mutations are spread across the gene without a clear mutational hotspot, indicating a broad spectrum of potential genetic alterations leading to the disorder (EbrahimiFakhari2015Congenital). Additionally, EPG5-related disorders may overlap with other conditions involving defective autophagy and intracellular trafficking (Dafsari2024Mutations).

## Interactions
EPG5 is a crucial protein in the autophagy pathway, interacting with several key proteins to facilitate the fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes and lysosomes. EPG5 acts as a Rab7 effector, directly binding to the active form of Rab7, which is essential for its recruitment to late endosomes/lysosomes. This interaction is specific, as EPG5 does not bind to Rab5 or Rab11, which are associated with early and sorting endosomes (Wang2016The).

EPG5 also interacts with SNARE proteins, including VAMP7 and VAMP8, and facilitates the assembly of the STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 trans-SNARE complex, which is critical for autophagosome maturation. This interaction is crucial for the tethering and fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes (Wang2016The).

In addition, EPG5 binds to the GABARAP subfamily of ATG8 proteins through tandem LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs. This interaction is necessary for EPG5's recruitment to mitochondria during PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy and is mediated by specific hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Nam2021Insights). These interactions highlight EPG5's role in maintaining the specificity and efficiency of autophagic processes.
