# PRELID2

## Overview
PRELID2 is a gene that encodes the protein PRELI domain containing 2, which is primarily involved in mitochondrial lipid transport and metabolism. This protein is a member of the PRELI domain family and plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production by facilitating the transfer of phosphatidic acid between mitochondrial membranes. The PRELI domain containing 2 protein is part of the PRELI/MSF1 complex, which is essential for cellular lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial biogenesis. Its activity is crucial for the regulation of cardiolipin metabolism, a key component for mitochondrial membrane integrity and function. The protein's interactions, particularly with TRIAP1, enhance its stability and are vital for its role in mitochondrial lipid transport. Alterations in PRELID2 expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Miliara2019Structural; Xiong2023Elevated; Gao2009Conserved).

## Function
PRELID2 (PRELI domain containing 2) is involved in mitochondrial lipid transport and metabolism, playing a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production. The protein is part of the PRELI/MSF1 complex, which facilitates the transfer of phosphatidic acid between mitochondrial membranes. This process is essential for cellular lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial biogenesis, impacting overall cellular health and energy balance (Miliara2019Structural).

In healthy human cells, PRELID2 is associated with mitochondrial processes, such as the regulation of cardiolipin metabolism, which is vital for mitochondrial membrane integrity and function (Gao2009Conserved). The protein's activity in the mitochondria suggests its involvement in intra-mitochondrial sorting and respiratory growth, which are critical for efficient cellular respiration and energy production (Gao2009Conserved).

PRELID2's role in lipid transfer is supported by its structural similarities with other PRELI domain family members, which are known to mediate the specific transfer of phospholipids like phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylserine across the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Miliara2019Structural). This function is crucial for maintaining the lipid composition of mitochondrial membranes, thereby supporting mitochondrial dynamics and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PRELID2 gene have been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Elevated PRELID2 expression is associated with the activation of the FBXL6/p-ERK/p-mTOR pathway, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. High levels of PRELID2 are linked to advanced tumor stages, larger tumor sizes, metastasis, vascular thrombosis, and recurrence in HCC patients. This overexpression is also correlated with shorter overall survival, making PRELID2 an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in HCC (Xiong2023Elevated).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), circPRELID2, a circular RNA derived from PRELID2, is upregulated and promotes cancer progression through the miR-22-3p/ETV1 axis. This upregulation is associated with tumor lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage. Silencing circPRELID2 reduces RCC cell proliferation, motility, and invasion, suggesting its role in RCC malignancy (Lin2024CircPRELID2).

Additionally, a de novo deletion involving PRELID2 has been identified in a child with psychomotor developmental delay, indicating a potential link between PRELID2 alterations and developmental disorders (Falcone2022Identification).

## Interactions
PRELID2 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with TRIAP1, which enhances the stability of the PRELID2 protein. This interaction was demonstrated through a CHX pulse-chase assay and Co-IP assay, showing that TRIAP1 binds to PRELID2, thereby increasing its half-life (Xiong2023Elevated). The interaction between PRELID2 and TRIAP1 is essential for maintaining mitochondrial lipid transport and function, as TRIAP1 facilitates the transfer of phospholipids across mitochondrial membranes (Tatsuta2017Intramitochondrial).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PRELID2 is a downstream effector in the MEK/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway. Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this pathway are not detailed, PRELID2's role in promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation suggests it may interact with components of the signaling cascade to influence cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Xiong2023Elevated). The regulatory relationship between PRELID2 and the mTOR pathway is further supported by the observation that mTOR inhibitors decrease the mRNA levels of TRIAP1 and PRELID2, indicating a complex interaction network (Xiong2023Elevated).
