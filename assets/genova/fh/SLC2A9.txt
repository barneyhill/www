# SLC2A9

## Overview
The SLC2A9 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 9 (GLUT9), which is a member of the glucose transporter family and functions primarily as a urate transporter. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is integral to the regulation of serum urate levels in humans. GLUT9 is expressed predominantly in the kidneys, liver, and intestine, where it facilitates the transport of urate, a critical process for maintaining uric acid balance in the body (Kimura2014Expression; Ruiz2018Human). The protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane segments and exists in two splice variant isoforms, GLUT9a and GLUT9b, which differ in their cellular localization and function (Clémençon2014Expression; Cheeseman2015Structure). Mutations in the SLC2A9 gene can lead to disorders such as renal hypouricemia type 2 and are associated with conditions like hyperuricemia and gout, highlighting its clinical significance in uric acid metabolism (Ruiz2018Human; Caulfield2008SLC2A9).

## Structure
The SLC2A9 gene encodes the GLUT9 protein, a member of the glucose transporter family, which is primarily involved in urate transport. The protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane segments, typical of the major facilitator superfamily, and includes a long C-terminal domain that is unfolded (Clémençon2014Expression). GLUT9 exists in two splice variant isoforms: GLUT9a and GLUT9b. GLUT9a is 540 amino acids long and is targeted to the basolateral membranes in the liver and kidney, while GLUT9b, a truncated form, is found in the renal apical membrane, particularly in the distal convoluted tubule (Mueckler2013The; Cheeseman2015Structure).

The protein's structure has been modeled using homology-based approaches, with the bacterial homologue XylE serving as a template. This model predicts a double six-helical bundle arrangement and identifies potential urate binding sites within the transport cavity (Cheeseman2015Structure). The protein can exist in monomeric and multimeric forms, including potential dimeric or tetrameric assemblies, which may influence its transport function (Clémençon2014Expression). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation have been confirmed, indicating proper folding and surface localization (Clémençon2014Expression).

## Function
The SLC2A9 gene encodes the GLUT9 protein, a voltage-driven urate transporter that plays a crucial role in regulating serum urate levels in humans. This protein is primarily expressed in the kidneys, liver, and intestine, where it facilitates the transport of urate, a key process in maintaining uric acid balance in the body (Kimura2014Expression; Ruiz2018Human). In the kidneys, SLC2A9 exists in two isoforms: SLC2A9-L and SLC2A9-S. SLC2A9-L is located on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells and is involved in urate reabsorption, allowing urate to exit tubular cells into the interstitial space (Kimura2014Expression; Windpessl2016A). SLC2A9-S is found on the apical side of the collecting duct, although its precise role is less clear (Kimura2014Expression).

Mutations in SLC2A9 can lead to altered urate transport capacity, affecting serum urate levels and potentially resulting in conditions such as familial hypouricemia and renal hypouricemia type 2 (Ruiz2018Human; Pavelcova2020Evaluation). The gene's function in urate transport makes it a potential target for treating hyperuricemia and related complications like gout (Ruiz2018Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC2A9 gene, which encodes the glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9), are associated with several disorders related to uric acid metabolism. One significant condition linked to SLC2A9 mutations is renal hypouricemia type 2 (RHUC2), characterized by low serum uric acid levels, high fractional excretion of uric acid, and a predisposition to exercise-induced acute renal failure (EIARF) (Ruiz2018Human; Jeannin2014Recurrent). Specific mutations such as p.Gly216Arg and p.Arg380Trp have been identified in patients with severe EIARF, indicating a severe impairment of GLUT9 function (Jeannin2014Recurrent).

In addition to hypouricemia, SLC2A9 variants are implicated in hyperuricemia and gout. These conditions arise from increased serum urate levels due to altered urate transport, which can lead to gout, characterized by uric acid crystallization in the joints (Caulfield2008SLC2A9). The gene's role in urate transport is supported by genome-wide association studies, which have linked SLC2A9 polymorphisms to increased serum uric acid levels in various populations (Caulfield2008SLC2A9; Bannasch2008Mutations).

Overall, SLC2A9 mutations and variants significantly impact uric acid homeostasis, contributing to conditions like RHUC2, hyperuricemia, and gout.
