# WARS1

## Overview
The WARS1 gene encodes the enzyme tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 1, which is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family. This enzyme plays a critical role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of tryptophan to its corresponding tRNA, ensuring the accurate translation of mRNA into proteins (Nguyen2020TryptophanyltRNA; Izadi2024TryptophanyltRNA). Beyond its fundamental role in translation, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 is involved in various cellular processes, including immune response modulation and genomic stability maintenance. It acts as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptors, thereby participating in the activation of inflammatory pathways (Nguyen2020TryptophanyltRNA). Additionally, the enzyme is implicated in tryptophan metabolism, influencing processes such as angiogenesis and inflammation, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Izadi2024TryptophanyltRNA). The diverse functions of WARS1 highlight its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer and immune-related disorders.

## Structure
The WARS1 protein, also known as tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is involved in the attachment of tryptophan to its corresponding tRNA. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including an anticodon recognition domain, a Rossmann fold catalytic domain, an eukaryote-specific extension (ESE), and a WHEP domain (Gioelli2022Neuropilin). The secondary structure of WARS1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function.

The tertiary structure of WARS1 forms a compact, three-dimensional shape, often featuring a Rossmann fold, which is crucial for its catalytic activity. The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, which is common among aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can occur, potentially affecting the protein's function and interactions (Nguyen2020TryptophanyltRNA).

WARS1 also has splice variant isoforms, such as mini-WARS, which lacks exon II and exhibits distinct functional properties, including the inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis (Sung2022Functional). These isoforms can alter the protein's function or localization, contributing to its diverse roles in cellular processes.

## Function
The WARS1 gene encodes tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 1, an enzyme crucial for protein synthesis. It catalyzes the ligation of tryptophan to its corresponding tRNA, a process essential for accurate mRNA translation and protein production in the cytoplasm of healthy human cells (Nguyen2020TryptophanyltRNA; Izadi2024TryptophanyltRNA). Beyond its canonical role in protein synthesis, WARS1 is involved in maintaining genomic integrity by preventing DNA damage and ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Izadi2024TryptophanyltRNA).

WARS1 also plays a significant role in the immune system. It acts as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and TLR4, which are part of the innate immune system. This interaction leads to the activation of inflammatory responses, including the production of cytokines and chemokines, which are crucial for immune response activation (Nguyen2020TryptophanyltRNA). The enzyme is released from monocytes upon pathogen recognition, enhancing the body's defense mechanisms (Nguyen2020TryptophanyltRNA).

In addition to its roles in protein synthesis and immune response, WARS1 is involved in tryptophan metabolism, influencing processes like inflammation and angiogenesis, which are vital for cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Izadi2024TryptophanyltRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the WARS1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and intellectual disabilities. In cancer, WARS1 is associated with skin cutaneous melanoma, cervical squamous carcinoma, and colorectal cancer. High mRNA levels of WARS1 correlate with a better prognosis in skin cutaneous melanoma patients, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Izadi2023TryptophanyltRNA; Izadi2024TryptophanyltRNA). In uveal melanoma, increased WARS1 expression is linked to tumor metastasis and poor prognosis, indicating its role in cancer progression (Yang2020TryptophanyltRNA).

WARS1 also plays a role in genomic stability. Depletion of WARS1 in Caenorhabditis elegans leads to genomic instability, cell cycle arrest, and DNA damage checkpoint activation, suggesting similar mechanisms might occur in humans (Izadi2023TryptophanyltRNA; Izadi2024TryptophanyltRNA). This instability is associated with increased tryptophan catabolites, which are toxic and contribute to genomic instability (Izadi2024TryptophanyltRNA).

In the context of immune responses, WARS1 acts as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptors, activating innate immune responses and contributing to cytokine storms in sepsis, making it a potential therapeutic target (Nguyen2020TryptophanyltRNA).

## Interactions
Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (WARS1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence immune responses and cellular processes. WARS1 acts as an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and TLR4, leading to the activation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1. This interaction is crucial for amplifying pro-inflammatory processes and involves downstream phosphorylation of DAP12, Syk, and AKT, which are essential for cytokine and chemokine production (Nguyen2020TryptophanyltRNA).

WARS1 also interacts with Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and its inhibitory ligand mini-WARS, affecting VE-cadherin turnover and vascular permeability. This interaction involves various forms of WARS, including full-length, mini, and T2-WARS, and is analyzed through pull-down assays and western blotting (Gioelli2022Neuropilin).

In cancer-related pathways, WARS1 is involved in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), which is linked to DNA repair and apoptosis. This interaction is influenced by tryptophan and can be disrupted by a tryptophan analog, Trp-SA, highlighting the importance of tryptophan binding to WARS1 for its function (Sung2022Functional).
