# SSU72L3

## Overview
SSU72L3 is a gene that encodes the protein SSU72 like 3, which is part of the phosphatase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription and RNA processing. SSU72 like 3 shares structural similarities with other phosphatases, which are enzymes that remove phosphate groups from proteins, thereby modulating their function and activity. The precise biological roles of SSU72 like 3 are still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant in cellular signaling and development (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and regulation of SSU72L3 could provide insights into its potential implications in health and disease.
