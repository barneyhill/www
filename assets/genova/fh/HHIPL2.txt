# HHIPL2

## Overview
HHIPL2, or Hedgehog Interacting Protein-Like 2, is a gene that encodes the HHIP-like 2 protein, which is part of the hedgehog signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for various developmental processes and cellular functions. The HHIP-like 2 protein is categorized as a regulatory protein, playing a role in modulating the activity of hedgehog proteins, which are involved in cell growth, differentiation, and tissue patterning. The gene's expression and the protein's function are significant in understanding developmental biology and potential implications in disease states, particularly those related to aberrant hedgehog signaling. Research into HHIPL2 continues to elucidate its specific roles and interactions within cellular pathways, contributing to a broader understanding of its biological significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
