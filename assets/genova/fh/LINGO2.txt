# LINGO2

## Overview
LINGO2 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat and Ig domain containing 2, which is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the central nervous system. The protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its role in synaptic organization and neuronal development (Belle2019TFF3; Ji2018TFF3). LINGO2 is part of a family of proteins that includes other members such as LINGO1, LINGO3, and LINGO4, and it is known to form complexes with these proteins, influencing signaling pathways related to neuronal growth and synaptic function (Guillemain2020LINGO). The gene has been implicated in various neurological and pathological conditions, including essential tremors, Parkinson's disease, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Jo2019Novel; Siokas2020Genetic).

## Structure
LINGO2 is a 606 amino acid protein characterized by a large extracellular portion, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Belle2019TFF3; Ji2018TFF3). It belongs to the family of leucine-rich repeat and IgG-like domain proteins, which includes LRIG1 and LRIG5 (Ji2018TFF3). The extracellular region of LINGO2 contains leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Belle2019TFF3; Ji2018TFF3). LRRs typically form a horseshoe-shaped structure, contributing to the protein's ability to interact with other molecules, while the Ig domain provides structural stability.

LINGO2 is known to form complexes with other proteins, such as EGFR, and can interact with TFF3, which disrupts its interaction with EGFR, leading to increased EGFR activity (Belle2019TFF3; Ji2018TFF3). The protein can also form heterodimers with other LINGO family members, such as LINGO-1, LINGO-3, and LINGO-4, indicating its involvement in complex signaling pathways (Guillemain2020LINGO). The protein's molecular weight is approximately 68 kDa (Jo2019Novel).

## Function
LINGO2 (leucine rich repeat and Ig domain containing 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in the central nervous system, particularly in the regulation of synaptic function and neuronal development. It is involved in organizing excitatory synapses, as evidenced by its ability to increase the expression of excitatory presynaptic markers such as vGlut1 in neurons. This suggests that LINGO2 selectively induces the formation of excitatory presynapses, contributing to synaptic development and function (Tomita2023Soluble).

In addition to its role in synapse organization, LINGO2 is implicated in the regulation of neuronal growth and cell survival. It is a transmembrane protein and a homolog of LINGO1, which is known to negatively regulate these processes. LINGO2's involvement in synaptic function is further highlighted by its upregulation in neurons with the APP V717I mutation, a model for familial Alzheimer's disease, where it acts as a disease signaling mediator (Qu2024Xenografted).

LINGO2 is also associated with the modulation of pathways related to neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, axon guidance, and synaptic function, indicating its broad influence on neuronal health and signaling (Qu2024Xenografted).

## Clinical Significance
The LINGO2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. Mutations in LINGO2, along with LINGO1, have been associated with essential tremors and Parkinson's disease, suggesting a role in movement disorders (Jo2019Novel; Siokas2020Genetic). In cancer research, LINGO2 has been identified as a recurrent homozygous deleted gene in malignant mesothelioma, often co-deleted with the tumor suppressor CDKN2A, indicating its potential involvement in cancer pathogenesis (Jo2019Novel).

In gastric cancer, LINGO2 is highlighted as a novel marker related to cancer stem cells, influencing cell motility, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis. High LINGO2 expression is associated with advanced cancer stages and decreased overall survival, suggesting its role in cancer progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Jo2019Novel). Additionally, genetic variants in LINGO2, such as the rs824248 A > T variant, have been linked to an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, particularly in obese women, indicating its role as a susceptibility marker for this condition (Su2018A).

## Interactions
LINGO2, a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It forms complexes with other LINGO family members, such as LINGO-1, LINGO-3, and LINGO-4, through homodimerization and heterodimerization. These interactions have been confirmed using coimmunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) analysis in HEK-293 cells, as well as in mouse brain tissues (Guillemain2020LINGO).

LINGO2 also interacts with the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), where it acts as an inhibitor under normal conditions. This interaction is disrupted by Trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), which binds to LINGO2, leading to the de-repression of EGFR and subsequent activation of EGFR signaling pathways. This mechanism is significant in the context of colitis and gastrointestinal health, as it influences disease outcomes by modulating EGFR activity (Belle2019TFF3; Ji2018TFF3).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, LINGO2 is implicated as a potential disease signaling mediator. It is upregulated in certain conditions and may influence synaptic function and neuronal health, although the exact nature of its interactions in this context requires further investigation (Qu2024Xenografted).
