# JPH1

## Overview
JPH1 is a gene that encodes the protein junctophilin 1, which is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle tissue. Junctophilin 1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of junctional membrane complexes (JMCs), which are essential for the process of excitation-contraction coupling in muscle cells. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including MORN motifs and a transmembrane domain, which facilitate its interaction with key proteins such as L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors. These interactions are vital for efficient calcium signaling and muscle contraction. Mutations in the JPH1 gene have been linked to congenital myopathy, underscoring the gene's importance in muscle function and development (Landstrom2014The; Johari2024Lossoffunction; Piggott2021Junctophilins:).

## Structure
Junctophilin 1 (JPH1) is a protein primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, with a molecular weight of approximately 90 kDa, although some studies report a predicted mass of 72 kDa based on its amino acid sequence (Landstrom2014The; Phimister2007Conformationdependent). The protein consists of 658 amino acids and includes several distinct structural domains. 

The N-terminal region of JPH1 contains eight MORN (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus) motifs, which are 14 amino acid sequences crucial for targeting the protein to the plasma membrane (Perni2022The; Piggott2021Junctophilins:). These motifs are highly conserved across species and are thought to bind to the internal leaflet of the plasma membrane, potentially interacting with phosphatidylinositol phosphate species (Perni2022The).

Following the MORN motifs is an α-helical domain, approximately 70 amino acids in length, which acts as a flexible linker, allowing JPH1 to span the 10-12 nm junctional membrane complexes (Piggott2021Junctophilins:). The C-terminal region contains a hydrophobic transmembrane domain that anchors JPH1 in the endoplasmic reticulum or sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, facilitating its role in forming and stabilizing triad junctions (Perni2022The; Piggott2021Junctophilins:).

JPH1 also interacts with the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) through reactive thiol groups, which are sensitive to oxidative conditions, indicating a role in redox-sensing and protein-protein interactions (Landstrom2014The; Phimister2007Conformationdependent). The protein's structure is essential for maintaining the ultrastructural geometry of the skeletal muscle triad, crucial for muscle function (Landstrom2014The).

## Function
Junctophilin 1 (JPH1) is a critical protein in skeletal muscle cells, where it plays a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity of triad junctions. These junctions are essential for excitation-contraction coupling, a process crucial for muscle contraction. JPH1 facilitates the coupling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the plasma membrane (PM) by forming junctional membrane complexes (JMCs) (Landstrom2014The; Piggott2021Junctophilins:). 

JPH1 interacts with key proteins such as L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), ensuring efficient calcium release from the SR upon membrane depolarization. This interaction is essential for calcium signaling and muscle contraction (Landstrom2014The; Piggott2021Junctophilins:). JPH1 also supports store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which replenishes calcium stores in the SR, maintaining calcium homeostasis (Piggott2021Junctophilins:; Hirata2006Uncoupling).

In the absence of JPH1, mice exhibit poor triad formation and impaired excitation-contraction coupling, leading to early postnatal death due to muscle dysfunction (Landstrom2014The; Takeshima2015Ca2+). This highlights JPH1's essential role in muscle development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JPH1 gene are associated with congenital myopathy, a condition characterized by muscle weakness, particularly affecting facial and ocular muscles. This myopathy is linked to homozygous loss-of-function variants in JPH1, which disrupt the formation and maintenance of skeletal muscle triads, essential for proper calcium signaling and muscle contraction. Patients with these mutations often present with symptoms such as facial weakness, bilateral ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and generalized muscle weakness. Additional clinical features may include nasal voice, dysphagia, myalgia, exercise intolerance, and skeletal deformities like kyphoscoliosis, lordosis, and scoliosis, though cardiac involvement and intellectual impairment are typically absent (Johari2024Lossoffunction).

In mice, the absence of JPH1 leads to early mortality due to defective suckling, attributed to pharyngeal muscle and diaphragmatic dysfunction. This is linked to impaired calcium signaling and reduced contractile force, highlighting the critical role of JPH1 in muscle function (Landstrom2014The).

In conditions like Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility (MHS), elevated cytosolic calcium levels lead to the cleavage of JPH1, resulting in a fragment that may enter the nucleus and influence gene transcription. This process is associated with glucose dysregulation, hyperglycemia, and diabetes, suggesting a broader impact of JPH1 dysfunction on metabolic pathways (Tammineni2022Muscle).

## Interactions
Junctophilin 1 (JPH1) is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in muscle function. JPH1 interacts directly with the sarcolemmal L-type calcium channel (LTCC) and the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). These interactions are essential for the structural integrity and function of the triad junctions in skeletal muscle cells, which are crucial for efficient excitation-contraction coupling (Landstrom2014The). The binding of JPH1 to RyR1 is mediated by reactive thiol groups, which are sensitive to oxidative conditions and can influence RyR1 channel gating (Landstrom2014The).

JPH1 also plays a role in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in skeletal muscle, where it may facilitate interactions between STIM1 and Orai1 at ER-PM contacts. Knockdown of JPH1 reduces SOCE, indicating its involvement in this process (Piggott2021Junctophilins:). Additionally, JPH1 interacts with caveolin type 3 (Cav3), contributing to the maintenance of calcium homeostasis and muscle function (Landstrom2014The).

These interactions highlight the importance of JPH1 in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of muscle cells, particularly through its role in calcium signaling pathways.
