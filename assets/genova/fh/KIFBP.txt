# KIFBP

## Overview
KIFBP, or kinesin family binding protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport. The protein, also referred to as kinesin family binding protein, is characterized by its interaction with various kinesin motor proteins, such as KIF1A and KIF15, through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These interactions are crucial for modulating neuronal cargo transport and maintaining microtubule stability, which are essential for proper neuronal function and development (Kevenaar2016KinesinBinding; Atherton2020The). KIFBP is expressed in multiple human tissues, and mutations in this gene are linked to Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome, a disorder marked by intellectual disability and other developmental anomalies (MacKenzie2020Goldberg–Shprintzen). The protein's role in cellular processes such as cytokinesis and mitochondrial distribution underscores its importance in maintaining cellular function and health (Pallavicini2021Goldberg–Shprintzen; Wozniak2005The).

## Structure
The KIFBP gene encodes a protein that is 621 amino acids long and contains two tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (MacKenzie2020Goldberg–Shprintzen; Drévillon2013KBP–cytoskeleton). The protein is characterized by a right-handed alpha-solenoid structure, composed of nine pairs of anti-parallel alpha-helices, divided into N-terminal and C-terminal subdomains (Atherton2020The). The N-terminal subdomain contains four TPR motifs, contributing to the protein's alpha-helical pairs (Atherton2020The).

KIFBP interacts with kinesin motor domains, such as KIF1A and KIF15, by binding to their tubulin-binding subdomains, which inhibits their microtubule attachment and cellular function (Atherton2020The). This interaction involves the concave face of the TPR-containing alpha-solenoids, which serves as a recognition platform for specific peptide motifs (Atherton2020The). The protein's interaction with kinesins is regulated by phosphorylation, which can enhance binding to certain kinesins (Kevenaar2016KinesinBinding).

KIFBP is expressed in various human tissues, and mutations in this gene are linked to Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (Atherton2020The). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its role in regulating microtubule dynamics and cargo trafficking within cells (MacKenzie2020Goldberg–Shprintzen).

## Function
KIFBP, also known as kinesin family binding protein, plays a critical role in regulating kinesin motor activity and microtubule dynamics in healthy human cells. It binds to the motor domain of specific kinesin proteins, such as KIF1A, KIF1B, and KIF1C, inhibiting their motility by preventing their binding to microtubules. This regulation is essential for modulating neuronal cargo transport and maintaining microtubule dynamics, which are crucial for proper neuronal function and development (Kevenaar2016KinesinBinding).

KIFBP is also involved in the intracellular localization and distribution of mitochondria. It interacts with the kinesin-like protein KIF1Bα, enhancing its motility and ensuring proper mitochondrial distribution within cells. This interaction is vital for maintaining cellular function and health, as deregulation can lead to mitochondrial aggregation (Wozniak2005The).

In addition to its role in microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial distribution, KIFBP is implicated in cytokinesis. It interacts with CITK (Citron Kinase) and is crucial for the stability of midbody microtubules during cell division, ensuring successful cytokinesis (Pallavicini2021Goldberg–Shprintzen). These functions highlight KIFBP's importance in cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and neuronal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KIFBP gene, also known as kinesin family binding protein, are associated with Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features, and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) (MacKenzie2020Goldberg–Shprintzen; Drévillon2013KBP–cytoskeleton). The phenotypic range of GOSHS is wide, with some patients also exhibiting axonal neuropathy, congenital heart defects, and central nervous system abnormalities such as polymicrogyria (MacKenzie2020Goldberg–Shprintzen; Dafsari2015Goldberg–Shprintzen).

Most mutations in GOSHS patients lead to a loss of function of KIFBP, often through nonsense-mediated mRNA degradation, resulting in reduced or absent protein expression (MacKenzie2020Goldberg–Shprintzen; Drévillon2013KBP–cytoskeleton). These mutations disrupt normal cellular transport processes, affecting microtubule dynamics and neuronal differentiation, which are crucial for proper neural development (Alves2010KBP). The variability in the presence of HSCR among GOSHS patients suggests that a threshold expression of KIFBP may modulate the phenotypic variability of the disease (MacKenzie2020Goldberg–Shprintzen). Inactivation of Kifbp in animal models has been shown to result in nervous system defects, further supporting its critical role in neural development (Hirst2017Kif1bp).

## Interactions
KIFBP, also known as kinesin family binding protein, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for cellular processes. It interacts with several kinesin motor proteins, including KIF1A, KIF1C, KIF3A, KIF13B, KIF14, KIF15, and KIF18A, by binding to their motor domains. This interaction modulates neuronal cargo transport and microtubule dynamics, which are essential for neural development and mitotic processes (Chang2019Multiple; Malaby2019Kinesinbinding).

KIFBP also interacts with Citron Kinase (CITK), a protein involved in cytokinesis. This interaction is significant for proper chromosome alignment and kinetochore fiber assembly during cell division. Knockdown of KIFBP results in cytokinesis failure, leading to an increase in binucleated cells, a phenotype similar to CITK loss of function (Pallavicini2021Goldberg–Shprintzen).

In mitotic cells, KIFBP regulates the activity of kinesins KIF18A and KIF15 by inhibiting their motor functions, which is crucial for maintaining proper spindle function and accurate chromosome segregation. Overexpression of KIFBP disrupts chromosome movement and alignment, similar to the effects observed in cells deficient in KIF18A and KIF15 (Malaby2019Kinesinbinding).
