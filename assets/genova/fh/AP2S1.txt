# AP2S1

## Overview
The AP2S1 gene encodes the adaptor-related protein complex 2 subunit sigma 1 (AP2σ1), a critical component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein, playing a pivotal role in the internalization of plasma membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), by recognizing specific sorting signals on cargo proteins. The AP2σ1 subunit is essential for the proper functioning of the AP-2 complex, which is a heterotetramer composed of alpha, beta, mu, and sigma subunits. Mutations in AP2S1, particularly at the Arg15 residue, have been linked to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 (FHH3), a condition characterized by disrupted calcium homeostasis due to impaired calcium-sensing receptor signaling (Nesbit2012Mutations; Hannan2021Ap2s1). The evolutionary conservation of AP2σ1 underscores its importance in cellular processes and systemic calcium regulation (Hannan2021Ap2s1).

## Structure
The AP2S1 gene encodes the sigma 1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The primary structure of the AP2S1 protein consists of 142 amino acids (Gorvin2018Largescale). Its secondary structure includes five α-helices and a cluster of five β-strands, forming a compact domain that interacts with other subunits of the AP2 complex (Gorvin2018Largescale). The tertiary structure is characterized by the arrangement of these helices and strands, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Gorvin2018Largescale).

In terms of quaternary structure, the AP2σ subunit forms a heterodimer with the AP2α subunit, which is part of the larger AP2 heterotetramer complex. This complex is crucial for binding to cargo proteins via dileucine motifs (Gorvin2018Largescale). The AP2 complex includes other subunits such as AP2α, AP2β, and AP2μ, which together facilitate clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Collins2002Molecular).

Mutations in AP2S1, particularly at the Arg15 residue, can disrupt its function, affecting calcium-sensing receptor signaling and contributing to conditions like familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 (FHH3) (Nesbit2012Mutations). The protein is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its structural and functional importance (Hannan2021Ap2s1).

## Function
The AP2S1 gene encodes the sigma 1 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), which is essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. This complex is a heterotetramer composed of alpha, beta, mu, and sigma subunits, and it plays a critical role in the internalization of plasma membrane constituents, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Nesbit2012Mutations). The AP-2 complex facilitates the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles by recognizing and binding to specific sorting signals on cargo proteins, including tyrosine-based and dileucine-based motifs (Gorvin2018Largescale).

In healthy cells, AP2S1 is involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis by mediating the endocytosis and recycling of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a GPCR that detects changes in extracellular calcium levels. This process is crucial for maintaining calcium balance by influencing parathyroid hormone secretion and renal calcium reabsorption (Nesbit2012Mutations). The AP2σ subunit, encoded by AP2S1, is specifically responsible for recognizing dileucine motifs on cargo proteins, facilitating their incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles (Gorvin2018Largescale). This function is vital for proper receptor signaling and cellular uptake processes, impacting systemic calcium homeostasis (Gorvin2018Largescale).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP2S1 gene are associated with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 (FHH3), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by elevated serum calcium levels, low urinary calcium excretion, and normal or mildly elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (Gorvin2017N‐ethyl‐N‐nitrosourea–Induced; Hannan2015Adaptor). FHH3 is primarily caused by missense mutations at the Arg15 residue of the AP2σ2 subunit, such as Arg15Cys, Arg15His, and Arg15Leu, which impair the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) signal transduction in a dominant-negative manner (Aashiq2020Clinical; Hannan2015Adaptor). These mutations lead to a more severe phenotype compared to other types of FHH, with symptoms including marked hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, and cognitive dysfunction (Szalat2017Stepwise; Hannan2015Adaptor).

The Arg15 mutations disrupt the interaction between the AP2σ2 subunit and the CaSR, affecting clathrin-mediated endocytosis and leading to decreased sensitivity to extracellular calcium (Hannan2021Ap2s1; Fujisawa2013Identification). This impaired endocytosis results in increased cell-surface localization of CaSR, contributing to the altered calcium homeostasis observed in FHH3 (Fujisawa2013Identification). The clinical presentation of FHH3 can include developmental delays and learning disabilities, as seen in some patients with AP2S1 mutations (Szalat2017Stepwise; Aashiq2020Clinical).

## Interactions
The AP2S1 gene encodes the AP2σ2 subunit, which is a component of the heterotetrameric adaptor protein-2 (AP2) complex involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This complex includes other subunits such as AP2α, AP2β2, and AP2μ2, with which AP2σ2 interacts to facilitate the internalization of transmembrane proteins like the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) (Hannan2021Ap2s1). The AP2σ2 subunit specifically binds to acidic dileucine motifs on cargo proteins, a critical interaction for the endocytosis process (Hannan2021Ap2s1).

Mutations in AP2S1, such as the p.Arg15Leu variant, disrupt the interaction between AP2σ2 and CaSR, impairing clathrin-mediated endocytosis and leading to conditions like familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 3 (FHH3) (Hannan2021Ap2s1). This mutation also affects the interaction of AP2σ2 with other AP2 complex subunits, reducing the presence of AP2α, AP2β2, and AP2μ2 in immunoprecipitates from mutant cells (Hannan2021Ap2s1).

AP2S1 also interacts with RNF41, a protein involved in receptor trafficking. Although RNF41 does not ubiquitinate AP2S1, it stabilizes AP2S1 protein levels, preventing its proteasomal degradation (Masschaele2018HighConfidence). These interactions highlight the role of AP2S1 in maintaining the stability and function of the AP2 complex and its associated pathways.
