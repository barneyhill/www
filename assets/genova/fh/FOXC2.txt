# FOXC2

## Overview
FOXC2 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box C2 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the forkhead family characterized by a distinct forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating various biological processes, including development, metabolism, and cellular differentiation. As a transcription factor, forkhead box C2 is involved in the modulation of gene expression, influencing pathways such as osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (Gan2015Foxc2; You2013Foxc2). The protein's activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and SUMOylation, which affect its nuclear localization and function (Tavian2020FOXC2; Berry2005The). Clinically, mutations in the FOXC2 gene are associated with lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome and other health conditions, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Yildirim‐Toruner2004A; Finegold2001Truncating).

## Structure
The FOXC2 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain (FHD), which spans amino acids 71 to 162. This domain includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS1) between amino acids 78-93, crucial for its function in DNA binding and transcriptional activation (Tavian2020FOXC2; Tavian2016FOXC2disease-mutations). The FHD is a variant of the helix-turn-helix structure, consisting of three major alpha-helices, a smaller fourth alpha-helix, and three anti-parallel beta-sheets. The third alpha-helix, known as the DNA-recognition helix, aligns along the major groove of DNA, making several contacts with the DNA molecule (Berry2005The).

The FOXC2 protein's secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, with the third alpha-helix playing a significant role in DNA binding (Li2019Crystal). The tertiary structure of FOXC2 is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, particularly involving residues in the winged loops and helices (Li2019Crystal). The protein does not exhibit a quaternary structure in the context of its DNA-binding domain (Li2019Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of FOXC2 include phosphorylation, which affects its nuclear localization and function (Berry2005The). The central region of the protein also contains SUMOylation motifs, which confer a negative regulatory role (Tavian2020FOXC2).

## Function
The FOXC2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular and developmental processes. In bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), FOXC2 is crucial for regulating osteogenesis and angiogenesis. It enhances the differentiation of BMSCs into osteoblasts and promotes angiogenesis by increasing the expression of markers such as VEGF and PDGF-β, mediated through the activation of the ERK and PI3K signaling pathways (You2013Foxc2). FOXC2 is also involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs), where it represses E-cadherin and promotes cell migration and invasion (You2013Foxc2).

In adipose tissue, FOXC2 influences metabolism by preventing preadipocytes from differentiating into mature adipocytes, thereby playing a role in energy metabolism and potentially protecting against metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes (Gan2015Foxc2). It enhances cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in preadipocytes through the activation of the Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Gan2015Foxc2). FOXC2's activity in these pathways highlights its importance in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival across various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FOXC2 gene are primarily associated with lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by lymphedema, or swelling due to lymphatic obstruction, and distichiasis, the presence of an extra row of eyelashes. These mutations often result in truncated proteins that disrupt the normal function of FOXC2, leading to impaired lymphatic and venous valve development (Finegold2001Truncating; Mellor2007Mutations). The condition can also include other features such as cardiac defects, cleft palate, and extradural cysts (Berry2005The; Erickson2001Clinical).

FOXC2 mutations are linked to venous valve failure, causing venous reflux and contributing to varicose veins (Mellor2007Mutations). The gene's role in lymphatic and venous systems is crucial, and its haploinsufficiency is a key mechanism underlying the syndrome (Bell2001Analysis; Yu2010Haploinsufficiencies). Some mutations also affect nuclear localization and transcriptional activity, further impairing FOXC2's function (Tavian2020FOXC2; Berry2005The).

In addition to lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome, FOXC2 mutations have been associated with renal disease and diabetes mellitus in some families, indicating a broader impact on health (Yildirim‐Toruner2004A).

## Interactions
FOXC2 is a transcription factor that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in several biological processes. It interacts with transcription factors from the E-twenty-six (ETS) family, such as ETS variant 2 (ETV2), to synergistically activate downstream targets involved in angiogenesis and blood vessel formation (Li2019Crystal). FOXC2 also interacts with proteins like PIN1, PP2A, and ERK1/2, which regulate its activity through phosphorylation and conformational changes. PIN1 isomerizes phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro bonds in FOXC2, while PP2A is involved in its dephosphorylation, and ERK1/2 kinases phosphorylate FOXC2, affecting its transcriptional activity (Ivanov2013Phosphorylation).

In the context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), FOXC2 interacts with proteins such as PKCα and ZEB1, influencing the expression of markers like E-cadherin and N-cadherin. It also cooperates with EMT transcription factors like Slug and Twist, contributing to cancer progression (Wang2018Emerging). FOXC2's interactions with DNA are mediated through its DNA-binding domain, which specifically recognizes the T/CAAAC motif, with key residues in Helix 3 playing a significant role in DNA sequence specificity (Li2019Crystal).
