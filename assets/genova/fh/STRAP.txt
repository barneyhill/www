# STRAP

## Overview
The STRAP gene encodes the serine/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, signal transduction, and autophagy. As a scaffold protein, STRAP is involved in the modulation of key signaling pathways such as TLR, GSK3β, and Notch3, impacting cellular responses to stress and inflammation. It also participates in the regulation of spliceosomal assembly and collagen mRNA translation, highlighting its diverse functional repertoire. STRAP's involvement in oncogenic pathways, particularly in cancers like colorectal cancer and neuroblastoma, underscores its significance in tumorigenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Kashikar2011Role; Huh2016STRAP; Vu2022Serine-threonine).

## Structure


## Function
STRAP (serine/threonine kinase receptor associated protein) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. It acts as a transcription cofactor, playing a significant role in the heat-shock response by enhancing the transcription of heat-shock genes such as heat-shock protein 70 (hsp70). STRAP forms a chromatin-associated complex with heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) and the p300 coactivator, which augments HSF1 binding and chromatin acetylation, facilitating cell survival during heat stress (Xu2008A).

STRAP also functions as a scaffold protein in the regulation of the TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways, enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β. It facilitates the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit, which is crucial for the activation of NF-κB signaling (Huh2016STRAP).

In addition, STRAP interacts with GSK3β and Notch3 signaling pathways, influencing the regulation of cellular signaling pathways and transcriptional activity. It binds to GSK3β through its WD40 domain, forming a ternary complex that recruits substrates to GSK3β, impacting cell cycle regulation and protein degradation (Kashikar2011Role). STRAP is also involved in regulating autophagy by binding to JMY, a protein that promotes autophagosome formation, acting as a negative regulator of autophagy (Hu2018LC3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STRAP gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma, and lung cancer. In colorectal cancer, STRAP is overexpressed in a significant percentage of cases and is associated with poor outcomes. It plays a critical role in tumorigenesis by stabilizing β-catenin, thereby enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which promotes cancer progression and metastasis (Yuan2016Novel; Vu2022Serine-threonine). STRAP also interacts with the NOTCH signaling pathway, maintaining cancer stem-like cells and contributing to tumor growth (Jin2017STRAP).

In neuroblastoma, STRAP is overexpressed and promotes tumor growth, proliferation, and motility. Knockout studies have shown that reducing STRAP expression decreases these malignant characteristics, suggesting its role in maintaining a stem cell-like phenotype in these tumors (Bownes2021SerineThreonine).

STRAP's interaction with the Ewing sarcoma protein (EWS) in the nucleus also highlights its role in modulating oncogenic pathways. This interaction is independent of TGF-β signaling and suggests a novel mechanism by which STRAP influences tumorigenicity (Anumanthan2006Oncogenic). These findings underscore STRAP's potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
STRAP (serine/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein) is involved in various protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and splicing processes. STRAP interacts with components of the spliceosomal machinery, including U2 snRNP proteins, SF3A subunits, and SR140, which are crucial for spliceosomal assembly and function. These interactions are primarily protein-protein based, as they remain intact even after RNase treatment (Jin2020STRAP).

STRAP also forms complexes with GSK3β and Axin, influencing the phosphorylation and stabilization of substrates like Notch3. This interaction is mediated through STRAP's WD40 domains and is involved in the regulation of GSK3β activity (Kashikar2011Role). STRAP binds to the intracellular domain of Notch3, reducing its ubiquitination and stabilizing it, particularly in the context of non-small cell lung cancer (Kashikar2011Role).

In the context of collagen mRNA translation, STRAP interacts with LARP6 and eIF4A, forming a complex that regulates the translation of type I collagen mRNAs. This interaction is crucial for the proper synthesis and assembly of collagen trimers (Vukmirovic2013SerineThreonine). STRAP's interactions with these proteins and nucleic acids highlight its multifaceted role in cellular processes.
