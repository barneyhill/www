# TSGA10

## Overview
TSGA10, or Testis-Specific Gene A10, is a gene that encodes a protein predominantly expressed in the testis, playing a critical role in spermatogenesis and male fertility. The protein encoded by TSGA10, known as testis-specific 10, is characterized by a coiled-coil structure and is involved in various cellular processes, including the differentiation and maturation of spermatids into spermatozoa. It interacts with several cytoskeletal proteins, such as vimentin and myosin-9, and is implicated in the autophagy pathway, which is essential for normal sperm morphology and function (Roghanian2010Filamentassociated; Asgari2021TSGA10). Beyond its reproductive functions, TSGA10 also exhibits anti-angiogenic properties by interacting with hypoxia-inducible factors, thereby influencing endothelial cell behavior and angiogenesis-related gene expression (Valipour2020Antiangiogenic; Amoorahim2020TSGA10). The gene's expression and mutations have clinical significance, being associated with conditions such as acephalic spermatozoa syndrome and certain cancers, where it may serve as a biomarker for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes (Kazerani2023Identification; Sha2018TSGA10).

## Structure
The TSGA10 protein in humans is composed of 698 amino acids and exhibits a predominantly alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. It is divided into a 27-kDa N-terminus and a 55-kDa C-terminus. The C-terminus contains a structural maintenance chromosome (SMC) domain, while the N-terminus features a conserved myosin-like SMC domain with ERM motifs, suggesting roles in cellular processes such as axonal traffic or signaling (Roghanian2010Filamentassociated). 

The protein undergoes post-translational cleavage, resulting in two distinct fragments: the 27-kDa fragment localizes to the principal piece of the sperm tail, and the 55-kDa fragment accumulates in the midpiece of sperm, as well as the centrosome and basal body (Sha2018TSGA10). The C-terminus interacts with the ODF2 protein, indicating a role in centriole assembly and function (Sha2018TSGA10). 

TSGA10 also interacts with cytoskeletal proteins such as vimentin, myosin-9, and actin-c1, forming filamentous structures around the nucleus and in cellular projections (Roghanian2010Filamentassociated). These interactions suggest a potential quaternary structure involving complex formation with other proteins. The protein's expression and interaction with vimentin are particularly noted in professional antigen-presenting cells (Roghanian2010Filamentassociated).

## Function
The TSGA10 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, particularly in the differentiation and maturation of spermatids into spermatozoa. It is primarily expressed in the testis and is involved in several molecular processes essential for male fertility. TSGA10 is associated with the autophagy pathway, interacting with hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) to regulate genes critical for sperm maturation, such as Beclin1, LC3B, ATG5, and ATG7 (Asgari2021TSGA10). This interaction is important for maintaining normal sperm morphology and function, as TSGA10 helps modulate autophagy and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Asgari2021TSGA10).

In addition to its role in spermatogenesis, TSGA10 is involved in inhibiting angiogenesis by interacting with HIF-2α, thereby affecting endothelial cell behavior and reducing the expression of angiogenesis-related genes like VEGF-A and VEGFR-2 (Valipour2020Antiangiogenic; Amoorahim2020TSGA10). TSGA10's anti-angiogenic effects are also linked to decreased phosphorylation of signaling pathways such as ERK and AKT, which are involved in cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Valipour2020Antiangiogenic). These functions highlight TSGA10's role in cellular processes beyond spermatogenesis, contributing to its potential therapeutic implications in managing pathological angiogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TSGA10 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, particularly affecting male fertility and cancer progression. TSGA10 mutations have been linked to acephalic spermatozoa syndrome, a rare form of teratozoospermia characterized by sperm lacking heads, leading to male infertility. Studies have identified various mutations, including homozygous truncating and missense mutations, which result in the absence or dysfunction of the TSGA10 protein, crucial for sperm head-tail connection (Ye2020Loss‐of‐function; Khan2024A; Sha2018TSGA10). These mutations disrupt the structural integrity of sperm, causing infertility due to impaired sperm morphology (Xiang2021Pathogenesis).

In cancer, TSGA10 is overexpressed in certain tumors, including brain tumors, where it may serve as a biomarker for diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Its role in inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) suggests a function in preventing angiogenesis and metastasis, highlighting its potential impact on tumor progression (Kazerani2023Identification). Alterations in TSGA10 expression are also implicated in teratospermia, where decreased expression is associated with impaired spermatid differentiation and increased reactive oxygen species, contributing to abnormal sperm morphology (Asgari2021TSGA10).

## Interactions
TSGA10, a testis-specific protein, is known to interact with several other proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One of its key interactions is with vimentin, an intermediate filament protein. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation studies and is observed in professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages (Roghanian2010Filamentassociated). TSGA10 also interacts with cytoskeletal proteins like actin-c1 and myosin-9, suggesting its involvement in maintaining cellular structure and function (Roghanian2010Filamentassociated).

In the context of spermatogenesis, TSGA10 interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), inhibiting its transcriptional activity. This interaction affects the autophagy pathway, which is crucial for sperm maturation (Asgari2021TSGA10). TSGA10 also binds to the PASB and C-TAD domains of HIF proteins, disrupting their dimerization and transcriptional activity (Amoorahim2020TSGA10).

In mice, TSGA10 interacts with proteins such as GRP78 and NSUN2, which are involved in mitochondrial function and sperm motility, highlighting its role in male fertility (Luo2020Tsga10). These interactions underscore TSGA10's multifaceted role in cellular processes related to reproduction and immune function.
