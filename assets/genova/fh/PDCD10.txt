# PDCD10

## Overview
The PDCD10 gene encodes the programmed cell death 10 protein, also known as CCM3, which is a highly conserved adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell migration, and vascular development. This protein is characterized by its lack of catalytic domains and its ability to form homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with germinal center kinase III (GCKIII) proteins, which are crucial for maintaining vascular integrity (Ceccarelli2011CCM3PDCD10; Yang2015Molecular). PDCD10 plays a significant role in stabilizing the Golgi apparatus and regulating neuronal survival, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Lin2010PDCD10CCM3; Fidalgo2010CCM3PDCD10). Mutations in the PDCD10 gene are associated with cerebral cavernous malformations, a neurovascular disorder, and have implications in various cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (De2021Genomewide; Shenkar2015Exceptional).

## Structure
The PDCD10 protein, also known as CCM3, is a 212 amino acid protein that is highly conserved among metazoans (Ceccarelli2011CCM3PDCD10). Its primary structure is encoded by the PDCD10 gene, which includes a conserved domain spanning from Asn 10 to His 162 (Yang2015Molecular). The secondary structure of PDCD10 consists of two distinct domains: an N-terminal dimerization domain and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT)-homology domain. These domains are composed of seven α-helices, with the N-terminal domain containing three α-helices and the C-terminal domain containing four α-helices (Yang2015Molecular).

The tertiary structure of PDCD10 is characterized by its role as an adaptor protein, lacking catalytic domains, and is predicted to be composed of seven α-helices (Yang2015Molecular). In terms of quaternary structure, PDCD10 can form homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with GCKIII proteins, such as MST4, through its N-terminal domain. This interaction is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and involves a mechanism analogous to CCM3 homodimerization (Ceccarelli2011CCM3PDCD10).

PDCD10 is also subject to post-translational modifications, with five phosphorylated sites predicted at Ser 39, Ser 79, Ser 171, Ser 173, and Ser 175 (Yang2015Molecular).

## Function
The PDCD10 gene, also known as CCM3, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell migration, and vascular development. In healthy human cells, PDCD10 is involved in stabilizing the germinal center kinase III (GCKIII) proteins, which are essential for Golgi apparatus assembly and cell orientation. The PDCD10 protein forms a complex with GCKIII proteins and GM130, a Golgi-resident protein, to maintain the structure of the Golgi apparatus. This interaction is vital for proper cell migration and orientation, as the absence of PDCD10 leads to Golgi disassembly and impaired cell migration (Fidalgo2010CCM3PDCD10).

PDCD10 is also implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. It interacts with γ-protocadherins (PCDH-γ) to regulate neuronal survival, acting as an intracellular adaptor protein. This interaction prevents PDCD10 from inducing apoptosis, suggesting a protective role in neuronal cells (Lin2010PDCD10CCM3).

In the context of vascular development, PDCD10 is expressed in the neurovascular unit and is involved in CNS angiogenesis. It is strongly expressed in arterial and capillary endothelium, indicating a role in establishing arterial identity in developing vasculature (Tanriover2008PDCD10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDCD10 gene, also known as CCM3, are primarily associated with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), a neurovascular disorder characterized by abnormally dilated blood vessels in the brain. These malformations can lead to symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and cerebral hemorrhages. PDCD10 mutations result in an exceptionally aggressive form of CCM, with a higher lesion burden and increased risk of hemorrhages compared to other CCM genotypes like KRIT1 and CCM2 (Guclu2005Mutations; Shenkar2015Exceptional). The clinical phenotype of PDCD10-related CCM includes additional features such as scoliosis, cognitive disabilities, and skin lesions, which are not directly related to lesion burden or bleeding (Shenkar2015Exceptional).

Alterations in PDCD10 expression are also implicated in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, PDCD10 acts as an oncogene, with overexpression linked to increased tumor grade and progression. It promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through pathways such as ERK1/2 and RhoA (De2021Genomewide). Conversely, in glioblastoma multiforme, PDCD10 is down-regulated, contributing to increased microvascular density and brain edema (Valentino2021The).

## Interactions
PDCD10, also known as CCM3, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the germinal center kinase III (GCKIII) subfamily, including MST4, STK24, and STK25, forming part of the STRIPAK complex. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of PDCD10, which is essential for binding to the C-terminal tail regions of GCKIII proteins (Ceccarelli2011CCM3PDCD10). PDCD10 also interacts with γ-protocadherins (PCDH-γ) and PYK2, where it acts as a downstream effector of PCDH-γ, promoting neuronal survival by inhibiting PYK2 kinase activity (Lin2010PDCD10CCM3).

In the context of cerebral cavernous malformations, PDCD10 is part of a multiprotein complex that includes STRIP1, CTTNBP2NL, and MST4, among others, indicating its role in a high-density interaction network (Goudreault2009A). PDCD10 also plays a role in maintaining brain endothelial barrier integrity by interacting with tight junction proteins and regulating their organization, which is crucial for vascular development and integrity (Stamatovic2015PDCD10). These interactions highlight PDCD10's involvement in apoptosis regulation, cell signaling, and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
