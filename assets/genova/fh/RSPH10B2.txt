# RSPH10B2

## Overview
RSPH10B2 is a gene that encodes the protein radial spoke head 10 homolog B2, which is involved in the structural organization of cilia and flagella. The protein belongs to the radial spoke head protein family, which plays a crucial role in the motility and stability of these cellular appendages. Radial spoke head proteins are integral to the proper functioning of the axoneme, the central shaft of cilia and flagella, by facilitating the interaction between the central pair of microtubules and the outer doublet microtubules. This interaction is essential for the regulation of dynein motor activity, which drives the bending motions necessary for ciliary and flagellar movement. Mutations or dysregulation of RSPH10B2 can lead to defects in ciliary function, potentially resulting in clinical conditions such as primary ciliary dyskinesia (Qiu2020aarFDC).
