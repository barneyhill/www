member of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family. The gene product is a protein that forms a multiprotein complex that links receptor kinases and actin. Binding to actin occurs through a C-terminal verprolin homology domain in all family members. The multiprotein complex serves to tranduce signals that involve changes in cell shape, motility or function. The published map location (PMID:10381382) has been changed based on recent genomic sequence comparisons, which indicate that the expressed gene is located on chromosome 1, and a pseudogene may be located on chromosome X. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
