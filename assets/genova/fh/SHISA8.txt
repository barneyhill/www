# SHISA8

## Overview
SHISA8 is a gene that encodes the protein shisa family member 8, which is part of the Shisa protein family. This protein is characterized as a type I transmembrane protein, featuring a single-transmembrane domain, an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, and a proline-rich C-terminal region. The cysteine-rich domain is essential for forming disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's structural integrity, while the proline-rich region suggests potential interactions with other proteins, such as NEDD4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases, indicating roles in protein degradation and sorting (Pei2012Unexpected). SHISA8 is primarily expressed in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb and is involved in modulating AMPA receptor (AMPAR) function, which is crucial for synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). The protein's interactions with AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA2 suggest its role in synaptic plasticity, potentially influencing learning and memory processes (Xu2024An). Additionally, SHISA8 has been implicated in the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms, particularly under altered light-dark cycles (Xu2024An).

## Structure
SHISA8, a member of the Shisa protein family, is characterized by a single-transmembrane domain with an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain and a proline-rich C-terminal region (Liu2023Characteristics; Pei2012Unexpected). The cysteine-rich domain follows a specific pattern ('C*C*CC*C*CC*C'), which is crucial for forming disulfide bonds that contribute to the protein's structural integrity (Pei2012Unexpected). The proline-rich C-terminal region contains motifs such as the PY motif, which suggests potential interactions with WW-domain-containing proteins, like NEDD4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases, indicating roles in protein degradation and sorting (Pei2012Unexpected).

SHISA8 is predicted to be a type I transmembrane protein, with its proline-rich, mostly disordered C-terminal region residing in the cytosol (Pei2012Unexpected). The protein lacks cysteines near the C-termini of its predicted transmembrane segments, suggesting a loss of lipid modification sites (Pei2012Unexpected). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SHISA8 are not provided, the presence of these domains and motifs indicates a complex structural organization typical of Shisa family proteins. The evolutionary analysis suggests that SHISA8 may have originated from a mammalian-specific gene duplication event (Pei2012Unexpected).

## Function
SHISA8, a member of the Shisa protein family, is involved in modulating the function of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are critical for fast synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. SHISA8 interacts with AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA2, affecting AMPAR-mediated current kinetics, including current amplitude, desensitization, and recovery from desensitization (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). This modulation of AMPARs suggests a role for SHISA8 in synaptic function and plasticity, potentially influencing learning and memory processes (Xu2024An).

SHISA8 is primarily expressed in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, with minimal expression in other brain regions (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). Despite its interactions with AMPARs, the specific effects of SHISA8 on AMPAR gating properties in neurons have not been fully elucidated, and its endogenous neuronal function remains largely unknown (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary).

In addition to its role in synaptic modulation, SHISA8 has been implicated in the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms, particularly under altered light-dark cycles, such as those experienced in extreme environments like Antarctica (Xu2024An). This highlights its potential as a target for addressing sleep disorders in such conditions.

## Clinical Significance
SHISA8 has been implicated in various neurological conditions due to its role in synaptic function and circadian rhythm regulation. Altered expression of SHISA8 has been observed in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a study using the Sgo1 À/+ mouse model, SHISA8 was found to be underexpressed, suggesting a potential link between its expression levels and AD pathology (Rao2018Spontaneous).

In the context of sleep disorders, SHISA8 has been identified as a key regulator of circadian rhythm and sleep disruptions, particularly in environments with altered photoperiods, such as Antarctica. The study suggests that SHISA8 could be a target for clinical intervention in sleep disorders induced by changes in light exposure (Xu2024An).

SHISA8 is also part of a minimally deleted region in a 22q13.2 microdeletion syndrome, which is associated with language and developmental delays. Although SHISA8 is included in this region, its specific clinical significance in this context is not well defined, with other genes like TCF20 being more prominently highlighted for their roles in the observed phenotypes (Upadia2018A).

## Interactions
SHISA8, also known as CKAMP39, is a member of the Shisa protein family that interacts with AMPA receptors (AMPARs). It has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with AMPAR subunits GluA1 and GluA2, suggesting a potential interaction with these subunits (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). In studies using HEK293 cells, SHISA8 significantly affects AMPAR-mediated current kinetics, including current amplitude, desensitization, and recovery from desensitization. However, differences in deactivation and desensitization kinetics were observed between GluA1-mediated and GluA2-mediated currents when modulated by SHISA8 (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary).

SHISA8 is part of the CKAMP family of proteins, which are known to interact with AMPARs and influence their trafficking, subcellular localization, and function. These proteins have a cysteine-knot structure and a PDZ type II binding motif, which are important for their function (von2019AMPA). Despite these interactions, the role of SHISA8 as a true AMPAR auxiliary protein remains uncertain due to the lack of data on its endogenous neuronal function (Abdollahi2021Auxiliary). Further experimental evidence is needed to confirm its role in the brain (von2019AMPA).
