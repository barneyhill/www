# APIP

## Overview
APIP, or APAF1 interacting protein, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes, including apoptosis and pyroptosis. The protein functions as a 5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase (MtnB) within the methionine salvage pathway, playing a vital role in recycling methionine, an essential amino acid (Kang2013Structural). Structurally, APIP forms a tetramer with C4 symmetry, characterized by a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices, and contains a zinc ion at its active site, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Kang2013Structural). Beyond its enzymatic role, APIP interacts with apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) to inhibit caspase-9 activation, thereby modulating apoptosis and promoting cell survival under stress conditions (Cho2004Induced). Additionally, APIP is involved in cardioprotection and cell proliferation, with significant implications in diseases such as cancer and heart failure (Hong2016APIP; Lim2019Cardioprotective).

## Structure
The human gene APIP encodes a protein that functions as a 5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase (MtnB) in the methionine salvage pathway. The protein's structure has been determined at a high resolution of 2.0 Å, revealing that APIP/MtnB forms a tetramer with C4 symmetry. This quaternary structure consists of a central nine-stranded β-sheet flanked by five α-helices and four 3_10 helices, resembling the fold of the class II aldolase family (Kang2013Structural).

The active site of APIP contains a zinc ion, coordinated by three histidine residues (His115, His117, and His195) and three water molecules, which are crucial for its catalytic activity (Mary2012Functional; Kang2013Structural). The enzyme's catalytic mechanism involves Glu139* acting as a catalytic acid/base (Kang2013Structural).

APIP exists in two splice variant isoforms: APIP.long and APIP.short. The short isoform lacks the first 38 amino acids and is catalytically inactive, highlighting the importance of the N-terminal region for its enzymatic function (Mary2012Functional). The protein is also phosphorylated at specific serine residues, although this modification is not required for its activity (Mary2012Functional).

## Function
APIP (APAF1 interacting protein) functions as a critical regulator of apoptosis and pyroptosis in human cells. It interacts with the apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) to inhibit the activation of caspase-9, thereby suppressing the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This interaction prevents the activation of downstream caspases, such as caspase-3, which are essential for the execution of apoptosis, thus promoting cell survival under stress conditions like ischemia and hypoxia (Cho2004Induced).

In addition to its role in apoptosis, APIP also inhibits pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death, by interfering with caspase-1 activity, particularly in response to bacterial infections like Salmonella (Kang2013Structural). APIP's enzymatic function as a 5-methylthioribulose-1-phosphate dehydratase in the methionine salvage pathway is crucial for recycling methionine, an essential amino acid, and is linked to its role in inhibiting pyroptosis (Kang2013Structural).

APIP is active in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in tissues such as skeletal muscle and heart, where it plays a protective role against ischemic damage by modulating apoptotic pathways (Cho2004Induced). Its activity is independent of its enzymatic function in apoptosis inhibition but is necessary for preventing pyroptosis (Kang2013Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the APIP gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and inflammatory conditions. In gastric cancer, APIP acts as an oncogenic factor by enhancing ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling, which promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Increased expression or gene amplification of APIP is observed in gastric cancer, where it stimulates the formation of ERBB2/ERBB3 heterodimers, crucial for cancer cell proliferation (Hong2016APIP).

APIP is also involved in regulating inflammatory cell death, specifically pyroptosis and apoptosis, through its role in the methionine salvage pathway. Variations in APIP expression can influence the response to chemotherapeutic agents and proinflammatory conditions like systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). A pro-cell death APIP allele, associated with lower expression and greater pyroptosis, has been linked to reduced odds of positive blood cultures and mortality during hospitalization, suggesting a potential benefit in infection control (Ko2012Functional).

In heart conditions, APIP expression is significantly increased in cardiac tissues from patients with ischemic heart disease and heart failure. It plays a cardioprotective role, potentially through its interaction with the ADORA2B receptor, which is crucial for cardiomyocyte survival under hypoxic stress (Lim2019Cardioprotective).

## Interactions
APIP (APAF1 interacting protein) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the adenosine receptor ADORA2B, particularly under hypoxic conditions, which is essential for cardioprotection. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of APIP, specifically between the 41st and 60th amino acids, with residues Thr44, Gly45, and Gly46 being critical. Mutations in these residues disrupt the interaction and impair APIP's protective effects (Lim2019Cardioprotective).

APIP also interacts with the CARD domain of Apaf-1, competing with caspase-9 for binding. This interaction inhibits the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, thereby suppressing apoptosis triggered by mitochondrial apoptotic stimuli (Cho2004Induced). APIP's interaction with Apaf-1 is confirmed through immunoprecipitation assays in HeLa and HEK293F cells (Cho2004Induced).

Additionally, APIP binds to the C-terminal tail of ERBB3, enhancing the formation of a ternary complex with ERBB2, which is crucial for cell proliferation in gastric cancer cells (Hong2016APIP). These interactions highlight APIP's role in modulating apoptosis, cardioprotection, and cell proliferation.
