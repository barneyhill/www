# OR1P1

## Overview
The OR1P1 gene is responsible for encoding the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily P member 1, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The OR1P1 gene is located within a cluster of olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 17, and it is considered a pseudogene in some individuals, meaning it may not be functional in all populations. The olfactory receptor proteins, including those encoded by OR1P1, share a characteristic 7-transmembrane domain structure, which is also found in many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors, highlighting their importance in signal transduction processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
