# VDAC1

## Overview
VDAC1, or Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by facilitating the exchange of ions and metabolites between the mitochondria and the cytosol, thus maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. The VDAC1 protein is characterized by a 19-stranded beta-barrel structure, which is integral to its function in metabolite transport and voltage gating (Hiller2008Solution; Hiller2010The). Beyond its metabolic functions, VDAC1 is involved in regulating apoptosis and calcium homeostasis, interacting with various proteins such as those from the Bcl-2 family, which modulate its role in cell survival and death pathways (ShoshanBarmatz2018VDAC1a; ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1). Due to its central role in these processes, VDAC1 is implicated in several diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic and autoimmune diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1).

## Structure
VDAC1, or Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1, is a protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, characterized by a 19-stranded beta-barrel structure. This beta-barrel is formed by antiparallel beta sheets, with strands 19 and 1 paired in parallel, creating a unique fold among beta-barrel proteins (Hiller2008Solution; Hiller2010The). The N-terminal region of VDAC1 forms a partial alpha-helix that traverses the pore but does not contribute to the barrel wall, playing a role in voltage gating (Hiller2008Solution; Hiller2010The).

The primary structure of VDAC1 includes specific amino acid sequences that facilitate its function in metabolite transport. The protein's surface is hydrophobic, allowing interaction with the lipid bilayer or detergent micelles, as seen in structural studies (Hiller2008Solution). VDAC1 can exist as a monomer or form dynamic interactions without stable oligomerization in certain environments (Hiller2008Solution).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, do not significantly alter VDAC1's gating properties, although cholesterol is necessary for its wild-type-like function (Hiller2008Solution). The protein also interacts with molecules like b-NADH and Bcl-xL, with specific binding sites identified on the VDAC1 structure (Hiller2008Solution).

## Function
VDAC1, or Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1, is a crucial protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) that facilitates the exchange of ions and metabolites between the mitochondria and the cytosol. It plays a significant role in cellular energy metabolism by regulating the transport of molecules such as ATP, ADP, pyruvate, malate, succinate, and NADH, which are essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (ShoshanBarmatz2018VDAC1; ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1).

VDAC1 is involved in calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis, acting as a channel for Ca2+ transport in and out of mitochondria. This function is vital for regulating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, which influences energy metabolism and apoptosis. VDAC1's interactions with proteins like Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL modulate Ca2+ transfer, affecting cell survival and death pathways (ShoshanBarmatz2018VDAC1a).

VDAC1 also plays a role in apoptosis regulation by interacting with various proteins, including members of the Bcl-2 family, hexokinase, and creatine kinase. These interactions influence the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria, thus participating in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (ShoshanBarmatz2012VDAC; ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1). Through these functions, VDAC1 serves as a critical hub for integrating mitochondrial activities with broader cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
VDAC1 (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1) is implicated in a variety of diseases due to its role in mitochondrial function and apoptosis. Overexpression of VDAC1 is observed in several cancers, where it supports tumor metabolism by facilitating metabolite passage and ATP delivery, and interacts with anti-apoptotic proteins to protect tumor cells from apoptosis. Reducing VDAC1 expression can inhibit tumor growth, suggesting its potential as a target for cancer therapy (ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, VDAC1 dysfunction is linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), where it is found in high levels in dystrophic neurites of amyloid-beta deposits, contributing to neuronal apoptosis. Proteomic studies have identified modifications of VDAC1 in AD brains, indicating its role in the disease's pathogenesis (ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1).

VDAC1 is also involved in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), where its overexpression in pancreatic β-cells affects insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. Targeting VDAC1 with specific inhibitors can restore ATP generation and normalize insulin secretion (ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1).

In autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), VDAC1 oligomerization promotes mitochondrial DNA release, exacerbating disease severity. Inhibiting this process with compounds like VBIT-4 can reduce disease severity (ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1).

## Interactions
VDAC1, a protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, is involved in numerous interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, which regulate apoptosis by affecting Ca2+ fluxes and inhibiting apoptotic pathways (Malia2006NMR; ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1). VDAC1 also forms complexes with hexokinase, which prevents the release of pro-apoptotic factors, aiding in tumor cell survival (ShoshanBarmatz2020VDAC1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, VDAC1 interacts with proteins like amyloid β, full-length APP, and phosphorylated Tau in Alzheimer's disease, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Caterino2017Protein–protein). It also interacts with mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (mutSOD1) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, disrupting its normal function (Caterino2017Protein–protein).

VDAC1's interaction with cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and gelsolin affects its channel activity and is linked to the Warburg effect (ShoshanBarmatz2017VDAC1). It also interacts with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), influencing its activity in systemic and pulmonary circulations (Caterino2017Protein–protein). These interactions highlight VDAC1's role as a hub protein in regulating metabolic, apoptotic, and other cellular processes.
