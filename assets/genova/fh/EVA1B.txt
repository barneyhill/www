# EVA1B

## Overview
EVA1B is a gene that encodes the protein eva-1 homolog B, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a role in cell signaling and interaction. It is implicated in the regulation of immune responses and has been associated with several types of cancer, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis. The gene's expression and epigenetic modifications are of particular interest in cancer research, as they may provide insights into tumorigenesis and potential therapeutic interventions (Qu2021EVA1B; Ma2022Molecular; Lim2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
EVA1B has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In glioma, high EVA1B expression is associated with poorer overall survival and is considered an independent prognostic biomarker. It correlates with unfavorable clinicopathological features and increased immune cell infiltration, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, macrophages, and neutrophils (Qu2021EVA1B). In colorectal cancer (CRC), EVA1B overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and advanced tumor stages. It is associated with increased immune cell infiltration and stromal activation, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and immune response modulation (Ma2022Molecular). 

In breast cancer, EVA1B is part of a prognostic model for predicting outcomes, although its expression patterns vary between datasets, indicating a need for further research to clarify its role (Cai2022Identification). Additionally, EVA1B is involved in epigenetic regulation, with significant DNA methylation variations correlating with gene expression in various tissues, which may influence its role in cancer and other diseases (Lim2019Identification). These findings suggest that EVA1B could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology.
