# CTNNB1

## Overview
CTNNB1 is a gene that encodes the protein catenin beta 1, commonly referred to as beta-catenin, which is a pivotal component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Beta-catenin is a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in both cell-cell adhesion and gene transcription regulation. As a part of the cadherin protein complex, beta-catenin is essential for maintaining cell structure and integrity by facilitating cell adhesion. In the context of the Wnt signaling pathway, beta-catenin acts as a transcriptional co-activator, influencing the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and development. The regulation of beta-catenin is tightly controlled through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which determine its stability and activity within the cell. Dysregulation of CTNNB1 and its encoded protein is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Travaglino2022Prognostic; Song2015A; de2021Zooming).

## Structure
CTNNB1 encodes the protein beta-catenin, a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway. The primary structure of beta-catenin is composed of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these elements, allowing beta-catenin to perform its role in cellular processes. 

Beta-catenin is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeats, which are essential for protein-protein interactions. These repeats facilitate the binding of beta-catenin to other proteins, playing a significant role in its function within the cell. The quaternary structure of beta-catenin involves its interaction with other proteins, which is critical for its role in signaling pathways.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination are common in beta-catenin. These modifications regulate the protein's stability and function, influencing its activity in the Wnt signaling pathway. Phosphorylation often marks beta-catenin for degradation, while ubiquitination can target it for proteasomal degradation, thus controlling its levels within the cell. These structural and functional characteristics underscore the importance of beta-catenin in cellular signaling and regulation.

## Function
CTNNB1 encodes the protein beta-catenin, which plays a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathway, a key regulator of various cellular processes. Beta-catenin is integral to cell-cell adhesion and gene transcription. At the cell membrane, it interacts with cadherins, which are proteins that mediate cell adhesion, thereby maintaining cell structure and integrity. This interaction is essential for the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions, which are critical for tissue architecture and stability.

In the cytoplasm, beta-catenin is involved in signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation and differentiation. When the Wnt pathway is activated, beta-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates to the nucleus. In the nucleus, it acts as a transcriptional co-activator, partnering with transcription factors to regulate the expression of genes involved in cell growth and development. This regulation is vital for embryonic development and the maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis.

The precise control of beta-catenin levels and activity is crucial, as dysregulation can lead to pathological conditions, including cancer. Its role in both cell adhesion and gene transcription underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTNNB1 gene, which encodes β-catenin, are implicated in various diseases and conditions due to their role in the Wnt signaling pathway and cell adhesion. In endometrial carcinoma, CTNNB1 mutations are associated with early-stage endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, particularly in the NSMP group, where they increase the risk of recurrence (Travaglino2022Prognostic). These mutations are also linked to nuclear localization of β-catenin, which is a marker for recurrence and decreased recurrence-free survival in endometrioid-type endometrial carcinoma (Kim2018Nuclear).

In desmoid tumors, CTNNB1 mutations, particularly in codon 45, are common and correlate with local recurrence, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and recurrence (Lazar2008Specific). In lung adenocarcinoma, CTNNB1 mutations are relatively rare but are associated with a poor prognosis and alterations in β-catenin expression (Zhou2020Analysis).

CTNNB1 mutations also contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability characterized by peripheral spasticity, microcephaly, and central hypotonia (Kharbanda2017Clinical). In adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma, CTNNB1 mutations are linked to tumor recurrence and poor progression-free survival (Hara2019Clinical). These mutations lead to β-catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation, affecting transcription of target genes and contributing to disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
CTNNB1, also known as beta-catenin, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. In the Wnt signaling pathway, CTNNB1 interacts with the destruction complex, which includes proteins such as AXIN, APC, GSK3, and CSNK1A1. This complex regulates the stability and degradation of CTNNB1 by phosphorylating it, marking it for proteasomal degradation in the absence of Wnt signals (de2021Zooming). Upon Wnt activation, the destruction complex is inhibited, allowing CTNNB1 to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors to drive gene transcription (de2021Zooming).

CTNNB1 also forms a complex with DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) in colorectal cancer cells. This interaction is independent of chromatin and occurs in the nucleus, where it is enhanced by Wnt3a signaling. The central region of Dnmt1 is necessary for this interaction, which is mutually stabilizing for both proteins (Song2015A). Additionally, CTNNB1 is a key component of adherens junctions, linking membrane proteins to actin-based microfilaments and interacting with proteins such as CDH1 and OCLN (Paris2008The).
