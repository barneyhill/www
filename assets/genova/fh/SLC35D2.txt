# SLC35D2

## Overview
SLC35D2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member D2, which is a transmembrane transporter involved in the movement of nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes. This protein is a critical component of the solute carrier family, playing a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by facilitating the transport of UDP-sugars within the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. The proper function of SLC35D2 is essential for the glycosylation of proteins and lipids, processes that are vital for protein folding and trafficking. The protein's activity is crucial for the synthesis of hyaluronan and other GAGs, which are important for cellular development and function (Viola2016MDAMB231; Szulc2020Biosynthesis).

## Structure
The SLC35D2 protein is a member of the solute carrier family, specifically involved in the transport of nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes. The primary structure of SLC35D2 consists of amino acid sequences encoded by the SLC35D2 gene. This sequence determines the protein's specific function and interaction with other cellular components. 

In terms of secondary structure, SLC35D2 may include elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure of SLC35D2 refers to its three-dimensional folding, which is crucial for its role in transporting nucleotide sugars. This folding allows the protein to interact with other molecules and perform its transport function effectively.

The quaternary structure of SLC35D2 involves the assembly of multiple subunits, which may be necessary for its full functional activity. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or glycosylation, can occur in SLC35D2, potentially affecting its activity, stability, and interactions with other proteins. 

Splice variants of the SLC35D2 gene may result in different isoforms of the protein, each with distinct functions. These isoforms can contribute to the diversity of the protein's roles in various cellular processes.

## Function
SLC35D2 is a nucleotide sugar transporter that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by facilitating the transport of UDP-sugars across the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum membranes. This transport is essential for the proper glycosylation of proteins and lipids, which is a key process in protein folding and trafficking within the cell (Viola2016MDAMB231). SLC35D2 is particularly important for the synthesis of hyaluronan (HA) and other GAGs, as it ensures the availability of UDP-sugars necessary for these processes. The transporter is localized in the Golgi apparatus and is known to colocalize with UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase, which produces UDP-xylose, a crucial link sugar in GAG synthesis (Viola2016MDAMB231).

In healthy human cells, SLC35D2 is suspected to deliver UDP-GlcNAc, although its specific function in these cells is not fully detailed (Szulc2020Biosynthesis). The absence or dysfunction of SLC35D2 can lead to developmental failures due to the lack of heparan sulfate (HS) and/or chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, highlighting its essential role in normal cellular functions and development (Viola2016MDAMB231).
