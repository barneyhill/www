# SH3BGRL3

## Overview
SH3BGRL3 is a gene located on chromosome 1p34.3-p35 that encodes the SH3 domain binding glutamate rich protein like 3, a member of the thioredoxin superfamily. Despite its structural similarity to glutaredoxins, the SH3BGRL3 protein lacks enzymatic activity due to the absence of canonical redox active sites. It is characterized as a nonclassical secretory protein and is involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. The protein interacts with various partners, including the motor protein Myo1c and the adaptor protein Grb2, facilitating its role in signaling pathways that are crucial for cell motility and cancer progression (Chiang2015SH3BGRL3; Di2021SH3BGRL3). SH3BGRL3's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential significance in cancer biology and as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
The SH3BGRL3 protein is a 93 amino acid protein that belongs to the thioredoxin superfamily and is encoded by the SH3BGRL3 gene located on chromosome 1p34.3-p35 (Chiang2015SH3BGRL3; Li2022SH3). Its structure has been resolved using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Di2021SH3BGRL3). Despite its similarity to glutaredoxins, SH3BGRL3 lacks the canonical sequence of redox active sites and does not exhibit enzymatic activity (Di2021SH3BGRL3).

The protein's tertiary structure includes six α helices and four β sheets, which are crucial for its interactions with other proteins (Li2020SH3BGRL). SH3BGRL3 contains a proline-rich motif, which is important for its interaction with the Grb2 adaptor protein, facilitating its role in signaling pathways (Chiang2015SH3BGRL3). It also interacts with the motor protein Myo1c in a calcium-dependent manner, binding specifically to the neck region of Myo1c, which contains three IQ calmodulin-binding domains (Di2021SH3BGRL3).

SH3BGRL3 does not have a canonical SH3 binding domain but contains a PPQIV sequence instead of the SH3 consensus sequence (Di2021SH3BGRL3). The protein is characterized as a nonclassical secretory protein, although specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variants are not provided in the available context (Chiang2015SH3BGRL3).

## Function
The SH3BGRL3 gene encodes a protein that is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, yet its specific function in healthy human cells remains largely undetermined (Di2021SH3BGRL3). Structurally similar to glutaredoxins, SH3BGRL3 lacks enzymatic activity due to the absence of canonical redox active sites and does not possess a canonical SH3 binding domain (Di2021SH3BGRL3). Despite these structural characteristics, SH3BGRL3 is involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration through its interaction with the motor protein Myo1c in a calcium-dependent manner (Di2021SH3BGRL3). This interaction is crucial for cell locomotion, as demonstrated in studies using the MDA-MB-231 cell line, where SH3BGRL3 modulates cell migration by binding to the neck region of Myo1c, which contains IQ domains (Di2021SH3BGRL3). SH3BGRL3's role in cell migration suggests it may regulate cytoskeletal activity, potentially affecting various cellular functions (Di2021SH3BGRL3). While its specific role in healthy cells is not fully understood, SH3BGRL3's interactions with proteins like Myo1c indicate its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing cell motility (Di2021SH3BGRL3).

## Clinical Significance
The SH3BGRL3 gene has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and gastric carcinoma (GC). In AML, SH3BGRL3 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. It produces a circular RNA, circRNA_0010984, which acts as a molecular sponge for miR-375, affecting the expression of YAP1, a gene involved in tumor proliferation. This interaction promotes AML cell proliferation and contributes to drug resistance, highlighting SH3BGRL3 as a potential therapeutic target (Yang2023Gene).

In gastric carcinoma, SH3BGRL3 is significantly upregulated and correlates with poor overall survival and post-progression survival. Its high expression is linked to aggressive tumor features and altered immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role as an adverse prognostic factor (Li2022SH3).

The gene's expression is also associated with hyperglycemia-related cancer progression, as it interacts with pathways like PI3K, Akt, and mTOR, which are involved in glycolysis and tumor growth (Li2022SH3). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SH3BGRL3 in cancer progression and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SH3BGRL3 interacts with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through the adaptor protein Grb2, which is significant in the context of urothelial carcinoma. This interaction is mediated by SH3BGRL3's proline-rich motif and is associated with the activation of the Akt signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation and survival (Chiang2015SH3BGRL3). SH3BGRL3 also interacts with Myo1c, a non-conventional myosin, in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction occurs at the neck region of Myo1c, which contains IQ calmodulin-binding domains, and is crucial for cell migration. The binding of SH3BGRL3 to Myo1c suggests a role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility (Di2021SH3BGRL3). Additionally, SH3BGRL3 has been shown to bind directly to GAP43, another protein with an IQ domain, also in a calcium-dependent manner, indicating a broader role in interacting with IQ domain-containing proteins (Di2021SH3BGRL3). These interactions highlight SH3BGRL3's involvement in signaling pathways and cellular processes related to cancer progression and metastasis.
