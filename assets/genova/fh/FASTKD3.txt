# FASTKD3

## Overview
FASTKD3 is a gene that encodes the FAST kinase domains 3 protein, which is integral to mitochondrial RNA processing and metabolism. The protein is characterized by the presence of FAST kinase-like domains, which facilitate its interaction with mitochondrial RNA, playing a crucial role in the regulation and processing of mitochondrial transcripts. FASTKD3 is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial mRNAs, contributing to the synthesis of key proteins necessary for mitochondrial function and energy production. It is part of a family of proteins that influence mitochondrial RNA stability and processing, with potential overlapping roles with other FASTKD proteins. The gene's alterations have been implicated in various cancers and mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in both oncogenesis and mitochondrial pathologies (Ohkubo2021The; Barchiesi2019Transcription; MagranerPardo2021Systematic).

## Structure
FASTKD3 is a protein encoded by the FASTKD3 gene, playing a significant role in mitochondrial RNA processing. The protein is characterized by the presence of FAST kinase-like domains, which are essential for its function in mitochondrial metabolism. These domains are integral to the protein's ability to interact with mitochondrial RNA, facilitating its processing and regulation. The structure of FASTKD3 includes specific domains that are crucial for its activity, although detailed information on its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures is not provided in the available context.

Post-translational modifications may influence the activity and localization of FASTKD3, suggesting that these modifications are important for its functional regulation. Additionally, splice variants of FASTKD3 may exist, potentially leading to isoforms with distinct functional properties or localization patterns. These variations could impact the protein's role in mitochondrial processes, although specific details on the nature and effects of these splice variants are not detailed in the context provided. The structural features of FASTKD3, including its domains and potential modifications, underscore its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and RNA processing.

## Function
FASTKD3 is a protein that plays a significant role in mitochondrial RNA biology, particularly in the processing and stability of mitochondrial transcripts. It is essential for the correct processing of mitochondrial mRNAs, including ND2, ND3, CYB, CO2, and ATP8/6, and is necessary for the synthesis of the COXI protein and the proper assembly and activity of complex IV, which are crucial for mitochondrial function and energy production (Barchiesi2019Transcription). FASTKD3 is involved in mitochondrial translation, and its loss leads to an increase in ND3 protein synthesis, suggesting a regulatory role in ND3 mRNA expression (Ohkubo2021The).

FASTKD3 is part of a family of proteins that influence the stability and processing of mitochondrial RNAs. Although its primary function does not appear to be in the cleavage of mitochondrial RNAs, it may have a partially overlapping role with other FASTKD proteins in mtRNA processing (Ohkubo2021The). The protein is active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it is implicated in post-transcriptional regulation, including RNA maturation and translation (Ohkubo2021The). FASTKD3's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of mitochondrial mRNA levels and processing, particularly in the context of its interaction with other FASTK family proteins (Ohkubo2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FASTKD3 gene have been implicated in various cancers and mitochondrial disorders. In cancer, FASTKD3 is frequently amplified, particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and bladder carcinoma, with amplification rates ranging from 8.7% to 12.5%. These amplifications are associated with increased expression levels of FASTKD3, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (MagranerPardo2021Systematic). Specific mutations in FASTKD3, such as the frameshift mutation K143Rfs*36 and missense mutations R207C, R216C, and R590M, have been identified in various cancer types, indicating their potential as cancer drivers (MagranerPardo2021Systematic; Cartalas2022How).

Beyond cancer, alterations in FASTKD3 have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. The gene is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing, and its dysfunction can lead to conditions like adult-onset MELAS-like syndrome, characterized by mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (Cartalas2022How). The loss of FASTKD3 affects the synthesis of mitochondrially encoded proteins, which could contribute to mitochondrial pathologies (Ohkubo2021The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FASTKD3 in both oncogenesis and mitochondrial diseases.

## Interactions
FASTKD3 is involved in mitochondrial RNA processing and regulation, and it participates in various interactions with other proteins and RNA molecules. Although specific physical interactions of FASTKD3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, some studies suggest potential interactions and roles within protein complexes.

FASTKD3 is noted to interact with PTCD1 within a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, which consists of 185 nodes and 278 edges, identifying clusters of highly connected proteins. This interaction is part of a broader network that explores the relationship between FASTK genes and cancer signaling pathways (MagranerPardo2021Systematic).

The stability of FASTKD3 and FASTKD5 proteins may depend on their interaction, as the expression of FASTKD5 decreases in FASTKD3 knockout cells and vice versa. This suggests a potential physical interaction between FASTKD3 and FASTKD5 proteins, although a BioID analysis did not detect a direct interaction, possibly due to cell-type specific effects (Ohkubo2021The).

FASTKD3 is also implicated in the processing of mitochondrial RNA, where its absence results in specific increases in certain precursor RNAs, indicating a role in RNA processing and potential compensatory interactions with other FASTKD proteins (Ohkubo2021The).
