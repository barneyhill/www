# FAM90A15

## Overview
FAM90A15 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, member A15. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by shared sequence motifs and structural features, although the specific functional role of FAM90A15 within this family remains to be fully elucidated. Proteins in this family are often involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and regulation of gene expression, but the precise biological pathways and interactions involving FAM90A15 are still under investigation. The gene's expression and potential involvement in disease pathways are subjects of ongoing research, highlighting its significance in understanding complex genetic networks and their implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
