# FBXL22

## Overview
FBXL22 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 22, a member of the F-box protein family. These proteins are characterized by an F-box motif, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, and leucine-rich repeats that facilitate protein binding. The F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 22 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, by serving as a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is implicated in the regulation of muscle differentiation and cardiac function, as well as in the pathogenesis of certain cancers, such as estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (Blondelle2020The; Haddad2016An). The diverse roles of FBXL22 in different tissues underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in disease contexts.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FBXL22 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of breast cancer, particularly among African American women, FBXL22 has been associated with estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer. This association is linked to rare exonic variants, specifically two nonsynonymous coding SNPs in FBXL22, which were predicted to be damaging. These findings suggest a potential role for FBXL22 in breast cancer development, although the biological mechanisms remain unclear and require further investigation (Haddad2016An).

In cardiac muscle, FBXL22 is crucial for maintaining normal function. Knockdown of FBXL22 in zebrafish leads to the accumulation of α-actinin-2 and reduced cardiac contractility, indicating its importance in cardiac muscle function (Blondelle2020The). Additionally, FBXL22 has been associated with heart failure-related conditions, such as atrial fibrillation and heart rate regulation, through potential enhancer effects identified in genome-wide association studies (Miyazawa2021The).

In skeletal muscle, FBXL22 is involved in muscle differentiation and atrophy. Overexpression of FBXL22 can lead to increased muscle mass, necrosis, and degeneration, affecting protein levels of dystrophin, desmin, vimentin, and α-actinin-2, with these effects being isoform-dependent (Blondelle2020The).
