# TAF11L5

## Overview
TAF11L5 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 5. This protein is part of the TAF family, which plays a crucial role in the transcription initiation process by forming part of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. The TAF11L5 protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating the binding of the TATA-box binding protein to DNA, thereby influencing the transcription of specific genes. As a transcription factor, TAF11L5 is essential for the proper functioning of various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation. Its role in these processes underscores its potential significance in understanding certain genetic disorders and diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
