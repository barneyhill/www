# TMEM35A

## Overview
TMEM35A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 35A, also known as NACHO, which is a critical component in the cellular machinery responsible for the proper assembly and function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which are structurally similar to tetraspanins, and it is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. TMEM35A plays a pivotal role as a chaperone in the folding and assembly of nAChRs, particularly the α7 and α4β2 subtypes, facilitating their trafficking and surface localization in neural cells. The protein's expression is upregulated during neuronal maturation, indicating its importance in neural development and synaptic transmission. Additionally, TMEM35A is involved in various cellular interactions and has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Loring2022Speculation; Huang2016Downregulation; Larsen2019Alpha7).

## Structure
TMEM35A, also known as NACHO, is a small, highly conserved protein residing in the endoplasmic reticulum. It is characterized by four transmembrane domains (TMs), which are predicted to fold similarly to tetraspanins, despite sequence differences. The structure of TMEM35A is highly conserved across species, with variations mainly in the cytoplasmic C-terminal regions. AlphaFold predictions indicate that the protein's structure includes four overlapping TMs across species, with differences primarily in the C-terminal regions (Loring2022Speculation).

TMEM35A plays a crucial role in the expression and assembly of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), such as α4β2 and α6, but not non-nicotinic receptors. Knocking out TMEM35A eliminates α-bungarotoxin binding in the mouse brain, highlighting its essential role in receptor expression (Loring2022Speculation).

The protein's structure and function are integral to its role as a chaperone in the folding and assembly of α7 nAChRs, working synergistically with other proteins like RIC-3 to promote receptor assembly (Loring2022Speculation). The specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of TMEM35A are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
TMEM35A, also known as transmembrane protein 35A, plays a crucial role in the trafficking and surface localization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α7 and hetero-pentameric α4β2 subtypes, in human cells. This protein is essential for the proper functioning of these receptors, which are important for synaptic transmission in neural networks. TMEM35A expression is significantly upregulated during neuronal maturation, indicating its involvement in the development and functional expression of nAChRs in neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) (Larsen2019Alpha7).

TMEM35A is a membrane-spanning protein that may influence ion channel regulation or transporter activity, contributing to cellular homeostasis and communication. It is transiently expressed in the prefrontal cortex of postnatal rats, with protein levels increasing upon α7 receptor activation, suggesting a dynamic role in receptor trafficking and signaling (Larsen2019Alpha7). The protein's expression correlates with the expression of nAChR subunits such as CHRNA7, CHRNA4, and CHRNB2, further supporting its role in receptor trafficking dynamics (Larsen2019Alpha7).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM35A, also known as transmembrane protein 35A, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In the context of cancer, TMEM35A has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its knockdown significantly suppressed cell growth in multiple HCC cell lines, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Huang2012Exome). Additionally, TMEM35A was found to be enriched in normal fibroblasts compared to cancer-associated fibroblasts, indicating its potential involvement in tumor microenvironments (Atanasova2022Mimicking).

In the realm of hematological malignancies, TMEM35 mutations were identified in a subclone of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after induction therapy, highlighting its possible role in the persistence of pre-leukemic clones and treatment resistance (Pettersson2020Subclonal).

Furthermore, TMEM35A expression levels have been studied in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). It was one of the genes with significant expression differences between patients who achieved endoscopic remission and those who did not after vedolizumab therapy, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment response (Verstockt2020Expression). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TMEM35A in various diseases, particularly in cancer and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
TMEM35A, also known as transmembrane protein 35A, is implicated in various cellular interactions, particularly in the context of osteosarcoma (OSA) cells. The STRING database analysis suggests that TMEM35A may interact with several proteins, including neuropeptide Y (NPY), nerve growth factor (NGF), NGF receptor (NGFR), brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and calcitonin-related polypeptide β (CALCB) (Huang2016Downregulation). These interactions indicate a potential role for TMEM35A in cell differentiation and survival, possibly through pathways involving these neuropeptides and growth factors.

The study by Huang et al. highlights that TMEM35A is part of the tetraspanin family, which are known to be involved in cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. This suggests that TMEM35A may influence cell signal transduction pathways related to tumor cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, and invasion (Huang2016Downregulation). The involvement of TMEM35A in these processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in OSA, given its role in critical cellular functions and interactions. However, specific details of these interactions, such as whether they are direct or part of larger multiprotein complexes, are not fully elucidated in the available data.
