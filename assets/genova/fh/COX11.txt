# COX11

## Overview
The COX11 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase copper chaperone COX11, a protein integral to the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein is essential for the proper assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), also known as complex IV, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. COX11 facilitates the formation of the Cu B site in the Cox1 subunit of CcO, a process vital for the enzyme's role in reducing oxygen to water and generating a proton gradient necessary for ATP synthesis. Structurally, COX11 is characterized by a homodimeric arrangement with a binuclear copper cluster, and it interacts with other proteins involved in copper metabolism and CcO assembly, such as COX17 and SCO1. Mutations in the COX11 gene can lead to mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Banci2004Solution; CaronGodon2023Novel; Carr2005Functional).

## Structure
The COX11 protein is characterized by a three-dimensional structure that forms a homodimeric arrangement with an antiparallel β-strand fold. This structure includes a binuclear copper cluster at the dimer interface, which is crucial for its function. The N-terminal transmembrane helices anchor the dimer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, positioning the copper ions towards the membrane to facilitate copper transfer (CaronGodon2023Novel). The soluble domain of COX11 is composed entirely of β-strands, forming a nearly cylindrical β-barrel stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions involving aromatic and aliphatic residues (Banci2004Solution). The copper-binding region, containing Cys-100 and Cys-102, is highly disordered and located between two short β-strands. The copper-binding motif CFCF is located in a hydrophobic region, with a conserved Lys-97 nearby to balance the charge during copper binding (Banci2004Solution). The protein's structure is similar to immunoglobulin-like domains but has unique features, such as an additional β-strand at the N-terminus, classifying it as a new class of Ig-related domain (Banci2004Solution). The structural features of COX11, including its ability to form a binuclear copper(I) cluster, suggest its function in Cu B site formation and copper delivery (Banci2004Solution).

## Function
The COX11 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), also known as complex IV, in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is essential for the formation of the Cu B site in the Cox1 subunit of CcO, which is critical for the enzyme's function in reducing oxygen to water and generating a proton gradient for ATP synthesis (Nývltová2022Coordination; Carr2005Functional). COX11 is anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane, with its C-terminal domain exposed in the intermembrane space, where it binds a single Cu(I) ion. This copper-binding activity is vital for the proper assembly and function of CcO (Banci2004Solution; Carr2005Functional).

In human cells, COX11 interacts with other proteins such as COX19 and PET191, forming complexes that are important for the stabilization and maturation of CcO subunits COX1 and COX2 (Nývltová2022Coordination). The protein's function is regulated by its interaction with these proteins, which help maintain its conformation suitable for copper coordination (Nývltová2022Coordination). The absence or mutation of COX11 can lead to impaired CcO assembly, resulting in reduced respiratory capacity and potential mitochondrial disorders (CaronGodon2023Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COX11 gene are associated with mitochondrial disorders, which can manifest in a variety of clinical symptoms. These disorders often present with neurological symptoms, such as hypotonia, global developmental delay, cerebellar signs, and movement disorders. In some cases, patients may develop spastic-dyskinetic tetra-paresis, dystonias, and sleep disturbances. Brain MRI findings in affected individuals typically show progressive neurodegeneration with specific lesions in the white matter and other brain regions, along with increased lactate peaks in the cerebellum and lenticular nuclei, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction (CaronGodon2023Novel).

Novel mutations in COX11, such as c.739C>A (p.P247T) and c.766dupA (p.T256Nfs*8), have been identified and are associated with mitochondrial disorders. These mutations can lead to partial dysfunction of mitochondrial complex IV and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, contributing to the clinical symptoms observed in patients (CaronGodon2023Novel). The COX11 gene is also implicated in conditions with Leigh-like features, where mutations can result in a complete loss of cytochrome c oxidase function, degradation of COX subunits, and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (CaronGodon2023Novel).

## Interactions
COX11, a protein integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane, plays a crucial role in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase by facilitating copper insertion into the enzyme complex. It interacts with several proteins involved in copper metabolism and cytochrome c oxidase assembly. COX11 interacts with COX17 and SCO1, forming part of a copper transfer pathway where COX17 transfers copper to COX11 and SCO1, which then insert these atoms into subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (Banting2006Mutational).

COX11 also interacts with Cox19 in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. This interaction is redox-regulated, with the redox state of glutathione influencing the binding affinity. Reduced glutathione impairs the interaction, while oxidized glutathione enhances it. This interaction does not require copper, as the presence of copper sulfate or a copper chelator does not affect the binding (Bode2015Redoxregulated).

Additionally, COX11 may associate with yeast mitochondrial ribosomes, potentially facilitating the formation of the Cu B site during the translation and membrane insertion of Cox1p. This association might be weak or indirect, possibly mediated by other components like Oxa1p (Khalimonchuk2005Evidence).
