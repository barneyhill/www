# DUSP11

## Overview
DUSP11, or dual specificity phosphatase 11, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the atypical dual specificity phosphatase family. The protein, also named dual specificity phosphatase 11, is characterized by its ability to dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine residues, although it primarily functions as an RNA triphosphatase. This enzyme plays a critical role in RNA metabolism by converting 5'-triphosphate RNAs into 5'-monophosphates, thereby modulating RNA stability and immunogenicity. DUSP11 is involved in the regulation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) pathway and is essential for the proper loading of miRNA precursors into Argonaute proteins, influencing noncoding RNA stability and function (Choi2020DUSP11mediated; Burke2016DUSP11). The protein's activity is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and immune response regulation (Choi2021DUSP11). DUSP11's interactions with both viral and cellular RNAs highlight its significance in antiviral defense and its potential implications in cancer and immune-related diseases (Xu2021DualSpecificity; Kincaid2018RNA).

## Structure
DUSP11, also known as dual specificity phosphatase 11, is characterized by a canonical protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) catalytic domain fold, which is typical of the dual-specificity phosphatase family. The catalytic domain of DUSP11 includes a wide active-site surface, which is consistent with its activity towards RNA 5'-triphosphates and diphosphates, accommodating bulky sugar moieties (Jeong2014The). Structurally, DUSP11 exists as a monomer in solution, as confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography (Jeong2014The).

The protein's active site contains a phosphate and a chloride ion, bound to the P-loop and an adjacent pocket, which is slightly dislocated compared to other DUSPs like DUSP8 (Jeong2014The). DUSP11's structure is similar to baculovirus RNA 5'-phosphatase, indicating evolutionary and functional relationships (Jeong2014The). The N-terminus of DUSP11 features an extended loop structure with a short α-helix, differing from other DUSPs, and lacks the typical Asp residue in the D-loop, aligning with its RNA dephosphorylation activity (Jeong2014The).

DUSP11 is an atypical DUSP, lacking the CH2 domain common to typical DUSPs, and contains two arginine-rich regions and a proline-rich region, suggesting a role in RNA binding and mRNA maturation (Patterson2009Dualspecificity). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and stability.

## Function
DUSP11, or dual specificity phosphatase 11, is an RNA triphosphatase that plays a crucial role in modulating RNA metabolism in human cells. It primarily acts by dephosphorylating 5'-triphosphate RNAs, converting them into 5'-monophosphates. This activity is essential for regulating the immunogenicity of RNA molecules, as 5'-triphosphate RNAs can activate the RIG-I signaling pathway, a key component of the antiviral immune response (Choi2020DUSP11mediated). By controlling the phosphorylation status of these RNAs, DUSP11 helps maintain immune homeostasis, preventing unnecessary activation of type I interferon responses, which could lead to autoinflammatory disorders (Choi2020DUSP11mediated).

DUSP11 is also involved in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) pathway by facilitating the loading of miRNA precursors into Argonaute proteins. This process is crucial for the regulation and stability of noncoding RNAs, including viral microRNAs and RNAP III-transcribed RNAs (Burke2016DUSP11). The enzyme's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it influences RNA processing and stability, contributing to cellular homeostasis and the regulation of immune responses (Choi2021DUSP11).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DUSP11 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and immune responses. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), DUSP11 is identified as a functional target of miR-513b-5p, with its expression being higher in NSCLC tissues compared to controls. The tumor-suppressive function of miR-513b-5p is partly dependent on its ability to regulate DUSP11, and overexpression of DUSP11 can partially reverse the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-513b-5p in NSCLC cells. This suggests that DUSP11 plays a role in promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the miR-513b-5p/DUSP11 axis (AZIN1AS1; p&gt; Cai2020&lt).

In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), high DUSP11 expression is significantly associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis, making it an independent biomarker for poor prognosis. Patients with high DUSP11 expression have a higher risk of poor outcomes, indicating its potential role in tumor progression (Xu2021DualSpecificity).

DUSP11 also plays a role in immune responses, where its deficiency leads to enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TAK1 phosphorylation and cytokine production, increasing susceptibility to LPS-induced endotoxic shock (Yang2020DUSP11).

## Interactions
DUSP11, a dual specificity phosphatase, interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing. It exhibits RNA triphosphatase activity, converting 5' triphosphate RNA ends into 5' monophosphate ends. This activity is crucial for the stable incorporation of miRNAs into Argonaute (AGO) proteins, which are key components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Burke2016DUSP11). DUSP11's interaction with AGO proteins facilitates the loading of miRNAs, enhancing their silencing activity (Burke2016DUSP11).

DUSP11 also interacts with viral and cellular RNAs, influencing their stability and function. It dephosphorylates triphosphorylated transcripts, promoting AGO association with noncanonical viral miRNAs (Burke2016DUSP11). In the context of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, DUSP11 collaborates with exonucleases XRN1 and XRN2 to convert 5' triphosphate RNA into 5' monophosphate RNA, making it susceptible to degradation and thereby restricting HCV replication (Kincaid2018RNA).

DUSP11's activity also affects the immune response by modulating the phosphorylation state of RNAs, influencing their recognition by the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I, which is involved in antiviral defense (Choi2020DUSP11mediated). These interactions highlight DUSP11's role in regulating RNA stability and immune responses.
