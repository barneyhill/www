# EPHX2

## Overview
The EPHX2 gene encodes the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a crucial component in the metabolism of lipid epoxides. This enzyme is categorized as an α/β hydrolase and is involved in the conversion of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) into less active dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), thereby modulating their biological effects, including anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory properties (Gautheron2020The; Koerner2006Polymorphisms). The EPHX2 gene is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in the kidney, liver, and intestine, and the protein primarily resides in the cytoplasm as a homodimer (Gautheron2020The). The enzyme's activity is significant in regulating physiological processes such as blood pressure and inflammation, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing the beneficial effects of EETs (Gautheron2020The). Variations in the EPHX2 gene have been linked to cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, underscoring its clinical relevance (Ma2020Association; Lee2006Genetic).

## Structure
The EPHX2 gene encodes the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) protein, which is a homodimeric enzyme composed of 554 amino acids (Decker2009Mammalian). The primary structure of sEH includes a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure is characterized by the α/β hydrolase fold, which consists of eight central beta-strands flanked by alpha-helices, forming a core fold (Decker2009Mammalian). 

The tertiary structure of sEH involves two distinct catalytic domains: an N-terminal phosphatase domain and a C-terminal epoxide hydrolase domain, separated by a proline-rich linker (Decker2009Mammalian). The C-terminal domain functions as an α/β hydrolase fold epoxide hydrolase, with a catalytic triad composed of Asp333, Asp495, and His523, and two tyrosines, Tyr382 and Tyr465 (Decker2009Mammalian). The N-terminal domain belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily and displays phosphatase activity (Decker2009Mammalian).

The quaternary structure of sEH is a domain-swapped architecture, where the N-terminal domain of one subunit interacts with the C-terminal domain of the other (Decker2009Mammalian). Two ovary-specific alternative transcripts, EPHX2B and EPHX2C, have been identified, which result in proteins lacking essential catalytic components of the N-terminal phosphatase domain while retaining the epoxide hydrolase domain (Decker2009Mammalian).

## Function
The EPHX2 gene encodes the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of epoxides derived from fatty acids. This enzyme is primarily involved in the conversion of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) into dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), a process that reduces the anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory properties of EETs (Gautheron2020The; Koerner2006Polymorphisms). sEH is widely expressed in human tissues, with the highest levels found in the kidney, liver, and intestine, and is primarily located in the cytoplasm where it forms homodimers (Gautheron2020The).

The enzyme's activity is significant in regulating blood pressure, inflammation, and metabolic disorders. By converting EETs, which are potent vasodilators, sEH influences vascular homeostasis and blood pressure regulation (Gautheron2020The). EPHX2 is also involved in the metabolism of epoxides from linoleic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, impacting various physiological processes across multiple organ systems, including the heart, kidney, liver, and brain (Gautheron2020The). The enzyme's broad expression and substrate specificity make it a potential therapeutic target, with inhibitors developed to enhance the anti-inflammatory properties of EETs (Gautheron2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the EPHX2 gene have been associated with several cardiovascular and metabolic conditions. In Caucasians, the K55R polymorphism in the EPHX2 gene is linked to an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), with carriers of the variant allele exhibiting higher soluble epoxide hydrolase activity, which may affect endothelial function and contribute to CHD risk (Lee2006Genetic). The R287Q variant is associated with lower enzyme activity and has been linked to a reduced risk of primary hypertension in a Chinese population (Ma2020Association). 

EPHX2 variations also play a role in heart failure susceptibility. In a rat model, Ephx2 was identified as a heart failure susceptibility gene, with increased expression and enzyme activity leading to rapid hydrolysis of cardioprotective epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (Monti2008Soluble). 

Additionally, EPHX2 gene variants have been implicated in anorexia nervosa, with studies suggesting a potential link between these variants and the condition, possibly due to their influence on cholesterol metabolism (ScottVan2013Evidence). These findings highlight the clinical significance of EPHX2 in various diseases.
