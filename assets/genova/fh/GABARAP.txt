# GABARAP

## Overview
GABARAP (GABA type A receptor-associated protein) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the Atg8 family involved in autophagy and intracellular trafficking. The GABARAP protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold and plays a crucial role in the trafficking and stabilization of GABA A receptors, which are essential for synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP; Ye2021Structural). Additionally, GABARAP is integral to autophagosome formation, contributing to cellular homeostasis by facilitating the degradation and recycling of cellular components (Jatana2019Human). The protein's interactions with various partners, including the γ2 subunit of GABA A receptors and autophagy-related proteins, underscore its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular and synaptic integrity (Bozic2020A; Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). GABARAP's clinical significance is highlighted by its involvement in cancer and neurological conditions, where alterations in its expression or function can impact disease progression (Komoike2010A; Klebig2005Characterization).

## Structure
GABARAP (GABA type A receptor-associated protein) is a member of the Atg8 family, characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold with a central β-sheet core and α-helices (Jatana2019Human). The primary structure of GABARAP consists of a sequence of amino acids that form this ubiquitin-like domain, which is crucial for its function in autophagy and intracellular trafficking (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). 

The secondary structure of GABARAP includes two N-terminal α-helices and a ubiquitin-like core, which are typical features of Atg8 ortholog proteins (Ye2021Structural). The tertiary structure of GABARAP forms a compact, globular shape, allowing it to interact with various proteins and participate in cellular processes such as autophagosome formation and receptor trafficking (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP).

GABARAP's quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as the γ2 subunit of GABA A receptors, which is essential for synaptic localization and trafficking (Ye2021Structural). Post-translational modifications, including lipidation, are critical for GABARAP's membrane association and function in autophagy (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). The protein may also have splice variant isoforms that influence its functional roles (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP).

## Function
GABARAP (GABA type A receptor-associated protein) plays a significant role in intracellular trafficking and autophagy in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the trafficking and stabilization of GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs) on cell membranes, which is crucial for proper synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. GABARAP interacts with the γ2 subunit of GABA A Rs, facilitating their transport to the plasma membrane and enhancing GABAergic synaptic transmission (Ye2021Structural). This interaction is modulated by the phosphorylation of the γ2 subunit, which can affect receptor localization and function (Ye2021Structural).

GABARAP is also a member of the Atg8 family of proteins and is involved in autophagosome formation, a critical process for cellular homeostasis. It contributes to the degradation and recycling of cellular components by facilitating the formation and sealing of autophagosomes (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP; Jatana2019Human). GABARAP's role in autophagy is further supported by its involvement in the conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine, which is essential for autophagosome function (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). These functions highlight GABARAP's importance in maintaining cellular and synaptic integrity.

## Clinical Significance
The GABARAP gene has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, GABARAP is significantly down-regulated, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This down-regulation is not due to mutations or large deletions but may be linked to epigenetic changes, such as methylation, which affect its expression (Klebig2005Characterization). Overexpression of GABARAP in breast cancer cell lines has been shown to reduce growth rates and tumorigenicity, indicating its potential in cancer progression control (Klebig2005Characterization).

GABARAP is also associated with neurological conditions. A study using zebrafish models demonstrated that knockdown of GABARAP led to developmental defects, suggesting its importance in brain development. Although no direct mutations in GABARAP were found in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, its dysfunction may contribute to conditions like 17p13.1 microdeletion syndrome, which includes symptoms such as developmental delay and epilepsy (Komoike2010A).

In cancer, GABARAP's role extends to its involvement in autophagy and intracellular trafficking, impacting the degradation of oncogenic proteins and dysfunctional organelles. This function is crucial in regulating cancer cell growth and survival (Jacquet2020The).

## Interactions
GABARAP (GABA type A receptor-associated protein) is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in autophagy and intracellular trafficking. It interacts with the γ2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABAAR), facilitating its transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. GABARAP also associates with kinesin family members KIF-5A and KIF21B, which regulate GABAAR surface expression (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP).

In the context of autophagy, GABARAP interacts with ULK1, a kinase involved in phagophore formation, and plays a role in recruiting ULK1 and beclin-1 to the site of nucleation (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). It also interacts with ATG2A, a protein essential for phagophore formation and closure, highlighting the importance of the ATG2A-GABARAP interaction in autophagy flux (Bozic2020A).

GABARAP is involved in selective autophagy through interactions with various adaptor proteins, such as SQSTM1, NBR1, and NDP52/CALCOCO2, which facilitate the targeting and degradation of specific cellular components (Schaaf2016LC3GABARAP). It also interacts with MAPK15, which stimulates autophagy by binding to GABARAP through a conserved LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif (Colecchia2012MAPK15ERK8). These interactions underscore GABARAP's multifaceted role in cellular processes.
