# TRPM6

## Overview
The TRPM6 gene encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 6, a protein that functions as a magnesium (Mg2+)-permeable ion channel. This protein is a member of the TRPM subfamily of ion channels, characterized by its six transmembrane domains and a unique α-kinase domain, which plays a regulatory role in channel activity (van2009Epithelial; Topala2007Molecular). TRPM6 is primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney, where it is essential for the absorption and reabsorption of magnesium, respectively, thus maintaining systemic magnesium homeostasis (Schlingmann2007TRPM6; Schlingmann2002Hypomagnesemia). The protein can form heteromeric complexes with TRPM7, another TRPM family member, which modulates its electrophysiological properties and sensitivity to Mg2+ (Ferioli2017TRPM6). Mutations in TRPM6 are associated with hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), highlighting its critical role in magnesium balance and broader implications in conditions such as type 2 diabetes and blood pressure regulation (Chubanov2018Role; Schlingmann2002Hypomagnesemia).

## Structure
The TRPM6 protein is a member of the TRPM subfamily of ion channels, characterized by six transmembrane domains and a pore-forming loop between the fifth and sixth segments (van2009Epithelial; Topala2007Molecular). The protein is composed of 2022 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 234 kDa (Topala2007Molecular). It features large intracellular amino (N) and carboxyl (C) termini, with the C-terminus containing a unique α-kinase domain, which plays an indirect regulatory role in channel activity (van2009Epithelial). This domain interacts with proteins such as RACK1, influencing TRPM6 channel activity through autophosphorylation (van2009Epithelial).

The pore region of TRPM6, specifically the amino acid stretch 1028 GEIDVC 1033, is critical for its permeability properties and sensitivity to channel blockers like ruthenium red (Topala2007Molecular). Mutations in this region, such as E1029A and I1030M, affect the channel's conductance and sensitivity to blockers (Topala2007Molecular). TRPM6 can form functional homotetramers or heterotetramers, often assembling with TRPM7 to form channel complexes (van2009Epithelial; Topala2007Molecular). The protein's structure is more complex than other TRP channels, with a pore diameter estimated to be larger than that of TRPV6 (Topala2007Molecular).

## Function
The TRPM6 gene encodes a protein that functions as a magnesium (Mg2+)-permeable ion channel, playing a critical role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis in the body. This protein is primarily expressed in the epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney, where it facilitates the active transcellular transport of magnesium. In the intestine, TRPM6 is involved in the absorption of dietary magnesium, while in the kidney, it is crucial for the reabsorption of magnesium in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (Schlingmann2007TRPM6; Schlingmann2002Hypomagnesemia).

TRPM6 forms part of heteromeric channels with TRPM7, another member of the TRPM family, and these channels are activated when cytosolic levels of Mg2+ and Mg•ATP are reduced (Ferioli2017TRPM6). The protein's function is essential for maintaining systemic magnesium balance, which is vital for numerous physiological processes, including enzyme activity, DNA synthesis, and neuromuscular transmission (Topala2007Molecular).

Mutations in TRPM6 can lead to hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), a condition characterized by low serum magnesium levels, which underscores the protein's importance in magnesium homeostasis (Topala2007Molecular; Schlingmann2002Hypomagnesemia).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRPM6 gene are linked to hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by low serum magnesium and calcium levels, leading to symptoms such as seizures and muscle spasms, primarily in infancy. The disorder results from loss-of-function mutations in TRPM6, which impair magnesium absorption in the intestines and kidneys (Lainez2013New; Walder2002Mutation; Schlingmann2002Hypomagnesemia). Identified mutations include missense mutations, splice-site mutations, and premature stop codons, all of which disrupt the normal function of the TRPM6 protein (Chubanov2018Role; Lainez2013New).

Alterations in TRPM6 expression are also associated with other clinical conditions. For instance, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TRPM6 have been linked to increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes mellitus, particularly in individuals with low magnesium intake (Chubanov2018Role). Additionally, TRPM6 expression changes have been implicated in blood pressure regulation, with downregulation associated with hypotension and upregulation linked to hypertension (Funato2021Importance). These findings underscore the critical role of TRPM6 in maintaining magnesium homeostasis and its broader implications in human health.

## Interactions
TRPM6 interacts with TRPM7 to form heteromeric channel complexes that are crucial for magnesium homeostasis. These complexes exhibit distinct electrophysiological properties compared to TRPM7 homomers, with TRPM6 modulating the Mg2+ sensitivity of TRPM7, allowing the channel to function under physiological conditions (Schlingmann2007TRPM6; Ferioli2017TRPM6). TRPM6 also reduces the sensitivity of TRPM7 to Mg•ATP, enabling constitutive activity of the TRPM6/7 channels (Ferioli2017TRPM6; Vydra2023Interaction).

TRPM6 interacts with calmodulin (CaM) and S100A1, two calcium-binding proteins, through its N-terminal region. These interactions are calcium-dependent and involve specific amino acids that form salt bridges with the acidic residues of CaM or S100A1 (Zouharova2019TRPM6). The binding affinity of TRPM6 to CaM and S100A1 is in the micromolar range, and these interactions are facilitated by hydrophobic motifs and basic residues in the TRPM6 N-terminus (Zouharova2019TRPM6; Vydra2023Interaction). These interactions suggest a role for TRPM6 in modulating cellular signaling pathways through its association with these calcium-binding proteins (Zouharova2019TRPM6).
