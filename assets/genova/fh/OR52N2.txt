# OR52N2

## Overview
The OR52N2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily N member 2, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is crucial for their role in signal transduction and sensory perception, particularly in the detection of odorant molecules (Castellani2014Copy). The OR52N2 protein is primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the diversity of olfactory signals by binding specific odorants and initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell (Meidert2021Extracellular). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR52N2 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neuroinvasive diseases, highlighting its potential significance in both sensory biology and disease pathogenesis (Lv2021Integrated; Yin2021Potential).

## Structure
The OR52N2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction (Castellani2014Copy). The seven-transmembrane domains allow the receptor to traverse the cell membrane multiple times, facilitating the recognition and transduction of odorant signals through G protein-mediated pathways. 

While specific details on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of OR52N2 are not provided in the context, it is known that GPCRs, including olfactory receptors, typically undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. These modifications can influence the receptor's function and localization within the cell. Olfactory receptors generally do not form quaternary structures, as they function as monomeric units (Castellani2014Copy).

The OR52N2 gene has been implicated in various studies, highlighting its potential role in conditions such as schizophrenia, where a unique copy number variation (CNV) overlapping this gene was identified in affected individuals (Castellani2014Copy). However, specific splice variant isoforms of OR52N2 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
OR52N2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR52N2 is active in the olfactory epithelium, contributing to the diversity of odor detection by binding specific odorant molecules and triggering neuronal responses that are interpreted as distinct smells (Meidert2021Extracellular).

In the context of COVID-19, miRNAs such as miR-338-5p have been shown to inhibit the expression of OR52N2, which may help explain the anosmia (loss of smell) often observed in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This suggests that OR52N2, located in the nasal mucosa, might also serve as an entry point for the virus, contributing to its neuroinvasiveness (Meidert2021Extracellular). However, the primary function of OR52N2 in healthy human cells remains focused on its role in olfactory transduction, where it plays a crucial part in the sensory perception of smell (Meidert2021Extracellular).

## Clinical Significance
The OR52N2 gene has been implicated in several types of cancer through alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In oral cavity cancer (OCC), OR52N2 is one of the genes significantly associated with the disease, identified through integrated analyses of GWAS summary statistics and eQTL data (Lv2021Integrated). In the context of breast cancer, OR52N2 is noted for being completely hypomethylated at the promoter site, which may suggest a role in cancer-related pathways, although specific diseases or conditions related to its mutations are not detailed (Fessahaye2021Breast). 

In invasive growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas (GH-PAs), OR52N2 is up-regulated and located on chromosome 11p15, with its expression levels validated through RT-qPCR, indicating a potential role in the invasiveness of these tumors (Yin2021Potential). Additionally, OR52N2 is mentioned in the context of metastatic medulloblastoma, although specific conditions related to its mutations are not provided (Ferrucci2018Metastatic). Despite these associations, the clinical significance of OR52N2 mutations or expression changes remains underexplored, and further research is needed to elucidate its role in disease pathogenesis.
