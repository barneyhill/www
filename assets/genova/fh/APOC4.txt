# APOC4

## Overview
The APOC4 gene encodes apolipoprotein C4, a protein that is part of the apolipoprotein family, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism. Apolipoprotein C4 is categorized as a lipid-binding protein and is primarily associated with very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (Jong1999Role; BolanosGarcia2003On). Located on chromosome 19, APOC4 is part of a gene cluster that includes other apolipoproteins such as APOE, APOC1, and APOC2, all of which are involved in lipid transport and metabolism. Although the precise function of apolipoprotein C4 in human lipid metabolism remains unclear, its evolutionary conservation suggests a potential role in this process (Allan1996Expression). Notably, APOC4 is not typically detected in normal adult human plasma, indicating it may not have a significant role under normal physiological conditions (Jong1999Role; Allan1996Expression). However, its overexpression in transgenic mice has been linked to hypertriglyceridemia, suggesting a possible inhibitory effect on lipolysis (Jong1999Role; Allan1996Expression).

## Structure


## Function
The APOC4 gene encodes apolipoprotein C-IV, a member of the apolipoprotein family involved in lipid metabolism. APOC4 is part of a gene cluster on chromosome 19, which includes other apolipoproteins such as APOE, APOC1, and APOC2. These genes play roles in lipid transport and metabolism, with APOC4 specifically associated with very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (Jong1999Role; BolanosGarcia2003On).

In transgenic mice, overexpression of human APOC4 leads to hypertriglyceridemia, suggesting that APOC4 may interfere with the clearance of VLDL triglycerides, potentially through an inhibitory effect on lipolysis (Jong1999Role; Allan1996Expression). However, APOC4 is not detected in normal adult human plasma, indicating it may not play a significant role in human lipoprotein metabolism under normal conditions (Jong1999Role; Allan1996Expression).

The gene's evolutionary conservation and sequence homology with other apolipoproteins imply a potential function in lipid metabolism, although its precise role in healthy human cells remains unclear (Allan1996Expression). The low expression of APOC4 in the human liver and its absence in plasma suggest it does not have a major role in human lipid metabolism (Jong1999Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APOC4 gene have been associated with various lipid-related conditions and diseases. The rs5167 T > G missense SNP in exon 3 of the APOC4 gene, which results in a leucine to arginine substitution at position 96, is linked to higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) (KenDror2010APOEC1C4C2). This SNP may influence the function of apolipoprotein C4 by altering its affinity for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) versus HDL particles, although its precise role in lipoprotein metabolism remains unclear (KenDror2010APOEC1C4C2).

In the context of coronary heart disease (CHD), certain SNPs in the APOC4 gene cluster have been associated with lipid traits that influence CHD risk. For instance, haplotypes in APOC4 are associated with modest effects on HDL-C and apoAI levels, which may contribute to CHD risk (KenDror2010APOEC1C4C2). Additionally, the rs1132899 polymorphism in APOC4 is linked to an increased risk of premature coronary artery disease, particularly in the Chinese population, with a more pronounced effect in males (Wang2019Diagnostic).

APOC4 expression levels have also been implicated in the prognosis of hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High expression of APOC4 is associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival in HCC patients (Wang2019Diagnostic).
