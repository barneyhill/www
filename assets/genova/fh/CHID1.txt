# CHID1

## Overview
The CHID1 gene encodes the protein chitinase domain containing 1, which is a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 (GH18). Unlike typical chitinases, this protein lacks enzymatic activity due to a substitution in its catalytic motif, but it retains a chitinase-like domain that facilitates carbohydrate binding. The protein is characterized by a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel structure, a common feature among GH18 family proteins. CHID1 is involved in various biological processes, including immune responses and tissue remodeling, and is secreted via the lysosomal pathway. It plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation and is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease, where its expression is altered. The protein's interactions with stabilin-1 and its involvement in the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway highlight its importance in both immune and neuroimmune functions (Funkhouser2007Chitinase; Kumar2019Human; Castrogiovanni2021Brain).

## Structure
The CHID1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 (GH18), characterized by a chitinase-like domain. This domain is crucial for its function in carbohydrate binding, although CHID1 lacks enzymatic activity due to a substitution in the catalytic motif (Funkhouser2007Chitinase; Kumar2019Human). The protein features a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel structure, a common fold in GH18 family proteins, consisting of a (β/α)8-barrel structure (Di2016Chitinases; Funkhouser2007Chitinase).

CHID1 is known to interact with stabilin-1, an endocytic/sorting receptor in macrophages, and is involved in immune responses and tissue remodeling (Li2019CHID1; Huang2011The). The protein is secreted via the lysosomal pathway and can be up-regulated by the Th2 cytokine IL-4 or dexamethasone in alternatively activated macrophages (Huang2011The).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CHID1 are not provided, the presence of the Glyco_18 domain suggests lectin properties, even in the absence of enzymatic activity (Kzhyshkowska2007Human). The protein's role in the RLR antiviral signaling pathway highlights its regulatory function in inflammation (Li2019CHID1).

## Function
The CHID1 gene encodes a chitinase-like protein that, unlike typical chitinases, lacks chitin-hydrolyzing activity. Instead, it exhibits cytokine-like and growth factor-like properties, playing a role in various biological processes across different cell types, including polarized macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts (Castrogiovanni2021Brain). CHID1 is involved in tissue remodeling during inflammation and contributes to the differentiation and maturation of macrophages (Castrogiovanni2021Brain). It is a marker for alternative macrophage activation and is secreted through interaction with the endocytic/sorting receptor stabilin-1, activated by Th2 cytokines (Castrogiovanni2021Brain).

In the brain, CHID1 expression is abundant in the nucleoplasm of microglia during neurodegenerative processes, suggesting a role in microglial activation (Castrogiovanni2021Brain). It is hypothesized to be linked to the cytoskeleton, potentially playing a role in dendritic spine maintenance and cytoskeletal rearrangements (Castrogiovanni2021Brain). CHID1's correlation with neurogranin (NRGN) and calbindin 1 (CALB1) suggests a common role in maintaining neuronal structure and calcium homeostasis, which is crucial for preventing neuronal death (Castrogiovanni2021Brain).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CHID1 gene have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD patients, CHID1 expression is significantly downregulated compared to non-demented healthy control (NDHC) subjects, suggesting its potential role in the disease's progression (Castrogiovanni2021Brain). The gene's expression is positively correlated with markers of microglial activation, such as IBA1, indicating a possible involvement in neuroimmune activation processes associated with AD (Castrogiovanni2021Brain).

CHID1 expression levels also show significant regional differences in the brain, with lower levels observed in AD patients across most regions except the diencephalon and cingulate regions (Castrogiovanni2021Brain). The gene's expression is inversely correlated with age in NDHC subjects, but this correlation is not significant in AD patients, highlighting its complex relationship with aging and neurodegeneration (Castrogiovanni2021Brain).

The study suggests that CHID1 could serve as a biomarker for distinguishing AD patients from healthy individuals, as indicated by its fair diagnostic ability in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses (Castrogiovanni2021Brain). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CHID1 in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
CHID1, a chitinase domain-containing protein, is involved in several interactions within the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. It interacts specifically with RIG-I and VISA, enhancing the activation of the IFN-β promoter, ISRE, and NF-κB, which are mediated by these proteins. This interaction is crucial for promoting IRF3 dimerization and the polyubiquitination of RIG-I and VISA, which are key steps in antiviral signaling. CHID1 enhances linear and K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I and VISA while reducing K48-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, thereby regulating the stability and activity of these proteins in the antiviral response (Li2019CHID1).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, CHID1 is associated with stabilin-1, an endocytic/sorting receptor, which mediates its secretion. This interaction suggests a role in neuroimmune activation and possibly in the alteration of the blood-brain barrier and neuronal transmission (Castrogiovanni2021Brain). CHID1 is also expressed in macrophages within tumor stroma and nests, indicating its involvement in tumor microenvironments, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Kovaleva2021CHID1).
