# OR10R2

## Overview
The OR10R2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily R member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction pathways. These receptors are integral to the sense of smell, as they are expressed in the olfactory epithelium and bind specific odorants, contributing to the vast diversity of olfactory perception. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR10R2 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues such as the skin and thymus, where it may participate in various cellular processes, including epidermal homeostasis and immune function (Uehara2021Non‐invasive; Lee2005Effects).

## Function
OR10R2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR10R2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection. In addition to its role in olfaction, OR10R2 is expressed in other tissues, including the skin, where it may be involved in various cellular processes such as epidermal/keratinocyte proliferation, migration, regeneration, and cytokine production (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The downregulation of OR10R2 and other olfactory receptor genes in individuals with sensitive skin suggests a potential link to disturbances in epidermal homeostasis, although it is unclear whether this is a cause or consequence of sensitive skin (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). Additionally, OR10R2 has been identified in the thymus, indicating a novel or previously unrecognized role in this tissue, although its specific function in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Lee2005Effects).
