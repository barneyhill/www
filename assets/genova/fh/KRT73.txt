# KRT73

## Overview
KRT73 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 73, a type II keratin, which is integral to the structural integrity and function of hair follicles. Keratin 73 is specifically expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) cuticle of hair follicles, where it plays a critical role in the differentiation and function of IRS cuticle cells. This protein is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments by forming heterodimers with type I keratins, contributing to the cellular framework essential for hair and epithelial tissue integrity (Ho2022Update; Liu2015Proteomic). The expression of KRT73 is crucial for the proper development and maintenance of hair follicles, as evidenced by its upregulation in certain conditions and its downregulation in specific genetic models, highlighting its importance in keratinocyte differentiation and hair structure resilience (Nicu2019922; Huang2024Integration).

## Function
KRT73 encodes a type II keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of hair follicles. It is specifically expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) cuticle of hair follicles, where it contributes to the proper differentiation and function of IRS cuticle cells. The expression of KRT73 begins in the lowermost bulb region of the hair follicle and continues until the terminal differentiation region of IRS cuticle cells, indicating its involvement in the differentiation process of these cells (Liu2015Proteomic).

In studies involving Angora rabbits, KRT73 was found to be upregulated at both transcriptomic and proteomic levels, suggesting its role in keratinocyte differentiation, which is essential for hair and wool fiber development (Huang2024Integration). The protein's involvement in keratinocyte differentiation highlights its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of hair, contributing to hair formation and maintenance. Although specific functions of KRT73 in healthy human cells are not directly addressed, its role in hair follicle biology and keratinocyte differentiation suggests it is vital for hair structure and resilience (Nicu2019922; Ho2022Update).

## Interactions
KRT73, or keratin 73, is a type II keratin protein that participates in various interactions crucial for its function in hair and epithelial cell integrity. It is known to form heterodimers with type I keratins, which are essential for the assembly of intermediate filaments. These filaments contribute to the structural framework of cells, particularly in hair follicles and epithelial tissues (Ho2022Update).

In the context of hair follicle development, KRT73 has been identified as a key component in the inner root sheath (IRS) cuticle of hair follicles. Its expression is significantly downregulated in homozygous iRhom2 Uncv mice, indicating its role in the proper differentiation and development of hair follicles (Liu2015Proteomic). This suggests that KRT73 may interact with other proteins involved in the IRS cuticle formation and maintenance.

KRT73 is also implicated in the response to dithranol treatment in psoriasis, where it is upregulated, indicating its involvement in keratinocyte differentiation and skin development processes (Benezeder2020Dithranol). This upregulation suggests potential interactions with other keratinization-related proteins during the therapeutic response in psoriatic conditions.
