# FHIP1B

## Overview
FHIP1B is a gene that encodes the protein FHF complex subunit HOOK interacting protein 1B, which is a critical component of the FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex involved in intracellular transport processes. The FHIP1B protein plays a significant role in endosomal trafficking, particularly in the dynein-mediated transport of early endosomes. It interacts with the small GTPase Rab5, facilitating the movement of endosomes along microtubules towards the centrosome. Structurally, FHIP1B contains a hydrophobic pocket that interacts with HOOK3, contributing to the stability and function of the FHF complex. The protein's interactions with other components, such as KIF1C, suggest a regulatory role in the activation of the complex, highlighting its importance in cellular organization and signaling (Ali2023KIF1C; Straube2023KIF1C; Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

## Function
FHIP1B is a crucial component of the FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex, which plays a significant role in intracellular transport processes, particularly in the context of endosomal trafficking. In healthy human cells, FHIP1B is involved in the dynein-mediated transport of early endosomes. It interacts directly with GTP-bound Rab5, a small GTPase that marks early endosomes, facilitating their movement towards the minus ends of microtubules near the centrosome (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). 

FHIP1B preferentially associates with Hook1 and Hook3, forming complexes that link dynein/dynactin to early endosomes through a direct interaction with Rab5B. This interaction is essential for the proper positioning and movement of endosomes within the cell, contributing to cellular organization and signaling (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). 

The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it colocalizes with microtubule-associated cargos and endosome-related proteins. Overexpression of FHIP1B leads to the accumulation of early endosomes at the centrosome, highlighting its role in endosomal transport and positioning (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
FHIP1B, a component of the FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex, is involved in several protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in intracellular transport. It forms complexes with Hook1 and Hook3 proteins, but not with Hook2, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). FHIP1B preferentially interacts with Hook3 to form FHF complexes, which associate with motile dynein/dynactin complexes, facilitating their movement (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

FHIP1B also interacts directly with Rab5B, a small GTPase associated with early endosomes. This interaction is stronger when Rab5B is bound to a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, indicating that FHIP1B binds to the active, membrane-bound form of Rab5B (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). This binding is specific to Rab5B among a panel of tested Rab GTPases, suggesting that FHIP1B acts as a Rab5-specific effector (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

The FHF complex, including FHIP1B, is described as auto-inhibited, with KIF1C capable of activating the complex by interacting with HOOK3, thus enhancing dynein movement (Ali2023KIF1C; Straube2023KIF1C). These interactions highlight FHIP1B's role in linking dynein to early endosomes and regulating its motility.
