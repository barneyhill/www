# CD63

## Overview
CD63 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin family, which is characterized by four transmembrane domains and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. The CD63 protein is predominantly located in the lysosomal membrane and is also present in late endosomes and lysosome-related vesicles. It plays a significant role in immune responses by facilitating leukocyte recruitment through interactions with endothelial P-selectin. Additionally, CD63 is implicated in secretory processes in eosinophils and is associated with the trafficking and polarization of secretory granules. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the adaptor protein complex AP-3 and proteins involved in the secretion of small extracellular vesicles, underscore its importance in cellular signaling and vesicle biogenesis. Clinically, alterations in CD63 expression have been linked to conditions such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Carmo2016CD63; Folkmanis2022Clinicopathological; Schröder2009Deficiency; Doyle2011CD63).

## Structure
The CD63 protein is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by its structure comprising four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops. The primary structure of CD63 includes a single open reading frame encoding 238 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 25 kDa (Metzelaar1991CD63). The protein features three N-linked glycosylation sites, which contribute to its highly glycosylated nature, resulting in a molecular mass ranging from 30 to 60 kDa (Metzelaar1991CD63). 

The secondary and tertiary structures are not explicitly detailed in the sources, but the protein's structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds formed by conserved cysteine residues in the large extracellular loop (Liyanage2021Expression). The CD63 protein contains a C-terminal lysosomal sorting motif, Gly-Tyr, which is crucial for its localization to lysosomal membranes (Ryu2000Domain). 

CD63 is involved in forming tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, known as 'tetraspanin webs', through interactions with other proteins, including integrins and other tetraspanins like CD81 and CD82 (Liyanage2021Expression). These interactions suggest a role in quaternary structure, facilitating complex formation and cellular signaling.

## Function
CD63, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signal transduction. It is primarily located in the lysosomal membrane and is also found in late endosomes and lysosome-related vesicles of leukocytes and platelets. CD63 plays a crucial role in leukocyte recruitment by endothelial P-selectin, where it acts as an essential cofactor. It facilitates the clustering and surface expression of P-selectin on endothelial cells, which is necessary for efficient leukocyte rolling and adhesion during immune responses (Doyle2011CD63).

In eosinophils, CD63 is associated with secretory events such as piecemeal degranulation and compound exocytosis. It is involved in the trafficking and polarization of secretory granules, facilitating their fusion with the plasma membrane during exocytosis (Carmo2016CD63). CD63 is also linked to phosphoinositide 4 kinase in intracellular vesicles and focal adhesions, highlighting its role in cell signaling (Schröder2009Deficiency).

Despite its involvement in these processes, CD63-deficient mice exhibit a mild phenotype, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms by other tetraspanins (Schröder2009Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CD63 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. CD63 deficiency is notably linked to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding disorders, and lysosomal storage defects. In this syndrome, CD63 is deficient in platelet dense granules, leading to prolonged bleeding times and impaired platelet aggregation (Nishibori1993The).

In cancer, particularly prostate adenocarcinoma, CD63 expression levels have been correlated with disease aggressiveness. Higher CD63 expression is observed in high-grade prostate cancer compared to low-grade cases, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. Increased CD63 expression is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior and shorter progression-free survival in patients (Folkmanis2022Clinicopathological).

CD63 deficiency has also been linked to kidney pathology in mice, where it affects water balance and results in abnormal cytoplasmic inclusions in kidney cells. Despite these findings, CD63 deficiency does not significantly impact lysosomal function or platelet production, indicating a specific role in kidney health (Schröder2009Deficiency).

## Interactions
CD63, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the adaptor protein complex AP-3, which is crucial for targeting CD63 to lysosomes. The interaction is mediated by the carboxyterminal cytosolic tail of CD63, specifically the GYEVM motif, which shows a strong, tyrosine-dependent interaction with the AP-3 subunit (Rous2002Role). Mutations in this motif, such as GYEVI, alter the interaction dynamics, affecting the protein's localization and trafficking (Rous2002Role).

CD63 also interacts with proteins involved in the secretion of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). It is primarily associated with exosomes and interacts with proteins like LAMP1, suggesting a role in the release of exosomes from secretory lysosomes (Mathieu2021Specificities). CD63 is found on distinct populations of extracellular vesicles, often co-localizing with other tetraspanins like CD9, indicating its involvement in the biogenesis of these vesicles (Mathieu2021Specificities).

Additionally, CD63 interacts with amelogenin, ameloblastin, and enamelin proteins through its extracellular domain, specifically amino acids 165-205, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays (Zou2007Determination). These interactions highlight CD63's role in various cellular and molecular processes.
