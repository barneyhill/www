# KLK1

## Overview
KLK1 is a gene that encodes the protein kallikrein 1, a serine protease that is part of the kallikrein family. This protein is involved in the kallikrein-kinin system, which plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure, inflammation, and pain through the release of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Dong2014Activation). Kallikrein 1 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidneys, pancreas, and salivary glands, and is involved in processes such as smooth muscle contraction and blood flow regulation (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Clements2004The). Beyond its role in the kallikrein-kinin system, kallikrein 1 is implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis, highlighting its importance in vascular homeostasis and tissue repair (Spinetti2011Tissue; Clements2004The). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its diverse physiological functions (Adamopoulos2019Discovery).

## Structure
KLK1, a member of the kallikrein family, is a serine protease characterized by a polypeptide chain that includes a signal peptide and multiple cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its structural stability (Adamopoulos2019Discovery). The primary structure of KLK1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, while the secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of serine proteases. The tertiary structure is the three-dimensional folding of the protein, stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are essential for its enzymatic activity.

KLK1 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms. Notably, a novel transcript, KLK1 v.3, encodes a protein isoform with the same N- and C-termini as the main KLK1 protein but is shorter in length. Another variant, KLK1 v.4, lacks exons 2 and 3 and likely produces the same isoform as a previously predicted transcript (Adamopoulos2019Discovery). These splice variants contribute to the diversity of KLK1's functional roles in physiological processes. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its activity and stability.

## Function
KLK1, or kallikrein 1, is a serine protease enzyme that plays a crucial role in the kallikrein-kinin system, primarily involved in the regulation of blood pressure, inflammation, and pain. It achieves these functions by cleaving low molecular weight kininogen to release bradykinin, a peptide that binds to bradykinin receptors, leading to vasodilation and increased vascular permeability (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Dong2014Activation). KLK1 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidneys, pancreas, and salivary glands, where it contributes to processes such as smooth muscle contraction and blood flow regulation (Lundwall2008Kallikreinrelated; Clements2004The).

In addition to its role in the kallikrein-kinin system, KLK1 is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling by activating matrix metalloproteases and cleaving insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (Clements2004The). It also plays a role in the invasive capacity of circulating proangiogenic cells, which are essential for angiogenesis and tissue remodeling, through a mechanism involving the kinin B2 receptor (Spinetti2011Tissue). These activities highlight KLK1's importance in maintaining vascular homeostasis and facilitating tissue repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KLK1 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KLK1, such as rs1054713 and rs2740502, have shown significant associations, particularly in patients with nephritis. These genetic variations may contribute to the development and severity of SLE and nephritis by affecting KLK1 expression or function (Liu2009Kallikrein).

KLK1 is also implicated in cardiovascular health. Genetic deficiency in KLK1 activity, particularly the R53H polymorphism, results in reduced kinin-forming activity and is associated with arterial dysfunction. This mutation leads to impaired vasodilation and increased shear stress, which may elevate the risk of cardiovascular diseases (Pizard2008Genetic). KLK1 deficiency in mice has been linked to impaired cardioprotective mechanisms during acute cardiac ischemia and heart failure, suggesting a crucial role for KLK1 in cardioprotection (Pizard2008Genetic).

In vascular repair and neovascularization, KLK1 plays a critical role. A polymorphic variant, R53H-hKLK1, lacks the capacity for effective neovascularization, which may result in a worse prognosis for conditions like coronary or peripheral artery disease due to impaired vascular healing (Stone2009Critical).

## Interactions
KLK1, also known as kallikrein 1, is a serine protease that participates in various interactions with proteins and receptors, playing a significant role in physiological and pathological processes. KLK1 is involved in the kallikrein-kinin system, where it cleaves low molecular weight kininogen to release bradykinin, a peptide that interacts with the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R). This interaction is crucial for the invasive and proangiogenic activities of circulating proangiogenic cells (PACs), as it activates pathways involving inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) (Spinetti2011Tissue).

KLK1 also interacts with protease-activated receptors (PARs), such as PAR4, contributing to inflammatory responses (Blaber2010Functional). It can activate pro-uPA and convert single-chain tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to its more active form, impacting the thrombostasis system (Blaber2010Functional). KLK1's interactions extend to the activation of the Akt pathway, enhancing cell migration and invasion, which are essential for angiogenesis and tissue remodeling (Spinetti2011Tissue). These interactions highlight KLK1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and its potential implications in disease contexts.
