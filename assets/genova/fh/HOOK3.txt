# HOOK3

## Overview
HOOK3 is a gene that encodes the hook microtubule tethering protein 3, a member of the Hook protein family. This protein is characterized by its role as a dynein adaptor, facilitating intracellular transport and cytoskeletal organization. It is involved in the retrograde transport of early endosomes and is crucial for neuronal function and neurogenesis. The protein's structure includes a conserved N-terminal hook domain, central coiled-coil domains, and a divergent C-terminal region, which are essential for its interactions with dynein and dynactin, as well as other proteins like PCM1. These interactions are vital for maintaining centrosome function and proper cellular compartment organization. HOOK3 is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to the Golgi apparatus, playing a significant role in various cellular processes and disease mechanisms, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (Ge2010Hook3; Shi2023HOOK3; Dwivedi2019Incorporating).

## Structure
HOOK3 is a member of the Hook protein family, characterized by a conserved N-terminal hook domain, central coiled-coil domains, and a divergent C-terminal region. The N-terminal hook domain is crucial for dynein binding and is the most conserved part of the protein. The crystal structure of the Hook domain of human HOOK3 reveals an extended eighth helix beyond the canonical seven-helix calponin homology (CH) fold. This eighth helix contains solvent-exposed residues that interact with conserved residues in the C-terminal region of light intermediate chain (LIC) 1, a subunit of dynein (Dwivedi2019Incorporating).

The central region of HOOK3 contains two leucine zipper-like coiled-coil domains that facilitate homodimerization, contributing to its quaternary structure. These coiled-coil regions are essential for forming a stable ternary complex with dynein and dynactin, which is necessary for dynein processivity (Dwivedi2019Incorporating).

HOOK3 also includes a spindly-like motif between the coiled-coil regions, potentially acting as a hinge in the stalk connecting two globular domains, although its exact role requires further investigation (Dwivedi2019Incorporating). The protein does not directly bind to microtubules, contrary to initial assumptions (Dwivedi2019Incorporating).

## Function
HOOK3, a member of the hook microtubule tethering protein family, plays a crucial role in intracellular transport and cytoskeletal organization. It functions as a dynein adaptor, facilitating the retrograde transport of early endosomes by forming a tripartite complex with dynein and dynactin. This complex is essential for the retrieval of Rab5-positive early endosomes from axons to the cell body, a process vital for neuronal function (Dwivedi2019Incorporating). HOOK3 is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to the Golgi apparatus, where it regulates its perinuclear positioning and architecture (Dwivedi2019Incorporating).

In the context of neurogenesis, HOOK3 interacts with the pericentriolar satellite protein PCM1 to regulate the assembly of pericentriolar material, which is crucial for centrosome function. This interaction is necessary for the dynamic assembly of centrosomal proteins and proper interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) during neurogenesis, maintaining the balance between progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation (Ge2010Hook3). Disruption of HOOK3 leads to impaired centrosomal functions and premature differentiation of neural progenitors, highlighting its essential role in embryonic brain development (Ge2010Hook3).

## Clinical Significance
HOOK3 has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disruptions in its normal interactions. In gastric cancer (GC), HOOK3 is expressed at low levels, and its suppression is associated with increased proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival of cancer cells. Conversely, overexpression of HOOK3 inhibits these processes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor in GC through the SP1/VEGFA axis (Shi2023HOOK3).

In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a novel HOOK3-FGFR1 fusion gene has been identified, which activates the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. This fusion is associated with poor clinical outcomes and resistance to treatment, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2022Identification).

HOOK3 is also involved in neurogenesis, where its interaction with PCM1 is crucial for centrosome assembly. Disruption of this interaction can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders such as lissencephaly and microcephaly (Ge2010Hook3).

In Alzheimer's disease, reduced levels of HOOK3 have been observed, which may enhance β-amyloid production, suggesting a role in the disease's progression by affecting protein clearance (Dwivedi2019Incorporating).

HOOK3 variants have been associated with familial thyroid cancer, indicating a potential role in its development (Tous2023Identification).

## Interactions
HOOK3, a microtubule-binding protein, participates in several critical interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One of its primary interactions is with Pericentriolar Material 1 (PCM1), which is essential for the assembly of pericentriolar material and the regulation of neurogenesis. This interaction occurs via the C terminus of HOOK3 and is crucial for maintaining centrosome function and interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) during cortical development. Disruption of the HOOK3-PCM1 interaction affects the trafficking of pericentriolar satellites and the assembly of centrosomal proteins, leading to premature depletion of the neural progenitor pool (Ge2010Hook3).

HOOK3 also interacts with microtubules through its NH2-terminal domain, which is highly conserved among Hook proteins. This interaction is vital for the proper positioning and organization of cellular compartments, such as the Golgi apparatus, where HOOK3 localizes via its COOH-terminal domain (Walenta2001The).

Additionally, HOOK3 interacts with IIGP, a member of the 47 kDa GTPase family, in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction suggests a role for HOOK3 in cytoskeleton-based membrane trafficking, particularly in response to IFNγ stimulation (Kaiser2004IIGP).
