# CPNE4

## Overview
CPNE4 is a gene that encodes the protein copine 4, a member of the copine family, which functions as a calcium-dependent membrane adaptor. Copine 4 is characterized by its structural domains, including two N-terminal C2 domains and a C-terminal von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domain, which facilitate its role in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively. This protein is predominantly expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and is regulated by Brn3 transcription factors, playing a crucial role in cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interactions, vesicle trafficking, and dendritic morphology. Through its interactions with various proteins such as Morn2, HCFC1, and the 14-3-3 family, copine 4 is implicated in neurogenesis, differentiation, axon guidance, and neurotransmitter release, highlighting its significance in neuronal development and function (Goel2021Moleculara; Goel2021Molecular).

## Structure
CPNE4 (copine 4) is a protein characterized by its distinct domain structure, which includes two N-terminal C2 domains (C2A and C2B) and a C-terminal von Willebrand factor A (vWA) domain. The C2 domains are involved in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, facilitating the protein's attachment to cell membranes in response to calcium signals (Goel2019Differential; Goel2021Molecular). The vWA domain is primarily responsible for mediating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for CPNE4's role in cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangement (Goel2021Moleculara; Goel2021Molecular).

The protein's structure allows it to participate in various cellular functions, particularly in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), where it is specifically expressed and regulated by Brn3 transcription factors (Goel2021Moleculara). CPNE4's interactions with other proteins, such as Morn2 and HCFC1, are facilitated by its vWA domain, which has been shown to interact with these proteins in studies using yeast two-hybrid systems and co-immunoprecipitation (Goel2021Moleculara). The protein's structure and interactions suggest its involvement in metabolic and signaling pathways related to membrane-associated structures (Goel2021Molecular).

## Function
The CPNE4 gene encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). CPNE4 is a member of the Copine family, which are calcium-dependent membrane adaptors. It plays a significant role in cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interactions, influencing cell morphology and differentiation. Overexpression of CPNE4 in RGCs leads to the formation of large varicosities on dendrites, indicating its involvement in dendritic morphology and potentially affecting dendrite remodeling or cytoskeletal changes during development (Goel2021Moleculara; Goel2021Molecular).

CPNE4 interacts with several proteins, including Morn2, HCFC1, and the 14-3-3 family, suggesting its involvement in metabolic and signaling pathways. These interactions indicate roles in neurogenesis, differentiation, axon guidance, and neurotransmitter release (Goel2021Moleculara; Goel2021Molecular). CPNE4 is localized in plasma membrane-bounded cell projections and neuron projections, supporting its role in cytoskeletal interactions and vesicle trafficking (Goel2021Moleculara).

The protein is also suggested to be involved in the regulation of transport in neurons, with potential sub-cellular locations including the late endosome lumen (Goel2021Moleculara). These functions highlight CPNE4's importance in retinal cell biology and its potential impact on neuronal development and function.

## Interactions
CPNE4, a member of the copine family, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It interacts with several proteins, including Mycbp2, a ubiquitin ligase implicated in vesicle trafficking and axon guidance, suggesting a role in dendritic varicosities in RGCs (Goel2021Moleculara). CPNE4 also interacts with the 14-3-3 family, which is abundant in the central nervous system and plays a role in neurogenesis and differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells (Goel2021Moleculara). Other notable interactions include Map1b, important for axon guidance and branching, and Syntaxin1 and SV2, which are involved in neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic terminal (Goel2021Moleculara).

The protein also interacts with HCFC1, a transcriptional co-activator influencing neuronal maturation and neurite growth, and Morn2, which is expressed in RGCs and interacts with LC3 to recruit phagosomes against bacteria (Goel2021Moleculara; Goel2021Molecular). These interactions suggest CPNE4's involvement in cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interactions and vesicle trafficking, potentially affecting dendrite remodeling and cytoskeletal changes during dendrite development (Goel2021Moleculara). CPNE4's interactions are implicated in neuronal receptor pathways and cytoskeletal regulation, highlighting its role in retinal development and function (Goel2021Molecular).
