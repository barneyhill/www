# BCAP31

## Overview
BCAP31 is a gene that encodes the B cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31), a transmembrane protein predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). BAP31 plays a critical role in the transport and quality control of newly synthesized proteins, acting as a cargo receptor for the export of transmembrane proteins and participating in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (Namusamba2021Biological; Wakana2008Bap31). The protein is also involved in apoptosis signaling, where it interacts with caspase-8 to generate pro-apoptotic fragments, influencing ER-mediated apoptosis and calcium ion regulation between the ER and mitochondria (Namusamba2021Biological). Additionally, BAP31 is implicated in immune system functions, particularly in T cell receptor maturation and signaling (Namusamba2021Biological). Mutations in the BCAP31 gene are linked to several X-linked syndromes, including deafness, dystonia, and cerebral hypomyelination syndrome (DDCH), highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Cacciagli2013Mutations; Whalen2021Further).

## Structure
BAP31, encoded by the BCAP31 gene, is a transmembrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is a 28 kDa protein with a hydrophobic N-terminus and a charged C-terminus, which includes a dilysine (KKEE) motif that associates with the ER membrane and mediates retrograde transport of membrane proteins between the Golgi and ER (Namusamba2021Biological). The protein structure features a predicted α-helical structure at the C-terminus and two identical caspase recognition sites involved in programmed cell death, as well as a variant of the death effector domain (vDED) (Namusamba2021Biological).

BAP31 contains three putative transmembrane domains (TMDs), with TMD2 playing a crucial role in recycling between the peripheral ER and a juxtanuclear compartment related to ER-associated degradation (Wakana2008Bap31). The protein is involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and functions as a cargo receptor for the ER export of transmembrane proteins (Wakana2008Bap31). BAP31 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, which are significant for its function in various cellular processes (Namusamba2021Biological). The protein's interaction with other proteins, such as Tom40, is crucial for mitochondrial regulation, linking the ER and mitochondria (Namusamba2021Biological).

## Function
BCAP31, also known as BAP31, is a transmembrane protein located primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. It is involved in the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the ER to other cellular compartments, acting as a cargo receptor for the export of transmembrane proteins, including those prone to ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (Namusamba2021Biological; Wakana2008Bap31). BCAP31 is a key component of the ER quality control system, ensuring proper folding and assembly of secretory and membrane proteins (Wakana2008Bap31).

BCAP31 also plays a significant role in apoptosis signaling. It contains caspase recognition sites that are involved in programmed cell death, and its cleavage by caspase-8 generates pro-apoptotic fragments that regulate ER-mediated apoptosis through calcium ion efflux and mitochondrial membrane fragmentation (Namusamba2021Biological). Additionally, BCAP31 is involved in the regulation of calcium between the ER and mitochondria, interacting with proteins like Tom40 to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and influence cellular energy metabolism (Namusamba2021Biological).

BCAP31 is also implicated in the immune system, particularly in the maturation and activation of T cell antigen receptors, affecting T cell signaling and proliferation (Namusamba2021Biological). Its involvement in these diverse processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BCAP31 gene are associated with several severe X-linked syndromes, primarily characterized by intellectual and motor disabilities, sensorineural deafness, and dystonia. One such condition is the deafness, dystonia, and cerebral hypomyelination syndrome (DDCH), which includes symptoms like severe intellectual disability, dystonia, deafness, and central hypomyelination (Cacciagli2013Mutations; Whalen2021Further). Loss-of-function mutations in BCAP31 lead to altered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology and Golgi apparatus disorganization, disrupting intracellular protein trafficking and contributing to severe congenital brain dysfunction (Cacciagli2013Mutations).

Contiguous deletions involving BCAP31 and adjacent genes, such as ABCD1 and SLC6A8, result in more severe phenotypes. For instance, the Contiguous ABCD1 and DXS1375E/BCAP31 Deletion Syndrome (CADDS) is associated with severe neurological symptoms, liver disease, and early death (Whalen2021Further; Calhoun2014Distal). BCAP31 mutations are also linked to Schimke X-linked intellectual disability syndrome, characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and distinctive facial features (Louie2020Schimke).

Female carriers of BCAP31 mutations are typically asymptomatic but may exhibit sensorineural hearing loss and mild intellectual disability (Whalen2021Further). The gene's role in ER-associated degradation and protein export is crucial, and its dysfunction can lead to a spectrum of neurological and systemic manifestations (Albanyan2017BCAP31‐associated).

## Interactions
BCAP31, also known as B cell receptor associated protein 31, is involved in various protein interactions within the cell. It interacts with components of the Sec61 translocon, specifically Sec61b and TRAM, which are part of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein-sorting machinery. This interaction is crucial for the retrotranslocation and degradation of misfolded proteins like the CFTRDF508 mutant via the Derlin-1 complex (Wang2008BAP31).

BCAP31 also forms a complex with Fis1, creating a platform for procaspase-8 recruitment, which is essential for apoptosis induction. This interaction is part of the ARCosome complex that bridges the mitochondria and ER, playing a critical role in apoptosis regulation (Iwasawa2010Fis1).

In the context of cancer, BCAP31 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), modulating its signaling pathway. This interaction is significant in triple-negative breast cancer, where BCAP31 affects EGFR trafficking and spontaneous phosphorylation, promoting cancer development (Fu2019BCAP31).

BCAP31 also associates with CD11b/CD18, a leukocyte integrin, influencing its intracellular trafficking and cell surface expression, particularly in neutrophils (Zen2004Association). These interactions highlight BCAP31's role in protein transport, apoptosis, and cancer progression.
