# AADACL2

## Overview
AADACL2 is a gene that encodes the protein arylacetamide deacetylase-like 2, which functions as a hydrolase involved in lipid metabolism. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis by breaking down specific lipid substrates, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum. The activity of arylacetamide deacetylase-like 2 influences membrane composition and signaling pathways, underscoring its importance in cellular processes (Palaniappan2022COADREADx:). The gene has been associated with protective effects against ischemic stroke through specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and is implicated in various diseases, including colorectal cancer and leukemia, where its expression levels are altered (Dogan2017New; Palaniappan2022COADREADx:; Akinyemi2024Novel). Despite its recognized roles, further research is needed to fully elucidate the functions and mechanisms of AADACL2 in health and disease.

## Function
The AADACL2 gene encodes a protein involved in lipid metabolism, functioning primarily as a hydrolase that breaks down specific lipid substrates. This activity plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis, influencing processes such as membrane composition and signaling pathways. The protein is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to the regulation of lipid levels within cells (Palaniappan2022COADREADx:).

In the context of ischemic stroke, loci near the AADACL2 gene have been associated with protective effects. Significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs6440776 and rs2410883 have shown a protective association against stroke, with an odds ratio of 0.74. This suggests that AADACL2 may play a role in protective mechanisms against ischemic stroke, potentially through its expression and regulatory interactions in the skin and other tissues (Akinyemi2024Novel).

While the specific function of AADACL2 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in lipid metabolism and potential protective roles in certain conditions highlight its importance in cellular and organismal biology (Palaniappan2022COADREADx:).

## Clinical Significance
The AADACL2 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of ischemic stroke, loci near the AADACL2 gene have demonstrated protective effects, with significant SNPs associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke. This protective effect is thought to be due to histone modification and regulatory activity near the gene, with interactions involving the IGSF10 gene, which has immune regulatory functions (Akinyemi2024Novel).

In colorectal cancer, AADACL2 is significantly downregulated across all cancer stages, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression. It is one of the genes identified as essential for developing diagnostic models for colorectal cancer screening (Palaniappan2022COADREADx:). Additionally, AADACL2 has been noted for its distinct expression patterns in leukemia, indicating a potential role in leukemia pathogenesis (Dogan2017New).

In breast cancer, the lncRNA AADACL2-AS1, associated with the AADACL2 gene, is downregulated, suggesting a potential role in the disease (Jia2019Transcriptome). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various conditions, although its precise role in these diseases requires further investigation.
