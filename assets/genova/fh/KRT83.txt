# KRT83

## Overview
KRT83 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 83, a type II hair keratin, which is a member of the intermediate filament protein family. This protein is primarily expressed in the hair follicle, particularly within the cortex and cuticle layers, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of hair fibers (Ho2022Update; Schweizer2007Hair). Keratin 83 is involved in the formation of intermediate filaments, which are essential for the tensile strength and elasticity of hair, contributing to its overall mechanical properties (Ho2022Update). Mutations in the KRT83 gene have been linked to hair disorders such as monilethrix, characterized by fragile, beaded hair, and progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma, a rare skin condition, highlighting the gene's significance in hair and skin health (van2015Novel; Shah2016Recessive).

## Structure
Keratin 83 (KRT83) is a type II hair keratin involved in the structural integrity of hair and nails. The primary structure of KRT83 consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain, which is flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This configuration is typical of intermediate filament proteins, facilitating the formation of coiled-coil dimers (Ho2022Update). 

The secondary structure of KRT83 includes alpha-helices that form these coiled-coil dimers, which are essential for the protein's function. These dimers can be either homodimeric or heterodimeric, contributing to the protein's ability to form stable structures (Ho2022Update). 

In terms of tertiary structure, these dimers assemble into intermediate filaments, which are crucial for the mechanical stability of hair fibers. The quaternary structure involves the formation of complex filament networks, which are integral to the hair's resilience and flexibility (Ho2022Update).

Post-translational modifications of KRT83 may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence the protein's function and interactions within the hair follicle (Ho2022Update). These modifications are important for the regulation of keratin filament assembly and stability.

## Function
Keratin 83 (KRT83) is a type II hair keratin gene that encodes a protein crucial for the structural integrity of hair and nails. In healthy human cells, KRT83 is primarily expressed in the hair follicle, particularly within the cortex and cuticle layers, where it contributes to hair strength and resilience (Ho2022Update). The protein forms intermediate filaments, which provide mechanical support and protection to epithelial cells, helping them withstand various stresses (Ramot2009Endocrine).

KRT83 plays a significant role in maintaining the normal structure of hair and skin. It is involved in the formation of the hair shaft, contributing to the overall mechanical properties of hair fibers (Schweizer2007Hair). The protein's function is essential for the proper assembly of keratin filaments, which are critical for the hair's tensile strength and elasticity (Ho2022Update).

Mutations in KRT83 can lead to hair disorders such as monilethrix, characterized by a beaded appearance of hair due to periodic constrictions, resulting in hair fragility and alopecia (van2015Novel). This highlights the importance of KRT83 in maintaining hair integrity and its role in preventing hair-related abnormalities (Shah2016Recessive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT83 gene are associated with several hair and skin disorders. One notable condition linked to KRT83 mutations is monilethrix, an autosomal dominant hair disorder characterized by beaded or fragile hair, leading to hair loss. This condition is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in KRT83, which affect the structural integrity of hair shafts (van2015Novel; Ho2022Update). 

In addition to monilethrix, KRT83 mutations can also result in progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (PSEK), a rare skin disorder. PSEK is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by homozygous loss-of-function mutations in KRT83. This leads to symmetrically distributed hyperkeratotic plaques on the skin (Shah2016Recessive). 

The phenotypic variability associated with KRT83 mutations highlights the genetic complexity of this gene. While recessive mutations can lead to PSEK, dominant mutations result in monilethrix, indicating that these conditions are allelic (Shah2016Recessive). The rarity of these mutations in the general population aligns with the uncommon nature of these disorders, particularly outside consanguineous contexts (Shah2016Recessive).

## Interactions
KRT83, or keratin 83, is a type II hair keratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair fibers. It is involved in forming intermediate filaments by interacting with other keratin proteins, which are essential for maintaining the mechanical resilience and stability of hair fibers (Schweizer2007Hair). KRT83 is part of a complex network of protein-protein interactions that contribute to hair shaft integrity. In the context of patchy-type alopecia areata, KRT83 is connected with desmoglein 4 (Dsg4) and plakophilins 1 (PKP1), which are important for maintaining hair shaft integrity (Shi2020Bioinformatics).

KRT83 is also a target of miR-432, a microRNA that regulates its expression post-transcriptionally. The interaction between miR-432 and KRT83 was demonstrated using a dual-luciferase reporter assay, which showed that miR-432 mimic decreased luciferase activity in cells containing wild-type KRT83-CDS, indicating that miR-432 targets KRT83 expression (Liu2018Integrated). This interaction highlights the regulatory role of miRNAs in modulating KRT83 protein levels, which may influence hair follicle development and phenotypic traits such as curly fleece in sheep.
