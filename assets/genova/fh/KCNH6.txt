# KCNH6

## Overview
KCNH6 is a gene that encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 6, a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. This protein is a member of the ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) class of voltage-dependent potassium channels, which are integral to the electrogenic processes in pancreatic islet beta cells. The KCNH6 protein is characterized by its complex structure, including transmembrane and non-transmembrane domains, and is involved in forming tetramers that contribute to the transmembrane potassium pore. Functionally, KCNH6 channels are essential for the repolarization of the cell membrane in response to high glucose levels, thereby modulating intracellular calcium levels and influencing insulin secretion. The gene's expression in insulin-secreting cells underscores its importance in maintaining normal insulin levels and glucose metabolism. Mutations in KCNH6 have been associated with various insulin-related disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as diabetes and neonatal hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (Zhao2021Berberine; Yang2018From; H2020Ion).

## Structure
The KCNH6 protein is a voltage-gated potassium channel characterized by a specific molecular structure. It consists of two non-transmembrane domains (residues 1-225 and residues 567-950) and one transmembrane domain (residues 226-566) (Wang2024KCNH6). The transmembrane domain is composed of six segments, including a pore-forming loop essential for ion conduction and selectivity (Wang2024KCNH6). The protein forms tetramers, with each subunit contributing to the transmembrane potassium pore (Yang2018From).

The molecular structure of KCNH6 includes several domains: the N-terminal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain, the ether-a-go-go (EAG) domain, C-linkers, the C-terminal cyclic nucleotide binding homology domain (CNBHD), and post-CNBHD domains (Yang2018From). These structural components are crucial for the protein's function in regulating insulin secretion (Yang2018From).

Specific amino acids within the transmembrane domain, such as R246, T248, and L250, are critical for the interaction with Munc18-1, a regulator of insulin granule exocytosis (Wang2024KCNH6). A triple mutant (R246A/T248A/L250A) showed diminished binding activity to Munc18-1, highlighting the importance of these residues in protein-protein interactions (Wang2024KCNH6).

## Function
The KCNH6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ether-a-go-go-related gene (ERG) class of voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channels, which are crucial for regulating insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in humans. In healthy cells, KCNH6 is typically localized to the plasma membrane of pancreatic islet beta cells, where it plays a significant role in regulating the membrane potential and, consequently, insulin secretion (Yang2018From). 

The KCNH6 protein is involved in the electrogenic events that regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). This process involves the ATP-sensitive potassium (K ATP) channel pathway, where glucose metabolism increases the ATP/ADP ratio, leading to the closure of K ATP channels, depolarization of the plasma membrane, and influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels (VDCCs), ultimately resulting in insulin secretion (Yang2018From). KCNH6 channels contribute to the high-glucose-dependent repolarization of the cell membrane, influencing insulin secretion by modulating intracellular calcium levels (Zhao2021Berberine).

KCNH6 is expressed in insulin-secreting islet beta cells in both humans and mice, highlighting its critical role in maintaining normal insulin levels and glucose homeostasis (Yang2018From).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNH6 gene have been linked to various disorders related to insulin secretion and glucose metabolism. Specific mutations, such as p.P235L, p.R385G, and p.R715W, have been associated with diabetes in multigenerational families, particularly in Chinese populations. These mutations are believed to impair the function of the KCNH6 potassium channel, leading to a spectrum of conditions from hyperinsulinemia to hypoinsulinemia and diabetes (Yang2018From). The p.P235L mutation, in particular, has been shown to cause monogenic diabetes characterized by childhood hyperinsulinemia and adulthood hypoinsulinemia and diabetes (Yang2018From).

KCNH6 dysfunction can lead to increased intracellular calcium levels, initially causing excessive insulin secretion and hyperinsulinemia. Over time, this overstimulation results in endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, and loss of beta-cell mass, ultimately leading to hypoinsulinemia and diabetes (Yang2018From). The gene's role in protecting pancreatic β-cells from ER stress and apoptosis is crucial, as its dysfunction can contribute to glucose metabolic disturbances and β-cell apoptosis (Lu2020KCNH6).

Additionally, KCNH6 mutations have been implicated in neonatal hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH), with the p.V532F mutation identified as a potential cause in an Italian family (H2020Ion). These findings underscore the clinical significance of KCNH6 in insulin-related disorders.

## Interactions
The KCNH6 protein, a member of the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H, is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that influence its function beyond its role as an ion channel. One significant interaction is with Munc18-1, a key regulator of insulin granule exocytosis in pancreatic islet β-cells. This interaction is crucial for the docking and fusion of insulin secretory granules to the plasma membrane, facilitating insulin secretion. The interaction between KCNH6 and Munc18-1 is independent of KCNH6's electrophysiological role as a potassium channel, as demonstrated by the KCNH6 3A mutant, which retains electrical function but disrupts the interaction with Munc18-1, leading to impaired insulin secretion (Wang2024KCNH6).

The binding region for Munc18-1 on KCNH6 has been identified within the transmembrane domain, specifically residues 246-255, with R246, T248, and L250 being critical for the interaction. Mutations at these sites significantly reduce binding activity, underscoring their importance (Wang2024KCNH6). This interaction is essential for the proper functioning of insulin exocytosis, highlighting a non-canonical role for KCNH6 in cellular processes (Wang2024KCNH6).
