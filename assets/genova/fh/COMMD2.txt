# COMMD2

## Overview
COMMD2 (COMM domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the COMMD protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of a conserved C-terminal COMM domain, essential for dimerization and protein-protein interactions (Healy2018Structural; Maine2007COMMD). The COMMD2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of NF-κB-mediated transcription, which plays a critical role in immune response, inflammation, and cell survival (Burstein2005COMMD). It is also a component of the Commander complex, participating in endosomal trafficking and maintaining cellular metal ion balance (Healy2023Structure). COMMD2's interactions with other proteins, such as NF-κB subunits and p62, highlight its role in modulating transcriptional activity and cellular responses to environmental stimuli (Connor2022Pneumococcus). The protein's involvement in disease contexts, such as cancer and pneumococcal infections, underscores its clinical significance, particularly in tumor progression and immune response regulation (Connor2022Pneumococcus; Wang2021Transcriptional).

## Structure
The COMMD2 protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal COMM domain, which is essential for dimerization and protein-protein interactions. This domain is approximately 70 to 85 amino acids long and is involved in forming both homo- and heterodimeric complexes with other COMMD proteins (Healy2018Structural; Maine2007COMMD). The COMM domain structure includes three anti-parallel beta strands and a C-terminal alpha-helix, forming a dimeric module with a 'left-handed handshake' topology (Healy2023Structure).

The N-terminal region of COMMD2 is rich in alpha-helices, similar to other COMMD family members, and is thought to contribute to the protein's unique functions (Maine2007COMMD). Although specific structural details for COMMD2's N-terminal domain are not provided, it is likely to share the common alpha-helical-rich features observed in other COMMD proteins (Healy2023Structure).

COMMD2 is part of the Commander complex, forming heterodimeric and heterotetrameric assemblies with other COMMD proteins, such as COMMD3, COMMD4, and COMMD8 (Healy2023Structure). These interactions are crucial for its role in endosomal trafficking and other cellular processes.

## Function
COMMD2 is a member of the COMMD protein family, which is characterized by the presence of the COMM domain. This domain facilitates interactions among COMMD proteins and is crucial for their function in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, COMMD2 is involved in the regulation of NF-κB-mediated transcription, a key pathway in immune response, inflammation, and cell survival. COMMD2 can inhibit TNF-mediated NF-κB activation by associating with NF-κB subunits, particularly favoring complexes containing RelB, thereby influencing the transcriptional activity of NF-κB and potentially affecting the expression of NF-κB-responsive genes (Burstein2005COMMD).

COMMD2 is also implicated in protein-protein interactions within cells, which may influence various cellular processes (Burstein2005COMMD). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a role in modulating transcriptional activity and maintaining cellular metal ion balance. While specific functions of COMMD2 in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its involvement in these molecular processes suggests a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli (Burstein2005COMMD).

## Clinical Significance
COMMD2 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), COMMD2 is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages, higher tumor grades, and poor prognosis. Its high expression is associated with increased tumor proliferation, migration, and immune cell infiltration, suggesting an oncogenic role in HCC (Fang2022COMMD2; Wang2021Transcriptional; You2023COMMD). COMMD2's interaction with immune cells and immune checkpoint molecules like PD1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 indicates its involvement in tumor immune escape, further contributing to poor overall survival in liver cancer patients (Fang2022COMMD2).

In the context of pneumococcal infections, COMMD2 plays a role in modulating the host inflammatory response. It mediates the degradation of the NF-κB subunit p65 through aggrephagy, a process that can suppress inflammation and potentially favor pathogenic infection. This mechanism is specific to certain pneumococcal strains and involves interactions with proteins like p62 and pneumolysin (Connor2022Pneumococcus). These findings suggest that alterations in COMMD2 expression or function can significantly impact disease progression and immune response regulation.

## Interactions
COMMD2 (COMM domain containing 2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as the regulation of NF-κB signaling. During pneumococcal infection, COMMD2 interacts with the NF-κB subunit p65 and the protein p62 (SQSTM1). This interaction is enhanced in the presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and is involved in the degradation of p65 through aggrephagy, a process of protein degradation (Connor2022Pneumococcus). COMMD2 translocates to the nucleus during infection with the pneumococcal strain TIGR4, forming a complex with p65 and p62, which is then exported for lysosomal degradation (Connor2022Pneumococcus).

COMMD2 is also part of a family of proteins that can form homo- and heterodimeric complexes through their C-terminal COMM domains. These interactions are crucial for the formation of large multi-subunit assemblies (Healy2018Structural). COMMD2 has been shown to associate broadly with NF-κB subunits, particularly interacting more strongly with RelB-containing complexes (Burstein2005COMMD). These interactions suggest that COMMD2 plays a role in regulating NF-κB transcriptional activity by modulating the composition and activity of NF-κB complexes.
