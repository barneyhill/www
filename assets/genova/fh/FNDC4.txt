# FNDC4

## Overview
The FNDC4 gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III domain containing 4, which is a secreted hepatokine involved in metabolic regulation and inflammation. This protein plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, primarily through its interaction with the orphan receptor GPR116. FNDC4 enhances insulin signaling and glucose uptake in adipose tissue, while also exerting anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages and adipocytes. It is involved in reducing lipogenesis and promoting the browning of adipose tissue, which is essential for maintaining metabolic health. Alterations in FNDC4 expression are linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, highlighting its clinical significance in these conditions (Georgiadi2021Orphan; Frühbeck2020FNDC4; Bosma2016FNDC4).

## Function
The FNDC4 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in healthy human cells. FNDC4 is primarily secreted by the liver and acts as a hepatokine, influencing systemic glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. It enhances insulin signaling in adipose tissue by interacting with the GPR116 receptor, promoting insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via the GLUT4 transporter (Georgiadi2021Orphan). FNDC4 also exerts anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages and adipocytes, reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers, which contributes to improved insulin resistance (Lee2018Fibronectin; Bosma2016FNDC4).

In adipocytes, FNDC4 reduces lipogenesis and promotes fat browning, which is indicated by the upregulation of brown and beige adipocyte markers such as UCP-1. This process is crucial for maintaining healthy adipocyte function and is associated with increased mitochondrial biogenesis (Frühbeck2020FNDC4). FNDC4's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining glucose homeostasis and reducing inflammation, which are vital for metabolic health (Georgiadi2021Orphan).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FNDC4 gene have been associated with several metabolic disorders, particularly those related to glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Reduced levels of FNDC4 mRNA in the liver are linked to impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, conditions often observed in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Georgiadi2021Orphan). In humans, lower circulating levels of the soluble form of FNDC4 (sFNDC4) are associated with high-fat diets and the onset of insulin resistance, suggesting a role in the development of prediabetes and T2D (Georgiadi2021Orphan).

FNDC4 also plays a role in inflammation and adipose tissue function. It is shown to reduce lipogenesis and promote fat browning in human visceral adipocytes, with decreased plasma levels observed in obesity, which is linked to systemic inflammation (Frühbeck2020FNDC4). The FNDC4-GPR116 axis is crucial for insulin signaling in white adipose tissue, and disruptions in this pathway are associated with impaired glucose uptake and insulin resistance (Georgiadi2021Orphan). These findings suggest that FNDC4 and its interactions are significant in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases.

## Interactions
FNDC4 (fibronectin type III domain containing 4) is known to interact with the orphan receptor GPR116, playing a significant role in insulin sensitization in adipose tissue. This interaction is crucial for the insulin-sensitizing effects of FNDC4, as it enhances insulin-induced phosphorylation of AKT and AS160, which are key components in glucose uptake (Georgiadi2021Orphan). The binding of FNDC4 to GPR116 is specific, with equilibrium dissociation constants measured in HEK293A and HEK293T cells, indicating a strong affinity (Georgiadi2021Orphan). 

FNDC4's interaction with GPR116 also involves the stimulation of Gs and cAMP as secondary messengers, which are linked to increased lipolysis and mitochondrial oxidation in white adipocytes (Georgiadi2021Orphan). The interaction is further supported by pull-down assays, which demonstrate a direct physical interaction between FNDC4 and GPR116 (Georgiadi2021Orphan). 

FNDC4 does not appear to interact with nucleic acids, as the studies primarily focus on its protein-protein interactions, particularly with GPR116, and its role in modulating insulin signaling pathways (Georgiadi2021Orphan).
