# HK2

## Overview
Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme hexokinase 2, a key player in cellular glucose metabolism. As a member of the hexokinase family, hexokinase 2 is a kinase enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the initial step in the glycolytic pathway. This enzyme is predominantly expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, where it plays a crucial role in energy production and metabolic regulation (Tan2015HK2hexokinaseII; Ciscato2021Hexokinase). Beyond its metabolic functions, hexokinase 2 is involved in various cellular processes, including protection against oxidative stress and regulation of apoptosis, particularly through its interactions with mitochondrial proteins (Sun2008Glucose). The gene's expression and activity are tightly regulated by signaling pathways such as those involving mTOR, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and response to metabolic demands (Ciscato2021Hexokinase). Additionally, HK2 has been implicated in cancer metabolism, where its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and therapy resistance, making it a potential target for cancer treatment (Zheng2023Hexokinase; Li2020Regulatory).

## Structure
Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is a homodimeric enzyme composed of two structurally identical halves, each with an α/β fold conserved among the hexokinase family. The protein's primary structure includes catalytic residues D209 and D657, which are crucial for its function, forming hydrogen bonds with glucose (Nawaz2018The). The secondary structure features prominent α-helices and β-sheets, with helix-α 13 linking the N- and C-halves and playing a critical role in maintaining the enzyme's catalytic activity (Nawaz2018The). 

The tertiary structure of HK2 forms a globular shape, with the active site located in a cleft between large and small subdomains, enclosed by β-sheets and helices α 5 and α 13 (Nawaz2018The). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is essential for its function. HK2 is predominantly located on the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it interacts through its N-terminus (Nawaz2018The). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in HK2, affecting its regulatory and catalytic functions. The enzyme also has splice variant isoforms, which may influence its activity and stability (Nawaz2018The).

## Function
Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is a key enzyme in glucose metabolism, primarily expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. It catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the first step in glycolysis, which is crucial for ATP synthesis and energy production in cells (Tan2015HK2hexokinaseII; Ciscato2021Hexokinase). Beyond glycolysis, HK2 is involved in various metabolic pathways, including glycogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and hexosamine biosynthesis, contributing to glucose storage, NADH pool enrichment, and protein glycosylation (Ciscato2021Hexokinase).

HK2 also plays a protective role in cells, particularly in cardiomyocytes, where it helps prevent oxidative stress and maladaptive hypertrophy by increasing the pentose phosphate pathway flux (Ciscato2021Hexokinase). It is involved in the anabolic program elicited by insulin in muscle tissues, with its expression being regulated by the PI3K and p70 S6 protein kinase pathways downstream of mTOR complex 1 (Ciscato2021Hexokinase). HK2 can dock to mitochondria, enhancing glucose usage efficiency and exerting cytoprotective effects, a process regulated by the mTORC2 complex in insulin-treated cells (Ciscato2021Hexokinase). Additionally, HK2 acts as a molecular switch between glycolysis and autophagy, ensuring cellular energy homeostasis during glucose deprivation (Tan2015HK2hexokinaseII).

## Clinical Significance
Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its role in metabolic reprogramming. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), HK2 is highly expressed in tumor tissues and correlates with tumor stages and grades. Its silencing leads to decreased cell growth and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2020Regulatory). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HK2 is overexpressed and contributes to radio-resistance by promoting autophagy-dependent degradation of pro-apoptotic proteins, enhancing cell survival (Zheng2023Hexokinase). 

HK2 is also involved in prostate cancer, where its expression is linked to PTEN and p53 deficiencies, contributing to the Warburg effect and tumor growth (Wang2014Hexokinase). In liver cancer, HK2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and is a potential therapeutic target due to its selective expression in cancer cells (DeWaal2018Hexokinase2). HK2's overexpression in various tumors, including glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer, is linked to treatment resistance and poor outcomes, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer progression and therapy resistance (Ciscato2021Hexokinase).

## Interactions
Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein NS5A. This interaction enhances the catalytic activity of HK2, increasing its maximum velocity (Vmax) and decreasing its Michaelis constant (Km), which results in increased glucose consumption and lactate production in infected cells. This interaction is part of a viral strategy to reprogram host cell metabolism to support viral replication (Ramière2014Activity).

HK2 also interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and preventing apoptosis by influencing the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (Sun2008Glucose). The binding of HK2 to VDAC is regulated by protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε), which phosphorylates VDAC, enhancing HK2's protective effects against oxidative stress-induced cell death (Sun2008Glucose).

Additionally, HK2 is involved in the regulation of the RNA-binding protein hnRNP A1 during cellular stress and viral infections. HK2 modulates the cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1, affecting viral replication and cellular stress responses (Courteau2015Hexokinase).
