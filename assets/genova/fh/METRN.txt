# METRN

## Overview
The METRN gene encodes the meteorin protein, a glial cell differentiation regulator involved in various biological processes, including the modulation of inflammatory responses. Meteorin is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in influencing signaling pathways, particularly the NF-kB pathway, through interactions with other proteins such as UCHL-1. These interactions are crucial for its function in inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, which has implications for conditions like choroidal neovascularization. Additionally, the METRN gene has been linked to colorectal cancer, where its overexpression is associated with advanced disease stages and poor clinical outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Xu2019Over; Zhang2024Metrnl).

## Clinical Significance
The METRN gene, encoding the meteorin protein, has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) through alterations in its expression levels. Studies have shown that METRN expression is significantly upregulated in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with advanced stages of CRC, particularly Dukes' stage C and D tumors, and is more prevalent in the microsatellite instability (MSI) subtype than in the microsatellite stability (MSS) subtype. Higher METRN expression is also observed in grade III CRC compared to grades I and II. Importantly, elevated METRN expression correlates with poorer clinical outcomes, including worse 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival rates in CRC patients. These findings suggest that METRN overexpression may serve as a prognostic biomarker for CRC, indicating a poor prognosis (Xu2019Over).

While the context does not provide specific information on diseases resulting from mutations in the METRN gene, the significant upregulation of METRN in CRC and its association with advanced disease stages and poor outcomes highlight its potential clinical significance in cancer prognosis and therapy. Further research is needed to explore the full spectrum of conditions associated with METRN gene alterations.

## Interactions
The METRN protein, also known as meteorin, is involved in glial cell differentiation and participates in various interactions with other proteins. One significant interaction is with UCHL-1, a protein that plays a role in the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is crucial for inflammatory responses. This interaction was confirmed through protein mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) techniques, indicating a direct binding between METRN and UCHL-1 (Zhang2024Metrnl).

Molecular docking studies have predicted potential binding sites between METRN and UCHL-1, including serine 244, glutamine 247, and arginine 153, suggesting specific sites of interaction that may influence the NF-kB signaling pathway (Zhang2024Metrnl). Although METRN does not regulate UCHL-1 expression, it affects the downstream NF-kB signaling pathway by inhibiting NF-kB nuclear translocation in LPS-induced macrophages. This modulation of the NF-kB pathway by METRN is thought to occur through its interaction with UCHL-1, which in turn inhibits the transcription and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Zhang2024Metrnl).

These interactions highlight METRN's role in modulating inflammatory responses and its potential therapeutic implications in conditions like choroidal neovascularization (CNV) (Zhang2024Metrnl).
