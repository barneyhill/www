# OR52E5

## Overview
The OR52E5 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily E member 5, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The olfactory receptor family is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors. The OR52E5 gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the complex process of odorant signal transduction, ultimately leading to the perception of smell. This gene is part of a large family of olfactory receptors, which are the largest gene family in the human genome, highlighting the diversity and specificity required for olfactory function.
