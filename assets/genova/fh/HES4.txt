# HES4

## Overview
HES4, or Hairy and Enhancer of Split 4, is a gene that encodes the hes family bHLH transcription factor 4, a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during various developmental processes and cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, and maintenance of stem cell populations. HES4 is involved in osteogenesis, T-cell development, and retinal development, among other processes, by modulating the expression of specific target genes (De2020HES1; Cakouros2015Novel; El2012Hes4). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in diseases such as Huntington's disease and various cancers, where it may serve as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target (Tan2024HES4; Bai2014Epigenetic).

## Function
HES4 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and maintenance of stem cell populations. In bone marrow stromal/stem cells (BMSC), HES4 promotes osteogenesis by enhancing the expression of osteogenic markers such as Runx2, osteocalcin, and osteopontin, while inhibiting adipogenesis by reducing the expression of adipogenic markers like PPARγ2, adiponectin, and adipsin (Cakouros2015Novel). HES4 interacts with Twist-1, alleviating its repression of Runx2, thereby facilitating osteogenic differentiation (Cakouros2015Novel).

In the context of early human T-cell development, HES4 is upregulated in a Notch-dependent manner and is essential for promoting T-lineage differentiation, although it does not repress B-cell development like its counterpart HES1 (De2020HES1). HES4 also plays a role in retinal development by maintaining retinal precursor cells in a proliferative state, delaying their differentiation, and influencing the balance between neuronal and glial cell production (El2012Hes4). In the forebrain, HES4 regulates neuronal development by controlling cell-fate determination and the induction of terminal differentiation (Bai2014Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
The HES4 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression and epigenetic regulation. In Huntington's disease (HD), epigenetic dysregulation of HES4 is associated with striatal degeneration. Studies have shown that DNA methylation changes in the HES4 promoter lead to reduced mRNA levels, which correlate with the severity of striatal degeneration and age of onset in HD patients (Bai2014Epigenetic). The downregulation of HES4 exacerbates mutant HTT-induced aggregates and cell death, suggesting a pathological role in HD (Bai2014Epigenetic).

In cancer, HES4 expression levels have been linked to disease prognosis. In bladder cancer, HES4 is considered a potential biomarker, with its expression levels correlating with immune cell abundance and drug sensitivity (Tan2024HES4). In high-grade osteosarcoma, high HES4 expression is associated with poor survival and increased metastasis, indicating its role in the aggressiveness of the disease (McManus2016Hes4:). These findings suggest that HES4 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
HES4, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is involved in several interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In the context of colorectal cancer, HES4 interacts with the protein BEST4. This interaction has been demonstrated through various experimental techniques, including co-immunoprecipitation assays, which confirm the physical interaction between HES4 and BEST4 proteins. Immunofluorescence staining has shown nuclear co-localization of HES4 and BEST4, suggesting a close physical association within the cell nucleus (Wang2023Bestrophin4).

HES4 is also implicated in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer cells. It interacts with BEST4 to downregulate Twist1, a transcription factor that promotes EMT. This interaction is part of a regulatory axis involving HES4, BEST4, and Twist1, which collectively suppresses EMT by modulating the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers (Wang2023Bestrophin4).

While HES4's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond BEST4 are not detailed in the provided context, its role in transcriptional regulation suggests potential interactions with other transcription factors or co-repressors (De2020HES1).
