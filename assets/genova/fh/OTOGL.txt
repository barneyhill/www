# OTOGL

## Overview
The OTOGL gene encodes the otogelin-like protein, a large secreted protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of the inner ear. This protein is categorized as part of the epithelial-secreted mucin family and is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of acellular membranes within the cochlea and vestibular system, such as the tectorial membrane. The otogelin-like protein is essential for the mechanical coupling between the tectorial membrane and the outer hair cell stereocilia, contributing to proper mechanoelectrical transduction and hearing sensitivity. Mutations in the OTOGL gene can lead to moderate sensorineural hearing loss, underscoring its critical role in auditory function (Yariz2012Mutations; Avan2019Otogelin).

## Structure
The OTOGL gene encodes the otogelin-like protein, which is a large secreted protein involved in the structural integrity of the inner ear. The primary structure of the otogelin-like protein consists of 2,343 amino acids in humans and 2,454 in zebrafish (Yariz2012Mutations). The protein includes several specific domains: a signal peptide, four von Willebrand factor (vWF) domains, four cysteine-rich (C8) domains, an alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase B (AbfB) domain, three trypsin inhibitor-like (TIL) domains, and a C-terminal cysteine-knot (CTCK) domain (Bonnet2013Biallelic; Avan2019Otogelin). The CTCK domain is crucial for the antiparallel homodimerization of the protein, forming a highly force-resistant structure (Avan2019Otogelin).

The otogelin-like protein shares structural similarities with otogelin, another protein in the epithelial-secreted mucin family, with an amino acid identity of 33.3% and a similarity of 56.0% (Yariz2012Mutations). The protein's structure is conserved across species, including zebrafish, mice, and humans, indicating its essential role in the inner ear (Avan2019Otogelin). The protein is localized to the acellular membranes of the cochlea and vestibular system, where it plays a critical role in maintaining normal inner ear function (Yariz2012Mutations).

## Function
The OTOGL gene encodes the otogelin-like protein, which plays a critical role in the structural integrity and function of the inner ear. This protein is involved in the formation and maintenance of acellular membranes, such as the tectorial membrane, which is essential for normal hearing. The otogelin-like protein is structurally similar to the epithelial-secreted mucin protein family and is localized to the acellular membranes of the cochlea and vestibular system (Yariz2012Mutations; Avan2019Otogelin).

In the cochlea, otogelin-like protein contributes to the mechanical coupling between the tectorial membrane and the outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia. It forms links that connect stereocilia to each other and to the tectorial membrane, which are crucial for the cohesiveness of the hair bundle and proper mechanoelectrical transduction (Avan2019Otogelin). The protein's presence in the tectorial membrane and its interaction with other proteins like stereocilin are vital for the generation of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), which are important for hearing sensitivity and frequency discrimination (Bonnet2013Biallelic; Avan2019Otogelin).

Mutations in OTOGL can lead to moderate sensorineural hearing loss, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal auditory function (Yariz2012Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OTOGL gene are associated with moderate sensorineural hearing loss. This condition is characterized by hearing impairment without other associated symptoms, and it is often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. In studies involving families with affected individuals, various mutations in OTOGL have been identified, including homozygous one base pair deletions causing frameshifts and premature stop codons, as well as missense and splice site mutations. These genetic alterations lead to disruptions in the production and function of otogelin-like protein, which is crucial for the structural integrity of the inner ear (Yariz2012Mutations).

In zebrafish models, knockdown of otogl expression results in sensorineural hearing loss and anatomical changes in the inner ear, underscoring the gene's essential role in normal auditory function (Yariz2012Mutations). The mutations in OTOGL are absent in control samples and databases, suggesting a novel association with hearing loss (Yariz2012Mutations). The gene's expression is highest during embryonic stages and decreases in adulthood, indicating its importance in early ear development (Yariz2012Mutations). These findings highlight the clinical significance of OTOGL mutations in contributing to hearing impairments.

## Interactions
OTOGELIN-like (OTOGL) is a protein encoded by the OTOGL gene, primarily expressed in the inner ear. It plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of the tectorial membrane. OTOGL is known to interact with other proteins involved in the auditory process, particularly in the formation of structures within the cochlea. 

OTOGL, along with otogelin and stereocilin, contributes to the formation of horizontal top connectors and tectorial membrane-attachment crowns in outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia. These proteins form links that connect stereocilia to each other and to the tectorial membrane, which is essential for hearing. The interaction between these proteins is crucial for the proper connection of stereocilia to the tectorial membrane, with otogelin-like being particularly important in mature OHCs (Avan2019Otogelin).

The presence of otogelin-like is dependent on stereocilin, as it is not detected in its absence, indicating a close interaction between these proteins. Otogelin and stereocilin initially form immature crowns, and otogelin-like is incorporated at later stages, highlighting its role in the maturation of these structures (Avan2019Otogelin).
