# NMBR

## Overview
The NMBR gene encodes the neuromedin B receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis, glucose regulation, and smooth muscle contraction. The neuromedin B receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, such as the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it mediates responses to its ligand, neuromedin B. Through its interaction with G proteins and involvement in signaling pathways, NMBR influences cellular activities like tyrosine phosphorylation and the regulation of inflammatory mediators (Tsuda1997Neuromedin; Chen2020Neuromedin; Wada1991cDNA).

## Structure
The neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a seven transmembrane domain structure, typical of this receptor family (Kroog1995Mammalian; Wada1991cDNA). The primary structure of NMBR consists of 390 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 43 kDa (Kroog1995Mammalian; Wada1991cDNA). The receptor includes potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, particularly in the extracellular domains, which may influence its function and stability (Kroog1995Mammalian; Wada1991cDNA).

The secondary structure likely includes hydrophobic stretches that form the transmembrane helices, as suggested by hydropathy analysis (Wada1991cDNA). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices to form a functional receptor capable of binding its ligand, neuromedin B, with high affinity. The fifth transmembrane segment is critical for this high-affinity binding, with specific amino acids such as Ile216 playing a crucial role (Kroog1995Mammalian; Fathi1993The).

Post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, are implicated in receptor internalization and signal transduction, affecting the receptor's activity and signaling pathways (Kroog1995Mammalian). The NMBR is expressed in various tissues, including neural, neuroendocrine, and gastrointestinal tissues, with distinct distribution patterns (Kroog1995Mammalian).

## Function
The neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. It is primarily involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, glucose and insulin regulation, satiety, and lung development and response to injury (Jensen2007International). NMBR is expressed in several tissues, including the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, where it influences smooth muscle contraction, feeding behavior, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, body temperature, and cell growth (Chen2020Neuromedin).

At the molecular level, NMBR activation leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (p125 FAK), a process that is independent of phospholipase C and does not require changes in intracellular calcium levels. This phosphorylation involves the small GTP-binding protein rho p21 and the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, indicating a role in cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion (Tsuda1997Neuromedin). NMBR is also involved in the upregulation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and type 2 cyclo-oxygenase enzyme (COX-2) expression in human primary myometrial cells, mediated through the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factors (Chen2020Neuromedin).

## Interactions
The neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) interacts with various proteins and signaling pathways to mediate its physiological effects. NMBR is a G protein-coupled receptor that primarily interacts with G_q proteins to transduce signals. This interaction is crucial for the NMBR-mediated increase in T-type calcium channel currents, which are linked to pain hypersensitivity. The G_βγ subunit of the G_q protein is necessary for this response, indicating a specific interaction between NMBR and these G protein components (Zhang2021Neuromedin).

NMBR also engages in signaling pathways involving AMPK and PKA. AMPK acts as an upstream effector of PKA in the NMBR signaling pathway, and its activation is necessary for the NMB-induced PKA activation. This pathway is essential for the stimulatory effect of NMB on T-type calcium channels, highlighting a complex interaction network involving these kinases (Zhang2021Neuromedin).

In myometrial cells, NMBR influences the expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6) through the Rela/p65 pathway. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of IL-6 expression and involves changes in intracellular calcium levels, suggesting a role for NMBR in calcium signaling and inflammatory responses (Zhang2012Neuromedin).
