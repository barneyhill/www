The functional domains of p53 family proteins include an N-terminal transactivation domain, a central DNA-binding domain and an oligomerization domain. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternative promoters results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms that vary in their functional properties. These isoforms function during skin development and maintenance, adult stem/progenitor cell regulation, heart development and premature aging. Some isoforms have been found to protect the germline by eliminating oocytes or testicular germ cells that have suffered DNA damage. Mutations in this gene are associated with ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft lip/palate syndrome 3 (EEC3); split-hand/foot malformation 4 (SHFM4); ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-cleft lip/palate; ADULT syndrome (acro-dermato-ungual-lacrimal-tooth); limb-mammary syndrome; Rap-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS); and orofacial cleft 8.
