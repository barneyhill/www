# C16orf90

## Overview
C16orf90, or chromosome 16 open reading frame 90, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including post-translational modifications and apoptosis. The protein encoded by C16orf90 is implicated in neddylation-dependent and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathways, suggesting its role in protein turnover and regulation within the cell (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). It interacts with several proteins, such as RNF123 and NDFIP2, which are involved in ubiquitination and activation of E3-ubiquitin-protein ligases, indicating its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, C16orf90 has been associated with neurological disorders and sleep-disordered breathing, highlighting its significance in both cellular homeostasis and disease (Cade2021Wholegenome; Abedalthagafi2019Precsion). Despite its involvement in critical cellular functions, the precise molecular roles of C16orf90 remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further research to understand its complete range of interactions and functions.

## Function
C16orf90 is implicated in several cellular processes, primarily through its interactions with other proteins. It is suggested to be part of a protein-modifying enzyme complex, as its interacting partners are involved in post-translational modifications, such as neddylation-dependent and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). This indicates a potential role in protein turnover and regulation within the cell. The protein is also associated with apoptotic processes, as indicated by its link to the 'WP254~apoptosis' functional term, suggesting a role in programmed cell death (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In the context of cancer, C16orf90 interacts with proteins like RNF123 and NDFIP2, which are involved in ubiquitination and activation of E3-ubiquitin-protein ligases, highlighting its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, C16orf90 has been identified as significantly mutated in CYT-high metastatic skin tumors, which are characterized by high cytolytic activity, suggesting a possible role in the immune microenvironment of tumors (Roufas2021Distinct).

Overall, while the precise molecular functions of C16orf90 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in protein modification and apoptosis, as well as its potential roles in cancer, underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease.

## Clinical Significance
C16orf90 has been implicated in several neurological and sleep-related disorders. Genetic studies have identified de novo and recessive variants of C16orf90 associated with intellectual disability (ID), highlighting the gene's role in the genetic heterogeneity and complexity of ID (Abedalthagafi2019Precsion). In the context of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), C16orf90 has been significantly associated with the Per90 phenotype in Hispanic males, suggesting a potential link to mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species (ROS) pathways, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of SDB through mechanisms involving neuronal dysfunction and inflammation (Cade2021Wholegenome).

In cancer research, C16orf90 is noted for its interactions with proteins involved in post-translational modifications, such as neddylation and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation, suggesting its involvement in protein-modifying enzyme complexes. This interaction indicates a potential role in apoptosis, although specific diseases directly associated with C16orf90 mutations or expression alterations in cancer are not detailed (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene is expressed only at the transcript level in cancer studies, suggesting it may be a 'missing' protein, with its broader roles in cancer progression and intercellular communication still under investigation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Interactions
C16orf90 is involved in several protein interactions that suggest its role in post-translational modifications and protein degradation pathways. It interacts with proteins such as BIRC2, ND-FIP1, NDFIP2, XIAP, RNF123, and TRAF2, indicating its potential involvement in neddylation-dependent and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation processes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Specifically, the interaction with RNF123 is associated with ubiquitination, while the interaction with NDFIP2 involves the activation of HECT domain-containing E3-ubiquitin-protein ligases, particularly in testis tissue, which is relevant to testicular germ cell tumors (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

C16orf90 is also implicated in apoptosis, sharing the 'WP254~apoptosis' functional term with C10orf67, suggesting a possible role in apoptotic pathways (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These interactions highlight the importance of C16orf90 in cellular signaling pathways and its potential relevance in cancer research and treatment. Despite these findings, the specific role of C16orf90 in cancer remains to be fully elucidated, and further research is needed to understand its complete range of interactions and functions (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
