# SPATA7

## Overview
SPATA7 is a gene that encodes the protein spermatogenesis associated 7, which is primarily involved in the maintenance and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. The SPATA7 protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and plays a crucial role in the organization of ciliary protein complexes, particularly within the connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells. This protein is essential for the proper localization and trafficking of other proteins, such as RPGRIP1, which are critical for retinal health and function (Eblimit2014Spata7; Kannabiran2020The). Mutations in the SPATA7 gene are linked to retinal dystrophies, including Leber congenital amaurosis and juvenile retinitis pigmentosa, conditions characterized by early-onset vision loss due to photoreceptor degeneration (Eblimit2014Spata7; Kannabiran2020The). The gene's role in retinal health underscores its importance in preventing degenerative retinal diseases (Lu2022Spata7).

## Structure
The SPATA7 protein is approximately 526 amino acids in length and contains a DNA binding motif and multiple phosphorylation sites, indicating potential post-translational modifications (Kannabiran2020The). The protein is associated with the photoreceptor axoneme and is involved in organizing ciliary protein complexes, crucial for its function in the retina (Kannabiran2020The). SPATA7 is proposed to be a novel microtubule-associated protein, although a direct interaction with microtubules has not been established (Eblimit2014Spata7). The N-terminal region of SPATA7, which contains a predicted coiled-coil domain, is crucial for its localization to the ciliary axoneme in ciliated cells (Eblimit2014Spata7). This domain is also important for its interaction with RPGRIP1, a protein involved in retinal degeneration-associated complexes (Eblimit2014Spata7). The interaction between SPATA7 and RPGRIP1 is specific, as SPATA7 does not co-precipitate with other coiled-coil domain-containing proteins such as IQCB1 and lebercilin (Eblimit2014Spata7). The SPATA7 gene encodes two transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing of exon 3, with variant 1 including exon 3 and variant 2 lacking it (Kannabiran2020The).

## Function
The SPATA7 gene encodes a microtubule-associated protein that plays a critical role in the maintenance and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. SPATA7 localizes to the connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells, a crucial structure for protein transport between the inner and outer segments of these cells (Eblimit2014Spata7). It is essential for the correct localization and trafficking of proteins such as RPGRIP1, which are involved in retinal ciliopathies (Eblimit2014Spata7). SPATA7 interacts with the coiled-coil domain of RPGRIP1, facilitating its proper localization to the microtubule cytoskeleton (Eblimit2014Spata7).

In healthy cells, SPATA7 is involved in the transport of rhodopsin across the connecting cilium, which is vital for photoreceptor function and survival (Eblimit2014Spata7). The absence of SPATA7 leads to mislocalization of rhodopsin and other proteins, resulting in photoreceptor degeneration (Eblimit2014Spata7). SPATA7 also maintains the integrity of the distal connecting cilium, ensuring the proper localization of proteins like AHI1 (Dharmat2018SPATA7). Its role in these processes is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of photoreceptor cells, preventing retinal degenerative diseases (Lu2022Spata7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPATA7 gene are linked to several retinal dystrophies, most notably Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and juvenile retinitis pigmentosa (RP). These conditions are characterized by early-onset vision loss due to photoreceptor degeneration. SPATA7 mutations often result in nonsense or frameshift mutations that lead to a loss of function, disrupting normal protein interactions essential for retinal health (Eblimit2014Spata7; Kannabiran2020The). 

The gene plays a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of the photoreceptor connecting cilium, a key component in the retina. Mutations in SPATA7 lead to mislocalization of proteins such as rhodopsin and RPGRIP1, causing defects in protein trafficking and subsequent photoreceptor cell degeneration (Dharmat2018SPATA7; Eblimit2014Spata7). This mislocalization is a primary defect observed in conditions like LCA and juvenile RP, where the degeneration of photoreceptors is progressive and primarily affects rod cells (Eblimit2014Spata7).

Phenotypic heterogeneity is common, with the same mutation potentially leading to different disease manifestations, such as early-onset RP or LCA, depending on the population (Kannabiran2020The). Despite its expression in spermatocytes, SPATA7 mutations are not commonly associated with infertility (Kannabiran2020The).

## Interactions
SPATA7 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the retina, particularly in the connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells. It interacts with several proteins involved in ciliary function and photoreceptor maintenance. SPATA7 has been shown to interact with RPGRIP1, a protein associated with X-linked retinitis pigmentosa, through its coiled-coil domain. This interaction is specific, as SPATA7 does not co-precipitate with other coiled-coil domain-containing proteins like IQCB1 and lebercilin (Eblimit2014Spata7). 

SPATA7 is also part of a protein complex that includes RPGR, NPHP1, NPHP4, and AHI1, which are crucial for maintaining the structure and function of the distal connecting cilium (DCC) in photoreceptors. The loss of SPATA7 leads to the mislocalization of these proteins, destabilizing the microtubule core and affecting photoreceptor function (Dharmat2018SPATA7). 

In addition, SPATA7 interacts with the NPHP-RPGR complex, including proteins like RPGR, RPGRIP1, NPHP1, NPHP4, and AHI1, as confirmed through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (Dharmat2018SPATA7). These interactions suggest that SPATA7 acts as a scaffold protein, essential for the proper localization and function of DCC proteins, and plays a role in microtubule stability (Lu2022Spata7).
