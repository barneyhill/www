# BLOC1S5

## Overview
BLOC1S5 is a gene that encodes the protein biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex 1 subunit 5, which is a critical component of the BLOC-1 complex. This protein is involved in the biogenesis and function of lysosome-related organelles (LROs), such as melanosomes and platelet δ-granules, by facilitating protein sorting and intracellular trafficking processes. As a cytoplasmic protein, BLOC1S5 acts as a molecular scaffold within the BLOC-1 complex, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of vesicle trafficking and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The proper function of BLOC1S5 is essential for pigmentation, hemostasis, and the stability of the BLOC-1 complex, with its dysfunction linked to conditions such as Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 11 and certain neurodevelopmental disorders (Hartwig2017Neurodevelopmental; Zhong2021A; Boeckelmann2021A).

## Function
The BLOC1S5 gene encodes a subunit of the BLOC-1 complex, which is crucial for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (LROs) such as melanosomes and platelet δ-granules. This complex is involved in protein sorting and recycling of endosomes, linking the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons to facilitate intracellular trafficking processes (Boeckelmann2021A). In healthy human cells, BLOC1S5, as part of the BLOC-1 complex, plays a significant role in the proper maturation, trafficking, and function of LROs, which are essential for pigmentation and platelet function (Zhong2021A; Boeckelmann2021A).

BLOC1S5 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the regulation of vesicle trafficking, particularly in the sorting and delivery of cargo proteins to lysosomes and other organelles (Boeckelmann2021A). The BLOC-1 complex, including BLOC1S5, acts as a molecular scaffold, recruiting motor proteins and engaging actin-driven forces to support the formation and elongation of recycling endosomal tubules, which are crucial for cellular homeostasis and various cellular functions (Delevoye2016BLOC1). The proper function of BLOC1S5 is vital for maintaining cellular processes related to pigmentation and hemostasis, as well as for the stability and function of the BLOC-1 complex (Hartwig2017Neurodevelopmental).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BLOC1S5 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 11 (HPS-11). This syndrome is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding diathesis. A specific pathogenic variant, c.181delC (p.Val61*), has been identified in patients with HPS-11, leading to symptoms such as hypopigmentation and mild bleeding diathesis (Zhong2021A). The BLOC1S5 gene is part of the BLOC-1 complex, which is crucial for the formation and function of lysosome-related organelles. Disruption of BLOC1S5 in zebrafish models has shown phenotypic abnormalities like small-eye phenotype, cardiovascular defects, and thrombocyte loss, indicating its role in hemostasis and endothelial cell function (Zhong2021A).

In addition to its role in HPS-11, BLOC1S5 is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Alterations in BLOC1S5 expression have been linked to intellectual and developmental disabilities, as its deficiency affects brain development and function, particularly in males (Lee2020Sex‐dimorphic; Hartwig2017Neurodevelopmental). Furthermore, BLOC1S5 is involved in cancer, with the BLOC1S5-TXNDC5 conjoined gene being up-regulated in breast cancer tissues, serving as a potential prognostic marker (Wang2022Identification).

## Interactions
BLOC1S5, also known as Muted, is a subunit of the Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex-1 (BLOC-1), which is involved in membrane protein trafficking and organelle biogenesis. BLOC1S5 interacts with other BLOC-1 subunits, including BLOC1S1, BLOC1S2, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S4, BLOC1S6, BLOC1S7, and BLOC1S8 (dysbindin) (Ambrosio2016Storage). It co-precipitates with BORCS6 in mammalian cells, suggesting a physical interaction that may indicate the existence of stable BLOC-1/BORC hybrid complexes or dynamic exchanges of subunits between these complexes (Hartwig2017Neurodevelopmental).

The BLOC-1 complex, including BLOC1S5, is involved in the transport of dense granule proteins during organelle biogenesis by interacting with the adaptor protein complex AP-3 and the endosomal SNARE syntaxin 13 (Ambrosio2016Storage). Although specific interactions of BLOC1S5 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, its role within the BLOC-1 complex suggests it participates in broader protein interactions necessary for lysosome-related organelle function and biogenesis. The stability of BLOC1S5 is interdependent with other BLOC-1 subunits, as the loss of one subunit, such as dysbindin, can lead to the down-regulation of BLOC1S5 (Hartwig2017Neurodevelopmental).
