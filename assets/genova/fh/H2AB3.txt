# H2AB3

## Overview
H2AB3 is a gene that encodes the H2A.B variant histone 3, a specialized histone protein involved in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. Unlike canonical histones, H2A.B is characterized by its unique structural features, including a more basic L2 loop and a distinctive N-terminal tail enriched with arginine residues, which influence its interaction with DNA and RNA (Soboleva2017A; Peng2020Molecular). This variant histone plays a crucial role in transcriptional initiation and pre-mRNA splicing, particularly in the testis and brain, by destabilizing nucleosomes and inhibiting chromatin compaction (Soboleva2017A). H2A.B.3 is also implicated in various cancers, where its reactivation is associated with splicing dysfunction and oncogenic transcriptional activity (Chew2021Short). The study of H2AB3 and its encoded protein continues to provide insights into its potential clinical significance in cancer diagnosis and treatment (Chew2021Short).

## Structure
H2AB3, also known as H2A.B, is a histone variant with distinct structural features compared to canonical histones. It is a 115 amino acid protein with 48% identity to the canonical H2A, lacking the last 19 C-terminal amino acids, similar to H2A.Z.2.2 (Cheema2015The). This variant is characterized by a more basic L2 loop and a continuous stretch of six arginines in the N-terminal tail, which influences its interaction with DNA (Peng2020Molecular). The absence of the C-terminal tail affects DNA stability at the entry/exit sites and interactions with the H3 αN (Peng2020Molecular).

H2A.B's structure prevents the formation of histone octameric complexes in solution, leading to nucleosomes that exhibit salt-dependent instability and an extended structure with flexible and detachable nucleotides at each flanking site (Cheema2015The). The variant's inability to form histone octamers is due to differences in the regulating-octamer-folding (ROF) sequence, which is not conserved in H2A.B (Zhou2020Structural). H2A.B nucleosomes favor open DNA states, which may enhance transcription and nucleosome disassembly processes (Kohestani2021Effects).

## Function
The histone variant H2A.B.3 plays a significant role in transcriptional initiation and pre-mRNA splicing, particularly in the testis and brain. It is involved in destabilizing nucleosomes and inhibiting chromatin compaction, which promotes transcription initiation and elongation (Soboleva2017A). H2A.B.3 is located at transcription start sites and within the gene body, with a higher abundance at the transcription start site, and is associated with active genes involved in RNA processing and function (Soboleva2017A).

H2A.B.3 directly interacts with RNA and splicing factors, suggesting it functions as an RNA binding protein. It is found at splicing speckles, nuclear compartments involved in RNA processing, indicating a role in transcription and splicing (Soboleva2017A). The presence of H2A.B.3 at intron-exon boundaries and its correlation with exon inclusion further supports its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing (Soboleva2017A).

H2A.B.3's ability to bind RNA and DNA, along with its interactions with RNA Polymerase II and RNA processing factors, suggests a competitive dynamic that may regulate transcription and splicing processes, particularly in tissues with high splicing activity (Soboleva2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the H2AB3 gene, also known as H2A.B variant histone 3, have been implicated in various cancers. The gene is reactivated in several cancer types, including diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), uterine corpus endometrial carcinomas, urothelial bladder carcinomas, and cervical squamous cell carcinomas (Chew2021Short). This reactivation is associated with splicing dysfunction, which is a common feature across many cancer types. The expression of H2A.B is linked to nucleosome destabilization, potentially allowing oncogenic transcription factors to access regulatory elements, thereby impacting gene expression in a cancer-specific manner (Chew2021Short).

The aberrant expression of H2A.B, including H2AB3, may contribute to cancer progression due to changes in X-chromosome ploidy or global derepression of large genomic domains (Chew2021Short). The gene's involvement in splicing and its potential role in oncogenesis suggest that it could have clinical significance in cancer diagnosis or treatment. The study of H2A.B's role in cancer is ongoing, with potential implications for the development of immunotherapies targeting sH2A-derived peptides and the generation of immunogenic neoantigens due to global splicing dysregulation (Chew2021Short).

## Interactions
H2A.B.3, a variant histone, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. It directly interacts with RNA both in vitro and in vivo, and these interactions are crucial for its function in RNA processing and transcriptional initiation (Soboleva2017A). H2A.B.3 is found at transcription start sites and intron-exon boundaries, where it associates with RNA processing factors and RNA Polymerase II, suggesting its involvement in transcription and splicing processes (Soboleva2017A).

The histone variant can replace H2A.Z at these sites, indicating a role in gene activation and splicing (Soboleva2017A). H2A.B.3 interacts with several proteins involved in transcription and RNA processing, such as Sf3b155, Spt6, DDX39A, and RNA Pol II, with some interactions being RNA-dependent (Soboleva2017A). It also co-localizes with splicing speckles and splicing factors, highlighting its role in RNA processing (Soboleva2017A).

H2A.B.3's ability to bind RNA is facilitated by its N-terminal tails, which are enriched with arginine residues, a common feature of RNA-binding proteins (Soboleva2017A). This binding ability may regulate its interactions with RNA Pol II and other factors, suggesting a competitive mechanism (Soboleva2017A).
