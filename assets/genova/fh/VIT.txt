# VIT

## Overview
The VIT gene encodes the protein vitrin, which is a component of the extracellular matrix and is characterized by its unique domain structure, including a single LCCL domain and two von Willebrand Factor A (VWA) domains. Vitrin is primarily synthesized in the developing mouse eye lens and is implicated in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions, similar to other proteins containing VWA domains such as matrilins and VWA collagens. The presence of conserved MIDAS motifs within these domains suggests a role in binding divalent cations, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. Although the specific functions of vitrin remain to be fully elucidated, its structural features imply a significant role in mediating interactions within the extracellular matrix, potentially influencing tissue development and integrity (Whittaker2002Distribution; Bishop2002The).

## Structure
Vitrin (VIT) is a protein characterized by its unique domain structure, which includes a single LCCL domain followed by two von Willebrand Factor A (VWA) domains. The LCCL domain is a common feature in proteins such as Limulus Factor C and cochlins, suggesting a role in extracellular matrix interactions (Whittaker2002Distribution). The VWA domains in vitrin are closely related to those found in matrilins, with a 51% bootstrap support indicating a clade relationship. These domains contain perfectly conserved MIDAS motifs, which are typically involved in binding divalent cations and are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Whittaker2002Distribution). 

The VWA domains are known for their role in cell adhesion and forming part of the extracellular matrix, similar to their function in other proteins like matrilins and VWA collagens (Whittaker2002Distribution). Vitrin is synthesized exclusively by the lens in the developing mouse eye, as shown by in situ hybridization studies, and its cDNA clones have been found only in a lens-specific library (Bishop2002The). The specific roles of the LCCL and VWA domains in vitrin's function remain to be fully elucidated, and there is no detailed information on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure (Bishop2002The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The VIT gene, encoding the protein vitrin, has been implicated in the modulation of brain asymmetry, which may have clinical significance in understanding certain neuropsychological disorders. Research has identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs11691187, located in the first intron of the VIT gene, as significantly associated with variations in brain asymmetry. This association suggests that alterations in VIT expression could influence structural brain asymmetry, potentially impacting conditions such as schizophrenia, where altered asymmetry of the anterior cingulate cortex has been observed (Tadayon2016Common).

The expression of the VIT gene in the left anterior cingulate cortex has been correlated with brain asymmetry scores, indicating that changes in VIT expression may be linked to variations in brain asymmetry. This could have implications for conditions like Alzheimer's disease, although direct evidence of diseases resulting from mutations in the VIT gene is not provided (Tadayon2016Common). The study highlights the potential role of VIT in brain asymmetry and related cognitive conditions, suggesting that further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance (Tadayon2016Common).

## Interactions
Vitrin (VIT) is a protein that contains von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domains, which are known for their roles in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions. These domains are involved in protein-protein interactions, often requiring divalent cations, and are components of multiprotein complexes (Whittaker2002Distribution). The VWA domains in vitrin are structurally similar to those found in matrilins and VWA collagens, suggesting potential functional similarities in protein-protein interactions (Whittaker2002Distribution).

Although specific interactions of vitrin with other proteins are not detailed, its VWA domains are likely involved in such interactions due to their structural features and conservation. These domains are implicated in cation binding and protein-protein interactions, which are essential for the protein's role in the extracellular matrix (Whittaker2002Distribution). Vitrin's potential to serve as a bridge between collagen fibrils and the hyaluronan network in cartilage further suggests its involvement in structural interactions within the extracellular matrix (Sato2006Comparative).

Overall, while direct interactions of vitrin with specific proteins or nucleic acids are not explicitly documented, its domain structure and sequence similarities imply a role in mediating interactions within the extracellular matrix.
