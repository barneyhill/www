# ATAD3C

## Overview
ATAD3C is a gene that encodes the protein ATPase family AAA domain containing 3C, which is a member of the ATPase family associated with various cellular activities. This protein is characterized by the presence of an AAA domain, which is crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis, facilitating energy-dependent processes within the cell. ATAD3C plays a significant role in mitochondrial function, and its structural integrity is essential for proper cellular operations. The protein's involvement in mitochondrial dynamics is underscored by its association with severe clinical conditions when mutations or duplications occur in the ATAD3 locus, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and related pathologies (Frazier2021Fatal; Gunning2020Recurrent). Understanding the structure and function of ATAD3C is vital for elucidating its role in cellular mechanisms and its impact on human health.

## Structure
ATAD3C is a protein that belongs to the ATPase family AAA domain-containing proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes. The primary structure of ATAD3C consists of its specific amino acid sequence, which determines its unique characteristics and functions. The secondary structure of ATAD3C includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation.

The tertiary structure of ATAD3C refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its interaction with other molecules and its role in cellular processes. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple subunits, which may be necessary for its full functional activity.

ATAD3C contains specific domains, such as the AAA domain, which is essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis. This domain plays a critical role in the protein's function, as it is involved in energy-dependent processes within the cell. Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of ATAD3C can influence its function and localization, potentially affecting its role in cellular activities. These structural features and modifications are vital for understanding the protein's function and its involvement in various cellular mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATAD3C gene are associated with several severe clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial function. Recurrent de novo duplications in the ATAD3 locus, which includes ATAD3C, lead to the formation of chimeric ATAD3A/ATAD3C proteins. These chimeric proteins disrupt ATAD3 oligomerization, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and are linked to severe conditions such as cardiomyopathy, perinatal death, and cardiac complex I deficiency (Frazier2021Fatal). The ATAD3 locus is a hotspot for genomic variations, and duplications involving ATAD3C are associated with pediatric mitochondrial diseases, particularly lethal perinatal presentations characterized by cardiomyopathy and severe pontocerebellar hypoplasia (Frazier2021Fatal).

The pathogenicity of these duplications is likely related to the expression of a chimeric ATAD3A/ATAD3C protein, which disrupts mitochondrial and cholesterol metabolism (Gunning2020Recurrent). This disruption is linked to a severe neonatal phenotype, including symptoms such as corneal clouding, cardiomyopathy, and hypotonia, with affected individuals often dying within six weeks of life (Gunning2020Recurrent). These findings underscore the critical role of ATAD3C in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and its involvement in severe mitochondrial disorders.
