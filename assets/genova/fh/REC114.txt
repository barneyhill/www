# REC114

## Overview
REC114 is a gene that encodes the REC114 meiotic recombination protein, which plays a pivotal role in the process of meiotic recombination. This protein is integral to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), a crucial step in homologous chromosome recombination during meiosis. The REC114 protein is characterized by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-like fold, which is conserved across various species, including yeast, plants, and animals (Boekhout2018REC114). Functioning as a regulatory subunit within the TOPOVIL complex, REC114 interacts with proteins such as TOPOVIBL, MEI4, and ANKRD31 to facilitate the initiation and regulation of DSBs, particularly in subtelomeric regions (Nore2021TOPOVIBLREC114; Kumar2018Mouse). Mutations in the REC114 gene have been associated with female infertility, underscoring its essential role in meiotic processes and fertility (Wang2019Homozygous).

## Structure
The REC114 meiotic recombination protein is characterized by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-like fold in its N-terminal region, which is highly similar to the N-terminal domain of coactivator-associated methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) (Kumar2018Mouse; Boekhout2018REC114). This domain consists of two perpendicular antiparallel β-sheets followed by a C-terminal helix, forming a β-sandwich fold (Kumar2018Mouse; Boekhout2018REC114). The PH domain is conserved across different species, including yeast, plants, and animals, despite lacking significant primary sequence similarity (Boekhout2018REC114).

The interaction of REC114 with ANKRD31 is crucial for its function, with the N-terminal two-thirds of REC114 (amino acids 1-147) interacting with the C-terminal tail of ANKRD31 to form an intermolecular sandwich fold (Boekhout2018REC114). This interaction is stabilized by hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions, with specific residues like S56, R27, E83, and R114 playing key roles (Boekhout2018REC114).

In terms of quaternary structure, REC114 forms a complex with MEI4, which is essential for meiotic DNA double-strand break formation. This complex is involved in the recruitment of REC114 to the chromosome axis, facilitated by IHO1 (Kumar2018Mouse). The interaction with MEI4 involves the C-terminal region of REC114, which contains the SSM7 motif overlapping with a predicted α helical structure (Kumar2018Mouse).

## Function
REC114 is a protein that plays a crucial role in meiotic recombination, a process essential for genetic diversity and proper chromosome segregation during meiosis. It is involved in the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are necessary for homologous chromosome recombination. REC114 functions as a regulatory subunit within the TOPOVIL complex, interacting directly with TOPOVIBL to facilitate the initiation and regulation of DSBs (Nore2021TOPOVIBLREC114). This interaction is essential for the efficiency and timing of DSB activity, particularly in subtelomeric regions, which are important for X/Y chromosome synapsis and segregation (Nore2021TOPOVIBLREC114).

REC114 also interacts with other proteins such as MEI4 and ANKRD31, forming complexes that are crucial for targeting specific genomic regions for DSB formation (Kumar2018Mouse; Boekhout2018REC114). The protein is active in the nucleus during the early stages of meiosis, ensuring the proper assembly of recombination machinery on chromosomes (Boekhout2018REC114). Mutations in REC114 can lead to defects in DSB formation, resulting in issues with homologous synapsis and fertility (Wang2019Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the REC114 gene have been linked to female infertility, characterized by multiple pronuclei formation and early embryonic arrest. Two specific mutations have been identified: a missense mutation c.397T>G (p.C133G) and a splicing mutation c.546+5G>A. The missense mutation occurs in a highly conserved motif of the REC114 protein, leading to reduced protein levels and instability, which affects the stability of its partner protein MEI4, resulting in its rapid degradation. This disruption in protein stability is crucial as REC114 is essential for stabilizing MEI4, a function lost in the C133G mutant (Wang2019Homozygous). The splicing mutation causes abnormal splicing, leading to a frameshift and premature termination of the protein, further contributing to infertility (Wang2019Homozygous).

These mutations were identified in individuals from consanguineous families who experienced recurrent failures in assisted reproduction techniques, such as IVF and ICSI. The mutations were associated with abnormal fertilization patterns, including multiple pronuclei formation and early embryonic arrest, highlighting a unique phenotype of female infertility linked to REC114 mutations (Wang2019Homozygous). These findings underscore the critical role of REC114 in normal meiotic processes and its impact on fertility.

## Interactions
REC114 is a protein involved in meiotic recombination, forming essential interactions with other proteins to facilitate DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation. In mice, REC114 interacts directly with MEI4, and this interaction is crucial for their localization to the meiotic chromosome axis. The N-terminal fragment of MEI4 can be co-purified with the C-terminal region of REC114, forming a stable complex, which suggests a direct interaction between these proteins (Kumar2018Mouse). REC114 and MEI4 co-localize on the chromosome axis, and their localization is mutually dependent, indicating a reciprocal requirement for their interaction (Kumar2018Mouse).

REC114 also interacts with IHO1, which is necessary for the recruitment of REC114 and MEI4 to the chromosome axis, forming a multiprotein complex that is essential for DSB formation (Kumar2018Mouse). This complex is thought to control the catalytic activity of SPO11/TOPOVIBL, which is crucial for initiating DSBs (Kumar2018Mouse).

In addition to its interactions with MEI4 and IHO1, REC114 interacts with ANKRD31, which regulates the number, timing, and location of meiotic DNA breaks. ANKRD31 is essential for the proper assembly of REC114 complexes on chromosomes, influencing DSB formation during meiosis (Boekhout2018REC114).
