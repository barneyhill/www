# AMPD2

## Overview
AMPD2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2, which is a critical component of the purine nucleotide cycle. This enzyme is categorized as a deaminase and is primarily involved in the conversion of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), a reaction essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and regulating nucleotide levels. The AMPD2 protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in intermediary metabolism, particularly in non-striated muscle tissues. Additionally, AMPD2 is expressed on the surface of human immune cells, where it influences extracellular adenine nucleotide metabolism, thereby modulating inflammatory responses. Mutations in the AMPD2 gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in both neurological and metabolic processes (Van1995Characterization; Kortüm2018Clinical; Ehlers2021Surface).

## Structure
The AMPD2 protein, also known as isoform L, is a 760-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 88.1 kDa (BauschJurken1992Molecular). The primary structure of AMPD2 includes conserved C-terminal catalytic domains and divergent N-terminal domains, which are subject to alternative splicing and result in variable N-terminal extensions (Van1995Characterization; Haas2003Nterminal). These N-terminal extensions influence the enzyme's regulatory behavior and are characterized by high proline content, affecting the protein's elution behavior in gel filtration chromatography (Haas2003Expression).

The tertiary structure of AMPD2 is suggested to be tetrameric, as indicated by chemical crosslinking experiments, which show that the protein is composed of four subunits (Haas2003Expression). The quaternary structure is further supported by the observation that the 1A/2 and 1B/2 enzymes, like the DD184(1B=2) protein, form tetramers (Haas2003Expression).

AMPD2 contains a conserved motif, SLSTDDP, within its C-terminal domain, which is similar to the catalytic site of murine adenosine deaminase (BauschJurken1992Molecular). The protein is sensitive to proteolysis, which can complicate in vitro studies (Haas2003Nterminal).

## Function
AMPD2 (adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the purine nucleotide cycle by catalyzing the deamination of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP). This process is essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and regulating nucleotide levels within cells (Van1995Characterization; BauschJurken1992Molecular). AMPD2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in intermediary metabolism and energy balance, particularly in non-striated muscle environments (Haas2003Nterminal).

In addition to its intracellular functions, AMPD2 is expressed on the surface of human immune cells, where it influences extracellular adenine nucleotide metabolism. This surface expression allows AMPD2 to modulate the balance of ATP and adenosine, which are critical for inflammatory responses (Ehlers2021Surface). The enzyme's activity on the cell surface can alter the extracellular environment by modifying the ATP-adenosine balance, potentially exerting anti-inflammatory effects through its product, IMP (Ehlers2021Surface). AMPD2's role in both intracellular and extracellular contexts highlights its importance in energy metabolism and immune regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AMPD2 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 9 (PCH9) is a severe condition caused by biallelic variants in AMPD2. It is characterized by postnatal microcephaly, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and pons, and hypoplastic or absent corpus callosum. Patients with PCH9 often exhibit severe developmental delay, spasticity, and central visual impairment. Brain imaging typically reveals hypomyelination and atrophy of the cerebral cortex (Kortüm2018Clinical). The pathogenic mechanisms of PCH9 involve adenosine-mediated neurotoxicity and defective GTP-dependent protein translation (Kortüm2018Clinical).

In some cases, AMPD2 variants are linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 63 (HSP63), a milder condition compared to PCH9. This difference in severity may be due to the presence of some intact isoforms of AMPD2 in HSP63, while PCH9 results from a broader absence of the enzyme (Camici2023Inborn; Kortüm2018Clinical).

In mice, mutations in the AMPD2 gene have been associated with nephrotic syndrome and hypercholesterolemia, indicating a potential role in kidney function and lipid metabolism (Helmering2014A). These findings suggest that AMPD2 is crucial for both neurological and metabolic processes.
