# KIAA1217

## Overview
KIAA1217 is a human gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell signaling, and intracellular transport. The protein, also referred to as KIAA1217, is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a crucial role in maintaining cell structure and facilitating intercellular communication. This gene is notably expressed in the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs, suggesting its importance in spinal function and flexibility. Mutations in KIAA1217 have been linked to vertebral malformations and other skeletal abnormalities, highlighting its role in skeletal development. Additionally, KIAA1217 is implicated in several pathological conditions, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where it influences disease progression through various signaling pathways (Al2020KIAA1217:; Karasugi2009Association; Wang2021KIAA1217).

## Structure


## Function
The KIAA1217 gene, also known as SKT, is implicated in the development and maintenance of the nucleus pulposus within intervertebral discs (IVDs) in humans. This gene is specifically expressed in the nucleus pulposus, suggesting a role in maintaining the structural integrity of IVDs, which are crucial for spinal function and flexibility (Karasugi2009Association). In mice, the murine homolog of KIAA1217, known as Skt, is involved in the later stages of nucleus pulposus growth and hypertrophy, with mutations leading to progressive abnormalities in IVDs. This indicates a potential similar function in humans, where KIAA1217 may contribute to the structural and functional maintenance of the spine (Karasugi2009Association).

The protein encoded by KIAA1217 is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell signaling, and intracellular transport. It is active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence cellular dynamics and organismal development. These activities suggest that KIAA1217 plays a role in maintaining cell structure and facilitating communication between cells, which are essential for normal cellular function and development (Karasugi2009Association).

## Clinical Significance
The KIAA1217 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes and signaling pathways. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KIAA1217 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. It promotes metastasis by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway, as well as the Notch and Wnt/β-catenin pathways (Wang2021KIAA1217). High expression levels of KIAA1217 correlate with shorter survival times in HCC patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2021KIAA1217).

KIAA1217 is also associated with vertebral malformations (VMs). Rare functional variants in the gene have been identified in individuals with isolated and syndromic VMs, indicating its role in skeletal development and potential contribution to these conditions (Al2020KIAA1217:). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a fusion gene involving KIAA1217 and RET has been identified, which acts as an oncogenic driver by activating the PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathways. This fusion gene is sensitive to specific inhibitors, highlighting its significance in targeted cancer therapy (Lee2016Identification).
