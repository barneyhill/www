# CDX2

## Overview
The CDX2 gene encodes the caudal type homeobox 2 protein, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. This protein is characterized by a homeobox domain, which facilitates its binding to DNA, thereby influencing the expression of genes essential for maintaining the intestinal phenotype (Witek2014A; MITCHELMORE2000Interaction). CDX2 is predominantly expressed in the nuclei of cells within the small intestine and colon, where it activates intestine-specific genes and contributes to the morphogenesis and maintenance of the intestinal epithelium (Hinoi2002CDX2; Mallo1997Molecular). Beyond its physiological roles, CDX2 is clinically significant due to its involvement in various cancers, including colorectal cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, where its expression levels can influence disease prognosis and progression (Scholl2007The; Tï¿½th2018Loss). As such, CDX2 serves as both a critical regulator of intestinal development and a potential biomarker in oncology.

## Structure
The CDX2 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a canonical structure comprising three exons and two introns, resulting in a protein of 313 amino acids (Witek2014A). It includes an amino-terminal transactivation region and a carboxy-terminal homeobox binding domain, which is crucial for its function in DNA binding (Witek2014A; MITCHELMORE2000Interaction). The homeobox domain typically forms a helix-turn-helix structure, a common motif in DNA-binding proteins.

CDX2 undergoes alternative splicing, producing variants such as CDX2/AS and miniCDX2. The CDX2/AS variant has a truncated homeodomain replaced by a novel 45 amino acid domain enriched in serine and arginine residues, suggesting a role in splicing rather than transcription (Witek2014A). MiniCDX2, another splice variant, retains the DNA-binding homeodomain but lacks the transactivation domain, exerting a dominant-negative effect on CDX2's transcriptional activity (Balbinot2017Finetuning).

CDX2 is known to interact with other proteins, such as HNF1α, through its homeodomain, which may lead to synergistic activation of target genes (MITCHELMORE2000Interaction). The protein's nuclear localization is essential for its function, with specific domains influencing its stability and trafficking (Witek2014A).

## Function
The CDX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. It is primarily active in the nuclei of cells in the small intestine and colon, where it regulates the expression of genes critical for maintaining the intestinal phenotype (Hinoi2002CDX2; Mallo1997Molecular). CDX2 is involved in the transcriptional activation of intestine-specific genes, such as sucrase-isomaltase, which is expressed in differentiated enterocytes (Lorentz1997Key; Mallo1997Molecular).

In healthy human cells, CDX2 influences cell proliferation and differentiation by promoting the expression of differentiation markers and enhancing cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions. It regulates molecules like E-cadherin and integrins, which are important for cellular adhesion and interaction (Lorentz1997Key). CDX2 also plays a role in specifying and maintaining intestinal cell fate during development and in adult tissues, contributing to the morphogenesis and maintenance of the intestinal epithelium (Hinoi2002CDX2; Suh1996An). The gene's expression is modulated by extracellular matrix components, such as laminin-1, which further promotes intestinal cell differentiation (Lorentz1997Key).

## Clinical Significance
The CDX2 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various cancers and hematological disorders. In colorectal cancer, CDX2 is often considered a tumor suppressor, with its reduced expression linked to poor prognosis, higher tumor grade, and advanced stage. Loss of CDX2 expression is associated with liver metastasis and is correlated with DNA repair protein deficiencies, such as mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) (Olsen2014The; Tï¿½th2018Loss). CDX2 is also implicated in the serrated pathway of colorectal cancer, characterized by BRAF mutations and MMR deficiency (Dawson2013Possible).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CDX2 is aberrantly expressed in most cases and promotes leukemogenesis. Its expression correlates with disease burden and progression, and it is involved in the dysregulation of HOX genes, which are critical in leukemogenesis (Scholl2007The). CDX2 expression is also detected in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), where it correlates with disease progression (Scholl2007The). These findings highlight CDX2's role in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CDX2 is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in intestinal gene regulation. CDX2 physically interacts with the transcription factor HNF1α to synergistically activate the lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH) gene promoter. This interaction involves the homeodomain regions of both proteins and is crucial for the activation of intestine-specific genes (MITCHELMORE2000Interaction). The N-terminal activation domain of CDX2 is essential for maximal synergy with HNF1α, although some interaction persists even when this domain is partially deleted (MITCHELMORE2000Interaction).

CDX2 also interacts with β-catenin, disrupting the β-catenin-TCF protein complex, which is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction inhibits β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity, affecting the expression of Wnt target genes. The interaction is mediated by a conserved subdomain in the N-terminus of CDX2, specifically between amino acids 15 and 50 (Guo2009The).

In addition, CDX2 forms complexes with other transcription factors such as GATA6 and HNF4A, depending on the cell state. These interactions are associated with active chromatin states and are crucial for maintaining intestinal epithelial differentiation and proliferation (Verzi2010Differentiation-Specific).
