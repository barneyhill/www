# SLC4A1AP

## Overview
The SLC4A1AP gene encodes the solute carrier family 4 member 1 adaptor protein, also known as Kanadaptin. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including interactions with other proteins and potential roles in disease pathways. As an adaptor protein, it is implicated in the regulation of ion transport and cellular homeostasis, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Research has highlighted its potential involvement in neurological disorders and metabolic conditions, as well as its association with cancer-related pathways (Zhang2018Powerful; Ray2023Extended; Goes2015Genome‐wide; Gao2022Pancancer).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The SLC4A1AP gene has been implicated in several conditions through genome-wide association studies. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a study identified the variant rs17006206 in the SLC4A1AP gene as showing suggestive significance in individuals of African ancestry, indicating a potential association with AD, although this finding is not definitive (Ray2023Extended). In schizophrenia, the SLC4A1AP gene is located near a significant marker identified in a meta-analysis involving Ashkenazi Jews, suggesting a possible association with the disorder, primarily driven by a larger dataset (Goes2015Genome‐wide). 

Additionally, the SLC4A1AP gene has been associated with fasting glucose levels. A study using a novel statistical method identified SLC4A1AP as significantly associated with fasting glucose, although previous studies did not find significant SNPs in this gene (Zhang2018Powerful). 

In cancer research, SLC4A1AP, also known as Kanadaptin, shows a positive correlation with the expression of the DDX1 gene, which is involved in pathways related to tumorigenesis, such as RNA transport and homologous recombination (Gao2022Pancancer). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations in SLC4A1AP are not detailed in the provided context.
