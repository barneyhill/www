# OR2A7

## Overview
The OR2A7 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily A member 7, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system. However, OR2A7 is also expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, such as the skin, where it participates in important cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and melanogenesis. The receptor's activation by specific ligands, such as cyclohexyl salicylate, initiates signaling pathways that influence intracellular calcium and cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, ultimately affecting protein phosphorylation and cellular outcomes. These functions suggest that OR2A7 may have broader physiological roles beyond olfaction, contributing to epidermal homeostasis and repair mechanisms (Wojcik2018Functional; Tsai2016Two).

## Function
OR2A7, an olfactory receptor, is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and is involved in detecting odor molecules. It is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including the skin, where it plays a role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and melanogenesis. In human melanocytes, OR2A7 is activated by cyclohexyl salicylate (CHS), leading to increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. This activation triggers a signaling cascade involving the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and a reduction in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which enhances melanin biosynthesis and influences melanocyte growth and differentiation (Wojcik2018Functional).

OR2A7 is also expressed in keratinocytes, where it influences cell proliferation and cytokinesis. Activation by specific ligands induces calcium signaling and affects the phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as AKT and Chk-2 (Tsai2016Two). The receptor's role in these processes suggests its involvement in maintaining epidermal homeostasis and repair, potentially impacting skin pigmentation and wound healing (Wojcik2018Functional; Tsai2016Two).
