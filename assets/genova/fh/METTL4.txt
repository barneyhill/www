# METTL4

## Overview
The METTL4 gene encodes the protein methyltransferase 4, N6-adenosine, which is a member of the MT-A70 family of methyltransferases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of RNA molecules, specifically catalyzing the N6-methylation of adenosine residues. METTL4 plays a critical role in RNA modification processes, including the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing through the methylation of U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). The protein functions as a monomer and is characterized by a conserved methyltransferase domain essential for its enzymatic activity. METTL4's interactions with nucleic acids and proteins are significant in various cellular processes, including cancer progression and metastasis, where it acts as a mediator of epigenetic modifications (Chen2020METTL4; Hsu2022METTL4mediated; Goh2020METTL4).

## Structure
The METTL4 protein is a member of the MT-A70 family of methyltransferases and is involved in N6-adenosine methylation. The primary structure of METTL4 includes a conserved methyltransferase (MTase) domain characterized by a DPPW motif, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Luo2022Structural; Goh2020METTL4). 

The secondary structure of METTL4 features a classic sandwich-fold within the MTase domain, flanked by two domains from the N-terminal extended region: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the middle domain (MID). The NTD is composed of five α-helices and three β-strands, while the MID consists of five β-strands and three short α-helices with an Ig-like fold (Luo2022Structural). 

In terms of tertiary structure, METTL4 forms a preformed L-shaped, positively-charged cavity surrounded by four loops, which is crucial for substrate binding and catalytic activity (Luo2022Structural). The C-terminal extension (CE) of METTL4 stabilizes the NTD and MID domains through specific interactions (Luo2022Structural).

Unlike METTL3, METTL4 functions as a monomer and does not require a partner protein to form a functional enzyme, achieving structural integrity through extensive interactions among its domains (Luo2022Structural).

## Function
METTL4 is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in RNA modification, specifically catalyzing the N6-methylation of adenosine residues in RNA molecules. In healthy human cells, METTL4 is primarily localized in the nucleus and is responsible for the methylation of U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) at the N6 position of adenosine, converting it to m6Am. This modification is essential for the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression (Chen2020METTL4; Goh2020METTL4).

The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining proper RNA splicing, particularly affecting splicing events governed by 3' splice site features. METTL4-dependent splicing events often involve changes in alternative 3' splice sites and are associated with weak 3' splice site strength in cassette exons (Goh2020METTL4). The absence of METTL4 leads to disruptions in the splicing of specific mRNAs, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular function and homeostasis (Goh2020METTL4).

Structurally, METTL4 is part of the MT-A70 family of methyltransferases and functions as a monomer. It has a preference for methylating Am over A, and its enzymatic activity is facilitated by a catalytic pocket that specifically recognizes and stabilizes the target base for methylation (Luo2022Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the METTL4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer progression and metastasis. METTL4 is involved in nuclear N6-deoxyadenosine methylation, which is crucial for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor metastasis under hypoxic conditions. Increased levels of METTL4 and its associated 6mA methylation are linked to poor prognosis in upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) patients, as demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier analysis (Hsu2022METTL4mediated). The gene's expression is upregulated by hypoxia through HIF-1α, which directly binds to the METTL4 promoter, enhancing its role in metastasis by activating multiple metastasis-inducing targets (Hsu2022METTL4mediated).

METTL4 also interacts with lncRNA RP11-390F4.3, which collaborates in activating EMT regulators, further promoting metastasis. High expression of this lncRNA correlates with worse survival in head and neck cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Hsu2022METTL4mediated). The study highlights the HIF-1α-METTL4-lncRNA RP11-390F4.3 axis as a key regulatory pathway in hypoxia-induced tumor progression, making METTL4 a potential therapeutic target for controlling metastasis in cancers such as UTUC and head and neck cancer (Hsu2022METTL4mediated).

## Interactions
METTL4 is involved in several interactions with nucleic acids and proteins, playing a crucial role in RNA and DNA methylation processes. It specifically targets U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) for m6Am methylation, a modification that requires pre-existing 2′-O-methylation on the RNA substrate (Chen2020METTL4). METTL4's interaction with RNA is facilitated by its ability to recognize and methylate specific adenosine residues, as demonstrated in structural studies that highlight its substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism (Luo2022Structural).

In the context of cancer, METTL4 interacts with long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-390F4.3, promoting metastasis through N6-deoxyadenosine methylation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of multiple metastasis-inducing targets, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulators (Hsu2022METTL4mediated). METTL4 also interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) and its co-activator ZMIZ1, enhancing the expression of hypoxia-induced genes and contributing to tumor progression (Hsu2022METTL4mediated).

These interactions underscore METTL4's role in gene regulation and cellular processes, particularly in the context of hypoxia and cancer metastasis, where it acts as a key mediator of epigenetic modifications (Hsu2022METTL4mediated).
