# ASCC2

## Overview
The ASCC2 gene encodes the protein activating signal cointegrator 1 complex subunit 2, which is a critical component of the activating signal co-integrator complex (ASCC). This protein plays a significant role in DNA repair, particularly in the repair of alkylation damage, by interacting with ASCC3, a DNA helicase, to facilitate the repair process. ASCC2 is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal region and a central CUE domain, which is involved in ubiquitin signaling. The CUE domain specifically binds K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, aiding in the recruitment of the ALKBH3-ASCC repair complex to DNA damage sites. Beyond its role in DNA repair, ASCC2 is implicated in transcription coactivation, ribosome-dependent protein quality control, and viral defense. Mutations in the ASCC2 gene have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in genomic stability and cellular response to DNA damage (Lombardi2021The; Soll2018RNA; Jia2020The).

## Structure
The ASCC2 protein is characterized by an irregularly structured N-terminal region and two helical sub-domains. The N-terminal region comprises residues 2-50, while sub-domain A spans residues 51-214 and sub-domain B covers residues 241-406. Each sub-domain consists of eight α-helices forming helical hairpins connected by loops (Jia2020The). ASCC2 also contains a central CUE domain, which is structurally related to the ubiquitin-binding UBA domain. This domain is proposed to aid in ubiquitin chain growth through substrate stabilization during ER-associated protein degradation (mordue2020identification).

The interaction between ASCC2 and ASCC3 is crucial for the ASCC complex's function in DNA repair. The N-arm of ASCC3, which forms three helices, interacts with ASCC2, and the interfaces between these proteins are evolutionarily conserved. Specific residues in ASCC2 form a binding pocket for ASCC3, highlighting the importance of these interactions for complex formation (Jia2020The). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ASCC2, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
ASCC2 is a component of the activating signal co-integrator complex (ASCC), which plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes, particularly in the repair of alkylation damage. It interacts with ASCC3, a DNA helicase, to facilitate the repair of alkylated DNA lesions by providing single-stranded DNA for de-alkylation by the enzyme AlkBH3. This interaction is essential for the proper functioning of the DNA repair pathway, and mutations in these proteins can lead to reduced DNA repair efficiency (Soll2018RNA; Jia2020The).

ASCC2 is also involved in linking DNA alkylation damage repair to ubiquitin signaling, which is important for cellular responses to DNA damage. It contains a CUE domain that binds K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, facilitating its recruitment to DNA damage sites (Lombardi2021The). This binding is crucial for the recruitment of the ALKBH3-ASCC repair complex to sites of alkylation damage, highlighting its role in DNA repair processes (Lombardi2021The).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, ASCC2 is implicated in transcription coactivation, ribosome-dependent protein quality control, and viral defense in healthy cells (Jia2020The). It is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASCC2 gene have been implicated in various cancers due to their impact on the interaction between ASCC2 and ASCC3, which is crucial for DNA repair. Somatic mutations at the ASCC2-ASCC3 interface reduce the interaction affinity, potentially leading to impaired DNA alkylation damage repair and contributing to malignant transformation (Jia2020The). These mutations are found in several cancers, including large intestine, lung adenocarcinomas, cervical, and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (Jia2020The).

ASCC2 is also upregulated in rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a role in inflammatory pathways (Jia2020The). Although the clinical significance of ASCC2 in diseases other than cancer is not fully explored, its downregulation has been noted in a study investigating bone fragility, where it was significantly reduced in a patient with a novel homozygous deletion in the ASCC1 gene (Voraberger2023Investigating).

Overall, the disruption of ASCC2 interactions and its altered expression levels are associated with genomic instability and may influence cancer progression and response to DNA damage, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Jia2020The).

## Interactions
ASCC2 is a component of the activating signal cointegrator 1 complex (ASCC) and plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes. It interacts with ASCC3, forming a stable complex essential for the helicase activity of ASCC3, which is involved in unwinding DNA during repair. The interaction between ASCC2 and ASCC3 is critical for the helicase function of ASCC3, and mutations in ASCC3 can disrupt this interaction, potentially impacting DNA repair processes (Jia2020Thea). 

ASCC2 also contains a CUE domain that specifically recognizes and binds to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. This interaction is important for the recruitment of the ALKBH3-ASCC repair complex to sites of DNA alkylation damage. The ASCC2 CUE domain binds both the distal and proximal ubiquitins in these chains, with a stronger affinity for K63-linked diubiquitin compared to monoubiquitin (Lombardi2021The). The binding to the proximal ubiquitin is unique to ASCC2, involving specific residues that enhance the affinity of the ALKBH3-ASCC complex for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains at damage sites (Lombardi2021The). These interactions highlight ASCC2's role in linking DNA repair to ubiquitin signaling.
