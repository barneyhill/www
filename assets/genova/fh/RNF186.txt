# RNF186

## Overview
RNF186 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 186, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by its RING finger domain, which is essential for its ubiquitination activity, and it contains two transmembrane domains that localize it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Beaudoin2013Deep; Ranjan2021Ubiquitination). The protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as the unfolded protein response (UPR), autophagy, and apoptosis, primarily through its interactions with other proteins and its involvement in ubiquitination pathways (Zhang2020RNF186; Wang2013A). RNF186 is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has significant clinical relevance, particularly in conditions like colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, where its expression and function are altered (Ranjan2021Ubiquitination; Ji2020The).

## Structure
RNF186 is a protein encoded by the RNF186 gene, characterized by a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger domain, which is a type of zinc finger domain crucial for its E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (Beaudoin2013Deep; Ranjan2021Ubiquitination). This domain contains a conserved C3HC4-type zinc finger motif, essential for the protein's ubiquitination function (Ranjan2021Ubiquitination). RNF186 also includes two transmembrane domains, which facilitate its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Beaudoin2013Deep; Wang2013A).

The protein's structure allows it to interact with other proteins, such as BNip1, a Bcl-2 family protein, indicating its role in ER stress-mediated apoptosis (Wang2013A). RNF186's RING domain is implicated in self-ubiquitination, a post-translational modification that can regulate its stability and function (Wang2013A). The protein's tertiary structure is likely influenced by its RING domain and transmembrane regions, although specific details on its quaternary structure are not provided in the available context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned, suggesting that the primary form of RNF186 is the focus of current research.

## Function
RNF186 is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, primarily through its involvement in ubiquitination. This protein is active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular mechanism that manages ER stress by regulating protein folding and degradation (Wang2013A). RNF186 facilitates the ubiquitination of various proteins, including Sestrin-2, which is involved in nutrient sensing and mTORC1 signaling. By promoting the degradation of Sestrin-2, RNF186 influences nutrient sensing pathways and cellular metabolism (Lear2019The).

In colonic epithelial cells, RNF186 is essential for maintaining basal levels of autophagy, a process critical for intestinal homeostasis. It regulates autophagy through the EFNB1-EPHB2 signaling pathway, which is important for intracellular bacterial clearance and host defense (Zhang2020RNF186). RNF186 also plays a role in ER stress-mediated apoptosis by interacting with proteins like BNip1, influencing calcium homeostasis and apoptotic signaling (Wang2013A).

Overall, RNF186 is integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating autophagy, apoptosis, and nutrient sensing, with significant implications for immune responses and intestinal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RNF186 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC). In colorectal cancer, RNF186 expression is significantly decreased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with increased tumor growth and migration, as RNF186 normally suppresses NF-κB activity, a key factor in inflammation and immune response regulation. Overexpression of RNF186 has been shown to reduce CRC cell growth and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC (Ji2020The).

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease, RNF186 variants such as the A64T and R179X have been studied. The A64T variant is associated with increased susceptibility to UC, while the R179X variant confers protection against the disease. These variants affect the gene's role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, crucial processes for maintaining intestinal homeostasis. RNF186's involvement in these pathways is essential for proper immune function and microbial clearance in the gut. Dysregulation of RNF186 can lead to impaired UPR signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of UC and other immune-mediated diseases (Ranjan2021Ubiquitination; Zhang2020RNF186; Rivas2016A).

## Interactions
RNF186, a RING finger protein, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with EPHB2 and EPHB3 in human colonic cancer cells, with different binding patterns observed for its mutants. The A64T mutant loses interaction with EPHB2 but retains binding to EPHB3, while the R179X mutant shows increased binding to EPHB2 but loses interaction with EPHB3 (Zhang2020RNF186).

In the context of the unfolded protein response (UPR), RNF186 interacts with UPR sensors such as ATF6, PERK, and IRE1α in human macrophages. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of a signaling complex that includes receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2), promoting optimal UPR activation (Ranjan2021Ubiquitination). RNF186 also ubiquitinates ATF6, which is essential for NOD2-induced UPR outcomes (Ranjan2021Ubiquitination).

RNF186 interacts with BNip1, a Bcl-2 family protein, at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This interaction is dependent on RNF186's transmembrane domains and is significant in ER stress-mediated apoptosis, promoting BNip1's translocation to mitochondria (Wang2013A). Additionally, RNF186 regulates the stability of Sestrin-2 by ubiquitinating it, which affects mTORC1 activity (Lear2019The).
