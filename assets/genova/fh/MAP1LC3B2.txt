# MAP1LC3B2

## Overview
MAP1LC3B2 is a gene that encodes the protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta 2 (LC3B2), which is integral to the autophagy pathway, a critical cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. LC3B2 is categorized as an autophagy-related protein and is involved in the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, vesicles that sequester damaged organelles and proteins for degradation. The protein undergoes a conversion from its cytosolic form, LC3-I, to a membrane-bound form, LC3-II, which is a hallmark of autophagy induction (Kabeya2000LC3; Hait2020Defects). LC3B2 plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in antiviral defense mechanisms, particularly against HSV2 infection (Hait2020Defects). Additionally, LC3B2 is involved in selective autophagy processes, such as mitophagy, where it aids in the recognition and degradation of damaged mitochondria (Antón2016Human).

## Function
MAP1LC3B2 encodes the protein LC3B2, which plays a critical role in the autophagy pathway, a cellular process essential for degrading and recycling cellular components. In healthy human cells, LC3B2 is involved in the formation and maturation of autophagosomes, which are vesicles that engulf damaged organelles and proteins for degradation. The protein is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), forming LC3-II, which integrates into the expanding phagophore, a precursor to the autophagosome. This conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II is a key indicator of autophagy induction (Kabeya2000LC3; Hait2020Defects).

LC3B2 is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and defense against viral infections. It plays a significant role in antiviral defense, particularly against HSV2 infection, by facilitating the autophagic process that controls viral replication and infection-induced cell death. Mutations in MAP1LC3B2 can impair autophagy induction, leading to increased viral load and cell death (Hait2020Defects).

LC3B2 is also involved in selective autophagy processes, such as mitophagy, where it interacts with cardiolipin-containing membranes on mitochondria, aiding in the recognition and degradation of damaged mitochondria (Antón2016Human).

## Interactions
MAP1LC3B2, also known as LC3B, is a key protein involved in the autophagy process, interacting with various proteins to facilitate autophagosome formation and transport. One significant interaction is with FYCO1, an autophagy adaptor protein. This interaction is mediated by the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif in FYCO1, which is essential for binding. FYCO1 also interacts with Rab7 and PI3P, forming a complex that promotes microtubule plus end-directed transport of autophagic vesicles (Pankiv2010FYCO1).

The phosphorylation of LC3B at threonine 50 by the kinase STK4 modulates its interaction with FYCO1. Phosphorylation decreases the binding affinity between LC3B and FYCO1, affecting the directional transport of autophagosomes. This phosphorylation is crucial for the perinuclear positioning of autophagosomes, particularly under starvation conditions, and influences whether autophagosomes are transported anterogradely or retrogradely (NietoTorres2020LC3B).

MAP1LC3B2 also interacts with FAIM2, a transmembrane protein involved in autophagy regulation. FAIM2 is necessary for autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and this interaction is mediated by a functional LIR motif within FAIM2, which binds to the lipidated form of MAP1LC3B-II (Hong2019Fas‐apoptotic).
