# OR2AT4

## Overview
The OR2AT4 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily AT member 4, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which enables them to traverse the cell membrane and participate in signal transduction. While traditionally associated with olfactory functions, OR2AT4 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including skin keratinocytes and hair follicles, where it plays significant roles in cellular processes such as wound healing and hair growth regulation. The receptor is activated by specific odorants, such as synthetic sandalwood compounds, which trigger intracellular signaling pathways involving calcium and cAMP, thereby influencing cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, OR2AT4 has been implicated in modulating inflammatory responses in conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in steroid-resistant inflammatory diseases (Chéret2018Olfactory; Busse2014A; Weidinger2022OR2AT4).

## Structure
The OR2AT4 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs, allowing them to traverse the cell membrane seven times. The primary structure of OR2AT4 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as a receptor. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs, facilitating their integration into the cell membrane (Zhang2020Computerized; Busse2014A).

The tertiary structure of OR2AT4 involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, which is crucial for its ability to bind ligands and activate intracellular signaling pathways. Although specific details about the quaternary structure of OR2AT4 are not provided, GPCRs typically function as monomers, and this is likely the case for OR2AT4 as well (Busse2014A).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs, including OR2AT4, and these modifications can influence receptor function and signaling. However, specific details about these modifications in OR2AT4 are not provided in the available context (Weidinger2022OR2AT4).

## Function
The human gene OR2AT4 encodes an olfactory receptor that is expressed in non-olfactory tissues, including skin keratinocytes and hair follicles. In keratinocytes, OR2AT4 is activated by synthetic sandalwood odorants such as Sandalore®, leading to a signaling cascade that involves calcium and cAMP pathways. This activation promotes keratinocyte proliferation and migration, processes essential for wound healing by accelerating reepithelialization, the restoration of the epidermal layer of the skin (Busse2014A). OR2AT4 also facilitates communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons, potentially playing a role in skin-nerve interactions during wound healing (Busse2014A).

In hair follicles, OR2AT4 regulates hair growth by prolonging the anagen phase and suppressing apoptosis in hair matrix keratinocytes. Activation by Sandalore® increases the expression and secretion of IGF-1, a growth factor crucial for maintaining hair follicles in the anagen phase and preventing premature catagen development (Chéret2018Olfactory). These findings suggest that OR2AT4 plays a significant role in the chemosensory regulation of human epithelial tissues, with implications for therapeutic applications in wound healing and hair growth disorders.

## Clinical Significance
The olfactory receptor gene OR2AT4 has been implicated in various clinical contexts beyond its traditional role in olfaction. Alterations in the expression of OR2AT4 have been associated with inflammatory lung diseases, particularly those resistant to steroid treatment, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis. In these conditions, OR2AT4 is expressed in alveolar macrophages and is involved in pathways that regulate intracellular calcium and cAMP levels, which are crucial for modulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines like CXCL-8. This suggests that OR2AT4 could be a potential therapeutic target for managing steroid-resistant inflammation in these diseases (Weidinger2022OR2AT4).

OR2AT4 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as skin cells, where it plays a role in wound healing and cell proliferation. Activation of OR2AT4 by compounds like Pogostemon cablin extract has been shown to enhance wound healing and reduce inflammation by modulating intracellular signaling pathways. This indicates a broader physiological role for OR2AT4 in tissue repair and inflammation control (Choo2024Pogostemon). However, the clinical significance of OR2AT4 gene mutations or expression alterations in these contexts is not fully understood.

## Interactions
OR2AT4, an olfactory receptor, is involved in several cellular interactions and signaling pathways. It is known to modulate protein kinase cascades, particularly the MAPK pathway. OR2AT4 can reduce early phosphorylation of p38-MAPK, which may hinder cell growth, and through phosphorylation of p44/42-MAPK, it can decrease cell apoptosis in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients (Raka2021Human). This suggests that OR2AT4 has significant interactions with MAPK pathways, affecting cell growth and apoptosis.

In the context of skin tissue, OR2AT4 is expressed in keratinocytes and can be activated by the odorant sandalwood. This activation leads to the release of ATP from keratinocytes, which subsequently activates P2X purinergic receptors on neighboring trigeminal neurons, facilitating communication between keratinocytes and trigeminal neurons (Abaffy2015Human).

In leukemia cells, the activation of OR2AT4 with the synthetic agonist sandalore inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis through Ca2+ dependent activation of Erk1/2 (Beito2024Role). These interactions highlight the receptor's role in modulating cellular processes through various signaling pathways.
