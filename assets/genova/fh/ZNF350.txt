# ZNF350

## Overview
ZNF350 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 350, a transcriptional repressor involved in DNA binding and regulation of gene expression. The protein is characterized by its KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain, which facilitates transcriptional repression through interactions with co-repressor proteins, and its C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which provide DNA-binding specificity (Zheng2000SequenceSpecific; Wu2021Correlation). ZNF350 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by interacting with the BRCA1 protein to co-repress genes such as GADD45A, which are involved in DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation (Zhang2018Functional; Plourde2012Analysis). The protein's function and interactions suggest its involvement as a tumor suppressor, with implications in cancer susceptibility and other diseases related to genomic instability (Gu2016Functional; Zhang2018Functional).

## Structure
ZNF350, also known as zinc finger protein 350, encodes a protein characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is approximately 60 kDa in size and contains a highly conserved KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain at the N-terminal end, which is involved in transcriptional repression by binding to co-repressor proteins (Zheng2000SequenceSpecific; Wu2021Correlation). The C-terminal end of ZNF350 features eight continuous C2H2 zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability and confer sequence specificity (Zheng2000SequenceSpecific; Wu2021Correlation). 

Additionally, ZNF350 includes a C-terminal repression domain (CTRD) that independently inhibits transcription (Wu2021Correlation). The protein's structure allows it to interact with BRCA1, forming a complex that represses transcription in a BRCA1-dependent manner (Zheng2000SequenceSpecific). ZNF350 may undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which regulates its stability and function, as seen in its interaction with HECW1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Lin2023HECW1). The gene also exhibits splice variant isoforms, contributing to structural and functional diversity.

## Function
ZNF350, also known as zinc finger protein 350, functions as a transcriptional repressor in healthy human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences through its zinc finger motifs, influencing the expression of target genes involved in DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation (Wu2021Correlation; Zhang2018Functional). ZNF350 interacts with the BRCA1 protein to co-repress the GADD45A gene, which plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and responding to DNA damage (Zhang2018Functional; Plourde2012Analysis). This interaction is essential for the tumor suppressor properties of BRCA1, as it helps regulate genes involved in cell cycle control and DNA repair (Zhang2018Functional).

The protein contains a highly conserved KRAB domain, which is critical for its repression activities. This domain recruits co-repressors such as KAP-1 and histone deacetylase complexes, facilitating the silencing of gene expression (Zhang2018Functional; Wu2021Correlation). By maintaining the repression of genes like GADD45A, ZNF350 contributes to the inhibition of malignant growth, invasion, and metastasis, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene (Plourde2012Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNF350 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly breast cancer. ZNF350, also known as ZBRK1, is a transcriptional suppressor that interacts with BRCA1, a gene linked to breast cancer susceptibility. Variants in the ZNF350 promoter region, although not directly associated with breast cancer risk, have been shown to affect gene expression levels, with certain haplotypes like H11 and H12 significantly stimulating ZNF350 expression (Plourde2012Analysis). Specific polymorphisms, such as rs138898320, have been associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, while others like rs2278420 (L66P) and rs2278415 (S501R) are linked to increased susceptibility (Zhang2018Functional; Wu2021Correlation).

Alterations in ZNF350 expression have also been observed in other cancers, including colon and cervical cancers, where its under-expression is noted (Plourde2012Analysis). The gene's role in DNA damage repair and genomic stability suggests that its deregulation can lead to increased cellular sensitivity to DNA damage and carcinogenesis. Additionally, the SNP rs2278414 in the 3'-UTR of ZNF350 has been associated with age-related cataract risk, indicating its broader impact on genomic stability and disease susceptibility (Gu2016Functional).

## Interactions
ZNF350, also known as ZBRK1, is a zinc finger protein that participates in several key interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to interact with BRCA1, a tumor suppressor protein, forming a complex that plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression. This interaction is significant for the repression of genes such as GADD45A, which is involved in cell cycle regulation and genomic stability (Zhang2018Functional; Desjardins2007Genetic).

ZNF350 also interacts with KRAB-ZFP-associated protein 1 (KAP1), which is involved in forming heterochromatin and transcriptional repression (Zhang2018Functional). In addition, ZNF350 has been shown to interact with the histone methyltransferase RE-IIBP, suggesting its involvement in a co-repressor complex that mediates transcriptional repression (Kim2009Identification).

The protein also binds to specific DNA sequences, such as a 15-bp sequence in the third intron of the GADD45A gene, which is regulated by BRCA1. This binding is essential for inhibiting downstream regulatory genes, thereby influencing transcriptional regulation (Wu2021Correlation). These interactions highlight ZNF350's role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell migration and cancer susceptibility.
