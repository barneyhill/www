# ASB12

## Overview
ASB12 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 12, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions and a SOCS box domain that plays a crucial role in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling, particularly through the JAK-STAT pathway (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB12 is involved in the formation of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which are essential for tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and modulating various cellular processes (Anasa2018Multifaceted). Although the specific functions of ASB12 in normal cellular physiology are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential significance in disease mechanisms and as a biomarker (Cha2018Genetic; Xie2023A).

## Function
ASB12 is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) protein family, which plays a significant role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. The protein contains ankyrin repeat (ANK) domains that facilitate interactions with a wide range of substrates, and a SOCS box domain that is crucial for the negative regulation of cytokine signaling, particularly the JAK-STAT pathway (Anasa2018Multifaceted). The SOCS box domain in ASB12 interacts with components of the elongin-cullin-SOCS (ECS) complex, specifically Cul5 and Rbx2, which are essential for substrate recognition and degradation pathways (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

ASB12 is involved in the formation of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which tag proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process is vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and modulating various cellular pathways, including signal transduction and cell cycle regulation (Anasa2018Multifaceted). Although the specific function of ASB12 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, it is implied that ASB12 participates in the regulation of protein degradation by forming complexes with scaffold proteins like Cullin and RING finger protein RBX (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

## Clinical Significance
ASB12 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In the context of cancer, ASB12 is involved in tumorigenesis and can influence tumor development through pathways such as apoptosis and the cell cycle. Its expression is significantly reduced in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential protective role in this cancer type (Xie2023A). Additionally, ASB12 is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumorigenesis, which is a key process in cancer progression (Xie2023A).

In prostate cancer, ASB12 has been identified as part of a gene set associated with EMT, indicating its potential role in cancer development (Ehsani2020Enhanced). Furthermore, ASB12 has been correlated with poor survival in prostate cancer, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Sokhangouy2023The).

In the context of metabolic disorders, a variant of ASB12, p.Arg78His, has been identified in individuals with hypouricemia, particularly in East Asian populations. This variant is postulated to affect the intracellular degradation of the uric acid transporter, although its functional significance in hypouricemia remains unclear (Cha2018Genetic).

## Interactions
ASB12 is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) protein family, which is involved in protein-protein interactions primarily through its ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are known for their structural flexibility and ability to form elongated surfaces for binding, facilitating interactions with various substrates (Anasa2018Multifaceted). The C-terminal SOCS box domain of ASB12 is involved in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling and interacts with components of the elongin-cullin-SOCS (ECS) complex, specifically forming complexes with Cul5-Rbx2 but not with Cul2-Rbx1 (Anasa2018Multifaceted).

Despite its potential for interaction, ASB12 has been noted to bind poorly to Elongins, which are crucial for effective protein ubiquitination, suggesting a limited role in promoting protein degradation compared to other ASB family members like ASB2 (Nie2010Notchinduced). The specific physical interactions of ASB12 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely undetailed, and further structural studies are needed to fully understand its interaction capabilities and functions (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB12's involvement in various signaling pathways, such as apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, has been suggested, but specific interaction partners have not been identified (Xie2023A).
