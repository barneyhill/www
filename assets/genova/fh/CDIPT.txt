# CDIPT

## Overview
The CDIPT gene encodes the enzyme CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, commonly referred to as phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS). This enzyme is a critical component in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI), a fundamental phospholipid involved in various cellular processes such as membrane trafficking, vesicular transport, and signal transduction. As a transmembrane enzyme localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum, PIS facilitates the conversion of CDP-diacylglycerol and myo-inositol into PI, thereby playing a pivotal role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis and structure (Blunsom2020Phosphatidylinositol; Thakur2013Dysregulated). The proper functioning of CDIPT is essential for normal cellular operations, and its disruption is associated with several pathological conditions, underscoring its significance in cellular and organismal health (Thakur2011Lack).

## Function
The CDIPT gene encodes the enzyme CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase, also known as phosphatidylinositol synthase (PIS), which is essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DG) and myo-inositol to PI, a critical phospholipid involved in various cellular functions, including vesicular transport, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction (Blunsom2020Phosphatidylinositol; Thakur2013Dysregulated).

PI serves as a precursor for several phosphoinositides, which are key regulators of cellular signaling pathways that affect processes such as cell differentiation and cell cycle regulation (Murphy2011Phosphatidylinositol). The enzyme is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a significant role in maintaining ER homeostasis and function, particularly in the folding, modification, and transport of proteins (Thakur2011Lack).

In healthy human cells, the activity of CDIPT is crucial for maintaining cellular lipid composition and structure, which in turn supports normal cellular and organismal functions. Disruptions in PI synthesis can lead to cellular stress and are implicated in various diseases, highlighting the importance of CDIPT in cellular homeostasis (Thakur2011Lack).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDIPT gene, which encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol synthase, have been linked to several diseases and conditions due to their impact on phosphatidylinositol (PI) synthesis. In zebrafish models, mutations in CDIPT lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and hepatic steatosis, conditions that resemble nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in humans. This suggests that disruptions in PI synthesis can contribute to liver pathologies through ER stress-mediated mechanisms (Thakur2011Lack).

In the gastrointestinal system, CDIPT mutations result in significant intestinal mucosal injury and inflammation, with features similar to human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The deficiency in PI synthesis causes abnormal intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation, which are exacerbated by bacterial overgrowth and goblet cell depletion (Thakur2013Dysregulated).

In the context of ocular health, CDIPT mutations in zebrafish lead to defects in lens structural integrity and photoreceptor cell survival, resulting in conditions akin to anterior subcapsular cataract (ASC) in humans. These mutations disrupt lens epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, highlighting the importance of PI metabolism in maintaining eye health (Murphy2011Phosphatidylinositol).
