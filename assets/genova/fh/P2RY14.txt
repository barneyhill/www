# P2RY14

## Overview
The P2RY14 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2Y14, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains. This receptor is primarily activated by UDP-sugars, such as UDP-glucose, and plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including immune response modulation, inflammation, and cellular signaling. The P2Y14 receptor is expressed in a range of cell types, including immune cells, hematopoietic stem cells, and cells in the central nervous system, where it influences processes such as degranulation, cell migration, and calcium signaling. Its involvement in signaling pathways, such as those activating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Rho kinase, underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli (PatrittiCram2021Purinergic; Jacobson2015Nucleotides; Lazarowski2015UDPSugars).

## Structure
The P2RY14 gene encodes the purinergic receptor P2Y14, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of the GPCR family. This receptor is involved in cellular signaling and is activated by nucleotide sugars such as UDP-glucose (Jacobson2015Nucleotides). The receptor's structure includes an extracellular amino-terminus and a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminus, which are typical features of GPCRs (Li2019Functional). 

The P2Y14 receptor has been shown to have specific binding sites for its ligands, with the presence of a terminal glucose or other sugar on the β-phosphate of UDP significantly affecting its potency, indicating a specific binding site for the distal end of UDP-glucose on the receptor (Jacobson2015Nucleotides). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are likely, as these modifications are common in GPCRs and influence receptor function and signaling (Azroyan2015Renal). However, specific details about the tertiary or quaternary structure of the P2Y14 receptor are not provided in the available context. The receptor's role in various physiological processes, including immune response modulation and inflammation, is well-documented, but structural details remain limited (Baalmann2023Reduced).

## Function
The P2RY14 gene encodes the P2Y14 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is activated by UDP-sugars, such as UDP-glucose. This receptor is involved in various cellular and physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is expressed in immune cells, including mast cells, dendritic cells, and T-lymphocytes, where it plays roles in immune responses. In mast cells, P2Y14R mediates degranulation, while in dendritic cells, it regulates maturation and migration to inflammation sites. In T-lymphocytes, it affects cAMP levels and inhibits proliferation (Lazarowski2015UDPSugars).

P2Y14R is also expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, where it influences cell localization and mobilization. In the brain, it is found in astrocytes and glia, affecting calcium signaling and astrocyte remodeling (Lazarowski2015UDPSugars). The receptor is involved in signaling pathways that include the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the Rho kinase pathway, influencing cell shape and movement (Lazarowski2015UDPSugars).

In the gastrointestinal tract, P2Y14R affects muscle tension and meal passage, while in the pancreas, it influences insulin secretion pathways, impacting glucose metabolism (Lazarowski2015UDPSugars). The receptor's broad expression and involvement in various signaling pathways highlight its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the P2RY14 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), P2RY14 plays a significant role in Schwann cell precursor (SCP) self-renewal and neurofibroma initiation. Inhibition of P2RY14, either genetically or pharmacologically, has been shown to reduce SCP self-renewal and delay neurofibroma development, suggesting that P2RY14 is a critical regulator in NF1-related tumorigenesis (Patritti2022P2RY14; PatrittiCram2021Purinergic). 

In NF1-deficient Schwann cells, P2RY14 inhibition leads to increased cAMP signaling and decreased EGFR-driven phospho-Akt, which affects tumor growth and maintenance (PatrittiCram2021Purinergic). The deletion of P2RY14 in mouse models of NF1 has been associated with increased survival, delayed tumor initiation, and improved nerve morphology, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Patritti2022P2RY14).

Additionally, P2RY14 is involved in modulating stress responses in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Deficiency in P2RY14 increases susceptibility to stress-induced senescence and cell death, highlighting its protective role in maintaining HSPC function under stress conditions (Cho2014Purinergic). These findings suggest that alterations in P2RY14 expression or function could have significant implications for conditions involving hematological stress or aging-related senescence.

## Interactions
The P2RY14 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with various proteins and nucleotides, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It is activated by UDP-glucose and other UDP-sugars, which leads to the release of Gβγ subunits from the Gi protein heterotrimer. These subunits can activate downstream effectors such as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PtdIns-3-kinase), which is involved in the chemotaxis of human neutrophils through the activation of Rho and subsequent actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (Lazarowski2015UDPSugars).

P2RY14 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in Schwann cell precursors and Schwann cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that P2RY14 may form a complex with EGFR, influencing EGFR-driven signaling pathways. This interaction affects cAMP signaling, where P2RY14 inhibition increases cAMP levels and decreases EGFR activation, impacting cell proliferation and survival (PatrittiCram2021Purinergic).

In the context of stress-induced senescence in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, P2RY14 modulates pathways involving reactive oxygen species (ROS) and p38 MAPK, suggesting its role in cellular stress responses (Cho2014Purinergic). These interactions highlight P2RY14's involvement in complex signaling networks that regulate various physiological processes.
