# SLC4A9

## Overview
The SLC4A9 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 4 member 9 (SLC4A9), which is a transmembrane anion exchanger involved in the transport of chloride (Cl-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions across cell membranes. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining acid-base homeostasis, particularly in the kidney and salivary glands. In the kidney, SLC4A9 is expressed in the β-intercalated cells of the distal nephron, where it functions as both a Cl-/HCO3- exchanger and a Na+/HCO3- cotransporter under specific conditions, contributing to the regulation of acid-base balance (Vitzthum2024Novel). The protein is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains and undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with potentially distinct functional properties (Lipovich2001A). Mutations in the SLC4A9 gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as Chiari Malformation Type I, highlighting its significance in ion transport and fluid regulation (AVŞAR2020Genomewide).

## Structure
The SLC4A9 gene encodes a sodium bicarbonate cotransporter-like protein, which is part of the SLC4A subfamily involved in Na+ and HCO3- transport across epithelial cell membranes. The protein is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, indicating its role in membrane transport (Lipovich2001A). The primary structure of the major splice isoform consists of 990 amino acids, with a relatively long cytoplasmic amino terminus (amino acids 1-265) and a shorter cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus (amino acids 929-990) (Lipovich2001A).

The secondary structure analysis reveals several serine and threonine phosphorylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that may regulate the protein's function (Lipovich2001A). The SLC4A9 protein shows sequence similarity to other human NBCs, with 49% identity to SLC4A4, 48% to SLC4A6, 44% to NBC4, and 43% to SLC4A8, suggesting conserved structural features (Lipovich2001A).

Alternative splicing of the SLC4A9 gene results in multiple cDNA sequences, with variations in the inclusion or exclusion of certain exons, leading to different isoforms (Lipovich2001A). These isoforms may have distinct functional properties, contributing to the protein's role in bicarbonate transport and pH regulation.

## Function
The SLC4A9 gene encodes the anion exchanger AE4, which is part of the solute carrier family 4 (SLC4). This protein is primarily involved in the exchange of chloride (Cl-) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) ions across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in maintaining acid-base homeostasis in the body. AE4 is predominantly expressed in the kidney, specifically in the β-intercalated cells (β-ICs) of the distal nephron, where it is located in the basolateral membrane (Vitzthum2024Novel).

In the kidney, AE4 functions as a Cl-/HCO3- exchanger and can also act as a Na+/HCO3- cotransporter under certain conditions. It is essential for sensing metabolic acid-base disturbances, particularly during metabolic alkalosis and acidosis, by regulating the activity of the apical Cl-/HCO3- exchanger pendrin (SLC26A4) (Vitzthum2024Novel). AE4's activity is crucial for the secretion of bicarbonate into the urine, contributing to the reabsorption of hydrogen (H+) and chloride (Cl-) ions, thus maintaining acid-base balance (Vitzthum2024Novel).

AE4 is also expressed in other tissues, such as the salivary glands, where it helps maintain high intracellular Cl- concentrations necessary for proper saliva production (Vitzthum2024Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC4A9 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily related to disruptions in ion transport and acid-base balance. A missense variation in the SLC4A9 gene, resulting in an Ile to Met amino acid conversion, has been associated with Chiari Malformation Type I (CMI). This condition involves cerebellar herniation and disrupted cerebrospinal fluid flow, potentially linked to the gene's role in fluid regulation and anion exchange (AVŞAR2020Genomewide).

In renal physiology, SLC4A9, also known as AE4, is crucial for acid-base homeostasis. AE4 knockout mice exhibit severe metabolic alkalosis due to impaired bicarbonate secretion, highlighting the gene's role as an acid-base sensor. This suggests that mutations in SLC4A9 could lead to significant clinical conditions related to acid-base imbalances, such as metabolic alkalosis or acidosis (Vitzthum2024Novel).

While SLC4A9 is involved in bicarbonate and chloride ion transport, its absence does not significantly impact sodium reabsorption or plasma volume regulation, indicating that mutations may not lead to disorders in these areas (Vitzthum2024Novel).
