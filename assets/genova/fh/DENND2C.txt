# DENND2C

## Overview
DENND2C is a gene that encodes the protein DENN domain containing 2C, which is characterized by the presence of a DENN domain. This domain classifies the protein as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) specifically for Rab GTPases, which are pivotal in regulating membrane trafficking pathways such as endocytosis and exocytosis (Marat2011DENN). The DENN domain in DENND2C is located in the C-terminal region and is particularly active towards Rab9a/b, playing a crucial role in the retrograde trafficking of the mannose phosphate receptor from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (Marat2011DENN). This function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting. In addition to its role in membrane trafficking, DENND2C is associated with GTPase activator activity, which is significant for intracellular signaling and the regulation of various cellular processes, including the organization of the extracellular matrix and calcium ion binding (Cardenas2023Whole). The gene has also been implicated in familial cholesteatoma, suggesting its potential involvement in disease through disruptions in GTPase activity (Cardenas2023Whole).

## Function
DENND2C encodes a protein that contains a DENN domain, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases. These proteins are crucial for regulating membrane trafficking pathways, including vesicle transport processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis (Marat2011DENN). The DENN domain in DENND2C is located in the C-terminal region, and it specifically acts as a GEF toward Rab9a/b. Rab9 is involved in the retrograde trafficking of the mannose phosphate receptor from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting (Marat2011DENN).

In healthy human cells, DENND2C is associated with GTPase activator activity, which is significant for intracellular signaling and the regulation of various cellular processes (Cardenas2023Whole). The protein's activity in these pathways suggests its involvement in critical cellular functions, such as the organization of the extracellular matrix and calcium ion binding, which are important for maintaining cellular structure and function (Cardenas2023Whole). The precise role of DENND2C in these processes highlights its importance in cellular biology and its potential impact on organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DENND2C gene have been implicated in familial cholesteatoma, a condition characterized by abnormal skin growth in the middle ear. The study identified DENND2C as one of the genes with co-segregating loss of function (LOF) variants in this condition. Whole exome sequencing and variant filtering revealed that DENND2C had variants in two different families, suggesting its potential role in the disease. The gene is linked to GTPase activator activity, a molecular function significantly enriched in the affected cohort, indicating that mutations in DENND2C may contribute to cholesteatoma development through disruptions in GTPase activity (Cardenas2023Whole).

DENND2C was also identified as one of six genes with variants that co-segregate with cholesteatoma in multiple families. Although no pathogenicity has been reported for the specific variants identified, their presence in multiple families suggests a potential role in the disease. The study highlights the importance of ciliary function in cholesteatoma, as other genes related to ciliary structure and function were also implicated. This suggests that genetic factors affecting cilia, including potential alterations in DENND2C, may contribute to cholesteatoma development, though the exact role of DENND2C remains to be fully elucidated (Cardenas2023Whole).
