# PIDD1

## Overview
PIDD1, or p53-induced death domain protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in response to DNA damage. The protein, also referred to as PIDD1, is characterized by its structural components, including leucine-rich repeats, ZU-5 domains, and a death domain, which facilitate its role in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation (Tinel2006Autoproteolysis). PIDD1 is a pivotal component of the PIDDosome complex, which includes RAIDD and caspase-2, and is activated in response to DNA damage, leading to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest (Sladky2017The). Additionally, PIDD1 is involved in NF-κB signaling, contributing to inflammatory responses and cell survival (Janssens2005PIDD). The gene's mutations are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Zaki2021Pathogenic).

## Structure
The PIDD1 protein, also known as p53-induced protein with a death domain, is a critical component in the cellular response to DNA damage. Structurally, PIDD1 contains seven leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) at the N-terminus, followed by two ZU-5 domains, and a C-terminal death domain (DD) (Tinel2006Autoproteolysis). Upon DNA damage, PIDD1 undergoes autoproteolysis, resulting in the formation of different fragments: a 48-kDa N-terminal fragment (PIDD-N) and a 51-kDa C-terminal fragment (PIDD-C), which is further cleaved into a 37-kDa fragment (PIDD-CC) (Tinel2006Autoproteolysis). The cleavage occurs at specific sites, S446 and S588, through an auto-processing mechanism (Tinel2006Autoproteolysis). 

The PIDD1 protein is also known to encode an alternative protein, altPIDD1, from an overlapping open reading frame (ORF). AltPIDD1 is a 171-amino acid protein that is co-expressed with PIDD1 from the same mRNA but in a different reading frame. The amino acid sequence of altPIDD1 is distinct from PIDD1, being rich in proline and containing several cysteines (Comtois2024Noncanonical). AltPIDD1 is predicted to have a disordered structure with protein binding activity (Comtois2024Noncanonical).

## Function
PIDD1 (p53-induced death domain protein 1) plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, PIDD1 is involved in forming the PIDDosome complex, which includes RAIDD and caspase-2, and is activated in response to DNA damage and supernumerary centrosomes. This complex is essential for activating caspase-2, leading to apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Sladky2017The; Fava2017The).

PIDD1 also participates in NF-κB signaling, a pathway critical for inflammatory responses and cell survival. Upon DNA damage, PIDD1 translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with RIP1 and NEMO, facilitating their modification and the activation of IKKs, which are crucial for NF-κB signaling (Janssens2005PIDD). This process helps balance cell survival and apoptosis, depending on the extent of DNA damage (Janssens2005PIDD).

Additionally, PIDD1 is involved in centrosome surveillance, where it localizes to mother centrioles and helps monitor their abundance. This function is vital for activating the PIDDosome in response to centrosome amplification, which is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing tumorigenesis (Fava2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIDD1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily characterized by intellectual disability (ID) and brain malformations such as pachygyria and lissencephaly. These conditions are often accompanied by psychiatric features, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Sheikh2021Biallelic; Zaki2021Pathogenic). Biallelic pathogenic variants in PIDD1, particularly those affecting the death domain, impair caspase-2 activation, which is crucial for apoptosis in response to DNA damage. This disruption is linked to defective neuronal migration and cortical underdevelopment (Uctepe2023Biallelic; Sheikh2021Biallelic).

The PIDD1 gene's role in these disorders is further highlighted by its involvement in the PIDDosome complex, which includes CRADD and caspase-2. Mutations in PIDD1 can lead to loss of interaction with CRADD, affecting the complex's function and contributing to the observed clinical phenotypes (Sheikh2021Biallelic). Despite these significant impacts in humans, Pidd1 knockout mice do not exhibit central nervous system or behavioral phenotypes, suggesting species-specific differences in gene function (Uctepe2023Biallelic).

## Interactions
PIDD1, or p53-induced death domain protein 1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in apoptosis and DNA damage response. PIDD1 forms the PIDDosome complex with RAIDD (also known as CRADD) and caspase-2, which is essential for initiating cell death pathways. This complex is assembled through the interaction of PIDD1's death domain (DD) with RAIDD's DD, while RAIDD's caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) serves as a docking site for caspase-2 (Sladky2017The).

PIDD1 also interacts with nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) in the nucleolus, which promotes caspase-2 activation in response to DNA damage (Ando2017NPM1). In the context of DNA damage, PIDD1 is involved in the formation of the NEMO-PIDDosome complex with RIP1 and NEMO, which is linked to NF-κB activation and cell survival (Sladky2017The). PIDD1 enhances the sumoylation and ubiquitination of NEMO, crucial for NF-κB pathway activation (Janssens2005PIDD).

PIDD1 also forms a complex with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication factor C subunits, known as the PCNA-PIDDosome, which is involved in translesion DNA synthesis and DNA repair processes (Sladky2017The). These interactions highlight PIDD1's multifaceted role in cellular stress responses.
