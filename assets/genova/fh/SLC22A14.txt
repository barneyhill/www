# SLC22A14

## Overview
SLC22A14 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 14, a mitochondrial riboflavin transporter. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and plays a critical role in sperm energy metabolism and male fertility. It is specifically localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane of spermatozoa, where it facilitates the transport of riboflavin, a crucial co-factor for enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation and the electron transfer chain. These processes are essential for ATP production, which is vital for sperm motility. Disruption of SLC22A14 function can lead to impaired sperm motility and male infertility, highlighting its importance in reproductive biology (Kuang2021SLC22A14).

## Function
The SLC22A14 gene encodes a mitochondrial riboflavin transporter that is crucial for sperm oxidative phosphorylation and male fertility. This protein is localized at the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) of spermatozoa, specifically in the mid-piece of the sperm flagellum, which is part of the mitochondrial sheath (Kuang2021SLC22A14). SLC22A14 facilitates the transport of riboflavin, a vital co-factor for enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and the electron transfer chain (ETC), both essential for ATP production in sperm cells (Kuang2021SLC22A14).

The absence of SLC22A14 disrupts riboflavin transport, leading to reduced activity of FAO-related flavoenzymes, decreased ATP production, and increased accumulation of free fatty acids and triacylglycerols in spermatozoa. These metabolic disruptions result in impaired sperm motility and male infertility (Kuang2021SLC22A14). The gene's role in energy metabolism is underscored by the metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis observed in SLC22A14 knockout spermatozoa, which is accompanied by reduced mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolytic activity (Kuang2021SLC22A14). Overall, SLC22A14 is essential for maintaining energy production and fertility in spermatozoa by facilitating riboflavin transport, which is necessary for proper FAO and ETC function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the SLC22A14 gene have been linked to male infertility, particularly in cases of idiopathic asthenozoospermia, where lower levels of SLC22A14 have been observed compared to fertile individuals (Kuang2021SLC22A14). The gene encodes a mitochondrial riboflavin transporter essential for sperm oxidative phosphorylation, and its deficiency leads to decreased sperm motility and male infertility (Kuang2021SLC22A14). In Slc22a14 knockout mice, the absence of this gene results in impaired sperm motility and abnormal tail structures, contributing to severe infertility (Maruyama2016A). 

The disruption of SLC22A14 affects fatty acid Î²-oxidation and flavoenzyme activity, leading to reduced ATP levels in spermatozoa, which are crucial for motility and fertility (Kuang2021SLC22A14). Additionally, the gene's dysfunction can cause metabolic reprogramming in spermatozoa, with enhanced glycolysis compensating for the ATP shortfall (Kuang2021SLC22A14). 

In humans, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the SLC22A14 gene have been identified, including a splice polymorphism in a Japanese population that may produce a truncated protein, although its association with male fertility is not yet known (Maruyama2016A). These findings suggest that SLC22A14 dysregulation can lead to male infertility without affecting hormone levels or sexual ability (Kuang2021SLC22A14).
