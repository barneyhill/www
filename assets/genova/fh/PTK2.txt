# PTK2

## Overview
PTK2, also known as the gene encoding focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is a critical component in cellular signaling pathways. The PTK2 gene is responsible for producing the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase, FAK, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival. FAK is characterized by its complex structure, comprising a central kinase domain, an N-terminal FERM domain, and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain, which facilitate its interactions with integrins and growth factor receptors (Hassan2018Exploring). This kinase is primarily localized at focal adhesions, where it mediates signal transduction between the cell and its extracellular environment, thus maintaining cellular communication and structural integrity (Chen2022Identification). PTK2's involvement in critical signaling pathways underscores its significance in normal physiological processes and its potential implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer (Fan2019PTK2; Panera2017Focal).

## Structure
PTK2, also known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PTK2 includes a central kinase domain, an N-terminal FERM domain, and a C-terminal focal adhesion targeting (FAT) domain (Hassan2018Exploring). The FERM domain, spanning amino acids 35-355, contains an autophosphorylation site at Y397, which is crucial for binding the SRC protein and activating downstream signaling pathways (Hassan2018Exploring). The protein kinase domain is located between amino acids 420-680 (Hassan2018Exploring).

The secondary structure of PTK2 is composed of 42% helices, 21% beta-sheets, 36% coils, and 31% turns, as determined by structural analysis tools (Hassan2018Exploring). Tertiary structure analysis reveals that PTK2 has a high model quality, with a Z score of -7.44 and an Errat score of 98.77, indicating a reliable structural model (Hassan2018Exploring). PTK2 can form dimers, suggesting a quaternary structure that facilitates interactions with integrins and growth factor receptors (Lee2019PTK2FAK).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating PTK2's activity, particularly at the Y397 site (Lee2019PTK2FAK). Splice variants of PTK2 may alter its functional domains, impacting its role in cellular processes (Lee2019PTK2FAK).

## Function
PTK2, also known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival. In healthy human cells, PTK2 is primarily involved in cell-ECM (extracellular matrix) interactions. Upon contact with the ECM, PTK2 undergoes rapid autophosphorylation, which facilitates the recruitment of other scaffold and signaling molecules. This activation leads to the initiation of downstream cell survival pathways, including PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK, which are essential for normal cell adhesion and survival signaling processes (Sethuraman2016SMARCE1).

PTK2 is localized at focal adhesions, which are critical sites for signal transduction that mediate the interaction between the cell and its extracellular environment. Through its interactions with integrins and growth factor receptors, PTK2 regulates signal transduction pathways that are vital for maintaining cellular communication and structural integrity (Chen2022Identification). The protein's activity is associated with the regulation of cell migration and proliferation, processes that are fundamental to tissue development and repair (Yu2022CircRPAP2). PTK2's role in these cellular functions underscores its importance in maintaining normal physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PTK2 gene, which encodes Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PTK2 is frequently overexpressed due to gene amplification, contributing to tumor growth, metastasis, and poor prognosis. This overexpression is associated with cancer cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis (Fan2019PTK2; Panera2017Focal). PTK2's role in HCC is further highlighted by its involvement in cancer stem cell traits and resistance to chemotherapy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Fan2019PTK2).

In breast cancer, PTK2 is identified as an adverse prognostic biomarker. Its elevated expression correlates with poor overall survival and is linked to clinicopathological features such as nodal metastasis and advanced cancer stages. Genomic alterations, primarily amplifications, are observed in a subset of patients, affecting overall and relapse-free survival (Chen2022Identification).

PTK2 also plays a role in ovarian cancer, where circ-PTK2, a circular RNA derived from PTK2, regulates cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. This regulation is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wu2021circPTK2).

## Interactions
PTK2, also known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play critical roles in cellular processes. PTK2 interacts with the SH3 domain, which is crucial for activating PTK2 signaling pathways. Key residues such as Tyr10, Gly40, Asn56, and Ile60 form hydrogen bonds with PTK2, highlighting the importance of these interactions in protein stability and conformation (Hassan2018Exploring).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, PTK2 interacts with Cas scaffolding protein family member 4 (CASS4), contributing to the formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. This interaction involves domains such as SH3 and SH2 in CASS4 and the FERM and protein kinase domains in PTK2, which are essential for downstream signaling pathways (Hassan2018Exploring).

PTK2 also plays a significant role in lung cancer progression through its interaction with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and toll-like receptors (TLRs). It enhances the activation of NF-B, a transcription factor involved in cancer progression, by interacting with key proteins in TLR-mediated signaling, such as TRAF6 and IRAK1 (Kim2024PTK2).

In TARDBP proteinopathies, PTK2 regulates the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) impairment by interacting with SQSTM1/p62 and TBK1, facilitating the degradation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins via the autophagy-lysosome pathway (Lee2019PTK2FAK).
