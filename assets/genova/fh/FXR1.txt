# FXR1

## Overview
The FXR1 gene encodes the FMR1 autosomal homolog 1 protein, a member of the fragile X-related protein family, which is primarily involved in RNA metabolism. This protein is characterized as an RNA-binding protein, featuring structural motifs such as KH domains and an RGG box, which facilitate its interaction with RNA molecules (Tamanini1997Differential; Siomi1995FXR1). FXR1 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including RNA splicing, export, stability, translation, and degradation, by forming ribonucleoprotein complexes (Khan2024The). It is also involved in miRNA processing and synaptic transmission, indicating its importance in neuromuscular junction integrity and cellular stress responses (Khan2024The). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues, such as the heart, skeletal muscles, brain, and testes, underscoring its diverse functional roles (Khan2024The). Mutations in the FXR1 gene have been linked to congenital multi-minicore myopathy and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle development and function (Estañ2019Recessive; Davidovic2008Alteration).

## Structure
The FXR1 protein is a member of the fragile X-related protein family and shares significant structural similarities with its homologs, particularly in the KH domains, which are crucial for RNA binding (Siomi1995FXR1). The primary structure of FXR1 includes two KH domains and an RGG box, which are common motifs in RNA-binding proteins (Tamanini1997Differential). The protein also contains a tandem Tudor domain, which is a significant structural feature, with the N-terminal Tudor domain (Tud1) forming a canonical Tudor barrel (AdamsCioaba2010Structural).

The secondary structure of FXR1 is characterized by the presence of highly twisted antiparallel β-strands and a single 3_10 helix within the Tudor domains (AdamsCioaba2010Structural). The tertiary structure includes a conserved architecture similar to the UHRF1 protein, which recognizes methylated histone peptides (AdamsCioaba2010Structural).

FXR1 can form homo- and heteromultimers with FMRP and FXR2P, indicating a quaternary structure that allows for functional autoregulation within this family of RNA-binding proteins (Tamanini1997Differential). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is crucial for translation regulation and stress response (Khan2024The). Multiple splice variant isoforms of FXR1 exist, differing at the carboxy-terminus, which may influence their localization and function (Siomi1995FXR1).

## Function
The FXR1 gene encodes the fragile X-related protein 1, which plays a multifaceted role in various cellular processes. FXR1 is primarily involved in RNA metabolism, where it regulates RNA splicing, export, stability, translation, and degradation by forming ribonucleoprotein complexes with specific RNAs (Khan2024The). It interacts with miRNA complexes and AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′-UTR of mRNAs, influencing mRNA decay, translation, and export (Khan2024The). FXR1 is also crucial in miRNA processing, impacting the biogenesis and maturation of miRNAs by interacting with proteins like Drosha, Dicer, and the RISC complex (Khan2024The).

In healthy human cells, FXR1 is involved in RNA editing mechanisms, particularly interacting with the A-to-I RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, which suggests a role in synaptic transmission and neuromuscular junction integrity (Khan2024The). FXR1 modulates ion channels in neurons, influencing their translation, trafficking, and gating, and is significant in cellular stress responses, particularly in stress granule assembly (Khan2024The). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscles, brain, and testes, indicating its diverse targeting and functional roles (Khan2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FXR1 gene are associated with congenital multi-minicore myopathy, a condition characterized by muscle weakness and structural abnormalities in muscle fibers. Recessive mutations, particularly in exon-15 of FXR1, lead to frameshift mutations that affect muscle-specific FXR1P isoforms, resulting in premature stop codons. These mutations escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, contributing to the pathology of the disease (Estañ2019Recessive). Patients with these mutations exhibit symptoms such as severe hypotonia, shallow breathing, and muscle weakness (Estañ2019Recessive).

The FXR1 gene is also implicated in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), where alterations in the expression of muscle-specific isoforms of FXR1P are observed. In FSHD patients, there is a reduction in the long isoforms of FXR1P, which correlates with altered splicing patterns and decreased stability of exon 15-containing mRNA variants (Davidovic2008Alteration). This reduction in FXR1P isoforms is linked to muscle abnormalities and may contribute to the pathophysiology of FSHD by affecting muscle regeneration (Davidovic2013A).

In zebrafish, reduced expression of FXR1 leads to cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy, highlighting its critical role in muscle and cardiac development (van’t2009Reduction).

## Interactions
FXR1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to the p21-activated kinase PAK1 through its KH(2) domain, a crucial interaction for muscle development and stress granule formation. This binding is specific to PAK1 and does not occur with PAK2 or PAK3. The interaction is dependent on the active form of PAK1, as FXR1 can bind to the open kinase but not the full-length autoinhibited kinase. Phosphorylation of FXR1 at Ser420 by PAK1 is essential for its function, particularly in muscle development and stress responses (Say2010A).

FXR1 also interacts with RNA molecules, including G quartet RNA, which are potential mRNA targets of FMR1. It can bind to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′-UTR of mRNAs, influencing mRNA stability and translation. FXR1 competes with the RNA-stabilizing protein HuR on ARE-containing transcripts, affecting mRNA decay (Khan2024The).

In addition, FXR1 is involved in transcription regulation by interacting with transcription factors such as STAT1 and STAT3, and chromatin regulators like CHD4 and SNF2H. It recruits or stabilizes these factors at gene promoters, facilitating active transcription (Fan2017FXR1).
