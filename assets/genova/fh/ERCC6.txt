# ERCC6

## Overview
The ERCC6 gene, also known as Cockayne syndrome B (CSB), encodes a protein that is integral to DNA repair and chromatin remodeling processes. The protein, ERCC excision repair 6, chromatin remodeling factor, is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases, which are known for their role in chromatin remodeling. Unlike typical helicases, the CSB protein lacks helicase activity but is crucial for transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), a specialized DNA repair pathway that rectifies transcription-blocking lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes. This function is vital for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring proper transcriptional activity. Additionally, CSB is involved in base excision repair (BER), particularly in addressing oxidative DNA damage. Mutations in the ERCC6 gene are linked to Cockayne Syndrome, a disorder characterized by growth failure, neurological degeneration, and photosensitivity, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Tiwari2021Current; Brosh1999The; Orren1996The).

## Function
The ERCC6 gene, also known as Cockayne syndrome B (CSB), encodes a protein that plays a critical role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling in healthy human cells. The CSB protein is primarily involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), a sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair (NER) that specifically targets and repairs DNA damage on the transcribed strand of active genes. This process is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and ensuring proper transcriptional activity by resolving transcription-blocking lesions (Brosh1999The; Orren1996The).

CSB is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of DNA-dependent ATPases and exhibits ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity, although it lacks helicase activity. It interacts with RNA polymerase II and other repair factors to facilitate the repair of active genes, enhancing transcription elongation and promoting efficient lesion removal (Tiwari2021Current; Brosh1999The). The ATPase domain of CSB is essential for its function in DNA repair, particularly in facilitating ATP hydrolysis necessary for transcription-coupled repair (Brosh1999The).

In addition to its role in TC-NER, CSB is involved in base excision repair (BER), where it aids in repairing oxidative DNA damage and interacts with other BER proteins to enhance their activity (Tiwari2021Current). CSB's functions are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function, with its dysfunction linked to disorders such as Cockayne syndrome (Tiwari2021Current).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ERCC6 gene are primarily associated with Cockayne Syndrome (CS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth failure, neurological degeneration, and photosensitivity. The ERCC6 gene encodes the CSB protein, which is crucial for DNA repair processes. Mutations in ERCC6 can lead to a loss of function in the CSB protein, impairing DNA repair and contributing to the clinical manifestations of CS. These mutations include frameshift, missense, and nonsense mutations, which result in truncated or dysfunctional proteins (Troelstra1992ERCC6; Yu2014Identification; Kou2018Novel).

Cockayne Syndrome is divided into subtypes, with CSB being the most common form linked to ERCC6 mutations. Patients with CSB often exhibit severe symptoms, including microcephaly, sensorineural hearing loss, and premature aging (Lin2021Whole; Zayoud2021Identification). The phenotypic variability in CS can be significant, even among patients with the same mutation, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors may influence the disease presentation (Zayoud2021Identification).

Alterations in ERCC6 expression levels have also been implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where reduced expression in the retinal pigment epithelium is observed in early AMD-affected eyes, potentially due to oxidative stress (Baas2010The).

## Interactions
The ERCC6 gene encodes the CSB protein, which is involved in transcription-coupled repair (TCR) and interacts with various components of the transcription machinery. CSB interacts dynamically with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during transcription elongation, forming a complex with Pol II that includes DNA and nascent RNA. This interaction is crucial for the repair of active genes and is dependent on ATP hydrolysis (Tantin1997Recruitment). CSB's ATPase activity is stimulated by double-stranded DNA, and it can bind directly to DNA at low magnesium concentrations, indicating that nucleic acids stabilize its interaction with Pol II (Tantin1997Recruitment).

CSB also interacts with the TFIIH-associated factor XPG and is part of a high molecular weight complex involved in TCR. It is implicated in chromatin remodeling, interacting with double-stranded DNA and core histones, which suggests a role in modulating nucleosome structure (Citterio2000ATPDependent). CSB's interactions are prolonged upon DNA damage, indicating its engagement in TCR, and it remains immobilized longer after UV irradiation compared to core nucleotide excision repair factors (van2004DNA).
