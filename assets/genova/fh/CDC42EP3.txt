# CDC42EP3

## Overview
CDC42EP3 is a gene that encodes the CDC42 effector protein 3, also known as BORG2, which is a member of the Borg family of CDC42 effector proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, particularly in actin and septin filament dynamics, by acting as an adaptor protein that binds to both F-actin and septins. The CDC42EP3 protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac Interactive Binding) domain, which is essential for its interaction with the small GTPase CDC42, and BH domains that facilitate its binding to actin and septins. These interactions are vital for maintaining cell morphology, motility, and polarity. CDC42EP3 is involved in various cellular processes and has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis, and neurological disorders, where it may affect cytoskeletal organization (Yang2022CDC42EP3; Farrugia2016The; Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Structure
The CDC42EP3 protein, also known as BORG2, is part of the Cdc42 effector protein family and is characterized by several conserved domains. It contains a CRIB (Cdc42/Rac Interactive Binding) domain, which is crucial for binding to the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 and possibly Rac proteins (Mehetre; Farrugia2016The). Following the CRIB domain is the BH1 domain, which, along with the CRIB domain, is proposed to be responsible for actin binding (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). The protein also includes BH2 and BH3 domains, with the BH3 domain being necessary for binding to septins (Farrugia2016The; Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

The structure of CDC42EP3 is largely predicted to be disordered, with the BH3 domain containing an alpha-helix (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). The protein is described as having an extended structure in solution, which undergoes a conformational change upon binding with Cdc42 (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). There are no high-resolution structures available for CDC42EP3, and specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature (Farrugia2016The; Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). The protein is conserved across vertebrates, but no information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms is detailed in the context provided (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Function
CDC42EP3, a member of the Borg family of CDC42 effector proteins, plays a significant role in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, particularly in actin and septin filament dynamics. It acts as an adaptor protein that binds both F-actin and septins, reinforcing these networks and contributing to the maintenance of cell morphology and motility (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP3 promotes actin filament assembly by recruiting actin monomers to septin filaments, thereby increasing local actin concentration and accelerating polymerization. This process is crucial for the formation and stabilization of stress fibers, which are essential for cellular structure and function (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, influencing cell shape, motility, and polarity (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP3's interaction with septins and actin filaments is regulated by the presence of active CDC42, which negatively affects its binding affinity, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism in cytoskeletal organization (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). In cancer-associated fibroblasts, CDC42EP3 forms a filamentous network that co-localizes with septin filaments and aligns with F-actin, impacting actomyosin contractility and mechano-transduction signaling (Farrugia2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDC42EP3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In glioma, CDC42EP3 is overexpressed, correlating with higher pathological grading and recurrence. Knockdown of CDC42EP3 in glioma cells reduces proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression through the regulation of the CCND1 gene via c-Myc-mediated transcription (Yang2022CDC42EP3). 

CDC42EP3 is also upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in breast cancer, where it is essential for CAF activation and cancer-promoting activities. This upregulation promotes actin stress fiber and septin filament formation, facilitating cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). In melanoma, CDC42EP3 is linked to metastasis and paclitaxel resistance (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

Conversely, in ovarian cancer, CDC42EP3 is downregulated, which correlates with a poorer prognosis and suggests a role in immunosuppression (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). In schizophrenia, elevated CDC42EP3 mRNA levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex suggest a potential link to the disorder through changes in the actin and septin cytoskeleton (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). These findings highlight the diverse roles of CDC42EP3 in different diseases, potentially balancing cell-autonomous effects and immunological responses.

## Interactions
CDC42EP3, also known as Cdc42 effector protein 3, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology. CDC42EP3 interacts with the active form of the small GTPase Cdc42 (Cdc42-GTP), which is essential for its activity. Mutants of CDC42EP3 that cannot bind Cdc42 exhibit reduced activity and fail to induce typical morphological changes (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP3 also binds to F-actin and septins, acting as an adaptor protein that reinforces both networks. In cancer-associated fibroblasts, it forms a filamentous network that co-localizes with septin filaments and aligns with F-actin, facilitating the crosslinking activity of septins and affecting actomyosin contractility (Farrugia2016The).

CDC42EP3 is a substrate for atypical MAP kinases ERK3 and MK5, which may influence neuronal cytoskeleton regulation (Farrugia2016The). It interacts with SEPT2/6/7, contributing to cell shape regulation and fibroblast activation (Farrugia2016The). In the context of somite segmentation in Xenopus embryos, CDC42EP3 interacts with Cdc42 to regulate cell shape changes and tissue arrangements, providing feedback regulation to Cdc42 activity (Kho2019Cdc42).
