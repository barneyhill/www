# HDAC11

## Overview
HDAC11 is a gene that encodes the protein histone deacetylase 11, which is a member of the histone deacetylase family. This protein is categorized as a class IV histone deacetylase, distinguished by its unique catalytic core region (Yanginlar2018HDAC11). Histone deacetylase 11 plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by removing acetyl groups from histone proteins, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene transcription. It is involved in various cellular processes, including immune function regulation, where it modulates the acetylation status of gene promoters affecting T cell activation and differentiation (Yanginlar2018HDAC11). HDAC11 is also implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses and has been associated with several diseases, such as metabolic disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2017Histone; Chen2022HDAC11).

## Function
HDAC11 is a member of the histone deacetylase family, primarily involved in the regulation of immune functions. It is the smallest member of the HDAC family and is classified as a class IV HDAC due to its distinct catalytic core region (Yanginlar2018HDAC11). HDAC11 is predominantly nuclear in HEK293 cells but can be found in different cellular compartments depending on the cell type, such as the cytoplasm of resting CD4+ T cells (Yanginlar2018HDAC11). It plays a significant role in regulating immune responses by influencing the acetylation status of gene promoters, such as Tbet and Eomes, which affects T cell activation and differentiation (Yanginlar2018HDAC11).

In neutrophils, HDAC11 is expressed at higher levels compared to other myeloid cells and is crucial for controlling their behavior, although it is not essential for their formation. HDAC11 deficiency leads to a more aggressive neutrophil population (Yanginlar2018HDAC11). HDAC11 also acts as a negative regulator of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in macrophages, affecting chromatin configuration and transcription factor binding, which in turn influences IL-10 production (Yanginlar2018HDAC11; Villagra2008The). This regulatory function suggests that HDAC11 plays a critical role in maintaining immune balance and preventing uncontrolled inflammatory processes (Yanginlar2018HDAC11).

## Clinical Significance
HDAC11 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in regulating gene expression through histone deacetylation. In metabolic disorders, HDAC11 is associated with obesity and diabetes. Its inhibition has been shown to promote brown adipose tissue development and improve glucose tolerance, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for these conditions (Chen2022HDAC11). HDAC11 also plays a role in diabetic cardiopathy, where its inhibition can ameliorate the condition by affecting lipid metabolism and reducing inflammation and oxidative stress (Chen2022HDAC11).

In the context of cancer, HDAC11 is involved in the suppression of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in pituitary tumors. Overexpression of HDAC11 leads to decreased p53 levels, contributing to tumor growth by interfering with apoptosis (Wang2017Histone).

HDAC11 is also linked to schizophrenia through a significant three-locus interaction model involving HDAC9, HDAC10, and HDAC11, suggesting a potential epistatic interaction between these genes (Kebir2014Familybased). These findings highlight the diverse roles of HDAC11 in various pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
HDAC11, the only member of Class IV histone deacetylases, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) to recruit HDAC11 to the promoter region of angiogenic factor with G patch and FHA domains 1 (Aggf1), resulting in decreased Aggf1 expression (Liu2020HDAC11:). HDAC11 also binds with the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) to inhibit the expression of tight junction proteins (Liu2020HDAC11:). It deacetylates several proteins, including E2Fa/E2F4, HEY-1, and Egr-1, affecting tumor suppressor gene expression and promoting cancer development (Liu2020HDAC11:).

HDAC11 interacts with the twist protein to inhibit HAS2 expression, impacting cancer invasion and metastasis (Liu2020HDAC11:). It also deacetylates the replication licensing factor CDT1, leading to its ubiquitylation and degradation, and binds to CDT1 and replication origins to reduce chromatin accessibility (Liu2020HDAC11:). In immune regulation, HDAC11 binds to the distal region of the IL-10 promoter, affecting chromatin configuration and transcription factor binding (Yanginlar2018HDAC11). HDAC11's interaction with SHMT2 regulates type I interferon signaling through defatty-acylation, affecting the ubiquitination and recycling of the type I interferon receptor (Cao2019HDAC11).
