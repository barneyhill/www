# ESS2

## Overview
The ESS2 gene, also known as DGCR14, encodes the ess-2 splicing factor homolog, a protein that functions as a transcriptional coregulator and is primarily localized in the nucleus. This protein is involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression, by participating in the splicing C complex and interacting with other splicing components such as FRA10AC1 (Takahashi2023ESS2; Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). Additionally, ESS2 acts as a transcriptional co-activator for nuclear receptors, influencing the expression of genes involved in cellular homeostasis and development, particularly in the prostate (Takahashi2023ESS2). The protein's interactions with chromatin remodeling factors and its role in various signaling pathways underscore its significance in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, with implications for cancer progression, particularly in prostate cancer (Takahashi2023ESS2).

## Function
The ESS2 gene, also known as DGCR14, encodes a transcriptional coregulator that is primarily localized in the nucleus. It plays a significant role in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process in gene expression, by influencing the removal of introns and the joining of exons to form mature mRNA. ESS2 is involved in the splicing C complex, although its precise role in splicing remains unclear (Takahashi2023ESS2). It interacts with other splicing components, such as FRA10AC1, suggesting a functional synergy during spliceosome assembly (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction).

ESS2 also acts as a transcriptional co-activator for nuclear receptors, including RORγ/γt, and regulates the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ and vitamin D receptor (VDR) in prostate cancer cells (Takahashi2023ESS2). In healthy cells, ESS2 is highly expressed in the normal prostate, indicating its potential role in maintaining normal cellular functions and prostate organogenesis (Takahashi2023ESS2). The gene's involvement in regulating cell proliferation and maintenance suggests its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal development. However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
The ESS2 gene, also known as DGCR14, plays a significant role in prostate cancer progression. Alterations in ESS2 expression are associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), where it acts as a transcriptional coregulator interacting with transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors like CHD1. ESS2 knockdown in prostate cancer cells leads to reduced proliferation and altered expression of cancer-related genes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for CRPC (Takahashi2023ESS2).

ESS2 is implicated in the regulation of several signaling pathways, including TGF-β/SMAD, NF-κB/CHD1, and noncanonical WNT, which are crucial for cancer progression and metastasis. Its knockdown results in decreased transcriptional activities of SMAD2/3 and reduced TGF-β-dependent MMP-9 mRNA induction, indicating its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor invasion (Takahashi2023ESS2).

ESS2 also influences the expression of genes involved in immune response and inflammation, such as type I interferon response genes, which are linked to prostate cancer severity. The expression of IFITM3, a type I IFN target gene, is positively correlated with prostate cancer severity, and its knockdown inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion (Takahashi2023ESS2). These findings suggest that ESS2 is crucial for prostate cancer progression and may serve as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The ESS2 protein, also known as DGCR14, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. ESS2 interacts with the Tsr2 protein, particularly through its eukaryotic-specific segment ESS2, which is crucial for the disassembly of the importin:eS26 complex. This interaction involves a transition of ESS2 from a disordered to a structured conformation upon binding to Tsr2-N, forming a complex characterized by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Schütz2018Molecular).

In prostate cancer, ESS2 interacts with chromatin remodeling factors such as chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (CHD1) and BAZ1B, influencing transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. ESS2 modulates the recruitment of CHD1 to chromatin and affects the expression of genes in the NF-κB/CHD1 pathway, impacting cancer progression (Takahashi2023ESS2).

ESS2 also interacts with FRA10AC1, a protein involved in spliceosomal functions. The interaction is mediated by specific regions within both proteins, suggesting a role in splice site recognition and splicing regulation (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). These interactions highlight ESS2's involvement in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.
