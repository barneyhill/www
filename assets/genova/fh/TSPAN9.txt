# TSPAN9

## Overview
TSPAN9 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 9, a member of the tetraspanin family characterized by four transmembrane domains. Tetraspanin 9 is involved in various cellular processes, including platelet function, cancer cell migration, and viral entry, by modulating membrane dynamics and protein interactions. It is localized at the plasma membrane and within endosomal compartments, where it influences the formation of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, crucial for membrane compartmentalization and signaling. Tetraspanin 9 interacts with several proteins, such as the collagen receptor GPVI in platelets and integrin β1 in cancer cells, affecting processes like hemostasis, metastasis, and autophagy. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have significant implications in clinical contexts, particularly in cancer, where TSPAN9 can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the cellular environment (Shao2022Tspan9; Qi2020TSPAN9; Haining2016Tetraspanin).

## Structure
TSPAN9, or tetraspanin 9, is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains. These domains are linked by extracellular loops, with a small extracellular loop (EC1) connecting the first two transmembrane domains and a larger extracellular loop (EC2) connecting the latter two. The EC2 loop contains conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges, which are crucial for the correct folding of the protein (Zhang2024Tspan). TSPAN9 is a small protein, approximately 27 kDa in size, and is conserved across species from humans to mosquitoes (Stiles2016Role).

TSPAN9 is localized at the plasma membrane and within early and late endosomes, playing a role in various cellular processes, including virus fusion and cancer cell migration (Stiles2016Role; Qi2019TSPAN9). It is involved in forming tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, which influence membrane compartmentalization and protein interactions (Stiles2016Role). Post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation are common in tetraspanins, although specific modifications for TSPAN9 are not detailed in the provided context (Zhang2024Tspan). The protein's role in cellular processes suggests it may interact with other proteins, such as integrins, influencing cell signaling and migration (Qi2019TSPAN9).

## Function
TSPAN9, or tetraspanin 9, is a protein that plays a significant role in platelet function by regulating the lateral diffusion and activation of the collagen receptor GPVI. This regulation is crucial for platelet activation and aggregation, processes essential for hemostasis and thrombosis. TSPAN9 influences the lateral mobility of GPVI on the platelet surface, facilitating rapid clustering and signaling upon ligand engagement, which is vital for effective platelet response to vascular injury (Haining2016Tetraspanin).

In addition to its role in platelets, TSPAN9 is involved in the endocytic pathway, particularly in early endosomes. It is localized at the plasma membrane and within vesicular compartments, including early and late endosomes. TSPAN9 modulates the endosomal environment, potentially affecting membrane fusion processes, although its specific cellular functions in healthy human cells remain incompletely understood (Stiles2016Role).

TSPAN9 is also expressed in endothelial cells of various organs, suggesting a broader role in vascular biology. However, TSPAN9-deficient mice do not exhibit significant morphological changes, indicating possible functional redundancy with other tetraspanins (Haining2016Tetraspanin).

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN9 has been implicated in various cancers, notably gastric cancer and osteosarcoma, due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In gastric cancer, TSPAN9 is associated with drug resistance, particularly to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Overexpression of TSPAN9 in gastric cancer cells leads to increased resistance to 5-FU by promoting autophagy and inhibiting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival under stress conditions like chemotherapy (Qi2020TSPAN9; Deng2021Tetraspanins:). Conversely, TSPAN9 overexpression can inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by suppressing the ERK1/2 pathway, indicating a complex role in tumor progression (LI2016Tspan9).

In osteosarcoma, TSPAN9 acts as an oncogene, promoting metastasis through the activation of the FAK-Ras-ERK1/2 signaling pathway and facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This is evidenced by increased migratory and invasive capabilities of osteosarcoma cells with TSPAN9 overexpression (Shao2022Tspan9). These findings suggest that TSPAN9's role in cancer is context-dependent, acting as a tumor suppressor in some scenarios and an oncogene in others.

## Interactions
TSPAN9, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the platelet collagen receptor GPVI, affecting its lateral diffusion and activation. This interaction is crucial for normal platelet aggregation and secretion, as TSPAN9 modulates GPVI membrane dynamics, although the interaction is not strong under stringent conditions (Haining2016Tetraspanin).

In the context of cancer, TSPAN9 interacts with integrin β1 in osteosarcoma cells, promoting metastasis through the FAK-Ras-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This interaction facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cell migration and invasion (Shao2022Tspan9). In gastric cancer, TSPAN9 is involved in the regulation of autophagy by interacting with the PIK3R3 subunit of PI3K, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for promoting autophagy and contributing to drug resistance (Qi2020TSPAN9).

TSPAN9 also plays a role in viral infections, where it is implicated in the entry and fusion of alphaviruses by modulating the endosomal environment, although specific interaction partners in this context are not detailed (Stiles2016Role).
