# SAT2

## Overview
The SAT2 gene encodes the protein spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase family member 2, which is a key enzyme involved in the polyamine catabolic pathway. This enzyme belongs to the acetyltransferase family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of polyamine levels within the cell by catalyzing the acetylation of spermidine and spermine. The regulation of polyamine levels is essential for cellular growth and differentiation, as well as for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of SAT2 expression or activity has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance.
