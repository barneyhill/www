# B3GNT9

## Overview
B3GNT9 is a human gene that encodes the protein UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 9, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine, a carbohydrate structure found on glycoproteins and glycolipids. Glycosyltransferases like the protein encoded by B3GNT9 play a crucial role in the modification of proteins and lipids, impacting various biological processes such as cell-cell communication and molecular stability. The activity of this enzyme is essential for the proper functioning of cellular mechanisms, and alterations in its expression or function can have significant implications for human health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
