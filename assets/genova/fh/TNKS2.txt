# TNKS2

## Overview
TNKS2, or tankyrase 2, is a gene that encodes a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including telomere maintenance, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and DNA repair. The protein tankyrase 2, produced by TNKS2, is characterized by its catalytic PARP domain, ankyrin repeat clusters, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins (DaRosa2016Structural; Qiu2014Insights). As a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, tankyrase 2 plays a critical role in post-translational modification through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, impacting cellular functions such as telomere length regulation and signal transduction pathways (Pillay2022Structural; Cook2002Role). The gene's involvement in key signaling pathways and cellular maintenance underscores its importance in health and disease, with implications for cancer progression and potential therapeutic targeting (Xiao2021miR5825p; Fu2022Icariin).

## Structure
TNKS2 (tankyrase 2) is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of TNKS2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form its backbone. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (Qiu2014Insights).

The tertiary structure of TNKS2 is defined by its catalytic PARP domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain is involved in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of target proteins, a key post-translational modification that TNKS2 performs (Qiu2014Insights). Additionally, TNKS2 contains ankyrin repeat clusters that facilitate substrate recognition and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain that is essential for dimerization and oligomerization (DaRosa2016Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, TNKS2 can form homodimers and hetero-oligomers through its SAM domain, which is important for its functional interactions and regulatory mechanisms (DaRosa2016Structural). The protein's ability to oligomerize is suggested to influence its PARylation activity, impacting various cellular processes (DaRosa2016Structural). Splice variant isoforms of TNKS2 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties (Qiu2014Insights).

## Function
Tankyrase 2 (TNKS2) is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase involved in several critical cellular processes, including telomere maintenance, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and DNA damage repair. TNKS2 interacts with the telomeric protein TRF1, modulating its binding to telomeres through ADP-ribosylation, which is crucial for telomere length regulation and stability (Cook2002Role). Although TNKS2 does not naturally contain a nuclear localization signal, it can influence telomere dynamics when artificially targeted to the nucleus, suggesting a regulatory role in telomere maintenance (Cook2002Role).

In addition to its role in telomere biology, TNKS2 is involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, a pathway important for cell proliferation and differentiation. It regulates the stability of Axin2, a negative regulator of β-catenin, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in cancers dependent on active β-catenin (Pillay2022Structural; Qiu2014Insights). TNKS2 is also implicated in glucose homeostasis and vesicle trafficking, with localization in the Golgi complex and GLUT4 storage vesicles (Lyons2001Identification; Damale2020Insights). These diverse roles highlight TNKS2's importance in maintaining cellular health and its potential impact on disease mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the TNKS2 gene, which encodes tankyrase 2, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In ovarian cancer, TNKS2 is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is often hyperactive in tumors. Icariin, a natural compound, has been shown to inhibit TNKS2, leading to reduced tumor growth by modulating this pathway (Fu2022Icariin). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, TNKS2 expression is targeted by miR-582-5p, which affects cancer cell migration and chemo-resistance, suggesting TNKS2's role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Xiao2021miR5825p).

Beyond cancer, TNKS2 interactions are significant in pigmentation disorders. The SASH1 gene, which interacts with TNKS2, is crucial for maintaining melanocyte stem cells. Variants in SASH1, such as S519N, alter its interaction with TNKS2, potentially leading to pigmentation disorders like accelerated hair graying and skin dyspigmentation (Lambert2023SASH1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TNKS2 in both cancer and non-cancerous conditions, emphasizing its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Tankyrase 2 (TNKS2) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. TNKS2 interacts with substrates through its ankyrin (ANK) domain, which recognizes the Tankyrase Binding Motif (TBM) present in substrates. This interaction is crucial for its role in telomere elongation, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, mitosis, glucose metabolism, pexophagy, and DNA repair (ZamudioMartinez2021Tankyrases).

TNKS2 forms complexes with proteins such as AXIN1 and AXIN2, which are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. These interactions influence the degradation of β-catenin, a key component of the pathway (Callow2011Ubiquitin). TNKS2 also interacts with TRF1, a telomeric protein, affecting telomere length regulation (Damale2020Insights).

The ubiquitin ligase RNF146 interacts with TNKS2, leading to its ubiquitylation and degradation via the proteasome. This interaction is significant for the regulation of Wnt signaling, as RNF146 mediates the ubiquitylation of TNKS2 and Axin proteins, impacting their stability (Callow2011Ubiquitin).

TNKS2 also binds to TAB182, a novel protein identified to interact with the ankyrin domain of tankyrase proteins, indicating a conserved binding mechanism between TNKS1 and TNKS2 (Seimiya2002The).
