# TEFM

## Overview
TEFM is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial transcription elongation factor, a protein crucial for the transcription of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This protein plays a significant role in enhancing the processivity of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), thereby facilitating the synthesis of longer RNA transcripts by preventing premature termination. Structurally, the transcription elongation factor, mitochondrial, is characterized by helix-hairpin-helix motifs and an RNase H fold, which are common in DNA-binding proteins involved in transcription (Posse2015TEFM; Minczuk2011TEFM). The protein's interaction with POLRMT is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, as it ensures the proper transcription and processing of mitochondrial RNAs, which are vital for the expression of respiratory chain components (Jiang2019TEFM; Minczuk2011TEFM). Dysregulation of TEFM has been linked to mitochondrial diseases and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in both health and disease (Jiang2019TEFM; Li2020Elevated).

## Structure
The TEFM protein, also known as transcription elongation factor, mitochondrial, is characterized by specific structural features that contribute to its function in mitochondrial transcription. TEFM contains two tandemly repeated helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motifs and an RNase H fold, which are common in transcription-related DNA-binding proteins (Posse2015TEFM; Minczuk2011TEFM). These motifs share sequence homology with the HhH motifs of the bacterial TEX protein and the nuclear transcription elongation regulator Spt6 (Minczuk2011TEFM).

The RNase H fold of TEFM is similar to that found in the YqgF family, preserving the overall topology and structural elements of the RuvC Holliday Junction Resolvases' fold, although TEFM itself does not function as a resolvase (Minczuk2011TEFM). TEFM is a 234-residue protein with a molecular weight of 37.6 kDa, and it exists as a dimer in solution, with an apparent molecular weight of 82 kDa (Posse2015TEFM).

TEFM interacts directly with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase POLRMT, forming a complex that enhances transcription elongation by stabilizing the transcription elongation complex and preventing premature termination (Yu2018TEFM; Minczuk2011TEFM). This interaction is crucial for its role in mitochondrial transcription.

## Function
The human gene TEFM encodes a mitochondrial transcription elongation factor that is essential for the transcription of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in healthy cells. TEFM enhances the processivity of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), allowing it to synthesize longer RNA transcripts by reducing premature termination events, particularly at regions with strong secondary structures like G-quadruplexes (Yu2018TEFM; Posse2015TEFM). TEFM interacts directly with POLRMT, forming a complex that stabilizes the transcription elongation machinery, ensuring efficient synthesis of mitochondrial RNA (Posse2015TEFM; Minczuk2011TEFM).

TEFM is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production through oxidative phosphorylation. It ensures the proper transcription and processing of mitochondrial RNAs, which are critical for the expression of respiratory chain components and the overall stability of mitochondrial respiratory complexes (Jiang2019TEFM; Minczuk2011TEFM). The protein is localized within the mitochondria, where it plays a vital role in both transcription elongation and RNA processing, contributing to the regulation of mtDNA replication and transcription (Yu2018TEFM; Jiang2019TEFM). The loss of TEFM leads to impaired mtDNA transcription, reduced mitochondrial transcripts, and decreased abundance of respiratory chain components, highlighting its essential role in cellular bioenergetics (Yu2018TEFM).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TEFM gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in conditions related to mitochondrial dysfunction. TEFM is essential for mitochondrial transcription elongation and RNA processing, and its disruption can lead to severe mitochondrial diseases. In mice, the absence of TEFM results in embryonic lethality, indicating its critical role in development (Jiang2019TEFM). In humans, TEFM dysfunction is associated with impaired oxidative phosphorylation, leading to decreased activity of respiratory chain complexes and reduced cellular energy production (Minczuk2011TEFM). This can manifest as cardiomyopathy and other mitochondrial-related diseases (Jiang2019TEFM).

In the context of cancer, elevated TEFM expression has been linked to poor prognosis in low-grade glioma (LGG) patients. Studies have shown that high TEFM mRNA levels correlate with older age, higher tumor grade, and shorter overall survival, suggesting its role as an oncogene in LGG progression (Li2020Elevated). These findings indicate that TEFM could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in LGG (Li2020Elevated). Overall, TEFM's role in mitochondrial function and its dysregulation highlight its importance in both developmental and disease contexts.

## Interactions
TEFM (transcription elongation factor, mitochondrial) is known to interact with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial transcription and RNA processing. TEFM forms a complex with the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT), enhancing its processivity and stabilizing the transcription elongation complex. This interaction is direct and persists even in the absence of DNA and RNA, indicating a strong association between TEFM and POLRMT (Posse2015TEFM; Minczuk2011TEFM).

TEFM also interacts with various RNA processing factors, including the RNase P complex (MRPP1-3), ELAC2, GRSF1, and components of the mitochondrial RNA degradosome (SUPV3L1-PNPase). These interactions suggest that TEFM is involved in coupling transcription elongation with RNA processing, potentially increasing the accuracy and efficiency of pre-RNA maturation (Jiang2019TEFM).

In addition to its interactions with proteins, TEFM binds to DNA and nascent RNA, stabilizing the transcription elongation complex and reducing transcription termination. This binding helps POLRMT bypass structured regions in mitochondrial DNA, such as G-quadruplexes, and facilitates the formation of replication primers (Yu2018TEFM; Posse2015TEFM).
