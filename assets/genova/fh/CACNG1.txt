# CACNG1

## Overview
The CACNG1 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit gamma 1, a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel complex, particularly in skeletal muscle cells. This auxiliary subunit plays a pivotal role in modulating the channel's biophysical properties, such as activation and inactivation kinetics, without affecting the number of channels on the cell surface or their trafficking (Campiglio2015The; Arikkath2003Auxiliary). By stabilizing the inactivated state of the CaV1.1 channel, the γ1 subunit regulates calcium ion flow, which is essential for muscle function and coordination (Campiglio2015The). The gene's involvement in calcium handling suggests its potential role in conditions like malignant hyperthermia and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Bjorksten2016Sequencing; Sharma2019Somatic).

## Structure


## Function
The CACNG1 gene encodes the gamma-1 (γ1) subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel complex, which is primarily active in skeletal muscle cells. This protein plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of the calcium channel, influencing calcium ion flow into cells. The γ1 subunit is an integral membrane protein with four transmembrane helices and is involved in stabilizing the inactivated state of the CaV1.1 channel in skeletal muscle. This stabilization limits calcium current and depolarization-induced sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, which is essential for proper muscle function and coordination (Campiglio2015The).

The γ1 subunit does not affect the number of channels on the cell surface nor is it required to maintain the integrity of the channel complex. Instead, it predominantly modulates the biophysical properties of the channel, such as activation and inactivation kinetics, without significantly influencing channel trafficking (Arikkath2003Auxiliary). The γ1 subunit's primary function is in modulating channel properties rather than trafficking, indicating its specific role in the functional diversity of voltage-gated calcium channels (Campiglio2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CACNG1 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. The gene encodes the γ subunit of the L-type calcium channel, which plays a crucial role in calcium handling in skeletal muscle. Although specific diseases directly linked to CACNG1 mutations are not extensively documented, its involvement in calcium movement suggests a potential role in conditions like malignant hyperthermia (MH). MH is a severe reaction to certain anesthetics, characterized by rapid body temperature increase and muscle contractions. The CACNG1 gene is located on chromosome 17q, a region previously associated with MH, and its role in increasing voltage sensitivity and calcium release in muscle cells suggests it may contribute to MH pathophysiology (Bjorksten2016Sequencing).

In cancer research, a missense mutation in CACNG1 was identified in a young patient with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression. This mutation results in a protein change from p.P71T, which may affect the function of ion channels in cancer cells (Sharma2019Somatic). These findings highlight the importance of CACNG1 in both muscle function and cancer, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.

## Interactions
CACNG1 is a subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, playing a critical role in modulating the channel's properties. It interacts with the alpha-1 subunit of the calcium channel, which is essential for influencing channel trafficking and gating. These interactions are vital for proper muscle function and signal transduction, as they help regulate the flow of calcium ions through the channel, impacting muscle contraction and other cellular processes. The interaction between CACNG1 and the alpha-1 subunit ensures the correct assembly and function of the calcium channel complex, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and physiological responses.
