# CLDN4

## Overview
The CLDN4 gene encodes claudin 4, a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudin 4 is part of the claudin family, which plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity and selective permeability of cellular barriers. The protein is characterized by four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, which are essential for its function in regulating paracellular transport and ion selectivity (Krause2015Assembly; Ling2008Structural). Claudin 4 is involved in various physiological processes, including enhancing transepithelial resistance and maintaining cell-cell junction integrity. It interacts with other proteins, such as claudin-8 and MUPP1, to ensure proper localization and function within tight junctions (Hou2010Claudin4; Lanaspa2008Hypertonic). Alterations in CLDN4 expression are associated with several cancers, where it can influence tumor progression and serve as a potential therapeutic target (Yang2022Evaluation; Kwon2011Claudin4).

## Structure
Claudin 4 (CLDN4) is a member of the claudin family, integral to the structure and function of tight junctions in epithelial cells. The protein is characterized by four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, ECL1 and ECL2, which are crucial for its function in paracellular barrier regulation (Krause2015Assembly; Ling2008Structural). The second extracellular loop (ECL2) is particularly important for binding interactions, such as with the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), where it interacts with the C-terminal 30 amino acids of the toxin (Krause2015Assembly; Ling2008Structural).

The protein's structure includes a left-handed four-helix bundle formed by its transmembrane domains, contributing to its stability and function (Krause2015Assembly). The extracellular loops are linked via a beta-sheet fold, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the protein (Krause2015Assembly). The ECL1 of CLDN4 contains residues that are critical for sealing against ions like Na+, highlighting its role in maintaining tight junction integrity (Krause2015Assembly).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the function of CLDN4, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Krause2015Assembly). The protein's ability to oligomerize poses solubility challenges, which are addressed in experimental studies (Ling2008Structural).

## Function
Claudin 4 (CLDN4) is a crucial component of tight junctions, which are integral to maintaining the barrier and fence functions in epithelial and endothelial cells. It is involved in the formation of tight junction strands, contributing to the structural integrity and function of these cellular barriers (Morita1999Claudin). CLDN4 plays a significant role in regulating paracellular transport by influencing ion selectivity and permeability. In certain cell types, such as MDCK II cells, CLDN4 increases transepithelial resistance by selectively sealing the paracellular space against sodium ions (Günzel2012Claudins). 

The protein is also involved in maintaining the integrity of cell-cell junctions, as evidenced by its role in enhancing transepithelial electrical resistance in keratinocytes, particularly when stimulated with vitamin D3 (Minowa2021Increased). CLDN4 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, where it colocalizes with occludin in the distal tubules, suggesting its involvement in maintaining the selective permeability barrier and cellular adhesion (Morita1999Claudin). Additionally, CLDN4 is implicated in the epithelial barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract, where it is predominantly expressed in the distal parts, such as the colon, contributing to epithelial resistance and integrity (Lameris2012Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLDN4 gene are associated with various cancers, including gastric, ovarian, colorectal, and other epithelial cancers. In gastric cancer, CLDN4 overexpression is linked to better prognosis, as it inhibits cell migration and invasion while enhancing the barrier function of tight junctions (Kwon2011Claudin4). This overexpression is often due to epigenetic changes, such as decreased repressive histone marks and increased active histone marks, rather than DNA methylation (Kwon2011Claudin4).

In ovarian cancer, CLDN4 is frequently overexpressed, contributing to increased invasion, motility, and cell survival. This overexpression is associated with the loss of repressive histone modifications and is not solely dependent on DNA methylation (Kwon2010Derepression; Honda2006Crucial). CLDN4's role as a receptor for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin also presents potential therapeutic applications (Honda2006Crucial).

In colorectal cancer, CLDN4 is upregulated and its expression is influenced by TGFβ1 signaling. Inhibition of TGFβ1 can suppress CLDN4 expression, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Yang2022Evaluation). The expression levels of CLDN4 in colorectal cancer are associated with patient outcomes, including overall survival and disease progression (Yang2022Evaluation).

## Interactions
Claudin-4 (CLDN4) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in tight junctions. CLDN4 forms a strong heteromeric interaction with claudin-8 (CLDN8), which is essential for its localization to tight junctions in kidney cells. This interaction is necessary for the proper trafficking of CLDN4 to the plasma membrane, and the absence of CLDN8 leads to CLDN4's mislocalization and disassembly from tight junctions (Hou2010Claudin4).

CLDN4 also interacts with the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1, which is critical for its correct localization at tight junctions. Silencing MUPP1 results in the misrouting of CLDN4 to lysosomes, indicating that MUPP1 is necessary for maintaining CLDN4's expression and localization under hypertonic stress conditions (Lanaspa2008Hypertonic).

Proteomic analyses have identified CLDN4's proximity to various signaling and trafficking proteins, including members of the Rab GTPase family and vesicle-associated membrane proteins, suggesting its involvement in vesicular trafficking and membrane dynamics (Fredriksson2015Proteomic). CLDN4 also interacts with Eph-A2, leading to its tyrosine phosphorylation and increased paracellular permeability (Fredriksson2015Proteomic). These interactions highlight CLDN4's role in maintaining tight junction integrity and regulating cellular processes.
