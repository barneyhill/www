# DPY19L4

## Overview
DPY19L4 is a gene that encodes the protein dpy-19 like 4, which is a member of the DPY19 family. This protein is primarily involved in the process of protein glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification that ensures proper protein folding and stability. The DPY19L4 protein functions predominantly within the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by supporting the assembly and maintenance of cellular structures. As a part of the DPY19 family, the protein is also implicated in cell adhesion and migration, which are essential for cellular communication and movement. These functions highlight the importance of DPY19L4 in the broader physiological processes that rely on effective protein synthesis and modification (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
DPY19L4 encodes a protein that plays a significant role in protein glycosylation, a critical cellular process for ensuring proper protein folding and stability. This process is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of proteins within the cell. The DPY19L4 protein is part of the DPY19 family, which is known for its involvement in cell adhesion and migration, processes vital for cellular communication and movement. The protein is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to the normal functioning of cells and the organism as a whole. By facilitating protein glycosylation, DPY19L4 supports the proper assembly and maintenance of cellular structures, which is crucial for the overall health and functionality of human cells. The activities of DPY19L4 in the endoplasmic reticulum underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and the broader physiological processes that depend on effective protein synthesis and modification.
