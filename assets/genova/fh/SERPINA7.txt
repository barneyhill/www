# SERPINA7

## Overview
The SERPINA7 gene encodes the protein thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), a member of the serpin superfamily, which is primarily responsible for the transport of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream. Unlike many serpins that function as protease inhibitors, TBG is non-inhibitory and specializes in hormone transport. It is synthesized in the liver and plays a critical role in maintaining the balance and distribution of thyroid hormones, such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), by binding them with high affinity. This function is essential for regulating metabolism, growth, and development in the human body (GomesLima2018Thyroxinebinding; Gatto2013Serpins). The protein's unique structure, characterized by a conserved serpin fold, facilitates its role in hormone transport, distinguishing it from other members of the serpin family (Silverman2001The; Zhou2006Structural).

## Structure
The SERPINA7 gene encodes thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), a member of the serpin superfamily, which is primarily involved in the transport of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream. TBG shares the conserved tertiary structure typical of serpins, which includes three β-sheets and nine α-helices, along with a reactive center loop (RCL) that is crucial for its function (Heit2013Update; Silverman2001The). Unlike many serpins, TBG is non-inhibitory and functions in hormone transport rather than protease inhibition (Gatto2013Serpins).

The molecular structure of TBG features a unique open main β-sheet, which allows the reactive center peptide loop to move in and out, facilitating the reversible binding and release of thyroxine. This mechanism is supported by the presence of a proline in the reactive loop, which prevents full and irreversible entry of the loop, distinguishing TBG from other serpins (Zhou2006Structural). The binding of thyroxine occurs in a surface pocket, involving hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, with specific mutations affecting binding affinity (Zhou2006Structural).

TBG may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, although the recombinant form used in structural studies was nonglycosylated (Zhou2006Structural). Variants and isoforms of TBG can arise from alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Heit2013Update).

## Function
The SERPINA7 gene encodes thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), a crucial protein for the transport of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream. TBG is a 54 kDa acidic glycoprotein synthesized in the liver and is responsible for binding approximately 75% of thyroxine (T4) and 70% of triiodothyronine (T3) in serum, which are essential thyroid hormones involved in regulating metabolism, growth, and development (Pappa2015Inherited; GomesLima2018Thyroxinebinding; Heo2022Identification).

TBG has the highest affinity for T4 among the major serum transport proteins, which include transthyretin (TTR) and human serum albumin (HSA). This high affinity allows TBG to function as a buffer system, maintaining a stable free T4 concentration and a large extrathyroidal thyroid hormone pool (Pappa2015Inherited). The protein's structure facilitates the equilibrated binding and release of thyroid hormones, enhancing tissue sensitivity to circulating hormone levels and preventing rapid depletion of the extrathyroidal T4 pool (Pappa2015Inherited).

In healthy individuals, TBG plays a vital role in ensuring the uniform distribution of thyroid hormones across cells, thereby supporting normal physiological functions. Abnormalities in TBG levels can lead to altered serum thyroid hormone concentrations, which may be misinterpreted in clinical settings, although they do not result in thyroid dysfunction (Pappa2015Inherited).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SERPINA7 gene, which encodes thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), can lead to various thyroid hormone transport disorders. These include complete TBG deficiency (TBG-CD), partial TBG deficiency (TBG-PD), and TBG excess (TBG-E). TBG-CD is characterized by undetectable TBG levels in affected males and half-normal levels in carrier females, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 15,000 newborn males. It is often caused by mutations such as single nucleotide substitutions and frameshifts (Pappa2015Inherited; Moeller2015Two). TBG-PD, the most common form of inherited TBG deficiency, results from missense mutations and affects about 1 in 4,000 newborns (Pappa2015Inherited; GomesLima2018Thyroxinebinding). TBG-E, which is less common, is frequently due to gene duplication or triplication, with a prevalence of 1 in 25,000 (Pappa2015Inherited).

Some mutations in the SERPINA7 gene do not significantly alter serum TBG concentration, but can affect the protein's structure and function, potentially leading to misfolding or aggregation (GomesLima2018Thyroxinebinding). Additionally, mutations in regulatory regions, such as liver-specific enhancers, can impact TBG gene transcription (Pappa2015Inherited). These genetic alterations can complicate the interpretation of thyroid function tests, leading to potential misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment (Heo2022Identification).

## Interactions
SERPINA7, also known as thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), is primarily involved in the transport of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream. While specific protein-protein interactions involving SERPINA7 are not detailed in the provided context, the protein is known to interact with thyroid hormones such as thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), facilitating their transport and availability in the body (GomesLima2018Thyroxinebinding).

In the context of preeclampsia, a study identified SERPINA7 as significantly upregulated in maternal urine, suggesting its potential involvement in the condition. Although the specific interactions of SERPINA7 with other proteins in this context are not detailed, the study used STRING analysis to explore protein interactions, indicating that SERPINA7 may have interactions with other proteins, either through direct protein interaction, gene co-expression, or literature citations (Bujold2021Proteomic).

The STRING database, a resource for exploring protein-protein interactions, could potentially provide further insights into the interactions of SERPINA7, although specific interactions are not mentioned in the context provided (Szklarczyk2020The). Overall, while the context suggests potential interactions, detailed interaction partners of SERPINA7 are not explicitly listed.
