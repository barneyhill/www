# ADCY1

## Overview
ADCY1, or adenylate cyclase 1, is a gene that encodes a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a pivotal second messenger in cellular signaling. The protein adenylate cyclase 1, categorized as a transmembrane enzyme, plays a significant role in various physiological processes, particularly within the nervous system. It is characterized by its sensitivity to calcium ions (Ca2+) and calmodulin, which regulate its activity through interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other intracellular signaling molecules (Devasani2022Expression; Chen2022Ca2+stimulated). ADCY1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it contributes to synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by participating in complex signaling pathways (Chen2022Ca2+stimulated). Additionally, its involvement in sensory processes, such as hearing, underscores its broader physiological significance (SantosCortez2014Adenylate). Alterations in ADCY1 expression or function have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its clinical relevance (Devasani2022Expression; Guo2022Targeting).

## Structure
ADCY1, or adenylate cyclase 1, is a membrane-bound enzyme involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The protein structure of ADCY1 includes multiple transmembrane domains, specifically two membrane-spanning regions, each containing six transmembrane alpha-helices (Devasani2022Expression). These transmembrane domains are connected by cytoplasmic loops, which include the C1 and C2 domains. The C1 and C2 domains are further divided into subdomains, with C1a and C2a serving as the catalytic sites that are highly conserved across ADCY isoforms (Devasani2022Expression).

The regulatory sites of ADCY1 are located in the C1b and C2b subdomains, which allow for modulation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and intracellular protein kinases and phosphatases (Chen2022Ca2+stimulated). ADCY1 is activated by calcium (Ca2+) and calmodulin, and its activity is regulated by G proteins, with Gαs stimulating and Gαi inhibiting its function (Devasani2022Expression; Chen2022Ca2+stimulated).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect ADCY1's activity and regulation. For instance, CaMKIV can phosphorylate and inhibit ADCY1, providing a mechanism to prevent overstimulation (Chen2022Ca2+stimulated). The protein's structure and regulatory mechanisms are crucial for its role in various cellular processes, including neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity (Chen2022Ca2+stimulated).

## Function
ADCY1 (adenylate cyclase 1) is a Ca2+/calmodulin-sensitive enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP), a crucial second messenger in cellular signaling pathways. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including neurotransmitter receptor activity, gene transcription, and translation (Chen2022Ca2+stimulated). ADCY1 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, with high mRNA levels in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and plays a significant role in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP) at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites (Chen2022Ca2+stimulated).

In the central nervous system, ADCY1 is involved in the Ca2+/cAMP-PKA/ERK1/2-MSK1-CREB and Ca2+/cAMP-ERK1/2-eIF4E/4EBP1/S6K1 signaling cascades, which are important for neuroplasticity and neurodevelopment (Chen2022Ca2+stimulated). It is crucial for maintaining Ca2+-stimulated ADCY activity and cAMP levels in the hippocampus, influencing processes like learning and memory (Chen2022Ca2+stimulated). ADCY1 is also involved in sensory input and neurodevelopment, as evidenced by its role in the mechanotransduction process in the inner ear, where it regulates hair cell function and hearing (SantosCortez2014Adenylate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ADCY1 gene have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. A nonsense mutation in ADCY1 is associated with hearing impairment, deafness, and loss of hair cell function, highlighting its role in auditory processes (Devasani2022Expression). In the context of fragile X syndrome, increased ADCY1 expression is linked to autism-like behaviors, and the loss of ADCY1 can reverse these changes, suggesting a regulatory interaction with the FMR1 gene (Devasani2022Expression). 

ADCY1 expression is also associated with several mental health conditions. Genome-wide association studies have linked ADCY1 polymorphisms to sleep deprivation, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, indicating its involvement in these psychiatric conditions (Devasani2022Expression). In cancer biology, ADCY1 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer and is associated with patient prognosis. It plays a role in regulating multidrug resistance and apoptosis in lung cancer cells, affecting treatment outcomes (Guo2022Targeting). 

In neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated neurofibromas, loss of SUZ12 leads to increased ADCY1 expression, amplifying the RAS/ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumor development (Li2021SUZ12).

## Interactions
ADCY1 interacts with various proteins that regulate its activity and localization. It is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) binding, which induces a conformational change that relieves autoinhibition. This interaction is crucial for its activation, as ADCY1 has a CaM-binding domain in the C1b region (SanchezCollado2020CrossTalk; Chen2022Ca2+stimulated). ADCY1 is also regulated by G proteins; it is stimulated by Gαs in the presence of Ca2+ and inhibited by Gαi and Gβγ subunits (Devasani2022Expression; Chen2022Ca2+stimulated).

ADCY1 is involved in the formation of signaling complexes with other proteins. It interacts with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which help localize protein kinase A (PKA) and other proteins into discrete signaling complexes, although specific interactions with AKAPs are not detailed (SanchezCollado2020CrossTalk). In airway epithelial cells, ADCY1 is part of a signaling complex involving GPCRs, CFTR, TMEM16A, and EPAC1, facilitating compartmentalized signaling and crosstalk (Lérias2018Compartmentalized).

ADCY1 also interacts with ion channels such as HCN1 and KCNQ4, which are activated by cAMP, playing a role in regulating MET channels in hair cells (SantosCortez2014Adenylate). These interactions highlight ADCY1's role in various cellular signaling pathways.
