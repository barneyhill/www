# CPNE3

## Overview
CPNE3 is a gene that encodes the protein copine 3, a member of the copine family characterized by its calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties. Copine 3 is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and cell communication, primarily through its interactions with other proteins. The protein is notable for its role in pancreatic β-cell function, where it influences insulin secretion and glucose uptake, and is implicated in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (ElHuneidi2021Copine). Additionally, copine 3 is associated with cancer progression, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer, where it affects cell migration, invasion, and drug resistance (Chen2018Silencing; Lin2013Quantitative; Li2024YAP1CPNE3). The protein's interactions with key signaling molecules, such as ErbB2 and YAP1, underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Heinrich2009CopineIII; Li2024YAP1CPNE3).

## Structure
Copine 3 (CPNE3) is a member of the copine family, characterized by its conserved domain architecture. It contains two N-terminal C2 domains, C2A and C2B, followed by a Copine-specific A domain at the C-terminus (Heinrich2009CopineIII). The C2 domains are involved in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding and are known for their eight-chain antiparallel β-sandwich structure, which is crucial for their function in cellular signaling pathways (Tang2021The). These domains contain conserved aspartate residues that suggest potential Ca2+-binding capabilities, indicating Ca2+-dependent functions (Heinrich2009CopineIII).

The A domain of CPNE3 is involved in protein-protein interactions and contains a conserved metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif, which suggests potential binding to Mg2+ and/or Mn2+ (Heinrich2009CopineIII). This domain is structurally related to integrins and primarily functions in protein binding (Tang2021The).

CPNE3 is known to interact with the ErbB2 receptor, promoting tumor cell migration, and is involved in membrane transport and signal transduction (Heinrich2009CopineIII; Tang2021The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details are not provided in the context (Heinrich2009CopineIII). Information on splice variant isoforms is not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
CPNE3 (copine 3) is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that plays a significant role in pancreatic β-cell function, particularly in insulin secretion and glucose uptake. It is highly expressed in human pancreatic islets, and its expression is inversely correlated with HbA1c levels, suggesting a role in glucose metabolism (ElHuneidi2021Copine). In vitro studies have shown that silencing CPNE3 in INS-1 cells impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, reduces insulin content, and decreases glucose uptake efficiency. This is accompanied by the downregulation of genes involved in insulin biosynthesis and glucose sensing, such as Ins1, Ins2, Glut2, and Gck (ElHuneidi2021Copine).

CPNE3 is active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane, influencing processes like cell adhesion and migration, which are crucial for tissue development and repair. It is involved in membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and cell communication, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (ElHuneidi2021Copine). The protein's activity in these processes underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in conditions like type 2 diabetes, where β-cell function is compromised (ElHuneidi2021Copine).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in CPNE3 expression have been implicated in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and gastric cancer (GC). In NSCLC, CPNE3 is identified as a metastasis-promoting gene, with higher expression levels correlating with advanced clinical stages and poor differentiation. Silencing CPNE3 reduces the migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lin2013Quantitative). In HCC, high CPNE3 expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients treated with sorafenib, a molecular targeted agent. Silencing CPNE3 enhances the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib, indicating its role in drug resistance (Chen2018Silencing).

In gastric cancer, CPNE3 acts as an independent prognostic factor for poor prognosis. It is involved in a positive feedback loop with the YAP1/TEADs transcription factor complex, promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion. High CPNE3 expression is linked to shorter overall survival and increased chemotherapy resistance (Li2024YAP1CPNE3). CPNE3's interaction with ErbB2 in breast cancer also suggests its role in tumor cell migration and metastasis (Heinrich2009CopineIII).

## Interactions
CPNE3 (copine 3) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in various cellular processes. In gastric cancer cells, CPNE3 interacts with YAP1, forming a protein complex that stabilizes YAP1 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for the activation of YAP1 downstream target genes, promoting gastric cancer progression through a positive feedback loop (Li2024YAP1CPNE3). CPNE3 competes with the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TRCP for binding to YAP1, thereby reducing YAP1 ubiquitination and maintaining its stability (Li2024YAP1CPNE3).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CPNE3 interacts with RACK1 and phosphorylated ErbB2 (pErbB2), activating the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway. This interaction enhances cell migration and invasion, contributing to cancer metastasis (Lin2018CPNE3). The interaction with RACK1 is particularly significant, as it regulates the expression of several genes involved in the FAK pathway (Lin2018CPNE3).

In the context of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, CPNE3 interacts with RACK1, enhancing cell viability and reducing cytotoxicity. This interaction plays a protective role by activating RACK1, which suppresses inflammatory cytokine release and decreases apoptosis (Zhang2021CPNE3).
