# TEX261

## Overview
TEX261 is a gene that encodes the protein testis expressed 261, which is primarily associated with reproductive biology due to its high expression in the testis, particularly in Sertoli cells. The protein is involved in several cellular processes, including the formation of coat protein II (COP II), which is essential for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein trafficking (Chen2022Supplementation). TEX261 is predicted to have five transmembrane domains, suggesting its involvement in membrane-associated processes (Carapito2015Computational). Beyond its expression in reproductive tissues, TEX261 is also found in various cell lines, such as glioblastoma and hepatocarcinoma cells, indicating a broader expression profile (Carapito2015Computational). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as Sec23 and Ndrg1, highlight its potential regulatory roles in cellular proliferation and stress responses (Chen2022Supplementation).

## Function
TEX261 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, primarily expressed in the testis. In healthy human cells, TEX261 is highly expressed in adult testis, particularly in Sertoli cells, and is first expressed after 15 days of post-natal life. This expression coincides with the presence of pachytene cells from the first wave of meiosis during spermatogenesis, suggesting a role in reproductive biology (Bellil2021Human).

TEX261 is also involved in the formation of coat protein II (COP II), which mediates protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating proper protein trafficking (Chen2022Supplementation). The protein is predicted to have five transmembrane domains, indicating its potential involvement in membrane-associated processes (Carapito2015Computational).

In addition to its role in the testis, TEX261 has been identified in various cell lines, including glioblastoma and hepatocarcinoma cells, suggesting a broader expression profile beyond reproductive tissues (Carapito2015Computational). Its function in these contexts, however, remains less understood.

## Interactions
TEX261 is involved in the formation of COP II, a complex that mediates protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. It interacts with Sec23, a component of COP II, and this interaction is crucial for regulating pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation under hypoxic conditions. Silencing TEX261 decreases Sec23 expression, while overexpression of TEX261 increases Sec23 levels, indicating a regulatory relationship between these proteins (Chen2022Supplementation).

TEX261 also interacts with Ndrg1, a protein involved in ER stress and sensitive to the redox state of cells. Ndrg1 is upregulated by hypoxia and further increased by TEX261 knockdown, while TEX261 overexpression suppresses Ndrg1. This interaction may influence the Akt signaling pathway, which is inactivated by hypoxia, suggesting that Ndrg1-mediated Akt is involved in TEX261's regulation of Sec23 (Chen2022Supplementation).

In yeast, TEX261, known as Erv26, is part of the Erv protein family and is involved in the ER export of specific proteins, such as secretory pro-ALP and the Ktr3p mannosyl-transferase. Erv26p binds its cargo through extracellular/lumenal loops, coupling them to the COPII coating machinery for transport (VanWinkle2020JAGN1).
