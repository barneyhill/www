# STOM

## Overview
The STOM gene encodes stomatin, a monotopic integral membrane protein that plays a critical role in cellular processes by modulating ion channels and glucose transport. Stomatin is characterized by its unique hairpin loop topology and is predominantly associated with cholesterol-rich membrane domains, known as lipid rafts. It is widely expressed across various human tissues, with significant presence in hematopoietic cells. Functionally, stomatin is involved in the regulation of ion channels, glucose transport, and adipogenesis, impacting pathways such as the ERK pathway within the MAPK signaling cascade. The protein's structure includes a prohibitin homology (PHB/SPFH) domain, essential for membrane attachment and oligomerization, and a coiled-coil domain that facilitates its interaction with other proteins. Stomatin's interactions with proteins like Pannexin 1 and the anion exchanger 1 underscore its role as a scaffolding protein, influencing cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Rungaldier2017Structurefunction; Rougé2022Mechanosensitive; Wu2022Stomatin).

## Structure
Stomatin, encoded by the STOM gene, is a 31 kDa monotopic integral membrane protein characterized by a unique hairpin loop topology. This topology is maintained by a conserved proline residue (Pro-47) within its hydrophobic domain, which is crucial for its membrane localization and function (Kadurin2009A). The protein is palmitoylated at Cys-30 and Cys-87, which supports its membrane association and oligomerization (Kadurin2009A; Rungaldier2017Structurefunction).

Stomatin contains several key domains, including an N-terminal basic domain, a hydrophobic domain, a prohibitin homology (PHB/SPFH) domain, and a coiled-coil domain. The PHB/SPFH domain is essential for membrane attachment and oligomer formation, while the coiled-coil domain is involved in oligomerization (Rungaldier2017Structurefunction). The C-terminal region contains the oligomerization and lipid raft-association (ORA) domain, which includes a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif, crucial for cholesterol binding and DRM association (Rungaldier2017Structurefunction).

Stomatin forms homo-oligomers and associates with cholesterol-rich membrane domains, also known as lipid rafts, which are important for its function in regulating ion channels (Kadurin2009A; Rungaldier2017Structurefunction). The protein's structure and function are influenced by its post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation, which are necessary for its proper localization and interaction with cellular components (Rungaldier2017Structurefunction).

## Function
The STOM gene encodes stomatin, a 31 kDa monotopic integral membrane protein that is widely expressed in human tissues, particularly in hematopoietic cells. Stomatin is associated with cholesterol-rich membrane domains, also known as lipid rafts, and plays a crucial role in regulating ion channels and glucose transport. It interacts with the glucose transporter GLUT1, influencing glucose and dehydroascorbate influx into erythrocytes (Rungaldier2017Structurefunction). Stomatin is involved in adipogenesis by modulating the ERK pathway, which is part of the MAPK signaling pathway. During adipogenesis, stomatin expression increases, which is essential for the differentiation process. It affects the expression of adipogenic genes like PPARγ, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ, and regulates lipid droplet growth and fatty acid uptake in adipocytes (Wu2022Stomatin).

Structurally, stomatin contains a conserved PHB/SPFH domain, which is crucial for its function and membrane attachment. This domain is palmitoylated and forms a compact structure composed of α-helices and β-sheets. Stomatin also has a coiled-coil domain necessary for oligomerization and a C-terminal domain that associates with cholesterol-rich membranes and the cortical actin cytoskeleton (Rungaldier2017Structurefunction). Stomatin's role as an integral scaffolding protein suggests its importance in maintaining membrane structure and function in healthy human cells (Rungaldier2017Structurefunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the STOM gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. Hereditary stomatocytosis, a type of hemolytic anemia, is directly associated with mutations in STOM. This condition is characterized by abnormal ion permeability in red blood cells, leading to their premature destruction. Changes in the expression levels of stomatin can also influence the progression of neurological disorders. Although the specific mechanisms are not fully understood, it is suggested that the disruption of ion channel regulation and membrane organization may play a role in these conditions.

In addition to its impact on blood and neurological disorders, altered STOM expression has been linked to cancer progression. The precise relationship between stomatin and cancer is still under investigation, but it is believed that changes in membrane organization and ion channel activity could affect tumor growth and metastasis. Understanding the clinical significance of STOM mutations and expression changes is crucial for developing targeted therapies for these conditions.

## Interactions
Stomatin (STOM) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in modulating their activities. In human red blood cells (RBCs), stomatin interacts with Pannexin 1 (PANX1), a mechanosensitive channel involved in ATP release. This interaction is crucial for modulating PANX1 activity, as stomatin helps maintain a specific lipid environment around PANX1, influencing its function (Rougé2022Mechanosensitive).

Stomatin also interacts with the anion exchanger 1 (AE1) in HEK293 cells, where it enhances AE1 activity by forming a complex likely associated with actin. This interaction suggests that stomatin acts as a scaffolding protein in lipid rafts, impacting AE1 activity and intracellular homeostasis (Genetet2017Stomatin).

In the context of bile salt uptake, stomatin interacts with the Na+ taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) in HepG2 cells. This interaction enhances NTCP function without altering its localization to lipid rafts, indicating a regulatory role of stomatin in NTCP-mediated bile acid uptake (Appelman2020The).

Stomatin's interactions extend to adipogenesis, where it associates with proteins like CD36 and caveolin-1, facilitating fatty acid uptake and lipid droplet growth (Wu2022Stomatin). These interactions highlight stomatin's role in various cellular processes through its regulatory influence on membrane proteins.
