# RHBDL1

## Overview
The RHBDL1 gene encodes the rhomboid-like 1 protein, which is a member of the rhomboid family of intramembrane serine proteases. These proteins are characterized by their ability to cleave other proteins within the membrane, a process that is crucial for various cellular functions, including signaling and regulation of protein activity. The rhomboid-like 1 protein is involved in the proteolytic processing of membrane-bound substrates, which can influence pathways related to cell growth and differentiation. Mutations or dysregulation of RHBDL1 have been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
