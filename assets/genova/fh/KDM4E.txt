# KDM4E

## Overview
KDM4E is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 4E, which is a member of the lysine demethylase 4 (KDM4) subfamily. This protein functions as a histone demethylase, specifically targeting methylated lysine residues on histone proteins, such as H3K9 and H3K36, to regulate gene expression through chromatin remodeling (Carter2017Identification). The enzymatic activity of lysine demethylase 4E is dependent on the presence of Fe2+ and α-ketoglutarate, and it plays a critical role in transitioning chromatin from a transcriptionally silent state to an active state, thereby influencing cellular processes and maintaining homeostasis (Langley2015Analysis). The protein's activity is also implicated in oxygen sensing and transcriptional regulation, highlighting its potential involvement in various physiological and pathological conditions (Hancock2017The).

## Structure
KDM4E, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family, is involved in histone demethylation. The primary structure of KDM4E includes the JmjC domain, which is essential for its catalytic activity (Horton2017The). This domain is characterized by a double-stranded β-helical fold, forming a β-sandwich structure that is crucial for its function (Horton2017The). KDM4E specifically catalyzes the removal of two methyl groups from H3K9me3 and H3K56me3 (Horton2017The).

The secondary structure of KDM4E typically involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common in proteins with JmjC domains. The tertiary structure is characterized by the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional conformation, often stabilized by metal ions like Fe(II), which are necessary for its enzymatic activity (Horton2017The).

KDM4E lacks the C-terminal region found in other KDM4 family members, which includes plant homeodomains (PHD) and Tudor domains, resulting in a shorter protein (Horton2017The). This structural difference may influence its substrate specificity and interaction with other proteins. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation can affect the activity and interactions of KDM4E, although specific modifications for KDM4E are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
KDM4E, a member of the lysine demethylase 4 (KDM4) subfamily, plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by demethylating specific lysine residues on histone proteins, particularly histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) and lysine 36 (H3K36) (Carter2017Identification). This demethylation process is essential for chromatin remodeling, transitioning chromatin from a condensed, transcriptionally silent state (heterochromatin) to a more open, transcriptionally active state (euchromatin) (Carter2017Identification). KDM4E is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with histone substrates to modulate chromatin structure and gene expression (Langley2015Analysis).

KDM4E requires Fe2+ and α-ketoglutarate as co-substrates for its enzymatic activity, producing succinate, CO2, formaldehyde, and demethylated histones as byproducts (Carter2017Identification). The enzyme's activity is influenced by oxygen availability, suggesting a potential role in oxygen sensing and transcriptional regulation in response to oxygen levels (Hancock2017The). In healthy human cells, KDM4E contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating gene expression patterns necessary for normal cellular functions (Carter2017Identification). Its activity is tightly regulated, as dysregulation can lead to aberrant gene expression and contribute to disease states, including cancer (Carter2017Identification).

## Interactions
KDM4E, a histone demethylase, plays a significant role in bovine embryonic development through its interactions with RNA, which are crucial for its function in demethylating H3K9 during embryonic genome activation (EGA). The RNA-dependent chromatin localization of KDM4E facilitates the removal of H3K9me3/2 marks, essential for proper embryonic development. Mutations in the RNA binding sites of KDM4E, which prevent RNA binding, result in defective H3K9 demethylation, underscoring the importance of these interactions (Liu2018H3K9).

KDM4E's interactions with RNA are suggested to involve non-coding RNAs, although specific RNA molecules have not been identified. These interactions are thought to be critical for overcoming hypermethylation barriers in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryos, which are characterized by deficient KDM4E expression and abnormal H3K9me3/2 deposition (Liu2018H3K9).

The study also highlights that KDM4E, unlike other KDM4 family members, is not activated by DUX4 during EGA in bovine embryos, suggesting species-specific regulatory mechanisms (Liu2018H3K9). These findings indicate that KDM4E's interactions with RNA are pivotal for its role as an epigenetic regulator in embryonic development.
