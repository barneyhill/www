# PABPC1

## Overview
PABPC1 (poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in mRNA metabolism and translation regulation. The protein, also referred to as PABPC1, is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs and a conserved C-terminal MLLE domain, which facilitate its binding to the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules. This binding is crucial for mRNA stabilization, translation initiation, and the formation of a closed-loop structure that enhances translation efficiency. PABPC1 plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and miRNA-mediated gene silencing, by interacting with other proteins such as eukaryotic initiation factors and GW182. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and functions. Clinically, alterations in PABPC1 expression are associated with several cancers, where it can act as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target due to its involvement in oncogenic pathways (Qi2022PABPC1——mRNA; Zhang2022PABPC1induced; Huang2013Phosphorylation).

## Structure
PABPC1 (poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1) is a protein characterized by its four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for its function in binding the poly(A) tail of mRNA molecules. These RRMs are linked through linker amino acids, contributing to the protein's overall molecular weight of approximately 70 kDa (Padariya2022The). The RRM domains facilitate the circularization of mRNA by interacting with both the 3′ poly(A) tail and the eIF4F complex on the mRNA 5′ cap (Xie2014The).

The protein also contains a conserved C-terminal MLLE domain, which is involved in binding PAM2 motifs from various proteins, playing a role in translation regulation and mRNA metabolism (Xie2014The). The MLLE domain is composed of a bundle of five α-helices and interacts with PAM2 motifs through hydrophobic interactions, primarily involving leucine and phenylalanine residues (Xie2014The).

PABPC1 can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing. The protein's structural dynamics and interactions are crucial for its roles in mRNA stabilization, translation initiation, and involvement in stress granules under physiological stress (Padariya2022The; Xie2014The).

## Function
PABPC1 (poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1) is a crucial player in mRNA metabolism, primarily active in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. It binds to the poly(A) tails of mRNAs, facilitating the formation of a closed-loop structure that enhances translation initiation and termination, promotes ribosome recycling, and influences mRNA stability (Huang2013Phosphorylation). PABPC1 interacts with eukaryotic initiation factors to stimulate cap-dependent translation, playing a significant role in maintaining translation efficiency (Lemay2010Crossing).

In addition to its role in translation, PABPC1 is involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a quality control mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature stop codons. It helps distinguish premature stop codons from natural ones, ensuring the fidelity of gene expression (Behm-Ansmant2007A). PABPC1 also participates in miRNA-mediated gene silencing by interacting with GW182 proteins, which is essential for the silencing of miRNA targets (Huntzinger2010Two).

PABPC1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it associates with pre-mRNAs and contributes to mRNA biogenesis and stability (Hosoda2006Evidence). This dual role highlights its importance in both mRNA processing and translation regulation in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the PABPC1 gene have significant clinical implications across various cancers. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PABPC1 is upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion through the stabilization of IFI27 mRNA and increased miR-21-5p expression, which enhances angiogenesis (Zhang2022PABPC1induced). In gliomas, particularly glioblastoma, PABPC1 expression is downregulated in more aggressive forms, with higher expression linked to better survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2019PABPC1). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high PABPC1 expression is associated with shorter overall survival and is considered an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes, as it is involved in pathways like P53 and WNT signaling (YuFeng2020Expression). PABPC1 also plays a role in breast cancer chemoresistance and promotes cell proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma by enhancing cell cycle progression (Qi2022PABPC1——mRNA). Its involvement in various oncogenic pathways makes PABPC1 a potential target for cancer therapy (Qi2022PABPC1——mRNA). In atherosclerosis, PABPC1 is identified as a biomarker, with its expression linked to immune cell infiltration in tumors, suggesting a role in the tumor microenvironment (Lin2023Atherosclerosisrelated).

## Interactions
PABPC1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in mRNA metabolism and translation regulation. It binds to the poly(A) tail of mRNA, enhancing translation initiation and stability. PABPC1 interacts with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), which is essential for mRNA circularization and ribosome recycling, thereby suppressing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Fatscher2014The). This interaction is crucial for the efficient expression of polyadenylated mRNAs and is disrupted by specific mutations in PABPC1 (Fatscher2014The).

PABPC1 also interacts with GW182, a protein involved in miRNA-mediated gene silencing. This interaction is significant for the translational repression and degradation of miRNA targets, as GW182 competes with eIF4G for binding to PABPC1, potentially interfering with mRNA circularization (Zekri2009The).

Additionally, PABPC1 is a phospho-dependent ligand for 14-3-3 proteins, particularly following DNA damage. This interaction is mediated by phosphorylation at Ser-470 by MAPKAP kinase-2 (MK2), which enhances cell death after UV irradiation (Stehn2023MAPKAP). The phosphorylation-dependent interaction with 14-3-3 proteins is crucial for the cellular response to DNA damage (Stehn2023MAPKAP).
