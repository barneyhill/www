# CUL2

## Overview
CUL2 is a gene that encodes the protein cullin 2, which is a key component of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (CRLs). As a scaffold protein, cullin 2 facilitates the assembly of these complexes, which are crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. This process is vital for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation. The CRL2 complexes, in particular, are involved in the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFα), playing a significant role in cellular responses to oxygen levels and tumorigenesis prevention (Cai2016The; Cardote2017Crystal). CUL2 is also implicated in various diseases, including cancer, where its expression levels and mutations can influence disease progression and prognosis (Jia2024Comprehensive).

## Structure
CUL2 (cullin 2) is a protein that serves as a scaffold in cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL) complexes, specifically in the CRL2 VHL complex. The primary structure of CUL2 includes specific amino acid sequences identified through microsequencing, which match the published human CUL2 sequence (Pause1997The). The secondary structure details are not explicitly provided in the context, but CUL2 is known to interact with other proteins through its N-terminal tail, which is significant for binding to the VBC complex (Cardote2017Structure‐Guided).

CUL2's tertiary structure is not detailed in the context, but its quaternary structure involves forming a complex with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), Elongin B, and Elongin C, known as the VBC complex (Pause1997The). This interaction is crucial for its function in ubiquitination processes. CUL2 is part of a multigene family of cullins, which are involved in cell cycle regulation (Pause1997The).

CUL2 is often post-translationally modified by neddylation, a modification that is common among cullin proteins, enhancing their activity in ubiquitin ligase complexes (Zimmerman2010Structural). The context does not provide information on specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms of CUL2.

## Function
Cullin 2 (CUL2) is a crucial component of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (CRLs), which play a significant role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. CUL2 acts as a scaffold protein, assembling with RING protein (Rbx1), Elongin B and C, and various substrate recognition receptors to form CRL2 complexes. These complexes are essential for targeting cellular proteins for ubiquitination, leading to their degradation by the 26S proteasome, a process vital for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating protein stability (Cai2016The; Cardote2017Crystal).

CUL2 is involved in the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIFα) subunits through its interaction with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, a process crucial for cellular responses to oxygen levels and tumorigenesis prevention (Cai2016The; Cardote2017Crystal). The CRL2 complexes also participate in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation, by targeting specific proteins for degradation (Cai2016The).

CUL2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences protein stability and cellular homeostasis. Its activity is regulated by neddylation, a post-translational modification that enhances the ubiquitin transfer activity of CRL2 complexes (Cai2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CUL2 gene are implicated in various cancers. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), CUL2 gene alterations, including loss of heterozygosity (LOH), have been observed, suggesting a potential role in RCC development, although no pathogenic mutations were identified in a significant number of cases (Clifford1999Genomic). CUL2 is also involved in the degradation of proteins like TDP-43, which is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS. Alterations in CUL2 can affect the degradation process of TDP-43 fragments, potentially influencing disease progression (Uchida2016CUL2mediated).

In cancer, CUL2 expression levels vary, being high in several tumor types such as adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), bladder cancer (BLCA), and breast cancer (BRCA), while low in acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) tissues. These expression levels correlate with prognosis, acting as a risk factor in some cancers and a protective factor in others, such as kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) (Jia2024Comprehensive). CUL2 is also linked to immune interactions and tumor progression, influencing pathways like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune cell infiltration, which are crucial for cancer metastasis and immune response (Jia2024Comprehensive).

## Interactions
CUL2 (cullin 2) is a scaffold protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (CRLs). It interacts with several proteins to facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. CUL2 forms a complex with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor protein, Elongin B, Elongin C, and Rbx1, which is involved in the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFα) under normoxic conditions (Cai2016The; Pause1997The). The interaction between CUL2 and the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) complex is specific and is disrupted by certain VHL mutations, such as R167W, which affect the binding affinity (Pause1997The).

CUL2 also interacts with other substrate recognition proteins, forming various CRL2 complexes. For example, in the CRL2 LRR1 complex, CUL2 interacts with Leucine-Rich Repeat protein-1 (LRR-1) to degrade the CDK-inhibitor p21 Cip1 (Cai2016The). In the CRL2 FEM1B complex, CUL2 interacts with FEM-1 to target proteins like TRA-1 for ubiquitination (Cai2016The). Additionally, CUL2 is involved in the CRL2 PRAME complex, which represses retinoic acid receptor signaling (Cai2016The). These interactions highlight CUL2's role in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation and tumor suppression.
