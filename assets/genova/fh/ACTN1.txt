# ACTN1

## Overview
ACTN1 is a gene that encodes the protein actinin alpha 1, a member of the spectrin superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in the crosslinking of actin filaments within the cytoskeleton. Actinin alpha 1 is categorized as an actin-binding protein and is integral to the structural organization and stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in both muscle and non-muscle cells. The protein's structure is characterized by an N-terminal actin-binding domain, a central rod domain with spectrin-like repeats, and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain, which together facilitate its function in actin filament bundling and mechanotransmission (Le2017Mechanotransmission; Sjöblom2008αActinin). ACTN1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of acto-myosin contractility, epithelial morphogenesis, and the stabilization of ion channels, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function (Milanini2018EFA6). Mutations in the ACTN1 gene have been linked to congenital macrothrombocytopenia, underscoring its clinical significance (Kunishima2013ACTN1).

## Structure
The ACTN1 protein, encoded by the ACTN1 gene, is a member of the spectrin superfamily and plays a crucial role in actin filament crosslinking. Its structure includes an N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD) composed of two calponin homology (CH) domains, a central rod domain with four spectrin-like repeats, and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain (CaMD) containing four EF-hand motifs (Le2017Mechanotransmission; Sjöblom2008αActinin).

The ABD is highly conserved and interacts with actin through a tandem pair of CH domains, which adopt a closed conformation stabilized by interdomain interactions (Sjöblom2008αActinin). The central rod domain, consisting of spectrin repeats, forms an anti-parallel dimer, providing structural rigidity and facilitating actin filament bundling (Sjöblom2008αActinin).

The CaMD regulates the protein's activity through calcium binding, which induces conformational changes, particularly in the EF1-2 lobe, affecting the protein's interaction with actin filaments (Drmota2016Structure). Calcium binding is endothermic and entropically driven, leading to increased rigidity of the CaMD (Drmota2016Structure).

ACTN1 forms antiparallel dimers, which are essential for its function as a crosslinker in the cytoskeleton. The protein's interaction with other molecules, such as vinculin, is regulated by mechanical forces, highlighting its role in mechanotransmission (Le2017Mechanotransmission).

## Function
ACTN1 (actinin alpha 1) encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the actin-binding protein family, primarily involved in crosslinking actin filaments. In healthy human cells, ACTN1 plays a significant role in organizing and stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Guéguen2013A). It is active in both muscle and non-muscle cells, contributing to the formation of linear F-actin bundles that enhance structural stiffness and facilitate myosin-II-driven contractility (Milanini2018EFA6).

ACTN1 is involved in the regulation of acto-myosin contractility and stiffness, which are critical for processes such as epithelial morphogenesis and lumen formation. It acts as an effector of EFA6A and EFA6B proteins, modulating the contractility of the cortical acto-myosin cytoskeleton to support the extension and enlargement of lumens in epithelial cells (Milanini2018EFA6). Additionally, ACTN1 is implicated in the stabilization of ion channels, which are important for fluid influx and lumen enlargement (Milanini2018EFA6).

In the cellular context, ACTN1 is found at the apical acto-myosin ring associated with adherens junctions and possibly tight junctions, acting as a mechanical linker between actin filaments and cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix adhesion complexes (Milanini2018EFA6). This localization is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and proper formation of lumens in epithelial cells (Milanini2018EFA6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTN1 gene are associated with congenital macrothrombocytopenia (CMTP), a rare platelet disorder characterized by abnormally large platelets and a reduced platelet count. These mutations lead to disorganization of actin filaments in megakaryocytes, the precursor cells for platelets, resulting in the production of abnormally large proplatelet tips (Kunishima2013ACTN1). The mutations in ACTN1 are typically autosomal dominant and cause moderate macrothrombocytopenia with anisocytosis, although affected individuals generally exhibit only a modest bleeding tendency (Kunishima2013ACTN1).

Specific mutations identified include missense mutations such as p.Arg46Gln, which have been shown to cause autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia in families (Guéguen2013A). These mutations disrupt the normal organization of the cytoskeleton, leading to the characteristic platelet abnormalities (Guéguen2013A). Despite the low platelet counts, individuals with these mutations often do not exhibit significant bleeding diathesis or other clinical features (Guéguen2013A).

In some cases, novel frameshift mutations in ACTN1 have been identified, leading to decreased expression of α-actinin-1 due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, further contributing to the pathogenesis of macrothrombocytopenia (Luo2021Case).

## Interactions
ACTN1 (actinin alpha 1) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular functions. It interacts with MYH9, a nonmuscle myosin heavy chain, facilitating the degradation of GSK-3β, which leads to the activation of β-catenin signaling. This interaction is mediated through the calponin-homology 1 domain of ACTN1 binding to the myosin tail domain of MYH9 (Cui2023ACTN1). ACTN1 also engages with integrin β1, promoting FAK phosphorylation and activating the FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway, which stabilizes β-catenin and contributes to tumorigenesis and cisplatin resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Cui2023ACTN1).

ACTN1 forms part of a protein complex with FHL1, ACTN4, and PDLIM1, where it interacts with PDLIM1 through its PDZ domain, essential for stress fiber assembly and focal adhesion maturation (Sharma2011Identification). It also interacts with zyxin, a component of adhesion plaques, through its NH2-terminal domain, which contains the actin-binding site, suggesting a role in coordinating membrane-cytoskeletal interactions (Crawford1992An). These interactions highlight ACTN1's role in cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction.
