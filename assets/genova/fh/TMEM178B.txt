# TMEM178B

## Overview
TMEM178B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 178B, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and cell communication. The specific functions and interactions of TMEM178B are still under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in pathways that regulate cellular homeostasis and may have implications in certain pathological conditions. Understanding the role of TMEM178B and its encoded protein could provide insights into its potential clinical significance and therapeutic applications (Qiu2020aarFDC).
