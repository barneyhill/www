# DPM1

## Overview
The DPM1 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the enzyme dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase, which is crucial for glycosylation processes in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme, categorized as a glycosyltransferase, is responsible for the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man), a key lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor necessary for N-linked glycosylation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis, and C-linked protein mannosylation. The DPM1 protein, which lacks transmembrane helices, forms a complex with DPM2 and DPM3, both of which contain transmembrane domains, to facilitate its function at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Gandini2017Structural; Kim2000Dolichol). Mutations in the DPM1 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, specifically CDG type Ie, characterized by severe developmental and neurological symptoms due to impaired glycosylation (Kim2000Dolichol; Imbach2000Deficiency).

## Structure
The DPM1 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase, which is involved in glycosylation processes. The human DPM1 protein lacks transmembrane helices but forms a multisubunit complex with DPM2 and DPM3, which each contain two transmembrane helices. This complex is topologically similar to the dolichylphosphate mannose synthase (DPMS) from Pyrococcus furiosus, suggesting a new class of DPMS, type-III (Gandini2017Structural).

The catalytic domain of DPM1 belongs to the GT2 family of inverting glycosyltransferases and features a GT-A fold, characterized by a 7-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices. This fold includes a Rossmann-like N-terminal motif and a C-terminal motif forming an extended β-sheet (Gandini2017Structural). Specific mutations in DPM1, such as R92G, S248P, and G152V, are associated with congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ie and impact protein stability and function (Gandini2017Structural).

Post-translational modifications of DPM1 include phosphorylation, with the phosphorylation of Ser165 linked to increased activity and angiogenesis, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Gandini2017Structural). The structural insights from related glycosyltransferases like GtrB suggest that DPM1 may function through similar mechanisms (Ardiccioni2016Structure).

## Function
The DPM1 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) synthase, an enzyme essential for the synthesis of Dol-P-Man from GDP-mannose and dolichol-phosphate. This enzyme plays a critical role in the assembly of lipid-linked oligosaccharides at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which are necessary for proper N-linked glycosylation of proteins (Imbach2000Deficiency). In healthy human cells, DPM1, along with DPM2 and DPM3, forms a complex that facilitates the synthesis of Dol-P-Man. DPM2 is necessary for the localization of the complex to the ER and binds Dol-P, while DPM3 stabilizes the complex by interacting with both DPM1 and DPM2 (Kim2000Dolichol).

The Dol-P-Man produced by this enzyme is crucial for converting a Man5GlcNAc2 lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) into a Man9GlcNAc2 LLO, a key step in the glycosylation process (Kim2000Dolichol). This process is vital for the biosynthesis of glycoproteins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, as well as C-linked protein mannosylation, impacting protein folding, stability, and function (Imbach2000Deficiency). The proper functioning of DPM1 is essential for maintaining normal glycosylation processes, which are critical for cellular and organismal functions (Lefeber2009Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPM1 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation, specifically CDG type Ie (CDG-Ie). These disorders are characterized by a range of severe clinical symptoms, including developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. CDG-Ie results from deficiencies in dolichol-phosphate-mannose synthase, an enzyme crucial for glycosylation processes. Mutations in DPM1 lead to defects in the synthesis of dolichol-phosphate-mannose, causing improper glycosylation of proteins (Kim2000Dolichol; Imbach2000Deficiency).

Patients with CDG-Ie often exhibit severe neurological and developmental deterioration, such as persistent muscular hypotonia, reduced spontaneous movements, and intractable seizures. These symptoms are due to the impaired synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides, which are essential for proper glycoprotein formation (Lausmann2022Case; Kim2000Dolichol). Genetic analyses have identified various mutations in the DPM1 gene, including point mutations and deletions, which lead to reduced enzyme activity and altered glycosylation patterns (Lausmann2022Case; Imbach2000Deficiency).

The clinical severity of DPM1-related disorders can vary, with some cases resulting in early infant mortality due to complications such as fulminant sepsis (Lausmann2022Case).

## Interactions
DPM1, the catalytic subunit of the dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase complex, is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its function in glycosylation processes. DPM1 interacts with DPM3, which is necessary for anchoring DPM1 to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This interaction is crucial because, in the absence of DPM3, DPM1 is rapidly degraded. The coiled-coil domain of DPM3, particularly the hydrophobic side including residues like Leu85, is vital for binding DPM1 (Lefeber2009Deficiency).

Mutations in DPM3, such as the p.L85S mutation, significantly reduce the binding capacity of DPM1, leading to its degradation in the cytoplasm via ubiquitination in the proteasome. This mutation affects the stability and binding of DPM1, which is crucial for proper glycosylation processes (Lefeber2009Deficiency).

DPM1 is also suggested to have roles beyond its enzymatic activity, potentially regulating downstream glycosylation pathways. However, specific details on interactions with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond the DPM complex are not provided in the context (Dalton2022A).
