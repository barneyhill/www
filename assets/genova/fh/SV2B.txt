# SV2B

## Overview
SV2B is a gene that encodes the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2B, a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at synapses. As a member of the synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) family, which also includes SV2A and SV2C, SV2B is integral to synaptic vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. The protein is predominantly expressed in glutamatergic neurons and is involved in modulating vesicle maturation and coupling calcium entry with neurotransmitter release (Bartholome2017Puzzling; Rossi2022Synaptic). SV2B is characterized by a 12-transmembrane domain structure and is known to interact with various proteins, including synaptotagmin and botulinum neurotoxins, highlighting its multifaceted role in synaptic function (Mittal2024Structures; Stout2019The). While its specific physiological functions are less defined compared to SV2A, alterations in SV2B expression have been linked to neurological conditions such as glioblastoma multiforme and Alzheimer's disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Bartholome2017Puzzling; Mustafov2024SV2BmiR34amiR128).

## Structure
SV2B is a synaptic vesicle protein characterized by a 12-transmembrane domain structure, typical of the major facilitator superfamily. It features cytosolic N- and C-termini and a large N-glycosylated intraluminal loop between transmembrane domains 7 and 8 (Stout2019The). The protein shares 61-64% sequence homology and 80% structural homology with other SV2 family members, SV2A and SV2C (Stout2019The). SV2B has a structural variant that lacks amino acids 1-151 and contains five known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), although the exact function of these variants is not fully established (Stout2019The).

The luminal loops of SV2B contain at least three N-glycosylation sites, which are crucial for proper protein folding and function (Bartholome2017Puzzling). Glycosylation is important for SV2B, as mutations in these sites can reduce protein expression (Bartholome2017Puzzling). SV2B also interacts with botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E), with specific tyrosine residues mediating this interaction (Mittal2024Structures). The protein's structure includes cholesteryl hemisuccinate and other lipid-like densities, which may play a role in its function (Mittal2024Structures).

## Function
SV2B (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2B) is a protein involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release at synapses. It is part of the synaptic vesicle protein family, playing a crucial role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and exocytosis. SV2B is primarily active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, contributing to synaptic plasticity and efficient neurotransmission.

SV2B is a member of the synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) family, which includes SV2A and SV2C. These proteins are integral to synaptic vesicle function and neurotransmitter transport. SV2B is predominantly expressed in glutamatergic neurons and is involved in modulating vesicle maturation during exocytosis and coupling calcium entry with neurotransmitter release (Bartholome2017Puzzling; Rossi2022Synaptic). It is also suggested that SV2B may function as a synaptic vesicle-specific chloride channel, influencing ion movement across the vesicle membrane, which could regulate neurotransmitter uptake (Bajjalieh1994Differential).

SV2B is expressed in various brain regions, including the cortex and hippocampus, and is more prevalent during development than in adulthood (Rossi2022Synaptic). It is coexpressed with SV2A in many neurons, suggesting potential functional redundancy (Stout2019The). Despite its significant role in neurotransmission, the specific physiological functions of SV2B in healthy cells remain less defined compared to SV2A (Bartholome2017Puzzling).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SV2B gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), SV2B is upregulated, and its high expression levels are associated with shorter overall survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker. The SV2B/miR-34a/miR-128 axis has been identified as a significant factor in GBM progression, with miR-34a and miR-128a being downregulated in these tumors (Mustafov2024SV2BmiR34amiR128). 

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), SV2B expression is downregulated in the hippocampi and neocortices of patients, particularly in those with APOE alleles linked to early onset AD. This downregulation is contrasted by the overexpression of an SV2B mRNA transcript variant in neurons exposed to amyloid beta peptides, suggesting a complex role in neurodegeneration (Bartholome2017Puzzling).

SV2B's role in neurotransmission is highlighted in the retina, where its absence in knockout mice leads to reduced synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and bipolar neurons. This is evidenced by decreased levels of synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptotagmin and VAMP, indicating SV2B's importance in maintaining synaptic protein levels and function (Morgans2009Loss).

## Interactions
SV2B, a member of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 family, participates in several key interactions that are crucial for its function in synaptic vesicle dynamics. SV2B interacts with synaptotagmin, a calcium sensor involved in neurotransmitter release. This interaction is calcium-independent, distinguishing it from the calcium-dependent interaction between synaptotagmin and SV2A (Bartholome2017Puzzling; Rossi2022Synaptic). SV2B also forms complexes with other vesicular proteins, which help stabilize protein orientation within the vesicle, suggesting a role in vesicle trafficking and structure regulation (Stout2019The).

SV2B is involved in the entry of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) into neurons, acting as a receptor that facilitates their cellular entrance through vesicle recycling. This interaction is specific to different SV2 isoforms, with SV2B being responsible for the neuronal entry of certain BoNT serotypes (Mittal2024Structures; Rossi2022Synaptic). Additionally, SV2B interacts with components of the extracellular matrix, such as laminin-1, which may influence vesicular recycling and neurotransmitter release (Stout2019The). These interactions highlight SV2B's multifaceted role in synaptic function and its potential involvement in various cellular processes.
