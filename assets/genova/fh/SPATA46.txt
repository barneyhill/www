# SPATA46

## Overview
SPATA46 is a gene that encodes the protein spermatogenesis associated 46, which plays a crucial role in the process of spermatogenesis, particularly in the shaping of the sperm head. This protein is integral to the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope (NE) during sperm development, interacting with other proteins such as Calicin to facilitate the formation of essential sperm structures. SPATA46 is involved in various cellular pathways, including Wnt, cAMP, mTOR, AMPK, PI3K-Akt, and spliceosome, indicating its participation in complex regulatory networks during testicular development (Chen2023Comprehensive). Beyond its role in male fertility, SPATA46 has been implicated in certain cancers, such as non-virus associated hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, where genetic aberrations and gene fusions have been observed (Song2021High‐throughput; Liu2020Transcriptomic). These findings suggest that SPATA46 may serve as a potential molecular marker for both reproductive and oncological conditions.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
SPATA46 is implicated in several clinical conditions related to male infertility. Abnormal expression of SPATA46 has been associated with teratozoospermia and azoospermia, conditions characterized by abnormal sperm morphology and absence of sperm in the ejaculate, respectively. These conditions complicate the identification of genetic markers due to the lack of potential drug targets, but SPATA46 is believed to play a significant role in spermatogenesis and may serve as a molecular marker for the clinical diagnosis of pathospermia (Das2022A).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly non-virus associated cases, SPATA46 has been identified as having high frequencies of genetic aberrations. This suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of HCC, although specific diseases or conditions directly associated with SPATA46 gene mutations or expression alterations in this context are not detailed (Liu2020Transcriptomic).

Additionally, SPATA46 has been mentioned in the context of lung cancer, where a SPATA46-NTRK1 fusion was detected in a patient. This fusion was identified using high-throughput sequencing, although the specific clinical implications of this fusion in lung cancer are not fully detailed (Song2021High‐throughput).

## Interactions
SPATA46 is a protein involved in spermatogenesis, particularly in sperm head shaping. It interacts with Calicin, a key protein expressed in elongating spermatids, which is crucial for male fertility. Calicin is involved in mediating interactions among perinuclear theca (PT) proteins to establish the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM)-acroplaxome-nuclear envelope (NE) structure during nuclear elongation and acrosome development. The interaction between SPATA46 and Calicin is essential for maintaining NE stability and proper sperm head formation. The loss of SPATA46 results in discontinuous NE and aberrant cavities in the acroplaxome, highlighting its role in maintaining NE integrity (Yan2022Calicin).

SPATA46 is also identified as a gene with high frequencies of genetic aberrations in non-virus associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Liu2020Transcriptomic). In the context of testicular development, SPATA46 is enriched during spermatogenesis and is part of pathways such as Wnt, cAMP, mTOR, AMPK, PI3K-Akt, and spliceosome, indicating its involvement in complex regulatory networks (Chen2023Comprehensive). However, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in these pathways are not explicitly described.
