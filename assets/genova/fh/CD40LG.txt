# CD40LG

## Overview
The CD40LG gene encodes the CD40 ligand (CD40L), a type II transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system. CD40L is primarily expressed on activated CD4+ T cells and is crucial for mediating interactions between T cells and B cells, facilitating processes such as germinal center formation, antibody isotype switching, and affinity maturation. These interactions are essential for the development of high-affinity antibodies and memory B cells, which are vital components of adaptive immunity. Beyond its role in humoral immunity, CD40L is also involved in cell-mediated immune responses, influencing the development of cytotoxic T cells and the regulation of autoimmune diseases. The protein's interaction with the CD40 receptor, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is central to its function, impacting various immune and inflammatory pathways (elgueta2009molecular; Laman2017Functions). Mutations in the CD40LG gene are linked to X-linked Hyper IgM Syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in immunodeficiency disorders (Davies2010Update; Seyama1998Mutations).

## Structure
The CD40 ligand (CD40L), encoded by the CD40LG gene, is a type II transmembrane protein with a molecular mass of approximately 32-33 kDa, although the amino acid sequence predicts a mass of 29 kDa, indicating post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Spriggs1993The; van2000CD40CD40). The primary structure of human CD40L consists of 261 amino acids, including a 22-amino acid cytoplasmic domain, a 24-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 215-amino acid extracellular domain (Spriggs1993The; van2000CD40CD40).

The secondary structure of CD40L includes a TNF-like region that forms a sandwich of two β sheets with jelly-roll topology (van2000CD40CD40). The tertiary structure has been resolved by X-ray crystallography, revealing a threefold symmetric homotrimer, similar to TNF-α and LTα proteins (van2000CD40CD40; Singh1998The). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a homotrimer, which is crucial for its function (van2000CD40CD40).

CD40L can exist in different forms, including a 33-kDa membrane-bound form and shorter soluble forms of 31 and/or 18 kDa, which retain the ability to form trimers and bind CD40 (van2000CD40CD40). The protein contains a single N-linked glycosylation site in the extracellular region (Spriggs1993The; van2000CD40CD40).

## Function
The CD40 ligand (CD40LG), also known as CD154, is a crucial protein in the immune system, primarily expressed on activated CD4+ T cells. It plays a significant role in the interactions between T cells and B cells, essential for the formation of germinal centers where B cells undergo proliferation, differentiation, somatic hypermutation, and isotype switching. These processes are vital for generating high-affinity antibodies and memory B cells (elgueta2009molecular; Laman2017Functions).

CD40LG is involved in the activation and differentiation of B cells during T-dependent antigen responses. The interaction between CD40LG and its receptor CD40 on B cells is necessary for germinal center formation, antibody isotype switching, and affinity maturation, leading to the development of memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells (elgueta2009molecular).

In addition to its role in humoral immunity, CD40LG is involved in cell-mediated immunity, contributing to the development of cytotoxic T cells and the regulation of autoimmune diseases. It also plays a role in allograft tolerance and rejection, with potential therapeutic implications in transplant medicine (elgueta2009molecular). CD40LG's expression is regulated by TCR-mediated signals and can be induced on various cell types under inflammatory conditions (elgueta2009molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD40LG gene, which encodes the CD40 ligand, are primarily associated with X-linked Hyper IgM Syndrome (XHIGM). This condition is characterized by immunodeficiency due to impaired class switching of immunoglobulins, leading to low levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE, with normal or elevated levels of IgM (Davies2010Update; Seyama1998Mutations). Patients with CD40LG mutations often experience recurrent and severe infections, particularly affecting the respiratory tract, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and gastrointestinal issues like chronic diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium species (Davies2010Update; França2019CD40).

The deficiency also results in non-infectious complications, including autoimmune disorders and an increased risk of malignancies, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract (França2019CD40). Neutropenia is a common hematological complication, occurring in more than half of the patients (Davies2010Update). The only curative treatment for CD40LG deficiency is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, although the decision to proceed with this treatment is complicated by the variability in clinical presentation (Uygun2020Hematopoietic).

Mutations in CD40LG can include missense, nonsense, deletions, insertions, and splice site mutations, which affect the expression and function of the CD40 ligand, leading to the clinical manifestations observed in XHIGM (Seyama1998Mutations).

## Interactions
CD40LG, also known as CD40 ligand, is a protein that engages in several critical interactions with other proteins, primarily influencing immune and inflammatory responses. It interacts with the CD40 receptor, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, which is expressed on various cell types including B cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. This interaction is essential for T cell-dependent B cell differentiation and activation, as well as for the modulation of inflammatory pathways (Schönbeck*RID="*"ID="*"2001The; Tang2021Molecular).

CD40LG also binds to integrins such as αIIbβ3, α5β1, and Mac-1 (αMβ2). The interaction with αIIbβ3 on platelets is involved in thrombotic and hemostatic processes, while binding to Mac-1 on myeloid cells facilitates cellular adhesion. The interaction with α5β1 on endothelial cells contributes to their activation (Aloui2014The; Michel2017CD40L).

These interactions can induce various signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K, and NF-κB, leading to pro-inflammatory gene expression. CD40LG can form homotrimers, allowing it to bind simultaneously to multiple receptors, which can result in complex signaling outcomes (Tang2021Molecular; Michel2017CD40L).
