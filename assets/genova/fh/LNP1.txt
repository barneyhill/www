# LNP1

## Overview
LNP1 is a gene that encodes the protein leukemia NUP98 fusion partner 1, also known as Lunapark. This protein is a polytopic integral membrane protein that plays a critical role in the morphology and maintenance of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Characterized by its two transmembrane domains, Lunapark is involved in the structural organization of the ER, contributing to its network formation and stability. The protein's functional domains, including coiled-coil domains and a Zn2+-finger domain, facilitate its dimerization and localization to ER junctions, which are essential for its biological activity. Post-translational modifications such as N-myristoylation and phosphorylation further regulate its function and localization, particularly during cellular processes like mitosis (Wang2016Cooperation; Zhou2018Reciprocal; Moriya2013Protein).

## Structure
The LNP1 protein, also known as Lunapark, is a polytopic integral membrane protein involved in the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It contains two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2), which contribute to its membrane integration and topology. TM1 acts as a type II signal anchor sequence, while TM2 functions as a stop-transfer sequence, resulting in a double-spanning membrane protein with an N-/C-terminal cytoplasmic orientation (Moriya2013Protein).

LNP1 features several structural domains, including coiled-coil domains (CC1 and CC2), a Zn2+-finger domain, and a phosphorylation domain. The Zn2+-finger domain is crucial for dimerization and localization to ER junctions (Wang2016Cooperation; Wang2018The). The N-terminal region contains an N-myristoylation site, which is essential for its membrane anchoring and function (Zhou2018Reciprocal; Moriya2013Protein).

Post-translational modifications include N-myristoylation, which is critical for ER morphological changes, and phosphorylation, which affects LNP1's oligomerization and localization during mitosis (Wang2016Cooperation; Moriya2013Protein). These structural features and modifications are vital for LNP1's role in ER network formation and maintenance.
