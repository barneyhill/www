# FUT5

## Overview
FUT5, or fucosyltransferase 5, is a gene that encodes a type II transmembrane protein involved in the enzymatic process of fucosylation, a critical step in protein glycosylation. The protein, fucosyltransferase 5, is part of the glycosyltransferase family and is characterized by its ability to transfer fucose, a hexose sugar, to glycoproteins and glycolipids. This process predominantly occurs in the Golgi apparatus and is essential for various cellular functions, including cell-cell recognition, signaling, and immune responses. The expression of FUT5 is regulated by transcription factors such as HNF1a and HNF4a, which play a role in its activity in liver and pancreatic cells. Additionally, FUT5 has been implicated in reproductive biology through its interaction with glycodelin-A on the human sperm plasma membrane, influencing sperm function and fertilization. Clinically, alterations in FUT5 expression have been associated with colorectal cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in oncology (Lauc2010Genomics; Chiu2007GlycodelinA; Liang2017miR125a3pFUT5FUT6).

## Structure
FUT5 (fucosyltransferase 5) is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a large C-terminal catalytic domain. This structure is typical of enzymes in the glycosyltransferase family, which often feature a conserved GT-B fold in their tertiary structure. The GT-B fold is crucial for the enzyme's function in transferring fucose, a hexose sugar, to glycoproteins and glycolipids. 

Post-translational modifications of FUT5 may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence the protein's stability, localization, and activity. These modifications are common in proteins involved in complex biosynthetic pathways, such as glycosylation. 

Alternative splicing of the FUT5 gene can result in different isoforms of the protein, potentially affecting its function and interaction with other cellular components. The presence of multiple isoforms allows for a diversity of functions and regulatory mechanisms, which can be crucial for the enzyme's role in various biological processes. 

Overall, the structural features of FUT5, including its transmembrane nature and post-translational modifications, are integral to its function as a fucosyltransferase in human cells.

## Function
Fucosyltransferase 5 (FUT5) is an enzyme involved in the fucosylation process, which is a critical step in protein glycosylation. This process involves the addition of fucose, a hexose sugar, to glycoproteins and glycolipids, primarily occurring in the Golgi apparatus. Fucosylation is essential for various cellular functions, including cell-cell recognition, signaling, and immune responses (Lauc2010Genomics).

FUT5 is co-regulated by the transcription factors HNF1a and HNF4a, which influence its expression in liver and pancreatic cells. HNF4a directly binds to the promoter of FUT5, and its knockdown results in the loss of FUT5 expression, indicating its role in the fucosylation pathway (Lauc2010Genomics). This regulation is part of a broader mechanism that affects the availability of fucose for glycosylation, impacting processes such as the acute phase response to infection (Lauc2010Genomics).

In healthy human cells, FUT5, along with other fucosyltransferases, contributes to the synthesis of N-glycans, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper physiological functions. The specific role of FUT5 in healthy cells, however, is not extensively detailed in the available literature (Lauc2010Genomics).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FUT5 gene have been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). FUT5, along with FUT6, is highly expressed in CRC tissues and cell lines, contributing to increased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. These processes are mediated through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer cell growth and metastasis (Liang2017miR125a3pFUT5FUT6). The miR-125a-3p, a non-coding RNA, is significantly downregulated in CRC and targets FUT5 and FUT6, inhibiting these oncogenic processes. This suggests that miR-125a-3p acts as an anti-oncogene by modulating the expression of FUT5 and FUT6, thereby impacting the PI3K/Akt pathway (Liang2017miR125a3pFUT5FUT6).

The aberrant expression of fucosylated N-glycans, synthesized by FUT5, is observed in various human malignancies, indicating a broader role in cancer biology (Liang2017miR125a3pFUT5FUT6). The study of the miR-125a-3p/FUT5-FUT6 axis highlights the potential of targeting this pathway for therapeutic interventions in CRC, suggesting that FUT5 could serve as a predictive biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Liang2017miR125a3pFUT5FUT6).

## Interactions
Fucosyltransferase 5 (FUT5) is known to interact specifically with glycodelin-A on the human sperm plasma membrane. This interaction is significant in the context of sperm function, as glycodelin-A inhibits spermatozoa-zona pellucida binding by interacting with FUT5. The study identified FUT5 as a binding partner of glycodelin-A through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which confirmed the specific interaction between these two proteins (Chiu2007GlycodelinA).

FUT5 is also suggested to act as a zona pellucida glycoprotein receptor due to its ability to bind to the zona pellucida, a critical component in fertilization. This binding is competitive, as the presence of solubilized zona pellucida reduces the binding of glycodelin-A to sperm FUT5 (Chiu2007GlycodelinA). The interaction is glycosylation-dependent, as deglycosylated glycodelin-A does not co-precipitate with FUT5 (Chiu2007GlycodelinA).

These interactions highlight the role of FUT5 in reproductive biology, particularly in the regulation of sperm binding to the zona pellucida, which is crucial for successful fertilization. The specific binding of FUT5 to glycodelin-A and the zona pellucida underscores its potential function as a receptor in spermatozoa.
