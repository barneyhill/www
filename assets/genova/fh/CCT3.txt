# CCT3

## Overview
CCT3, or chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 3, is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), also known as the TRiC complex. This complex is a type of molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in the folding of cytoplasmic proteins, including actin and tubulin, which are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (Pavel2016CCT). The CCT complex is composed of two stacked rings, each containing eight different subunits, with CCT3 being one of these integral components (Liu2022Current). The protein encoded by CCT3 is involved in various cellular processes, including the assembly of mTOR complexes and autophagy, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and proteostasis (Grantham2020The; Cuéllar2019Structural). Additionally, CCT3 has been implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression can influence tumorigenesis and cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Xu2020Suppression; Liu2019CCT3).

## Structure
CCT3, or chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 3, is a major component of the CCT complex, a eukaryotic chaperonin involved in protein folding. The primary structure of CCT3 consists of a sequence of amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa (Liu2022Current). The secondary structure includes conserved equatorial domains and variable apical domains, which are characteristic of chaperonins (Liu2022Current). The equatorial domain is responsible for ATP binding and is crucial for the structural integrity of the complex (Wang2020The).

The tertiary structure of CCT3, like other CCT subunits, contributes to the formation of a cylindrical double-ring structure, with each ring composed of eight distinct subunits (Liu2022Current). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of CCT3 with other subunits to form the complete CCT complex, which is essential for its function in protein folding (Liu2022Current).

Post-translational modifications of CCT3 include N-terminal processing, where the initiator methionine may be cleaved, and N-terminal acetylation, which can act as a degradation signal (Collier2021Native). These modifications are consistent with in vivo processing and may play a role in the protein's function and stability.

## Function
CCT3, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), plays a crucial role in protein folding within the cytoplasm of healthy human cells. The CCT complex is composed of two rings of eight different subunits, including CCT3, and is essential for the proper folding of a wide range of cytoplasmic proteins. Initially thought to be limited to cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin, CCT3 is now known to assist in the folding of various proteins, maintaining cellular structure and function (Pavel2016CCT).

CCT3 is involved in the assembly of mTOR complexes, specifically mTORC1, by facilitating the folding of mLST8 and Raptor proteins. These proteins contain β-propeller domains, which are crucial for their assembly into mTOR complexes, impacting cell metabolism, growth, and survival (Cuéllar2019Structural). The CCT complex, including CCT3, also plays a role in autophagy, a degradation pathway essential for clearing aggregate-prone proteins. Loss of CCT function can lead to protein accumulation due to autophagy inhibition, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis (Pavel2016CCT).

CCT3's involvement in these processes underscores its critical role in maintaining proteostasis and preventing protein aggregation, which is vital for healthy cellular function (Grantham2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCT3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often acts as an oncogene. In breast cancer, CCT3 knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and migration, induces apoptosis, and alters cell cycle distribution, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2020Suppression). In liver cancer, CCT3 interacts with Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcription factor CP2 (TFCP2), prolonging their half-lives and promoting tumorigenesis. This interaction is associated with poorer overall survival, highlighting CCT3 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Liu2019CCT3).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CCT3 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. It promotes cell proliferation by inhibiting ferroptosis and activating the AKT signaling pathway, making it a potential biomarker for LUAD (Wang2022Upregulation; Huang2023Integrated). CCT3 is also significantly upregulated in gastric, thyroid, and liver cancers, where its suppression triggers apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer progression (Temiz2021CCT3).

CCT3's expression is influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors, including mutations in driver genes like TP53, APC, and KRAS, as well as DNA methylation and histone modification, which may contribute to its role in tumorigenesis (Ma2022Insights).

## Interactions
CCT3, a subunit of the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT/TRiC) complex, is involved in numerous protein interactions essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis. In humans, CCT3 is reported to have 192 interactions, with a significant portion being physical interactions. These interactions are primarily identified through methods such as affinity capture and co-fractionation (Narayanan2016The).

CCT3 interacts with other subunits of the CCT/TRiC complex, including CCT2, CCT1 (TCP1), CCT4, CCT7, CCT6A, CCT5, and CCT8, forming a co-expression network crucial for its function in protein folding (Huang2022CCT3related; Huang2023Integrated). It also interacts with proteins like IGBP1, which is involved in the assembly and stability of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and ARPC1A, part of the ARP2/3 complex involved in actin filament organization (Huang2023Integrated).

CCT3 is linked to proteins such as PACRG and PARK2, which are associated with disease conditions, highlighting its medical significance (Narayanan2016The). In cancer research, CCT3 interacts with proteins like CDC20 and p53, affecting apoptosis pathways and influencing cancer cell proliferation and survival (Liu2022Current). These interactions underscore CCT3's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
