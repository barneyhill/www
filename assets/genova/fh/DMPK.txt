# DMPK

## Overview
The DMPK gene encodes the DM1 protein kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase that is a member of the AGC superfamily. This kinase is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in muscle tissues, where it plays a role in glucose homeostasis, insulin signaling, and cytoskeletal organization. The protein's structure includes key domains such as a leucine-rich domain, a serine/threonine kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal domain, which collectively contribute to its regulatory and enzymatic functions. DMPK is involved in the modulation of insulin receptor trafficking and the prevention of reactive oxygen species-induced cell death, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and muscle function. Mutations in the DMPK gene, particularly expansions of CTG trinucleotide repeats, are associated with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a disorder characterized by muscle weakness and other systemic symptoms (Thornton2017Myotonic; Pantic2013Myotonic; Llagostera2007Role).

## Structure
The DMPK gene encodes a protein kinase that is part of the AGC superfamily of serine/threonine protein kinases. The primary structure of DMPK includes several key domains: an N-terminal leucine-rich domain, a serine/threonine kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal domain (J.2012Myotonic; Sasagawa2003Overexpression). The leucine-rich domain is involved in regulating DMPK activity and localization, while the kinase domain is responsible for its enzymatic function, transferring phosphate groups to serine or threonine residues on target proteins (J.2012Myotonic).

The coiled-coil domain, consisting of approximately 65 amino acids, facilitates multimerization and substrate binding, contributing to the protein's tertiary and quaternary structures by allowing the formation of high-molecular-weight complexes (J.2012Myotonic). The C-terminal domain plays an autoinhibitory role and influences subcellular localization, with longer tails anchoring the protein to membranes (J.2012Myotonic).

DMPK undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct C-terminal regions, affecting their cellular localization and function. Isoforms A, C, and E include a VSGGG motif, which modulates autophosphorylation activity (J.2012Myotonic; Oude2009DMPK). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions (Sasagawa2003Overexpression).

## Function
The DMPK gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in muscle tissues. It is primarily involved in glucose homeostasis and muscle insulin action by modulating insulin signaling pathways. DMPK facilitates the intracellular trafficking of insulin and IGF-1 receptors, which is essential for maintaining normal glucose metabolism. In healthy cells, DMPK acts as a positive modulator of insulin action, ensuring proper insulin receptor localization to the plasma membrane, which is vital for effective insulin signaling (Llagostera2007Role).

DMPK is also involved in cytoskeletal organization, particularly in stress fiber formation, which affects the localization and signaling of the insulin receptor. This kinase is part of the AGC family of protein kinases, which includes kinases that regulate the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, influencing cell shape, motility, and muscle contraction (van2005Divergent; Oude2009DMPK).

Additionally, DMPK plays a role in preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell death by forming a complex with hexokinase II and Src on the mitochondrial surface. This complex helps maintain redox balance and protects cells from oxidative stress, which is crucial for muscle fiber differentiation and function (Pantic2013Myotonic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DMPK gene are primarily associated with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a dominantly inherited neuromuscular disorder. This condition is caused by an expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene, leading to the formation of toxic RNA transcripts that sequester splicing factors, such as the Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins. This sequestration disrupts normal RNA processing and alternative splicing, resulting in a range of symptoms including muscle weakness, myotonia, cardiac conduction defects, cataracts, and cognitive impairments (Izzo2022Molecular; Thornton2017Myotonic; LópezMartínez2020An).

The expanded CTG repeats also cause nuclear retention of mutant transcripts, reducing the expression of the DMPK protein and potentially affecting the expression of neighboring genes like SIX5 and DMWD. This can lead to chromatin structure alterations and further contribute to the disease phenotype (Davis1997Expansion; de2022Overview). The severity and onset of DM1 symptoms are correlated with the number of CTG repeats, with larger expansions generally resulting in more severe manifestations (Izzo2022Molecular; LópezMartínez2020An).

## Interactions
The DMPK (DM1 protein kinase) gene encodes a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes and the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). DMPK forms a complex with hexokinase II (HK II) and the tyrosine kinase Src on the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is crucial for preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell death. This complex helps maintain low levels of mitochondrial superoxide and protects cells from oxidative stress by inhibiting the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) (Pantic2013Myotonic).

DMPK also interacts with the CUG-binding protein (CUG-BP/hNab50), where it phosphorylates CUG-BP, affecting its RNA-binding activity and intracellular localization. This interaction is significant in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying myotonic dystrophy, as it influences the processing and transport of DMPK mRNA and potentially other mRNAs (Roberts1997Altered).

Additionally, DMPK is involved in modulating skeletal muscle voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ channels and phosphorylates the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1), suggesting a role in actomyosin contraction and cytoskeletal remodeling (Oude2009DMPK). These interactions highlight DMPK's involvement in muscle function and cellular dynamics.
