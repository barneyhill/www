# MSRB3

## Overview
MSRB3, or methionine sulfoxide reductase B3, is a gene that encodes the enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase B3, which is part of the methionine sulfoxide reductase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms by catalyzing the reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxide back to methionine, thus repairing oxidatively damaged proteins and preserving their function (Kim2004Methionine; Lee2009Functions). MSRB3 is expressed in various cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, through its isoforms MSRB3A and MSRB3B, which are produced by alternative splicing (Kim2004Methionine; Kim2007Methionine). The enzyme is notably involved in synaptic function within the hippocampus, contributing to synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release, which are crucial for cognitive processes (Adams2017Methionine). Mutations in the MSRB3 gene have been implicated in conditions such as autosomal recessive deafness and are associated with various pathologies, including gastric cancer and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Kwon2013Methionine; Ma2019Increased; Conner2019Methionine).

## Function
MSRB3 (methionine sulfoxide reductase B3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cellular antioxidant defense by reducing methionine-R-sulfoxide to methionine, thereby repairing oxidatively damaged proteins and maintaining protein function (Lee2009Functions). This enzymatic activity is crucial for protecting cells against oxidative stress, which can lead to structural changes and loss of protein function (Kim2004Methionine). MSRB3 exists in two isoforms, MSRB3A and MSRB3B, which are generated by alternative splicing and are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, respectively (Kim2004Methionine; Kim2007Methionine). The presence of MSRB3 in these cellular compartments suggests its involvement in distinct roles related to antioxidant defense and protein maintenance (Kim2013The).

In healthy human cells, MSRB3 is associated with synaptic vesicles and is involved in synaptic function, particularly in the hippocampus, where it may play a role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release (Adams2017Methionine). The enzyme's activity in the hippocampus is linked to maintaining synaptic integrity and vascular health, which are essential for cognitive function and may influence hippocampal volume and function in aging and neurovascular diseases (Adams2017Methionine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MSRB3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of hearing loss, MSRB3 mutations have been linked to the autosomal recessive deafness condition DFNB74. Specifically, mutations such as a missense mutation (p.Cys89Gly) and a nonsense mutation (p.Arg19X) in MSRB3 lead to the degeneration of stereocilia and apoptotic cell death in cochlear hair cells, resulting in profound hearing loss (Kwon2013Methionine). 

In gastric cancer, increased expression of MSRB3 is associated with a poorer prognosis. Studies have shown that MSRB3 expression is significantly higher in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and high levels of MSRB3 correlate with shorter overall survival times in patients (Ma2019Increased).

In Alzheimer's disease, alterations in MSRB3 expression have been observed in the hippocampus. The MSRB3 rs61921502 risk allele is associated with increased odds of brain infarcts and may influence Alzheimer's disease pathology, particularly in the absence of the APOE4 allele (Conner2019Methionine). Changes in MSRB3 expression patterns in the hippocampus are linked to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's patients (Adams2017Methionine).
