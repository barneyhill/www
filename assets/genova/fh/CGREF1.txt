# CGREF1

## Overview
The CGREF1 gene encodes the protein known as cell growth regulator with EF-hand domain 1, which is a secretory protein involved in cellular signaling and regulation of cell proliferation. This protein is characterized by the presence of two calcium-dependent EF-hand motifs, which are indicative of its role in calcium-mediated signaling pathways. As a secretory protein, CGREF1 is synthesized with a signal peptide that directs its secretion through the classical secretory pathway. Functionally, CGREF1 is known to inhibit the AP-1 transcription factor and components of the MAPK signaling pathway, thereby playing a critical role in controlling cell proliferation and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor. The gene's expression and mutations have been associated with various clinical conditions, including cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Zhihao2023Cancerassociated; Deng2015The; Cui2024Genomewide).

## Structure
The CGREF1 protein is composed of 301 amino acids, with a full-length cDNA of 1887 base pairs, translating into an open reading frame (ORF) of 301 amino acids (Deng2015The). The predicted molecular mass of the CGREF1 protein is approximately 32 kDa, and it has an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.35 (Deng2015The). Structurally, CGREF1 contains two calcium-dependent EF-hand motifs, which are typically involved in calcium binding, indicating its role in signaling pathways (Deng2015The). These motifs are common structural domains in proteins that participate in signaling pathways (Deng2015The).

The protein also features a putative signal peptide near the N-terminus, suggesting that it is a secretory protein (Deng2015The). This is supported by experimental evidence showing that CGREF1 is secreted via the classical secretory pathway, as its secretion is inhibited by Brefeldin A, a classical secretion pathway inhibitor (Deng2015The). The molecular structure of CGREF1 in terms of its three-dimensional conformation is not detailed in the available context, and there is no information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms (Deng2015The).

## Function
The human gene CGREF1 encodes a secretory protein that plays a significant role in regulating transcriptional activity and cell proliferation. CGREF1 is involved in the inhibition of the AP-1 transcription factor, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as inflammation, cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and transformation, particularly in tumor development (Deng2015The). The protein is secreted via the classical secretory pathway, involving the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and contains a signal peptide and two calcium-dependent EF-hand motifs (Deng2015The).

CGREF1's overexpression has been shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK, components of the MAPK signaling pathway, thereby suppressing the proliferation of HEK293T and HCT116 cells (Deng2015The). It also affects the phosphorylation status of c-Jun Ser63 and reduces the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, but not JNK, indicating its involvement in MAPK signaling pathways (Deng2015The). The protein's ability to inhibit AP-1 activity suggests it acts as a repressor of the AP-1 signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation and potentially preventing excessive cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in healthy human cells (Deng2015The).

## Clinical Significance
The CGREF1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling and proliferation. In colorectal cancer, higher expression levels of CGREF1 are associated with improved overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Cui2024Genomewide). In osteosarcoma, CGREF1 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its possible involvement in predicting drug resistance and serving as a prognostic indicator (Zhihao2023Cancerassociated).

Mutations in CGREF1 have been linked to cancer recurrence, particularly in HPV-positive tonsillar and base of tongue squamous cell carcinomas. A specific deletion in CGREF1 was identified in relapse samples, suggesting a role in treatment resistance or disease progression (ÄhrlundRichter2021WholeExome). In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), CGREF1 is up-regulated in patients with low fat-free mass index, correlating with muscle wasting and alterations in muscle fiber characteristics (Rabinovich2015Genomewide).

Furthermore, CGREF1 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for dorsopathies, with elevated expression levels associated with a decreased risk of these musculoskeletal disorders (Cui2024Genomewide). These findings highlight the gene's significance in various pathological conditions, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms and therapeutic potential.
