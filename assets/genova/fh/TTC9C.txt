# TTC9C

## Overview
TTC9C is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 9C, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the TTC9C protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific functions of the TTC9C protein are not fully understood, it has been implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, including cardiovascular and liver diseases. Notably, TTC9C expression is altered in conditions such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), indicating its potential involvement in disease mechanisms and highlighting the need for further research to elucidate its biological roles and therapeutic potential (Liu2023Identification; Cederström2019New).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the TTC9C gene, which encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, is still under investigation. In the context of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), TTC9C was identified as one of the seven candidate genes with significant differential expression between the acute and convalescent phases of the condition. Specifically, TTC9C was found to be downregulated during the acute phase of STEMI, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression or response (Cederström2019New). However, the specific clinical implications of this downregulation in STEMI or atherosclerosis have not been fully elucidated.

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TTC9C was identified as part of a protein interaction network related to CD8+ T cell exhaustion, although its direct clinical significance in this context was not detailed (Liu2023Identification). The gene's involvement in these conditions indicates that alterations in TTC9C expression or function may contribute to disease mechanisms, but further research is needed to clarify its precise role and potential as a therapeutic target.
