# DNPEP

## Overview
The DNPEP gene encodes the protein aspartyl aminopeptidase, a member of the M18 peptidase family, which is characterized by its specificity for acidic amino acids at the N-terminus of peptides. Aspartyl aminopeptidase is a metallopeptidase that plays a significant role in protein and peptide metabolism, particularly within the renin-angiotensin system, which is crucial for blood pressure regulation. The protein forms a dodecameric structure, a self-compartmentalization strategy that enhances its specificity towards unfolded polypeptides. This structure includes a binuclear zinc center in the active site, essential for its catalytic function and substrate specificity. DNPEP is highly expressed in neurons and neuroendocrine tissues, and its activity is implicated in various physiological processes, including autophagy and endosomal trafficking. Alterations in DNPEP expression have been associated with several diseases, including cancers and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Chaikuad2012Structure; Kakodkar2020Aspartic).

## Structure
The human aspartyl aminopeptidase (DNPEP) is a member of the M18 peptidase family, characterized by its specificity for acidic amino acids at the N-terminus. The protein structure is organized into a dodecameric assembly formed by domain-swapped dimers, consistent with electron microscopy data (Chaikuad2012Structure). Each dimer exhibits internal two-fold symmetry and is stabilized by extensive contacts, including the swapping of loop β8-β9 between subunits (Chaikuad2012Structure).

The DNPEP protein features a two-domain architecture: the proteolytic domain and the dimerization domain. The proteolytic domain, comprising amino acids 7-98 and 249-468, includes a core nine-stranded β-sheet flanked by several α-helices and a small five-stranded β-subdomain. The dimerization domain, spanning amino acids 99-248, is butterfly-shaped and consists of two orthogonal β-sheets, with an extended β8-β9 loop crucial for active site formation (Chaikuad2012Structure).

The active site contains a binuclear zinc center, essential for catalytic function, coordinated by conserved residues forming a 'H.D.E.D.H' signature. This site also includes a substrate specificity pocket that accommodates acidic amino acids, with a basic lysine residue contributing to substrate preference (Chaikuad2012Structure). The structure of DNPEP is similar to M42 dodecameric tetrahedrons, suggesting a common self-compartmentalization strategy for catalysis (Chaikuad2012Structure).

## Function
Aspartyl aminopeptidase (DNPEP) is a mammalian enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein and peptide metabolism, particularly within the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is essential for blood pressure regulation. DNPEP specifically targets acidic amino acids at the N-terminus of substrates, with a preference for aspartate over glutamate, and is highly expressed in neurons and neuroendocrine tissues. It converts angiotensin I to angiotensin 2-10 and angiotensin II to angiotensin III, implicating its role in RAS and blood pressure regulation (Chaikuad2012Structure).

The enzyme forms a dodecameric structure, which is a self-compartmentalization strategy similar to proteasomes, allowing specificity towards unfolded polypeptides. This structure features a binuclear zinc center in the active site, which is crucial for its catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity (Chaikuad2012Structure). The active site is characterized by two zinc ions coordinated by specific residues, forming a conserved 'H.D.E.D.H' signature among DNPEP paralogues and M18 family members. This configuration facilitates the enzyme's function in hydrolyzing N-terminal aspartate and glutamate residues from peptides, influencing cellular protein turnover and maintaining amino acid homeostasis (Chaikuad2012Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or activity of the DNPEP gene, which encodes aspartyl aminopeptidase, have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. DNPEP expression is notably altered in neoplastic disorders such as colon and breast cancers, squamous cell carcinoma, and gliomas (Chen2014Identification). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), DNPEP has been identified as a biomarker associated with aggressive disease. High DNPEP expression correlates with shorter time to treatment and lower overall survival probability in CLL patients, making it a significant prognostic factor for time to treatment (Kakodkar2020Aspartic). DNPEP inhibition has been shown to enhance the cytotoxicity of certain CLL treatments, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kakodkar2020Aspartic).

In mice, DNPEP is a target of the chondrocyte-specific microRNA, Mir140. Overexpression of DNPEP due to the loss of Mir140 leads to defects in skeletal development, indicating its role in bone physiology (Chen2014Identification). Additionally, DNPEP's involvement in endosomal trafficking has been observed in Caenorhabditis elegans, where loss of DNPEP activity corrected defects caused by a mutation in phosphatidylserine flippase (tat1) (Chen2014Identification). These findings suggest that DNPEP may play a role in various physiological and pathological processes.

## Interactions
DNPEP, or aspartyl aminopeptidase, is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins, which may influence its function in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with Atg8, a protein involved in autophagy. This interaction was identified through yeast two-hybrid analysis, suggesting a potential role for DNPEP in autophagic pathways (Mesquita2015Dissecting).

Structurally, DNPEP forms a dodecameric complex, a quaternary arrangement that is similar to other M18 and M42 metallopeptidases. This complex is composed of six homodimers, with each dimer formed by extensive contacts involving loop swapping between subunits. This structural feature is crucial for its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, as it allows DNPEP to self-compartmentalize and target unfolded polypeptides (Chaikuad2012Structure).

The enzyme's active site includes a binuclear zinc center, which is essential for its catalytic function. The coordination of zinc ions and the specific arrangement of residues in the active site suggest that DNPEP may interact with other proteins or substrates through electrostatic interactions, particularly with acidic amino acids like Asp and Glu (Chaikuad2012Structure). These interactions are critical for substrate recognition and catalysis, indicating DNPEP's involvement in various cellular pathways.
