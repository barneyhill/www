# ARR3

## Overview
The ARR3 gene encodes the protein arrestin-3, a member of the arrestin family involved in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Arrestin-3 is a non-visual arrestin that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by facilitating receptor internalization and enabling G protein-independent signaling pathways. Structurally, arrestin-3 is characterized by its N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which form a 7-stranded beta sandwich, and it can oligomerize in the presence of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) (Zhan2011Crystal; Chen2021An). Functionally, arrestin-3 interacts with various proteins, including GPCRs and kinases, to modulate signaling pathways and cellular responses (Prokop2017Differential; Galet2008Arrestin3). Clinically, mutations in the ARR3 gene are associated with conditions such as early-onset high myopia and color vision deficiencies, highlighting its significance in visual system development and function (Gu2023The; Xiao2023Identification).

## Structure
Arrestin-3 (ARR3) is a protein with a molecular structure characterized by two main domains: the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, each forming a 7-stranded beta sandwich connected by a ten-residue linker (Zhan2011Crystal). The primary structure of arrestin-3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form these domains, with specific regions contributing to its functional properties. The secondary structure includes beta sheets and alpha helices, with the C-domain exhibiting a non-contiguous β-sheet that provides increased flexibility, affecting receptor binding selectivity (Zhan2011Crystal).

The tertiary structure of arrestin-3 is an elongated two-domain molecule, with a conserved inter-subunit interface formed by a parallel beta-sheet interaction between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, crucial for oligomerization (Zhan2011Crystal). Arrestin-3's quaternary structure involves oligomerization, forming trimers in the presence of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), which influences its signaling capabilities (Chen2021An).

Arrestin-3 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions. The protein's structure allows it to bind to various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and non-receptor partners, contributing to its role in cellular signaling pathways (Zhan2011Crystal).

## Function
Arrestin-3 (ARR3) is a non-visual arrestin protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in human cells. It is ubiquitously expressed and capable of binding to a wide variety of GPCRs, facilitating receptor internalization and enabling G protein-independent signaling (Prokop2017Differential). ARR3 modulates the endocytic machinery by binding to clathrin and AP-2, components of clathrin-coated pits (CPs), which are involved in endocytosis. Upon GPCR activation, ARR3 is recruited to CPs, leading to receptor internalization (Santini2002G).

ARR3's interaction with GPCRs is influenced by specific mutations, which can alter its binding affinity to different receptors. For instance, mutations in the middle-loop of ARR3, such as Lys139Ile, can increase binding to the M2 muscarinic receptor while decreasing interactions with D1 and D2 dopamine receptors (Prokop2017Differential). This adaptability allows ARR3 to modulate GPCR activity, which is essential for various cellular responses.

In addition to its role in receptor internalization, ARR3 is involved in the activation of signaling pathways. For example, it is essential for the activation of Fyn, a member of the Src family of kinases, by the luteinizing hormone receptor, which is crucial for downstream signaling events (Galet2008Arrestin3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARR3 gene are associated with early-onset high myopia (eoHM), particularly in a unique X-linked female-limited inheritance pattern. This condition is characterized by a refractive error of ≤ -6.00 diopters or an axial length > 26 mm, and it is a leading cause of blindness (Xiao2023Identification). The specific mutation c.228T>A (p.Tyr76*) in the ARR3 gene has been identified as causing eoHM in female carriers, with affected individuals often exhibiting stable myopic levels over a decade (Gu2023The). 

In addition to high myopia, ARR3 mutations are linked to color vision defects, specifically protan/deutan deficiencies, affecting both male and female carriers. This suggests a multivariate cause involving both the ARR3 mutation and variants in the OPN1MW gene (Gu2023The). The ARR3 gene's role in these conditions is thought to involve its function in signal transduction in photoreceptors, with mutations potentially leading to abnormal cone function and visual system development (Gu2023The; Xiao2023Identification).

The penetrance of ARR3-related eoHM is not absolute, with some affected individuals showing no symptoms, indicating variability in the expression of the condition (Wang2022Genetic).

## Interactions
Arrestin-3 (ARR3) interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. One of its key interactions is with the mitogen-activated protein kinase JNK3α2. Arrestin-3 binds JNK3α2 through multiple sites on both its N-domain and C-domain. The primary binding site is the T1A peptide, located in the first 25 residues of the N-domain, while additional binding elements, T3 and T6, are found in the C-domain, albeit with lower affinity (Zhan2014Arrestin3). This interaction facilitates JNK3α2 activation, even in the absence of receptor stimulation, by acting as a scaffold for upstream kinases like ASK1, MKK4, or MKK7 (Zhan2014Arrestin3).

Arrestin-3 also interacts with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the neuropeptide Y receptor subtypes Y1R and Y2R. Specific mutations in arrestin-3 can alter its binding affinity to these receptors, demonstrating the importance of certain residues in receptor interaction (Gimenez2014Mutations; Wanka2018Different). The protein's ability to bind to phosphorylated receptors and facilitate receptor internalization is crucial for modulating GPCR signaling pathways (Chen2017Structural). Arrestin-3's interactions with these proteins highlight its versatile role in cellular signaling and receptor regulation.
