# ITFG2

## Overview
ITFG2 is a gene that encodes the protein integrin alpha FG-GAP repeat containing 2, which is a crucial component of the KICSTOR complex. This protein is involved in the regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, a pathway essential for cellular growth and metabolism. ITFG2, through its interaction with other proteins such as KPTN, plays a significant role in the localization and function of the KICSTOR complex at the lysosomal surface, where it facilitates the recruitment of GATOR1 and its interaction with Rag GTPases and GATOR2. The stability of the ITFG2-KPTN heterodimer, regardless of nutrient conditions, underscores its importance in maintaining mTORC1 signaling integrity (Wolfson2017KICSTOR). Alterations in ITFG2 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, due to their impact on mTORC1 signaling (Cai2021Genomic; Wolfson2017KICSTOR).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITFG2 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, primarily through their impact on mTORC1 signaling. ITFG2 is a component of the KICSTOR complex, which is crucial for the regulation of mTORC1 activity in response to nutrient availability. Loss of ITFG2 or other KICSTOR components can lead to increased mTORC1 signaling, making cells insensitive to amino acid and glucose deprivation. This dysregulation is associated with resistance to PI3Kα inhibitors in PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer, as the loss of ITFG2 results in sustained mTOR signaling despite pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K-AKT pathway (Cai2021Genomic; Wolfson2017KICSTOR).

In addition to its role in cancer, mutations in ITFG2 and other KICSTOR components have been linked to neurological disorders characterized by hyperactive mTORC1 signaling, such as epilepsy and brain malformation disorders (Wolfson2017KICSTOR). These findings suggest that ITFG2 mutations or alterations in its expression or interactions could disrupt normal mTORC1 signaling, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involving ITFG2 may guide therapeutic strategies, including the use of mTORC1 inhibitors like rapamycin in affected patients (Wolfson2017KICSTOR).

## Interactions
ITFG2 is a component of the KICSTOR complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating mTORC1 signaling. ITFG2 forms a heterodimer with KPTN, and this interaction is robust even in the absence of other KICSTOR components, indicating a strong and stable association between these two proteins (Wolfson2017KICSTOR). The KPTN-ITFG2 heterodimer can associate with C12orf66, but this requires the presence of SZT2, which acts as a linking component within the KICSTOR complex (Wolfson2017KICSTOR). 

The KICSTOR complex, including ITFG2, localizes to lysosomes and is essential for recruiting GATOR1 to the lysosomal surface, facilitating its interaction with the Rag GTPases and GATOR2 (Wolfson2017KICSTOR). ITFG2's interaction with KPTN is not significantly affected by amino acid availability, suggesting that their association is stable under varying nutrient conditions (Wolfson2017KICSTOR).

ITFG2 also interacts with the VWCE protein, which associates with all four subunits of the KICSTOR complex. The interaction between VWCE and KICSTOR relies on the KPTN/ITFG2 heterodimer, highlighting ITFG2's role in mediating these interactions (Zhao2023VWCE).
