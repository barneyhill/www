# CHRD

## Overview
The CHRD gene encodes the protein chordin, a secreted extracellular matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in embryonic development by modulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Chordin is characterized by its multiple cysteine-rich von Willebrand factor type C (vWC) domains, which enable it to bind and inhibit BMPs, thereby preventing them from interacting with their receptors. This inhibition is crucial for processes such as neural development, dorsoventral patterning, and pharyngeal development. The protein's regulatory function extends beyond embryogenesis, contributing to postnatal homeostasis and influencing cell fate, proliferation, and apoptosis in various tissues. Alterations in CHRD expression have been implicated in clinical conditions, including cancer, where it may act as a tumor suppressor by maintaining normal BMP signaling pathways (Correns2021BMP; Moll2006Chordin; Bachiller2003The).

## Structure
Chordin (CHRD) is a secreted protein characterized by its multiple cysteine-rich von Willebrand factor type C (vWC) domains, also known as cysteine-rich (CR) domains. These domains are crucial for its function in binding bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and inhibiting their signaling pathways. The protein consists of approximately 950-1000 amino acids and includes four highly conserved CR domains, with one located at the N-terminus and three in tandem at the C-terminus (Hyvönen2003CHRD; Garcia2002Chordinlike).

The CR domains are defined by a conserved spacing pattern of ten cysteines, which form disulfide bonds that stabilize the protein's conformation. These domains are part of the canonical von Willebrand factor-C domain and are involved in binding to BMP-4, with CR-1 and CR-3 showing higher affinity than CR-2 and CR-4 (Garcia2002Chordinlike). The full-length Chordin protein exhibits a tenfold higher affinity for BMPs than individual CR domains, suggesting cooperativity among these domains (Garcia2002Chordinlike).

Chordin's structure has been observed to resemble a horseshoe shape, as seen through transmission electron microscopy, indicating a potential mode of interaction with BMPs involving cooperation between the terminal cysteine-rich domains (Mulloy2015The). The protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage by metalloproteases like Xolloid, which regulates its activity by releasing BMP from the Chordin/BMP complex (Garcia2002Chordinlike).

## Function
The CHRD gene encodes the protein chordin, which is a critical extracellular regulator of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Chordin functions by binding to BMPs, such as BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7, preventing them from interacting with their receptors. This inhibition is crucial for various developmental processes, including neural development, dorsoventral patterning, and pharyngeal development (Bachiller2003The; Itoh2010Secreted). In healthy human cells, particularly in the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) and granulosa cells, CHRD is expressed and may regulate BMP activity, influencing cell fate, proliferation, and apoptosis (Moll2006Chordin).

Chordin's role extends to embryonic development, where it is essential for the correct formation of the neural plate and dorsal mesoderm. It is secreted by the mesendoderm and is necessary for the expression of transcription factors involved in pharyngeal development, such as Tbx1 and Fgf8 (Bachiller2003The). The protein's activity is not limited to embryogenesis; it also plays a role in postnatal homeostasis by modulating BMP signaling in various tissues (Correns2021BMP). The precise regulation of BMP signaling by chordin is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing diseases such as cancer (Moll2006Chordin).

## Clinical Significance
The CHRD gene, encoding the protein chordin, plays a significant role in modulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is crucial for proper embryonic development. Alterations in CHRD expression or function have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In ovarian cancer, CHRD is often underexpressed, which is associated with increased tumor cell motility and invasiveness, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role. This underexpression may contribute to cancer progression by disrupting normal BMP signaling pathways (Moll2006Chordin).

Although mutations in the CHRD gene have not been directly linked to Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CDLS), the gene's location and function prompted investigations into its potential involvement. However, mutation screenings in CDLS patients did not reveal any specific mutations in CHRD, suggesting it is unlikely to be a causative factor for this syndrome (Smith1999Genomic).

In mouse models, CHRD has been identified as a modifier gene for craniofacial malformations associated with 22q11 deletion syndrome. The absence of CHRD exacerbates defects caused by mutations in the Tbx1 gene, indicating its role in modifying the severity of these phenotypes (Choi2009Chordin).

## Interactions
Chordin (CHRD) is a protein that interacts with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) to inhibit their signaling. It binds to BMPs through its von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domains, specifically interacting with BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-7. The binding is characterized by high affinity, with chordin forming a 1:1 complex with BMP dimers (Zhang2007von; Troilo2014Nanoscale). Chordin's VWC domains, particularly VWC1 and VWC3, are crucial for BMP binding, and the protein can inhibit BMP-2 binding to its receptors, BMPR-IA and ActR-IIB (Zhang2007von).

Chordin also forms a ternary complex with BMPs and Twisted gastrulation (Tsg), which enhances its inhibitory effect on BMP signaling. Tsg does not compete with chordin for BMP binding but instead facilitates the formation of a trimolecular complex, enhancing BMP inhibition (Zhang2007von; Oelgeschläger2000The). The interaction with Tsg is cooperative in full-length chordin, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism (Zhang2007von).

Chordin's interactions are modulated by proteolytic cleavage, particularly by tolloid proteinases, which can enhance its BMP inhibitory function by altering its conformation and binding dynamics (Troilo2014Nanoscale).
