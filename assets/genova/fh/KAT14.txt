# KAT14

## Overview
KAT14, or lysine acetyltransferase 14, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which functions as an acetyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the acetylation of lysine residues on histone proteins, a critical post-translational modification that influences chromatin structure and gene expression. KAT14 plays a significant role in fibrogenesis, particularly in the context of ovarian endometrioma, by interacting with transcription factors such as serum response factor (SRF) to regulate the expression of fibrosis-associated genes (Gong2024Lysine). The protein's activity is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, which are key components in the development of fibrotic tissue (Gong2024Lysine). Given its involvement in fibrotic processes, KAT14 is considered a potential therapeutic target for conditions characterized by excessive fibrosis (Gong2024Lysine).

## Clinical Significance
KAT14 (lysine acetyltransferase 14) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioma, a subtype of endometriosis characterized by fibrogenesis. In this condition, KAT14 is upregulated in ectopic lesions and plays a crucial role in promoting fibrosis through its interaction with serum response factor (SRF). This interaction enhances the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, contributing to myofibroblast activation and excessive ECM deposition (Gong2024Lysine). 

The overexpression of KAT14 in human endometrial stromal cells leads to increased expression of fibrotic markers such as fibronectin and collagen I, which are critical in the development of fibrosis associated with endometriosis (Gong2024Lysine). Conversely, silencing KAT14 reduces the expression of these profibrotic markers, indicating its pivotal role in fibrogenesis (Gong2024Lysine). 

Targeting the KAT14/SRF complex has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for managing endometrioma-associated fibrosis, highlighting the clinical significance of KAT14 in fibrotic conditions (Gong2024Lysine). The involvement of KAT14 in TGF-β-induced fibrotic processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by fibrosis (Gong2024Lysine).

## Interactions
KAT14, also known as lysine acetyltransferase 14, is involved in several physical interactions that play a crucial role in fibrogenesis, particularly in the context of ovarian endometrioma. KAT14 interacts with the serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor, to mediate TGF-β-induced fibrosis. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional regulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. KAT14 forms a complex with SRF, which is recruited to the ACTA2 promoter sequence, known as the CArG box, where SRF binds to initiate the expression of fibrosis-associated genes under TGF-β1 stimulation (Gong2024Lysine).

The interaction between KAT14 and SRF is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, indicating the formation of a KAT14/SRF complex. This complex is involved in chromatin modifications at specific gene promoters, such as the ACTA2 promoter, where KAT14 promotes histone H4 acetylation, facilitating α-SMA expression (Gong2024Lysine). The KAT14/SRF complex is abundant in endometrioma samples and positively correlates with α-SMA expression, highlighting its key role in the progression of endometrioma-associated fibrogenesis (Gong2024Lysine).
