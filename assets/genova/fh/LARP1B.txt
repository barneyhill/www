# LARP1B

## Overview
LARP1B is a gene that encodes the La ribonucleoprotein 1B, a member of the La-related protein family known for its RNA-binding capabilities. The protein is characterized by a La-module, which includes a La motif (LaM) and an RNA recognition motif (RRM1), both essential for RNA interaction (Deragon2015The). Additionally, LARP1B features a unique C-terminal DM15 domain, which is highly conserved and plays a critical role in binding mRNA 5'-cap and TOP sequences, potentially facilitating mRNA circularization (Kozlov2023Structural). This protein is implicated in various cellular processes through its interactions with RNA and other proteins, although specific functional details remain to be fully elucidated.
