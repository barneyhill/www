# OGFR

## Overview
The opioid growth factor receptor (OGFR) gene encodes the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr), a non-classical receptor involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Unlike traditional opioid receptors, OGFr lacks transmembrane domains and is characterized by its unique structural features, including a series of imperfect amino acid repeats and a bipartite nuclear localization signal (Zagon2000Cloning; Cheng2009Dependence). This receptor primarily functions within the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it interacts with the opioid growth factor (OGF) to modulate the cell cycle by influencing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (McLaughlin2012The; Zagon2002The). The OGF-OGFr axis plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in various physiological processes, including tissue growth and repair, as well as in pathological conditions such as cancer (Kim2016Morphine; Zagon2002The).

## Structure
The opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) is a protein encoded by the OGFR gene in humans, consisting of 697 amino acids. The primary structure includes 8 imperfect repeats of 20 amino acids each, located at the C-terminus (Zagon2000Cloning; Wang2019Interaction). The receptor lacks homology to classical opioid receptors and does not contain typical transmembrane motifs, indicating a distinct structural organization (Zagon2000Cloning; Cheng2009Dependence).

OGFr features a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is crucial for its transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, suggesting a role in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (Zagon2004Nucleocytoplasmic; Cheng2009Dependence). This NLS is composed of short stretches of basic amino acids that interact with karyopherin (importin) β, facilitating translocation through the nuclear pore complex (Cheng2009Dependence).

Alternative splicing of the OGFr gene results in multiple isoforms, which may have distinct functions in growth regulation (Zagon2000Cloning). The receptor's structure is characterized by a high content of glutamic and aspartic acids, contributing to its acidic nature, although the functional implications of this feature remain speculative (Zagon2000Molecular).

## Function
The opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) is a crucial component in regulating cell proliferation in healthy human cells. It interacts with the opioid growth factor (OGF), also known as [Met5]-enkephalin, to modulate the cell cycle, particularly by delaying the G1/S transition. This regulation is achieved through the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) such as p16 and p21, which are essential for controlling cell cycle progression (McLaughlin2012The; Cheng2009The).

OGFr is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences DNA synthesis and cell cycle regulation. The receptor is associated with the nuclear envelope and is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is essential for its function in modulating DNA activity (Cheng2009Dependence; Zagon2002The). The OGF-OGFr axis is a tonically active inhibitory system that maintains cellular homeostasis and is involved in processes such as tissue growth, repair, and wound healing (McLaughlin2012The; Zagon2002The).

In healthy human cells, OGFr plays a significant role in maintaining normal cell growth and preventing uncontrolled proliferation, which could lead to neoplasia (Zagon2000Cloning). The receptor's activity is crucial for the regulation of growth and development in both neural and non-neural cells (Zagon2002The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFR) have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In pancreatic cancer, the OGFR is involved in regulating cell proliferation through the p21 pathway. Studies have shown that the OGF-OGFR axis inhibits cancer cell growth by inducing p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which is crucial for controlling the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase (Cheng2008The). In squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, tumor specimens often exhibit subnormal levels of OGFR, suggesting a link between reduced receptor expression and cancer progression (Zagon2002The).

In lung cancer, OGFR acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation. Morphine, which binds to OGFR, has been shown to suppress lung cancer cell growth, indicating a potential therapeutic role for morphine in targeting OGFR to inhibit cancer progression (Kim2016Morphine). Additionally, in epithelial ovarian cancer, the long noncoding RNA LINC00673 is upregulated and promotes cancer progression by dysregulating OGFR expression, highlighting OGFR's role in tumor growth and metastasis (Zheng2019&lt; p&gt; Long).

## Interactions
The opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) interacts with its ligand, the opioid growth factor (OGF), to form a complex that plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation. This complex is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, a process facilitated by interactions with karyopherin β and the RanGTP/RanGDP gradient, which are crucial for the translocation of the OGF-OGFr complex through the nuclear pore (Wang2019Interaction; Zagon2002The). The OGF-OGFr complex is also associated with the inner nuclear lamina and the periphery of heterochromatin, where it may suppress DNA replicative activity (Zagon2002The).

OGFr contains nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that are essential for its nuclear import, and mutations in these signals can significantly reduce its nuclear localization, highlighting their importance in the receptor's transport (Cheng2009Dependence). The interaction between OGFr and OGF modulates the expression of cell cycle regulators such as P16 and P21, which are up-regulated by OGF, contributing to its inhibitory effects on cell proliferation (Wang2019Interaction). Additionally, the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is decreased by OGF, aligning with reduced CDK2 and CDK4 activity (Wang2019Interaction).
