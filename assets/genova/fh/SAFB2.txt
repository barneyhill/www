# SAFB2

## Overview
SAFB2 (scaffold attachment factor B2) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in chromatin organization, transcriptional regulation, and RNA processing. The SAFB2 protein is a member of the SAFB family, characterized by its ability to bind to the nuclear matrix and interact with AT-rich DNA within scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) (Korn2023Insight). It contains several conserved domains, including an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a SAP domain, which facilitate its roles in DNA and RNA binding, chromatin remodeling, and transcriptional regulation (Korn2023Insight). SAFB2 is also involved in the maturation of microRNAs, such as miR-15a and miR-16-1, through its interaction with the microprocessor complex (Hutter2019SAFB2). Additionally, SAFB2 acts as a corepressor of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity, implicating it in breast cancer biology (Oesterreich2003Scaffold). Its diverse functions underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on disease when dysregulated.

## Structure
SAFB2 (scaffold attachment factor B2) is a protein characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its function in chromatin organization and gene regulation. The protein contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is typical for RNA-binding proteins, although its RNA binding capacity is not essential for its role in miRNA processing (Hutter2019SAFB2). A significant region of SAFB2, comprising amino acids 561 to 726, includes a putative coiled-coil domain and an arginine/glutamic acid-rich (RE) region, which are crucial for its activity in miRNA processing (Hutter2019SAFB2). This region, termed SAFB2 min, is almost as active as the full-length protein in restoring miR-15a reporter repression (Hutter2019SAFB2).

SAFB2 shares 74% similarity with SAFB1, particularly in the SAF-box and RRM domains, indicating a high degree of structural conservation (Garee2009SAFB1’s). The C-terminal region of SAFB2 contains Glu/Arg- and Gly-rich regions, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Oesterreich2003Scaffold). SAFB2 is also known to interact with DROSHA, a component of the Microprocessor complex, suggesting its role in forming protein complexes (Hutter2019SAFB2). The protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation (Oesterreich2003Scaffold).

## Function
The SAFB2 protein plays a crucial role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is involved in transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and chromatin organization. SAFB2 is part of the SAFB family, which binds to the nuclear matrix and interacts with AT-rich DNA within scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) (Korn2023Insight). It assists in the processing of suboptimal stem-loop structures in miRNA maturation, particularly in the biogenesis of miRNAs such as miR-15a and miR-16-1, by facilitating efficient cleavage through its interaction with the microprocessor complex, which includes DROSHA and DGCR8 (Hutter2019SAFB2).

SAFB2 contains several domains, including the SAP and RRM domains, which are responsible for DNA and RNA binding, respectively. These domains contribute to its role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation (Korn2023Insight). The protein is also involved in the formation of nuclear stress bodies and stabilizes heterochromatin through interactions with DNA and RNA (Korn2023Insight). SAFB2's interaction with nuclear-localized RNAs suggests a role in transcript processing, potentially influenced by protein co-factors and long non-coding RNAs (Korn2023Insight).

## Clinical Significance
SAFB2 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In breast cancer, SAFB2 is considered a potential tumor suppressor gene due to its role as an estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) corepressor. Alterations in SAFB2 expression have been associated with breast cancer progression, with low expression levels linked to worse patient survival and aneuploidy (Oesterreich2003Scaffold). Despite its potential role, studies have not found germline mutations in SAFB2 that are directly responsible for hereditary breast cancer, suggesting that its involvement may be more complex and not solely due to inherited mutations (Bergman2008No).

SAFB2 is also crucial for the biogenesis of certain microRNAs, such as miR-15a, which are involved in cellular processes like apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. Disruptions in SAFB2 can impair miRNA processing, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis (Hutter2019SAFB2). The loss of SAFB2 affects the processing of suboptimal stem-loop structures in clustered primary miRNA transcripts, which may influence cancer development by altering gene expression profiles (Hutter2019SAFB2). These findings highlight the significance of SAFB2 in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential impact on disease when altered.

## Interactions
SAFB2 is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular processes. It is suggested to have cytoplasmic functions, potentially involving cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization through its interaction with vinexin, an SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein. This interaction implies that SAFB2 might connect tight intercellular junctions with the cytoskeleton, possibly interacting with the tight junction protein ZO-2, which could indicate a role in cell adhesion processes (Oesterreich2003Scaffold).

In the context of breast cancer, SAFB2 acts as a corepressor of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity. Both SAFB1 and SAFB2 inhibit ERα's transcriptional activity through mechanisms that involve histone deacetylase-dependent and -independent pathways (Oesterreich2003Scaffold). The tumor suppressor gene BRCA1, which is linked to hereditary breast cancer, also functions as an ERα corepressor, and mutations in BRCA1 can affect its ability to repress ERα (Oesterreich2003Scaffold).

SAFB2 is also involved in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation, as it shares high similarity with SAFB1, which is known to bind to scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) and interact with RNA processing proteins and RNA polymerase II (Oesterreich2003Scaffold).
