# CXCR5

## Overview
The CXCR5 gene encodes the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 5, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by directing the migration of B cells and certain T cells to lymphoid tissues. This receptor is integral to the formation of germinal centers, which are crucial for B cell maturation and differentiation, thereby contributing to effective immune responses (Kazanietz2019CXCL13; Müller2001Signal). CXCR5 is primarily expressed on the surface of B cells and interacts with its ligand, CXCL13, to facilitate the homing and development of B cells within lymphoid tissues such as the spleen, Peyer's patches, and lymph nodes (Schmutz2005Chemokinereceptorsintherheumatoidsynovium:upregulationofCXCR5). The receptor's activation triggers intracellular signaling pathways, including calcium influx and the ERK/MAPK pathway, which are essential for cell survival, proliferation, and migration (Müller2001Signal). Dysregulation of CXCR5 and its signaling pathways is associated with various immune-related diseases and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Hussain2019CXCL13/CXCR5).

## Structure
The CXCR5 protein is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs, which facilitate signal transduction across cell membranes (Kazanietz2019CXCL13). The primary structure of CXCR5 includes two isoforms resulting from alternatively spliced transcript variants. The transcript variant 2 differs at the 5' end, leading to a shorter N-terminus due to translation starting from a downstream in-frame AUG (Pan2022Role).

The secondary structure of CXCR5 is typical of GPCRs, with seven hydrophobic transmembrane segments (Kazanietz2019CXCL13). The receptor shares approximately 40% amino acid homology with CXCR1, particularly in the second intracellular domain (IC2), which includes a DRY motif followed by a conserved YLXIV motif, facilitating binding to intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins (Kazanietz2019CXCL13).

The tertiary structure of CXCR5 is largely unknown, and there is no detailed information on its quaternary structure (Pan2022Role). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation may regulate its function, although specific details are not provided in the context. The receptor is involved in B-cell migration and organization within lymphoid tissues, playing a crucial role in immune responses (Panaro2010An).

## Function
The CXCR5 gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a critical role in the immune system by guiding the migration of B cells and certain T cells to lymphoid tissues. This receptor is primarily expressed on the surface of these cells and interacts with its ligand, CXCL13, to facilitate the homing and development of B cells within lymphoid tissues such as the spleen, Peyer's patches, and lymph nodes (Schmutz2005Chemokinereceptorsintherheumatoidsynovium:upregulationofCXCR5; Kazanietz2019CXCL13). 

CXCR5 is involved in the formation of germinal centers, which are essential for B cell maturation and differentiation, contributing to effective immune responses (Kazanietz2019CXCL13). The receptor's activation leads to intracellular calcium influx and the activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, which are crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and migration (Kazanietz2019CXCL13; Müller2001Signal). 

In healthy human cells, CXCR5's role in lymphocyte homing and lymphoid tissue development is evidenced by its involvement in the formation of primary follicles and germinal centers, as well as its impact on immune cell function (Kazanietz2019CXCL13; Müller2001Signal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CXCR5 gene are associated with various diseases, particularly those involving the immune system and cancer. Dysregulated expression of CXCR5 and its ligand CXCL13 can lead to the formation of ectopic lymphoid-like structures, known as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs), which are linked to chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, as well as cancer (Hussain2019CXCL13/CXCR5).

In cancer, aberrant CXCR5 signaling is implicated in the progression of several advanced human cancers, with serum CXCL13 levels proposed as a biomarker for cancer progression and early diagnosis (Hussain2019CXCL13/CXCR5). Specific polymorphisms in the CXCR5 gene have been associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and its subtypes, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL) (Charbonneau2013CXCR5; Song2012CXC). These genetic variations may influence the risk and prognosis of NHL by affecting lymphocyte migration and tumor growth (Charbonneau2013CXCR5).

In rheumatoid arthritis, certain CXCR5 polymorphisms are linked to increased susceptibility, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the disease (Su2022Association). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CXCR5 in immune-related conditions and cancer.

## Interactions
CXCR5, a G protein-coupled receptor, engages in various interactions with other proteins that influence its signaling pathways. In prostate cancer cell lines, CXCR5 is known to couple with different G protein subunits, such as G αi2 and G αq/11, in untreated cells. Upon stimulation with its ligand CXCL13, CXCR5 associates with G α13, indicating a dynamic interaction with G proteins that may affect tumor behavior, including cell adhesion and migration (ElHaibi2013Differential).

CXCR5 also forms both homo- and heterodimers with the Epstein-Barr virus-induced receptor 2 (EBI2). This interaction modulates CXCR5-mediated responses, such as calcium flux and MAPK activation, by altering the receptor's conformation and reducing the binding affinity of CXCL13. The presence of EBI2 affects the efficacy of G-protein activation, suggesting that CXCR5/EBI2 heterodimers are functional units that contribute to the plasticity of CXCL13-mediated responses (Barroso2012EBI2).

Additionally, CXCR5 interacts with other receptors like CXCR4 and PAR-1, suggesting potential signaling crosstalk and oligomer formation. These interactions highlight the complex network of signaling pathways in which CXCR5 is involved, impacting immune cell positioning and function (ElHaibi2013Differential).
