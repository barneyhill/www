# PLEKHS1

## Overview
PLEKHS1 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology domain containing S1, which is involved in cellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitates its binding to specific phosphoinositides, such as PI(3,4)P2 and PIP3, and plays a crucial role in membrane association and the PI3K signaling pathway (Chessa2023PLEKHS1). PLEKHS1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by Src-family kinases, which regulate its interactions with PI3K subunits and influence its activity in signaling pathways (Chessa2023PLEKHS1). The gene has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression and mutations can affect prognosis and disease progression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Xing2020PLEKHS1; Pignot2019PLEKHS1:).

## Structure
The PLEKHS1 protein contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is crucial for its ability to bind specific phosphoinositides such as PI(3,4)P2 and PIP3. This domain is involved in membrane association and plays a significant role in the protein's function within the PI3K signaling pathway (Chessa2023PLEKHS1). The PH domain of PLEKHS1 shares similarities with other PIP3-binding PH domains, which suggests a conserved structural motif that facilitates its interaction with lipid molecules (Chessa2023PLEKHS1).

Phosphorylation is a prominent post-translational modification of PLEKHS1, particularly at the Y258 residue. This phosphorylation is mediated by Src-family kinases and is essential for its interaction with PI3K subunits, indicating a regulatory mechanism that influences its activity in signaling pathways (Chessa2023PLEKHS1). The phosphorylation at Y258 is sensitive to PI3K inhibitors, highlighting its role in pathway homeostasis (Chessa2023PLEKHS1).

While the primary sequence of PLEKHS1 has been cloned and expressed in various systems, specific details about its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature (Chessa2023PLEKHS1). The protein's expression and functional interactions have been studied in the context of PTEN-null prostate tissue, but further research is needed to elucidate its complete molecular structure.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The PLEKHS1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and mutations. In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), PLEKHS1 overexpression is associated with poor outcomes, including lymph node and distant metastases, and predicts shorter overall and disease-free survival. This overexpression is linked to the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for PTC pathogenesis. The study suggests that PLEKHS1 overexpression may serve as a prognostic factor, especially in PTCs without TERT promoter mutations (Xing2020PLEKHS1).

In bladder cancer, PLEKHS1 promoter mutations are frequent, occurring in about 40% of tumors. These mutations are more common in the basal phenotype of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), which has a poor prognosis. PLEKHS1 overexpression is associated with a worse prognosis in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), serving as an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (Pignot2019PLEKHS1:).

In prostate cancer, PLEKHS1 is involved in the PI3K signaling pathway, particularly in PTEN-null conditions, leading to pathway activation and promoting cancer growth. This suggests a potential role for PLEKHS1 as a biomarker for PI3K pathway activation in prostate cancer (Chessa2023PLEKHS1).

In gastric carcinoma, PLEKHS1 expression is significantly decreased, suggesting a protective role. Its expression level is a strong predictor of gastric adenocarcinoma presence, indicating its potential clinical utility in diagnosis (AbdelTawab2022Evaluation).

## Interactions
PLEKHS1 is involved in several protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of PTEN-null prostate tissue. It interacts with the regulatory subunits of PI3K, specifically p85 and p55γ, which are crucial for its role in activating the PI3K pathway. This interaction is enhanced by the phosphorylation of PLEKHS1 at tyrosine 258, a modification dependent on PI3K and SRC-family kinase activity (Chessa2023PLEKHS1). PLEKHS1 also binds to phosphoinositides such as PIP3 and PI(3,4)P2 through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is essential for its function in PI3K signaling (Chessa2023PLEKHS1).

In PTEN-null prostate tissue, PLEKHS1's interaction with PI3K subunits is significantly increased, contributing to the remodeling of pathway homeostasis and sustaining PIP3 levels and AKT phosphorylation (Chessa2023PLEKHS1). Additionally, PLEKHS1 interacts with 14-3-3 proteins, which may modulate its signaling capacity by binding to phosphorylated serine residues (Chessa2023PLEKHS1). The interaction between PLEKHS1 and PIK3R3, a PI3K regulatory subunit, is also noted, with specific tyrosine residues playing a critical role in this binding (Grossmann2015Phospho‐tyrosine).
