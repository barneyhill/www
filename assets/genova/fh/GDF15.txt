# GDF15

## Overview
Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is a gene located on chromosome 19 that encodes a protein belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. The GDF15 protein is characterized as a secreted cytokine with a cysteine knot structure, forming a disulfide-linked homodimer essential for its biological activity (Wischhusen2020GrowthDifferentiation; Emmerson2018GDF15). It is initially synthesized as a precursor protein, which undergoes cleavage to produce the mature, active form (Assadi2020GDF15). GDF15 is involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including cellular stress response, metabolic regulation, and neuroprotection. It interacts with the GFRAL receptor, primarily in the brainstem, to regulate appetite and energy homeostasis (Assadi2020GDF15). Clinically, GDF15 is a biomarker for various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and metabolic syndromes, where its expression levels are often altered (Ling2023Role; Ek2015Genomewide).

## Structure
GDF15 is a member of the TGF-β superfamily and is characterized by a cysteine knot structure formed by seven conserved cysteine residues (Wischhusen2020GrowthDifferentiation). The human GDF15 gene is located on chromosome 19 and encodes a protein that is initially synthesized as a precursor with a signal peptide, a pro-domain, and a mature domain (Emmerson2018GDF15; Assadi2020GDF15). The mature GDF15 protein is a 25 kDa disulfide-linked homodimer, which is secreted after cleavage by furin-like proteases (Verhamme2019GDF15; Emmerson2018GDF15).

The mature protein contains a TGF-β domain and is known to undergo glycosylation as a post-translational modification (Fung2021FcGDF15). The protein's quaternary structure is a homodimer linked by disulfide bonds, which is essential for its biological activity (Assadi2020GDF15). GDF15's unique disulfide bonding configuration, distinct from other TGF-β family members, contributes to its divergence within the superfamily (Verhamme2019GDF15). The protein interacts with the GFRAL receptor, forming a complex that activates specific intracellular signaling pathways (Assadi2020GDF15).

## Function
GDF15, a member of the TGFβ superfamily, is involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is expressed in multiple tissues, including the prostate, placenta, kidney, liver, lung, colon, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract, as well as in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Assadi2020GDF15). GDF15 is upregulated in response to mitochondrial stress and plays a role in muscle recovery and systemic metabolic homeostasis by improving insulin resistance and promoting lipolysis and oxidative metabolism (Assadi2020GDF15). It acts as a neurotrophic and neuroprotective factor in the brain, supporting the survival of dopaminergic neurons and potentially offering protection against neurodegenerative diseases (Assadi2020GDF15).

In the heart, GDF15 expression increases following myocardial infarction, reducing cardiomyocyte damage and inflammation, and inhibiting myocardial hypertrophy (Assadi2020GDF15). In the kidneys, it suppresses extracellular matrix protein accumulation and promotes epithelial cell proliferation (Assadi2020GDF15). GDF15 also plays a role in appetite regulation through a muscle-brain axis, binding to the GFRAL receptor in the brainstem, which interacts with the RET co-receptor to activate intracellular signaling pathways such as AKT, ERK1/2, and PLCγ (Assadi2020GDF15).

## Clinical Significance
GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15) is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and genetic mutations. In cancer, elevated GDF15 levels are associated with poor prognosis and disease progression in several types, including colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers. It acts as a biomarker for cancer cachexia, contributing to muscle atrophy, fat loss, and bone density reduction through pathways like GFRAL/RET and MAP3K11/GDF15 (Ling2023Role; Wischhusen2020GrowthDifferentiation). The H6D polymorphism in the GDF15 gene is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and is associated with distant metastasis and shorter survival in affected patients (Wang2015The).

In cardiovascular diseases, GDF15 is overexpressed in myocardial infarction and is linked to increased mortality in acute coronary syndrome and chronic heart failure (Ek2015Genomewide). It also plays a role in pulmonary hypertension, where its elevated levels correlate with disease severity and vascular remodeling (Wan2023GDF15).

GDF15 is involved in metabolic disorders, with elevated levels predicting type 2 diabetes development and influencing macrophage polarization in metabolic syndrome (Wischhusen2020GrowthDifferentiation). In chronic lung diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COPD, GDF15 contributes to fibrosis and inflammation, exacerbating disease progression (Wan2023GDF15).

## Interactions
Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various biological processes. One significant interaction is with Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CCN2), where GDF15 binds to the von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain of CCN2. This interaction has been shown to inhibit CCN2-mediated angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by suppressing the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and decreasing integrin clustering, suggesting an anti-migratory mechanism (Whitson2013Growth).

GDF15 also interacts with the GFRAL receptor, a transmembrane protein located in the brainstem. This interaction is crucial for its role in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation. The GDF15-GFRAL complex further associates with the RET co-receptor, activating intracellular signaling pathways such as AKT and ERK1/2, but not the SMAD pathway (Assadi2020GDF15).

These interactions highlight GDF15's role in modulating angiogenesis and metabolic processes, with implications for its function in disease states such as cancer and metabolic disorders (Whitson2013Growth).
