# ATP8A2

## Overview
ATP8A2 is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 8A2 protein, a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a phospholipid flippase. This protein is integral to maintaining lipid asymmetry across cell membranes, particularly in the retina and testis, where it plays a crucial role in photoreceptor cells. The ATP8A2 protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain and several key functional domains, including the phosphorylation, nucleotide binding, and actuator domains, which are essential for its ATPase activity. The protein forms a heteromeric complex with CDC50A, which is necessary for its proper folding, stability, and function. Mutations in the ATP8A2 gene are linked to neurological disorders such as cerebellar ataxia and disequilibrium syndrome type 4, highlighting its clinical significance (Guissart2019ATP8A2related; Coleman2009Localization; Chalat2017Cterminus).

## Structure
The ATP8A2 protein is a member of the P4-ATPase family, functioning as a phospholipid transporter across cell membranes. It is composed of 1188 amino acids and features a predicted transmembrane domain with 10 helices (Guissart2019ATP8A2related; Chalat2017Cterminus). The protein includes several key domains: the phosphorylation (P) domain, nucleotide binding (N) domain, and actuator (A) domain, all of which are part of the haloacid dehalogenase domain superfamily (Guissart2019ATP8A2related). The P domain contains a phosphorylated canonical aspartic acid residue, the N domain houses the ATP-binding pocket, and the A domain is responsible for dephosphorylating the P domain (Guissart2019ATP8A2related).

The C-terminal domain of ATP8A2, consisting of 100 amino acids, is crucial for protein folding and regulation of flippase activity. It includes an auto-inhibitory domain and an anti-auto-inhibitory domain, which interact to regulate the protein's function (Chalat2017Cterminus). Phosphorylation of a serine residue within a CaMKII target motif in the C-terminus is suggested to regulate ATP8A2 in a calcium-dependent manner (Chalat2017Cterminus). ATP8A2 forms a functional heterodimer with the accessory subunit CDC50A, which is essential for its expression and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (Chalat2017Cterminus).

## Function
The ATP8A2 gene encodes a protein that functions as a phosphatidylserine (PS) flippase, a member of the P4-ATPase subfamily, which is crucial for maintaining lipid asymmetry in cell membranes. This protein is specifically expressed in the retina and testis, with high expression in the photoreceptor cells of the retina, where it localizes to the disc membranes of rod and cone outer segments (Coleman2009Localization). ATP8A2 primarily translocates phosphatidylserine across the membrane in an ATP-dependent manner, which is essential for maintaining the transbilayer asymmetry of PS and possibly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in photoreceptor disc membranes (Coleman2009Localization).

The asymmetry maintained by ATP8A2 is important for stabilizing membrane structure, facilitating interactions with proteins, and potentially playing roles in vesicle transport and phagocytosis processes (Coleman2009Localization). The ATPase activity of ATP8A2 is stimulated by PS and PE, but not by phosphatidylcholine, indicating its specificity for certain phospholipids (Coleman2009Localization). This activity is crucial for various cellular functions, including membrane impermeability, organelle shape, cell division, and vesicle transport (Coleman2009Localization). ATP8A2's role in maintaining membrane asymmetry is vital for the proper function of photoreceptor cells, contributing significantly to the energy consumption of these cells (Coleman2009Localization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP8A2 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily characterized by cerebellar ataxia, mental retardation, and disequilibrium syndrome type 4 (CAMRQ4). These conditions are autosomal recessive and can present with symptoms such as encephalopathy, hypotonia, psychomotor delay, abnormal movements, chorea, tremor, optic atrophy, and cerebellar atrophy (Guissart2019ATP8A2related; Alsahli2018Further). The gene's mutations can lead to severe neurological phenotypes, including intellectual disability and hyperkinetic movement disorders, with or without optic and cerebellar atrophy (Choi2019Expression).

Clinical studies have identified various mutations in ATP8A2, including missense, splicing, intragenic deletions, and frameshift mutations, which are predicted to cause loss of function of the gene (McMillan2018Recessive). These mutations often result in low protein levels and a lack of phosphatidylserine-activated ATPase activity, contributing to the clinical heterogeneity observed in affected individuals (Guissart2019ATP8A2related). The variability in clinical severity may be influenced by genetic modifiers and other factors, leading to a spectrum of phenotypes from severe epileptic encephalopathy to isolated ataxia (Guissart2019ATP8A2related).

## Interactions
ATP8A2 interacts with the CDC50A protein, forming a heteromeric complex essential for its function as a phospholipid flippase. This interaction is crucial for the stable expression, assembly, and subcellular localization of ATP8A2, as well as its lipid transport activity (Coleman2011Critical). CDC50A acts as a β-subunit, necessary for the proper folding of ATP8A2 and its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (choi2019study; van2010Heteromeric). The ATP8A2-CDC50A complex is transported to the Golgi and a fraction is exported to the plasma membrane (choi2019study).

The interaction between ATP8A2 and CDC50A involves specific transmembrane helices of ATP8A2, and mutations in ATP8A2 can affect the glycosylation of CDC50A, impacting the protein's function (Vestergaard2015Specific). CDC50A's glycosylation is not essential for maintaining ATPase activity or expression levels, but it contributes to the stability of the complex (Vestergaard2015Specific). The interaction is confirmed through various methods, including immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (van2010Heteromeric; Coleman2011Critical). ATP8A2's activity can also be modulated by calcium ions, which inhibit its ATPase activity when complexed with CDC50A (Chalat2017Cterminus).
