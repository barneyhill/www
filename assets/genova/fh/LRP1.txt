# LRP1

## Overview
LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) is a gene that encodes a large, multifunctional endocytic receptor protein known as LDL receptor-related protein 1. This receptor is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including lipid metabolism, cellular signaling, and the clearance of amyloid beta from the brain, which is particularly relevant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Emonard2014Regulation; Lillis2008LDL). LRP1 is expressed in multiple cell types, including neurons, hepatocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells, where it influences cell migration, proliferation, and survival (May2007The). The protein's structure, characterized by multiple ligand-binding repeats and EGF-like domains, allows it to interact with a wide array of ligands, facilitating its involvement in endocytosis and signal transduction pathways (He2021The). Additionally, LRP1 is implicated in the regulation of inflammation and atherosclerosis, highlighting its significance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and contributing to disease pathogenesis (He2021The).

## Structure
LRP1 (LDL receptor-related protein 1) is a large endocytic receptor composed of a single polypeptide chain that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form a heterodimer. The primary structure of LRP1 includes multiple ligand-binding repeats, EGF-like domains, and complement-type repeats, which are essential for its diverse functional roles (He2021The). The secondary and tertiary structures are characterized by these domains forming specific folds, contributing to the protein's ability to interact with various ligands and participate in endocytosis and signal transduction pathways (He2021The).

The quaternary structure of LRP1 is defined by its formation as a heterodimer, consisting of a heavy chain and a light chain. This structural arrangement is crucial for its function in cellular processes such as endocytosis and regulation of signaling pathways (He2021The). Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, play significant roles in modulating LRP1's activity and stability (He2021The). Additionally, splice variants of LRP1 can lead to different isoforms, each with distinct functional properties, allowing the protein to participate in a wide range of physiological processes (He2021The).

## Function
The LRP1 gene encodes the LDL receptor-related protein 1, a multifunctional receptor involved in endocytosis and cellular signaling. In healthy human cells, LRP1 plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the clearance of chylomicron remnants and apolipoprotein E-enriched lipoproteins (Lillis2008LDL). It is also involved in the clearance of amyloid beta (Aβ) from the brain, which is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Emonard2014Regulation; Lillis2008LDL).

LRP1 is highly expressed in neurons, where it interacts with proteins such as postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and NMDA receptor subunits, influencing calcium signaling and neuronal responses to excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate (May2007The). It also plays a role in regulating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuronal integrity through its interaction with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (Emonard2014Regulation).

In the immune system, LRP1 is involved in efferocytosis, the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, which is crucial for maintaining self-tolerance and host defense (Sizova2023Multifaceted). It also regulates inflammation and atherosclerosis, affecting macrophage apoptosis and monocyte recruitment (He2021The).

LRP1 is active in various cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, and neurons, and influences processes like cell migration, proliferation, and survival, impacting tissue homeostasis and development (Lillis2008LDL; May2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the LRP1 gene are associated with several vascular diseases and conditions. The genetic variant rs11172113 within the LRP1 locus is linked to multiple arterial diseases, including fibromuscular dysplasia, migraine, and thoracic aortic dissection. This variant affects LRP1 expression, with the T allele associated with higher expression levels, potentially influencing disease susceptibility (Liu2023Regulatory; Erhart2022Genetic).

LRP1 plays a crucial role in regulating TGF-β signaling and extracellular matrix remodeling. Alterations in LRP1 expression can lead to increased TGF-β signaling, contributing to conditions like Marfan syndrome and atherosclerosis. In LRP1-deficient mice, there is increased vascular wall fibrosis and disruption of elastic layers, which are characteristic of Marfan syndrome (Boucher2007LRP1).

LRP1 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms and dissections. The T allele of rs11172113 is identified as a risk factor for Stanford type B aortic dissection, while the C allele appears protective. These genetic variations may affect clinical outcomes and are significant in understanding the hereditary aspects of aortic dissections (Erhart2022Genetic).

## Interactions
LRP1 (LDL receptor-related protein 1) is involved in numerous interactions with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with matrix metalloprotease 1 (MMP-1), where MMP-1 acts as a ligand for LRP1. This interaction includes the binding of proMMP-1, active MMP-1, and the MMP-1/TIMP-1 complex to LRP1, which is calcium-dependent and can be inhibited by the receptor-associated protein (RAP) (Arai2020HighAffinity). RAP itself binds to LRP1 within clusters II and IV, with critical lysine residues on RAP and tryptophan residues on LRP1 facilitating this interaction. This binding is dynamic and bivalent, enhancing the folding of LRP1 and other LDL receptor family members (Marakasova2021Molecular).

LRP1 also interacts with tau proteins, influencing their internalization and spread across cells. Short peptide sequences derived from the LRP1 ectodomain have been shown to bind tau, potentially mitigating its internalization into LRP1-expressing cells (Boder2023Probing). In the context of Alzheimer's disease, LRP1 interacts with amyloid-beta (Aβ) and other proteins, playing a role in Aβ clearance and influencing amyloid precursor protein (APP) endocytosis (Kanekiyo2014The). Additionally, LRP1 modulates inflammatory responses by interacting with transcription factors like IRF-3, facilitating its nuclear export and degradation (Zurhove2008γSecretase).
