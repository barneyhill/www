# PLXNA4

## Overview
The PLXNA4 gene encodes the plexin A4 protein, a type I single-pass transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in semaphorin signaling pathways. This receptor is integral to neural development, particularly in axon guidance and neural differentiation, by mediating the effects of semaphorins such as Sema3A. Plexin A4 is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes a sema domain, multiple PSI and IPT domains, and a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) domain, facilitating its role in signal transduction (Lu2021Architecture). Beyond its neural functions, PLXNA4 is also involved in maintaining vascular homeostasis and has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as certain cancers (Jun2014PLXNA4; Balakrishnan2009Molecular; Vreeken2021Downregulation). The gene's diverse roles in cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis make it a significant focus of biomedical research.

## Structure
The PLXNA4 protein is a type I single-pass transmembrane receptor that plays a crucial role in semaphorin signaling. Its molecular structure includes a sema domain at the N-terminus of its extracellular region, which is responsible for binding semaphorins. This domain is followed by multiple PSI and IPT domains, which connect to the transmembrane helix (Lu2021Architecture). The extracellular region of PLXNA4 adopts a rigid, ring-like conformation, essential for its function and activation. This structure allows the membrane proximal IPT6 domains to converge, facilitating the formation of an active dimer necessary for signaling (Lu2021Architecture; Kong2016Structural).

The intracellular region of PLXNA4 contains a juxtamembrane region, a Rho GTPase-binding domain, and a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) domain, which are crucial for downstream signaling (Lu2021Architecture). PLXNA4 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and interactions. The protein forms a stable 2:2:2 complex with semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) and neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), which is necessary for effective signaling (Lu2021Architecture). The architecture of this complex is characterized by multiple interfaces that stabilize the assembly, with the sema domains of Sema3A and PLXNA4 and the a1 domain of Nrp1 forming the central part of the complex (Lu2021Architecture).

## Function
The PLXNA4 gene encodes Plexin-A4, a protein that plays a significant role in neural differentiation and axon guidance. It is part of the semaphorin signaling pathway, which is crucial for axon growth and guidance during neural development. Plexin-A4 is expressed on the surface of axon growth cones, where its activation leads to actin and microtubule destabilization, contributing to the contraction of growth cone protrusions (Cho2022Induction). This process is essential for proper neural circuit formation and neuron migration to synaptic organization (Cho2022Induction).

In human umbilical-cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs), PLXNA4 is involved in neural differentiation when exposed to low-intensity sub-sonic vibration (LISSV). This exposure increases PLXNA4 expression, leading to neuron-like morphological changes and the expression of neuron-related genes such as MAP2, NEUROD1, and NF-L (Cho2022Induction). The PLXNA4 protein also interacts with semaphorins, particularly SEMA3A, to mediate axon guidance and influence synaptic transmission (Cho2022Induction).

PLXNA4 is also involved in maintaining endothelial cell functions, crucial for vascular homeostasis. It supports endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and barrier integrity, indicating its role in maintaining vascular structure and function (Vreeken2021Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLXNA4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), PLXNA4 is associated with tau phosphorylation, a critical process in AD pathogenesis. The full-length isoform TS1 of PLXNA4 enhances tau phosphorylation, while shorter isoforms TS2 and TS3 inhibit it. Increased expression of TS1 is observed in late-stage AD, correlating with clinical dementia ratings and neuropathology (Jun2014PLXNA4). PLXNA4 is also linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), with rare variants such as p.Ser657Asn, p.Phe40Leu, and p.Arg302His identified in familial PD cases, suggesting a potential genetic contribution to the disease (Schulte2013Rare).

In cancer, PLXNA4 mutations and gene copy number alterations have been observed. In melanoma, PLXNA4 gene amplification is common, and specific mutations like p.H1736Y affect the receptor's ability to inhibit tumor cell migration, indicating a role in cancer progression (Balakrishnan2009Molecular). PLXNA4 has also been identified as a susceptibility locus for pulmonary embolism (PE), with the rs1424597 SNP associated with increased PE risk, highlighting its potential role in thrombosis-related conditions (Razzaq2021An). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PLXNA4 in various diseases, suggesting it as a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
PLXNA4 (plexin A4) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in neuronal signaling and Alzheimer's disease pathology. It acts as a receptor for clusterin (CLU), a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease risk. This interaction is significant in modulating cerebrospinal fluid levels of CLU and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology due to its role in learning and memory impairments (Kang2016Identification).

PLXNA4 also interacts with semaphorins, particularly Sema3A and Sema6A, which are involved in axon guidance. It forms receptor complexes with neuropilin-1 to propagate Sema3A signals, leading to growth cone collapse in neurons. This interaction is crucial for the propagation of semaphorin-induced inhibitory signaling in neurons (Suto2005PlexinA4; Suto2003Identification). The interaction between Sema6A and PLXNA4 involves a cis interaction that modulates the repulsive response to Sema6A, preventing the binding of Sema6A in trans (HaklaiTopper2010Cis).

PLXNA4 is also involved in autoinhibition through head-to-stalk cis-interactions, which regulate its activation and signaling. Disruption of these interactions can lead to receptor activation and signaling, highlighting the complexity of PLXNA4's regulatory mechanisms (Kong2016Structural).
