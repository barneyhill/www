# CD84

## Overview
CD84 is a gene that encodes a cell surface receptor protein belonging to the SLAM (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule) family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The CD84 protein is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in immune cell signaling and regulation. It is characterized by its ability to form homophilic dimers and is involved in various cellular interactions through its cytoplasmic domain, which contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) (Yan2007Structure; Cuenca2019CD84). CD84 is expressed on a wide range of immune cells, including T cells, B cells, macrophages, and mast cells, where it functions as an adhesion molecule and modulates immune responses. The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in autoimmune disorders and certain cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (ÁlvarezErrico2011CD84; Cuenca2019CD84).

## Structure
The CD84 protein is a member of the SLAM family and part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is a single-chain type-I glycoprotein with a molecular weight ranging from 64 to 82 kDa, indicating significant glycosylation (de1997CD84; Cuenca2019CD84). The protein's ectodomain consists of a non-canonical membrane-distal V-Ig domain and a membrane-proximal C2-Ig domain, forming a two-layer β-sandwich structure (Cuenca2019CD84). The V-Ig domain is characterized by front and back sheets composed of A'GFCC'C'' and BED strands, respectively, and lacks the typical disulfide bond found in canonical IgV domains (Yan2007Structure; Cuenca2019CD84).

CD84 forms homophilic dimers, primarily in a head-to-tail configuration, with a dissociation constant in the submicromolar range, indicating strong self-association (Yan2007Structure; Cuenca2019CD84). The dimer interface is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, with a buried surface area of approximately 1,460 Å² (Yan2007Structure). The protein's cytoplasmic domain contains several tyrosine residues involved in cell signaling, including immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) and an ITIM motif (Cuenca2019CD84). CD84 has multiple splice variants, with the most prevalent isoform lacking exon 5 (CD84Δ5) (Cuenca2019CD84).

## Function
CD84, a member of the SLAM family, is a cell surface receptor involved in immune cell signaling and regulation. It is broadly expressed on various immune cells, including T cells, B cells, macrophages, and mast cells, where it functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, binding to itself on adjacent cells (ÁlvarezErrico2011CD84; Cuenca2019CD84). In mast cells, CD84 negatively regulates the signaling pathways initiated by the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI), modulating the release of mediators involved in allergic responses. This regulation is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive allergic reactions (ÁlvarezErrico2011CD84).

CD84's inhibitory function in mast cells is mediated through its cytoplasmic domain, which contains tyrosine residues phosphorylated by kinases such as Lyn and Fes. This phosphorylation leads to the modulation of signaling pathways, including the Syk-LAT-PLCγ1 axis, reducing calcium mobilization and cytokine secretion (ÁlvarezErrico2011CD84). Beyond mast cells, CD84 is involved in T and B cell interactions, contributing to immune responses such as IFN-γ production and the formation of germinal centers in lymph nodes (ÁlvarezErrico2011CD84). CD84 also plays a role in autophagy regulation, acting as a positive regulator in dendritic cells (Cuenca2019CD84).

## Clinical Significance
The CD84 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and certain cancers. Alterations in CD84 expression or function have been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where elevated CD84 expression in CD4+ T cells is associated with disease pathogenesis. Targeting CD84 with monoclonal antibodies has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for SLE (Cuenca2019CD84). Polymorphisms in CD84 are also associated with lupus-like phenotypes in mice, indicating a genetic predisposition to autoimmune conditions (Wong2015B).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CD84 is upregulated in progressive cases and acts as a survival receptor, promoting CLL cell survival through interactions with the tumor microenvironment. This upregulation enhances CLL resistance to apoptosis, contributing to disease progression (Cuenca2019CD84). CD84's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in the retention of malignant cells in niches, with treatments like Ibrutinib and idelalisib shown to decrease CD84 expression in CLL cells (Cuenca2019CD84).

Additionally, CD84 polymorphisms have been linked to better responses to etanercept in psoriasis patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment efficacy in autoimmune diseases (Cuenca2019CD84).

## Interactions
CD84, a member of the SLAM family, engages in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in immune cell signaling. Its cytoplasmic domain contains tyrosine residues Y262 and Y299, which are part of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs). These residues are crucial for recruiting adaptor proteins such as SLAM-associated protein (SAP) and Ewing's sarcoma-associated transcript 2 (EAT-2) (BinskyEhrenreich2013CD84; Cuenca2019CD84). CD84 also interacts with enzymes containing SH2 domains, including SHP-2, SHP-1, Csk, and SHIP-1, which bind to phosphorylated tyrosines (Cuenca2019CD84).

CD84 forms homophilic dimers through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, facilitating T cell activation by bridging T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (Yan2007Structure). This homophilic interaction is crucial for CD84's role in stabilizing T:B cell interactions, which are essential for immune responses (Cuenca2019CD84).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, CD84's interaction with EAT-2 and subsequent phosphorylation of Akt enhances cell survival by increasing Bcl-2 expression (BinskyEhrenreich2013CD84; Cuenca2019CD84). CD84 also negatively regulates FcεRI signaling in mast cells through phosphorylation by the Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn, independent of SAP and EAT-2 (ÁlvarezErrico2011CD84).
