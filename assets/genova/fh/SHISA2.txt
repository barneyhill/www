# SHISA2

## Overview
SHISA2 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein shisa family member 2, which is involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by its signal peptide, cysteine-rich domain, transmembrane segment, and proline-rich C-terminal region, which contribute to its stability and function (Pei2012Unexpected). SHISA2 plays a crucial role in neural development by modulating the glycosylation and cell surface presentation of Frizzled3 (Fzd3), a receptor involved in Wnt/planar cell polarity signaling, thereby influencing axon guidance in the spinal cord (Onishi2017Sonic). Additionally, SHISA2 has been implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is associated with increased invasiveness, highlighting its potential significance in oncogenesis (Cheishvili2015A).

## Structure
SHISA2 is a transmembrane protein characterized by a signal peptide, an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, a transmembrane segment, and a proline-rich C-terminal region. The cysteine-rich domain features a specific pattern ('C*C*CC*C*CC*C') that is crucial for its function and may form disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability (Pei2012Unexpected). The transmembrane segment is predicted to be type I, with the C-terminal region residing in the cytosol (Pei2012Unexpected).

SHISA2 shares sequence features with other members of the Shisa1-3 subfamily, including longer insertions between conserved cysteines and a 'PxxxP' signature at the beginning of their predicted transmembrane segments. A subfamily-specific signature for SHISA2 is the cysteine pattern 'CCCRC' at the end of the predicted transmembrane domain (Pei2012Unexpected). 

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as lipid modifications near the C-termini, which stabilize the protein and aid in membrane trafficking (Liu2023Characteristics). SHISA2 also contains a type 2 PDZ-domain interacting signature at the C-terminus, which may influence its interactions and functions (Pei2012Unexpected). The presence of splice variant isoforms is not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
SHISA2 is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in regulating Wnt signaling pathways by modulating the glycosylation and cell surface presentation of Frizzled3 (Fzd3), a receptor involved in these pathways. In healthy cells, SHISA2 interacts with Fzd3, retaining it in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and preventing its glycosylation and subsequent transport to the cell surface. This interaction inhibits Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling by blocking Fzd3's glycosylation and trafficking, which is crucial for processes such as axon guidance during neural development (Onishi2017Sonic).

SHISA2's function is particularly significant in the context of commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord. It prevents pre-crossing commissural axons from responding to Wnt signals by regulating the cell surface expression of Fzd3. This regulation is essential for the proper anterior-posterior guidance of post-crossing commissural axons, ensuring accurate axon pathfinding during neural development (Onishi2017Sonic).

SHISA2 is primarily active in the ER and Golgi apparatus, where it affects protein maturation and trafficking, influencing cellular processes like embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis (Pei2012Unexpected).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SHISA2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. SHISA2 is overexpressed in several invasive tumor types, including breast, liver, and prostate cancers. In invasive breast ductal carcinoma, SHISA2 expression is higher compared to normal adjacent tissue, and similar overexpression is observed in hepatocellular carcinoma and prostate adenocarcinoma (Cheishvili2015A). The gene's elevated expression in these cancers suggests a role in cancer invasiveness, as its depletion in cancer cell lines leads to a significant reduction in invasiveness without affecting cell viability (Cheishvili2015A).

In the context of medulloblastoma, specifically the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subtype, SHISA2 is upregulated in mouse models but not in human SHH-MB samples, indicating a species-specific expression pattern. This discrepancy suggests that SHISA2 may not have the same clinical significance in human SHH-MB as it does in mouse models (Łastowska2019Differential).

SHISA2 is also involved in the regulation of axon guidance in the spinal cord, where it modulates the Wnt/PCP signaling pathway. Alterations in SHISA2 expression can affect axon pathfinding, although the clinical implications of these changes are not directly addressed in the context of human diseases (Onishi2017Sonic).

## Interactions
SHISA2 interacts with Frizzled3 (Fzd3), a receptor involved in Wnt signaling. SHISA2 inhibits the glycosylation and cell surface presentation of Fzd3 by retaining it in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), preventing its transport to the Golgi and cell surface. This interaction was demonstrated using co-immunoprecipitation, which showed that SHISA2 binds to the unmodified form of Fzd3, while not interacting with the insulin receptor, a control protein. Surface biotinylation assays confirmed that SHISA2 expression significantly decreases the cell surface level of Fzd3, and immunocytochemistry showed colocalization of Fzd3 with Calnexin, an ER marker, in the presence of SHISA2 (Onishi2017Sonic).

SHISA2 also interacts with components of the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathway. Knocking down SHISA2 leads to premature activation of Wnt-PCP signaling, which can be mitigated by the simultaneous knockdown of Vangl2, another component of the Wnt-PCP pathway. This suggests that SHISA2's role in axon guidance is linked to its interaction with the Wnt-PCP signaling pathway (Onishi2017Sonic).

Additionally, SHISA2 binds to fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3), although blocking FGFR activity does not affect the anterior-posterior guidance of commissural axons, indicating that these interactions may not be critical for this specific guidance process (Onishi2017Sonic).
