# EIF4E1B

## Overview
EIF4E1B is a gene that encodes the protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family member 1B, which is a non-canonical member of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) family. Unlike typical eIF4E proteins, which are primarily involved in the initiation of translation by binding to the mRNA cap and interacting with eIF4G, EIF4E1B exhibits distinct functional characteristics. It does not interact with eIF4G but instead has a strong affinity for eIF4ENIF1, a component of P-bodies, which are involved in mRNA regulation and storage. This unique interaction profile suggests that EIF4E1B plays a significant role in mRNA regulation, particularly during embryogenesis, by stabilizing and repressing maternal mRNAs. Additionally, EIF4E1B is involved in the repression of histone mRNAs and interacts with proteins such as SLBP and SLBP2, indicating its role in preventing premature translation during early developmental stages (Kubacka2013Investigating; LorenzoOrts2023eIF4E1b).

## Interactions
EIF4E1B, a non-canonical member of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E family, exhibits unique interaction characteristics compared to other class I eIF4Es. It binds to the mRNA cap but does not interact with the translation initiation factor eIF4G, which is essential for eIF4F-dependent translation initiation. Instead, EIF4E1B has a strong affinity for eIF4ENIF1, a component of P-bodies, which are involved in mRNA regulation and storage. This interaction is crucial for targeting EIF4E1B to P-bodies during embryogenesis, where it plays a role in stabilizing and repressing maternal mRNAs (LorenzoOrts2023eIF4E1b).

EIF4E1B also interacts with eIF4EBP1 and eIF4ENIF1, contradicting earlier reports of no binding to these sites. These interactions suggest a role in mRNA regulation rather than translation initiation. EIF4E1B is involved in the repression of histone mRNAs and interacts with stem loop binding proteins SLBP and SLBP2, indicating its role in preventing premature translation during early embryogenesis (LorenzoOrts2023eIF4E1b).

In addition, EIF4E1B is part of CPEB RNP complexes, where it interacts with proteins like Xp54 RNA helicase and 4E-T, forming structures similar to P-bodies. This interaction model suggests EIF4E1B inhibits translation by preventing eIF4G recognition of the cap structure (Kubacka2013Investigating).
