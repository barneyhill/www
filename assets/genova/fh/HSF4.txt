# HSF4

## Overview
HSF4 (heat shock factor 4) is a gene that encodes the heat shock transcription factor 4 protein, a member of the heat shock factor family. This protein functions as a transcriptional regulator, primarily involved in the development and maintenance of the ocular lens, as well as in various cellular processes such as DNA repair and stress response. HSF4 is characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper oligomerization domain, which facilitate its role in gene regulation (Syafruddin2021More; Nakai1997HSF4). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, notably HSF4a and HSF4b, which have distinct roles as a repressor and activator, respectively (Syafruddin2021More). Mutations in the HSF4 gene are linked to congenital and age-related cataracts, highlighting its clinical significance in eye health (Enoki2010DNAbinding). Additionally, HSF4's expression is implicated in various cancers, influencing tumor growth and prognosis through pathways such as AKT-mTOR (Syafruddin2021More).

## Structure
The human HSF4 protein is a member of the heat shock factor family and is characterized by several important structural domains. It contains a conserved N-terminal winged helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (DBD) located between amino acids 19 and 123, which is crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator (Syafruddin2021More; Nakai1997HSF4). The protein also features a leucine zipper oligomerization domain, consisting of two hydrophobic heptad repeats, HR-A and HR-B, between amino acids 130-203, which facilitate its oligomerization and DNA binding (Syafruddin2021More).

HSF4 lacks the HR-C domain found in other HSF family members, making it constitutively active and allowing it to exist in an oligomeric form in its native state (Syafruddin2021More; Nakai1997HSF4). The protein also includes two transactivation domains at the C-terminus, which are involved in recruiting transcription factors to regulate gene expression (Syafruddin2021More).

Post-translational modifications of HSF4 include phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitylation, and acetylation, which influence its activity and stability. Specific phosphorylation sites include S298, T471, and S491, while sumoylation occurs at K287 and K293, and ubiquitylation at K206 (Syafruddin2021More). HSF4 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with HSF4a and HSF4b being the primary ones, differing in their roles as a repressor and activator, respectively (Syafruddin2021More; Zhang2001Heat).

## Function
HSF4 (heat shock transcription factor 4) is a crucial regulator in various cellular processes, particularly in the development and maintenance of the ocular lens. It plays a significant role in lens epithelial cell homeostasis by interacting with lysosome and anti-apoptosis pathways, influencing lysosomal pH and DLAD expression, which affects cathepsin B and DNA hydrolysis activities (Cui2016Heat). HSF4 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes necessary for lens cell proliferation and differentiation, such as crystallins, which are major structural proteins in the lens (Syafruddin2021More). It also regulates the expression of heat shock proteins and is involved in DNA repair through the transcriptional regulation of RAD51 (Kovács2022Functional).

HSF4 has two isoforms, HSF4a and HSF4b, which have opposing roles; HSF4a acts as a transcriptional repressor, while HSF4b functions as an activator (Syafruddin2021More). The protein is constitutively active due to the absence of a C-terminal HR-C domain, allowing it to function beyond stress-responsive gene expression (Syafruddin2021More). HSF4's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, which influence its interaction with other proteins and its function as a transcriptional regulator (Syafruddin2021More).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HSF4 gene are associated with various eye disorders, particularly cataracts. Congenital cataracts, which can lead to childhood blindness, are linked to specific mutations in HSF4, such as A20D, R74H, I87V, L115P, R120C, and R176P. These mutations affect the DNA-binding ability of the HSF4b protein, leading to reduced expression of lens protein genes and cataract formation (Enoki2010DNAbinding). Age-related cataracts are also associated with mutations like Q62R and R117H, although these have a marginal effect on gene expression (Enoki2010DNAbinding).

In cancer, HSF4 expression varies across different types. It is upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and downregulated in glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, testicular germ cell cancer, thyroid cancer, and uterine carcinosarcoma. High expression in ccRCC and thyroid cancer correlates with a worse prognosis. In colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HSF4 influences cancer cell growth and metastasis through the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (Syafruddin2021More).

HSF4 also plays a role in olfactory epithelium cell genesis, where altered expression can impair olfactory sensory neuron maturation (Syafruddin2021More).

## Interactions
HSF4 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It specifically interacts with Heat Shock Factor 2 (HSF2) under unstressed conditions, but not with the HSF4b isoform. This interaction is reduced upon treatment with hemin, which causes both proteins to translocate to the nucleus. HSF4a inhibits HSF2 expression and activation, suggesting a regulatory role in HSF2-driven transcriptional activity (Kim2011Heat).

HSF4 forms a protein complex with ATP6V1A and mTORC1, crucial for maintaining lysosomal acidification in lens cells. It also recruits BRG1 to DNase 2β (DLAD) regulatory elements, transactivating DLAD expression essential for lens fiber cell denucleation (Syafruddin2021More). HSF4 interacts with p53, stabilizing it and facilitating its transcriptional activities, which are crucial for lens cell cycle arrest and differentiation (Syafruddin2021More).

BCAS2 negatively regulates HSF4 protein stability through ubiquitination, affecting the expression of HSF4 downstream target genes like CRYAB and BFSP1. This regulation is dose-dependent and requires the full-length BCAS2 protein (Liao2015BCAS2). HSF4 also interacts with fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), functioning as a transcriptional repressor for FGF1, FGF4, and FGF7 (Syafruddin2021More).
