# SC5D

## Overview
The SC5D gene encodes the enzyme sterol C5-desaturase, a crucial component of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme, categorized as an oxido-reductase, is responsible for the conversion of lathosterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol, a key precursor in cholesterol production (Furtado2016Disorders; Porter2015Electron). Sterol C5-desaturase is integral to maintaining cellular cholesterol levels, which are vital for cell membrane integrity and various signaling pathways (Porter2015Electron). The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, with significant expression in the liver and nervous system (Furtado2016Disorders). Mutations in SC5D can lead to lathosterolosis, a disorder marked by developmental and neurological impairments due to disrupted cholesterol synthesis (Herman2012Disorders). This underscores the enzyme's essential role in human health and cholesterol homeostasis.

## Function
The SC5D gene encodes the enzyme sterol C5-desaturase, which plays a critical role in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the desaturation of lathosterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol, a precursor to cholesterol, within the endoplasmic reticulum of cells (Furtado2016Disorders; Porter2015Electron). The proper function of sterol C5-desaturase is essential for maintaining cholesterol synthesis, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including the integrity of cell membranes and signaling pathways (Porter2015Electron).

SC5D is expressed in most human tissues, with particularly high levels in the liver, testis, prostate, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve (Furtado2016Disorders). The enzyme contains an iron-binding domain, four transmembrane domains, and an oxido-reductase domain with an NAD/NADP binding motif, indicating its complex structure and function in electron transfer processes (Furtado2016Disorders).

Deficiencies or mutations in the SC5D gene can lead to disorders such as lathosterolosis, characterized by developmental malformations and neurological deficiencies due to disrupted cholesterol synthesis (Herman2012Disorders). This highlights the enzyme's importance in healthy human cells and its role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SC5D gene, which encodes the enzyme sterol-C5-desaturase, lead to lathosterolosis, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of cholesterol biosynthesis. This condition is characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, limb anomalies, and variable liver involvement, ranging from normal function to severe fibrosis and cirrhosis (Yaplito‐Lee2020Successful; Herman2012Disorders). The disorder results from the accumulation of lathosterol due to impaired conversion to 7-dehydrocholesterol, a precursor of cholesterol (Herman2012Disorders).

Patients with lathosterolosis exhibit an 'SLOS-like' phenotype, similar to Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, with features such as skeletal abnormalities and liver disease (Herman2012Disorders). Genetic analysis has identified specific mutations, such as R29Q, G211D, and Y46S, which act as hypomorphs, leading to residual enzyme activity (Herman2012Disorders). Mouse models with targeted disruption of the Sc5d gene show similar phenotypic features, suggesting that the malformations are due to decreased cholesterol rather than the accumulation of sterol intermediates (Herman2012Disorders; Iwaya2024Craniofacial).

Treatment with simvastatin has been shown to lower plasma lathosterol levels and improve liver function and fibrosis, indicating that active treatment can prevent liver disease progression (Yaplito‐Lee2020Successful).
