# SLC25A35

## Overview
SLC25A35 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 35, which is part of the solute carrier family 25 (SLC25). This family is known for its role in the transport of small molecules across the mitochondrial membrane, a critical function for cellular metabolism and energy production. The SLC25A35 protein is characterized by its six transmembrane alpha-helices, which form a funnel-shaped structure essential for its transport activity (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). The gene's expression can result in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its function and link to mitochondrial dysfunction and disease (Babenko2018Altered). Despite its recognized role in mitochondrial transport, the detailed molecular mechanisms and broader physiological implications of SLC25A35 remain areas of active research.

## Structure
The SLC25A35 protein is a member of the solute carrier family 25, which is primarily involved in transporting small molecules across the mitochondrial membrane. Proteins in this family, including SLC25A35, are characterized by a tripartite structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices. These helices are arranged in a funnel-shaped structure, facilitating the transport of substrates between the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the matrix (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

The primary structure of SLC25A35 includes three homologous domains, each containing two hydrophobic regions separated by a hydrophilic sequence. This configuration is typical of the mitochondrial carrier family and contributes to the protein's ability to undergo conformational changes necessary for its transport function (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

SLC25A35 may also exhibit alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. This variability in isoforms is noted for its potential impact on the protein's function and its association with mitochondrial dysfunction and various diseases (Babenko2018Altered). However, the specific molecular structure of SLC25A35, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, remains less well-defined in the available literature.
