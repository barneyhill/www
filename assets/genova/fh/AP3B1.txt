# AP3B1

## Overview
The AP3B1 gene encodes the beta-3A subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), a critical component in the intracellular trafficking system of eukaryotic cells. This gene plays a pivotal role in the sorting and transport of membrane-associated proteins to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes and lytic granules. The protein encoded by AP3B1, known as adaptor-related protein complex 3 subunit beta 1, is integral to the formation and function of the AP-3 complex, which is involved in vesicle formation and cargo selection within the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments. The AP3B1 protein is categorized as an adaptor protein, facilitating interactions with various cellular partners to ensure proper protein localization and function. Mutations in the AP3B1 gene are linked to Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 2 (HPS2), a disorder characterized by pigmentation defects, bleeding diathesis, and immunodeficiency, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Clark2003Adaptor; Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak).

## Structure
The AP3B1 gene encodes the beta-3A subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is involved in the transport of proteins to lysosomes and related organelles. The C-terminal domain of the beta-3A subunit has an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold, consisting of 16 β-strands organized into two subdomains, A and B (Mardones2013Structural). This structural organization is crucial for the recognition of tyrosine-based sorting signals, such as the YXXØ motif, which binds to subdomain A in an extended conformation (Mardones2013Structural). The binding site on the beta-3A subunit is characterized by substantial polar interactions, including direct hydrogen bonds, which are essential for the specificity of the interaction (Mardones2013Structural).

The AP-3 complex, including the beta-3A subunit, is composed of four subunits: ∂, β3, µ3, and σ3 adaptins, forming a quaternary structure that facilitates its function in protein transport (de2017HermanskyPudlak). Mutations in the AP3B1 gene can lead to structural changes that affect the stability and expression of the AP-3 complex, as seen in Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 2 (HPS2), where mutations result in the near absence of the AP-3 complex (de2017HermanskyPudlak).

## Function
The AP3B1 gene encodes the β3A subunit of the adaptor-related protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is crucial for the intracellular trafficking of membrane-associated proteins in eukaryotic cells. This complex is involved in the sorting and transport of proteins to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles (LROs), such as melanosomes in melanocytes, dense granules in platelets, and lytic granules in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells (Jones2013Disruption; Dell’Angelica2009AP3dependent).

In healthy human cells, AP-3 facilitates the proper sorting and movement of lysosomal proteins, including CD63 and LAMP-1, to the lysosome compartment. This process is essential for maintaining normal cellular functions, such as pigmentation, immune response, and neuronal activities (Clark2003Adaptor). The AP-3 complex is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments, where it plays a role in vesicle formation and cargo selection (NewellLitwa2007Neuronal).

Deficiencies in AP3B1 can lead to mislocalization of proteins, affecting immune function and pigmentation, as seen in conditions like Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS2) (Jones2013Disruption; Clark2003Adaptor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AP3B1 gene are associated with Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome type 2 (HPS-2), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. HPS-2 is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and immunodeficiency due to neutropenia and T-lymphocyte dysfunction (Wenham2009Two; Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak). The AP3B1 gene encodes the β3A subunit of the adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), which is crucial for the proper sorting of transmembrane proteins to lysosomes. Mutations in this gene lead to functional impairments in cells with secretory lysosomes, such as melanocytes, platelets, and leukocytes (Wenham2009Two).

Clinical manifestations of HPS-2 include hypopigmentation, bleeding disorders, and a significant risk of developing interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in childhood (Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak). Immunodeficiency in HPS-2 results from dysfunction in T-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, leading to impaired cytotoxic activity (Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak). Neutropenia associated with AP3B1 deficiency is responsive to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy, although it does not prevent recurrent infections, indicating defects in innate immunity (Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak). Some individuals with AP3B1 mutations have developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which can be lethal (Huizing2020Hermansky–Pudlak).

## Interactions
The AP3B1 protein, a beta subunit of the AP-3 adapter protein complex, is involved in various protein-protein interactions. It interacts with the matrix (M) proteins of Nipah and Hendra viruses through its serine-rich and acidic Hinge domain. This interaction affects the association of M proteins with cellular membranes and inhibits the budding of virus-like particles (VLPs) (Sun2014Matrix). AP3B1 also interacts with kinesin family member 3A (Kif3A), a motor protein, through its non-motor domain. This interaction is negatively regulated by pyrophosphorylation mediated by inositol pyrophosphate (IP7), which weakens the interaction between AP3B1 and Kif3A, affecting the release of HIV-1 particles (Azevedo2009Inositol).

AP3B1 is also known to interact with rabip4, a protein involved in endosomal trafficking, and the FYVE domain of rabip4, which is important for lysosome distribution (Sun2014Matrix). These interactions suggest that the AP3B1 Hinge domain can bind to a variety of partners, potentially competing for the same binding site. AP3B1-derived polypeptides have been shown to inhibit the production of Nipah and Hendra VLPs, likely by disrupting M protein conformation or occupying M protein binding sites (Sun2014Matrix).
