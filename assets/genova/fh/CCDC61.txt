# CCDC61

## Overview
CCDC61 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 61 protein, also known as variable flagellar number 3 (VFL3). This protein is a member of the XRCC4 superfamily and is characterized by its N-terminal globular head domain and a parallel coiled-coil domain, which are essential for its structural and functional roles in cellular processes (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3). The CCDC61 protein is involved in centrosomal and ciliary functions, playing a critical role in the organization and function of the mitotic spindle, as well as in ciliogenesis. It interacts with various proteins, such as Cep170, to maintain microtubule stability and centrosome cohesion (Pizon2019hVFL3CCDC61; Bärenz2018Ccdc61). Mutations in the CCDC61 gene have been associated with cellular dysfunctions and potential disease implications, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular integrity (Feng2020Genetic).

## Structure
The CCDC61 protein, also known as variable flagellar number 3 (VFL3), is a paralog of SAS6 and a member of the XRCC4 superfamily. It is characterized by an N-terminal globular head domain and a parallel coiled-coil domain, which are crucial for its structural and functional roles (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3). The head domain contains a conserved sequence motif known as the PISA motif, which is critical for the function of XRCC4 superfamily members (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3).

The protein forms higher-order assemblies, including homodimers and oligomers, through its head and coiled-coil domains. These assemblies are important for its interaction with microtubules and its role in ciliary functions (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3). The coiled-coil domain is positively charged and interacts with the negatively charged C-terminal tails of tubulin, facilitating microtubule binding (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3).

CCDC61's structure was determined using X-ray crystallography, revealing a filament model with a left-handed 3-fold screw axis (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3). The protein's ability to form protofilaments and its interaction with microtubules are essential for its localization at basal bodies and its function in ciliogenesis (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3).

## Function
The CCDC61 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in centrosomal and ciliary functions in human cells. It is involved in the organization and function of the mitotic spindle, promoting microtubule nucleation and maintaining spindle symmetry during mitosis. This is essential for proper chromatin alignment and spindle assembly, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Bärenz2018Ccdc61). CCDC61 regulates the centrosomal anchorage of the microtubule-binding protein Cep170, which is vital for microtubule organization and stability (Bärenz2018Ccdc61).

CCDC61 is also a component of the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole, where it anchors microtubules, contributing to centrosome cohesion and positioning (Pizon2019hVFL3CCDC61). It interacts with proteins such as ninein and Cep170, playing a role in microtubule anchorage at subdistal appendages (Pizon2019hVFL3CCDC61).

In addition to its centrosomal functions, CCDC61 is involved in promoting ciliary functions. It localizes to basal bodies and is important for the structural organization and function of cilia, influencing ciliogenesis and the organization of basal body-associated structures (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC61 gene have been implicated in various cellular dysfunctions and potential disease associations. In a study involving a family with relapsing polychondritis (RP), whole-exome sequencing identified a specific mutation, rs777816675, in the CCDC61 gene. This mutation was present in two patients with RP but absent in healthy family members, suggesting a potential link between CCDC61 mutations and the disease (Feng2020Genetic).

CCDC61 is also involved in centrosomal functions, and its disruption can lead to defects in mitotic spindle assembly and chromatin alignment. The loss of CCDC61 affects the centrosomal anchorage of proteins like Cep170, which is crucial for microtubule stability and mitotic progression. These disruptions can result in chromatin alignment defects and prolonged mitotic phases, potentially contributing to diseases related to cell cycle dysregulation (Bärenz2018Ccdc61).

While specific diseases directly linked to CCDC61 mutations are not extensively documented, its role in ciliary functions and centrosomal processes suggests that alterations in CCDC61 could contribute to conditions involving ciliary dysfunctions and mitotic errors (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of CCDC61 mutations.

## Interactions
CCDC61, also known as hVFL3, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in centrosomal and ciliary processes. It interacts with the microtubule-binding protein Cep170, which is essential for microtubule stability and centrosomal localization. CCDC61 facilitates the anchorage of Cep170 at the centrosome, and its depletion leads to mislocalization of Cep170, affecting microtubule organization (Pizon2019hVFL3CCDC61; Bärenz2018Ccdc61). 

CCDC61 also interacts with PCM1 and Cep131, components of centriolar satellites, and is involved in their proper localization. The absence of CCDC61 results in the scattering of centriolar satellites within the cytoplasm, which can be rescued by re-expressing CCDC61 (Pizon2019hVFL3CCDC61). 

Additionally, CCDC61 binds to microtubules through its coiled-coil domain, which interacts with the C-terminal tails of tubulin. This interaction is crucial for its role in microtubule anchorage and organization (Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3). CCDC61's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in maintaining centrosome cohesion and positioning, as well as its involvement in ciliary functions (Pizon2019hVFL3CCDC61; Ochi2020CCDC61VFL3).
