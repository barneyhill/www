# CPEB4

## Overview
CPEB4, or cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability. The protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a zinc finger domain, which facilitate its interaction with mRNAs containing cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) (Schelhorn2014RNA). CPEB4 plays a pivotal role in cell cycle progression, particularly during mitosis, by modulating the translation of specific mRNAs through phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms (GuillénBoixet2016CPEB4). Additionally, CPEB4 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, where its expression and functional interactions can influence disease progression and prognosis (Shin2016Impaired; Hu2015Expression).

## Structure
CPEB4 is a protein characterized by its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a zinc finger domain, which are crucial for its RNA-binding capabilities. The protein contains two RRMs, RRM1 and RRM2, located in the conserved C-terminal region. RRM1 has a canonical αβ-sandwich structure, featuring an antiparallel arrangement of β-strands, and includes RNP1 and RNP2 motifs essential for RNA interactions. RRM2, although lacking the RNP1 consensus sequence, contributes to RNA binding in a non-canonical manner, possibly involving C-terminal residues (Schelhorn2014RNA).

The tandem RRM1-RRM2 domains form a continuous RNA-binding platform, enhancing RNA-binding affinity and specificity. This tandem arrangement does not alter the secondary structure of RRM1, which maintains its canonical fold (Schelhorn2014RNA). CPEB4 can exist in monomeric and dimeric forms, with dimerization occurring through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, independent of RNA binding (Schelhorn2014RNA).

CPEB4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with variations in the N-terminal region, which contains phosphorylation sites and a PEST degradation motif. These isoforms may impact the protein's function and regulation (Wang2010Comparative).

## Function
CPEB4 (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4) is a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability. It plays a significant role in cell cycle progression by regulating the translation of mRNAs containing cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs). During the M-phase of the cell cycle, CPEB4 is phosphorylated by ERK2 and Cdk1, which maintains it in a monomeric state, allowing it to drive the cytoplasmic polyadenylation of target mRNAs such as Cdc20, Spop, and Mnt (GuillénBoixet2016CPEB4). This regulation is essential for the temporal control of mRNA translation during mitosis (GuillénBoixet2016CPEB4).

CPEB4 is also involved in mitotic spindle localization and translational regulation, particularly during anaphase and cytokinesis. It activates the translation of mRNAs encoding factors necessary for these processes, such as PRC1, by binding to their mRNA and promoting their association with ribosomes (Pascual2020mRNA). CPEB4's activity is regulated by its ability to phase separate into liquid-like droplets, a process controlled by phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function in mRNA translation regulation (GuillénBoixet2016CPEB4).

## Clinical Significance
CPEB4 is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression or interactions. In cancer, CPEB4 is overexpressed in gliomas, particularly high-grade gliomas, and is associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis. It is suggested as an independent prognostic factor for glioma, potentially aiding in individualized treatment design (Hu2015Expression). CPEB4 is also upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, supporting tumor growth and vascularization (Fernández-Miranda2012The). In melanoma, CPEB4 is crucial for cell proliferation and is involved in regulating key oncogenic pathways, with its depletion leading to reduced tumor growth (Pérez-Guijarro2016Lineage-specific).

In neurological disorders, CPEB4 is linked to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Its low complexity domain can cause nucleolar stress and defects in rRNA processing, contributing to conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and other neurodegenerative diseases (Shin2016Impaired). In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), impaired mRNA splicing of CPEB4 is observed, affecting the translation of target mRNAs associated with ASD (Kozlov2021The).

CPEB4's expression varies across different cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor in some, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it is downregulated (Zeng2017Downregulated).

## Interactions
CPEB4 interacts with RNA through its tandem RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains, RRM1 and RRM2. These domains are crucial for binding to cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) containing mRNAs. The RRM1 and RRM2 domains do not function independently; instead, they work cooperatively to achieve high-affinity RNA binding. The RRM2 domain, despite having a degenerate RNP motif, enhances the RNA-binding surface and facilitates the correct orientation of the domains for effective RNA interaction (Schelhorn2014RNA). 

CPEB4 also forms dimers, although the predominant form in solution is monomeric. Dimerization is maintained through surface electrostatic and/or hydrophobic interactions and does not disrupt RNA binding, as both monomeric and dimeric forms can bind RNA (Schelhorn2014RNA).

In the context of astrocytic tumors, CPEB4 interacts with vimentin, a protein associated with cell structure and motility. This interaction is significant for tumor progression and poor prognosis. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry confirm the physical interaction between CPEB4 and vimentin, suggesting that CPEB4 regulates vimentin expression, which may contribute to the malignancy of astrocytic tumors (Chen2015CPEB4).
