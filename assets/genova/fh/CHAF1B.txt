# CHAF1B

## Overview
CHAF1B is a gene that encodes the chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit B, a protein integral to the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex. This protein is primarily involved in the assembly of nucleosomes during DNA replication and repair, playing a vital role in maintaining genomic stability. As a histone chaperone, chromatin assembly factor 1 subunit B facilitates the deposition of histones H3 and H4 onto newly synthesized DNA, a process essential for proper chromatin structure and epigenetic regulation. The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it interacts with other proteins such as ASF1A and PCNA to ensure efficient nucleosome assembly and DNA repair. CHAF1B's function is critical for cell proliferation and differentiation, and its dysregulation is associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2021The; Volk2015The; Wen2022Dynamic).

## Structure


## Function
CHAF1B, a subunit of the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex, plays a crucial role in nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair. It is involved in the deposition of histones H3 and H4 onto newly synthesized DNA, a process essential for maintaining genomic stability. CHAF1B interacts with the histone chaperone ASF1a to deliver H3/H4 dimers to the replication fork during the S phase of the cell cycle, facilitating the first step of nucleosome formation on newly synthesized DNA (Volk2015The).

The protein is active in the nucleus, particularly during the S phase, where it is essential for DNA replication-dependent nucleosome assembly. This process is critical for regulating epigenetic information and ensuring proper chromatin structure (Zhang2021The). CHAF1B is also involved in nucleotide excision repair, where it is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, aiding in the recruitment of repair complexes to damage sites (Volk2015The).

In healthy cells, CHAF1B is necessary for cell proliferation and differentiation, controlling chromatin recombination to promote cell cycle progression and influence cell proliferation and apoptosis (Peng2018CHAF1B). Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its association with chromatin and its role in DNA synthesis checkpoints (Volk2015The).

## Clinical Significance
CHAF1B is significantly overexpressed in various cancers, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis. In high-grade gliomas, melanomas, and several carcinomas, including prostatic, renal, cervical, and endometrial, CHAF1B overexpression is linked to increased metastasis, making it a potential prognostic marker (Wen2022Dynamic). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CHAF1B acts as an oncogene, with its knockdown reducing cell migration and invasion (Wen2022Dynamic). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high CHAF1B expression correlates with advanced disease stages, larger tumors, and shorter survival, indicating its role in tumor proliferation and resistance to apoptosis (Duan2019CHAF1B).

CHAF1B is also implicated in acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AKML) in Down syndrome patients, where it suppresses transcription factors involved in myeloid differentiation, contributing to leukemogenesis (Ivanov2019Overexpression). In squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and tongue, CHAF1B overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis (Lee2024Comparative). These findings suggest that CHAF1B's role in chromatin assembly and stability is crucial in cancer pathology, making it a potential therapeutic target for various aggressive tumors.

## Interactions
CHAF1B, a subunit of the chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) complex, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with CHAF1A and PCNA, which localizes to sites of DNA damage following UV irradiation, playing a crucial role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) synthesis (Volk2015The). CHAF1B also interacts with the histone chaperone ASF1A, facilitating the transport of newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 to the replication fork. This interaction is mediated through the B-like domains of CHAF1B, forming a β-hairpin that interacts with the β-sandwich structure of the ASF1A N-terminal core domain (Volk2015The).

CHAF1B is involved in the recruitment of ubiquitinated H2A (uH2A) to damage foci following UV-induced DNA damage, potentially due to the loss of an intact CAF-1 complex (Volk2015The). It also acts as a chaperone for protamines, which are histone-like proteins that compact chromatin in sperm DNA, with its homologue p75 in D. melanogaster responsible for protamine deposition during spermatogenesis (Volk2015The). CHAF1B's interactions extend to its role in regulating IFNα-inducible transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) by competing with transcription factors at specific DNA-binding sites (Saleiro2023Targeting).
