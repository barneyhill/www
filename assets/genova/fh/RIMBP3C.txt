# RIMBP3C

## Overview
RIMBP3C is a gene that encodes the RIMS binding protein 3C, a protein integral to the synaptic vesicle release machinery. This protein is characterized by its multiple domains, including SH3 domains, which facilitate interactions with other proteins involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle, thereby playing a crucial role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission (Mehrabipour2023A). As a component of the presynaptic terminal, RIMS binding protein 3C is essential for the precise regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, ensuring efficient neuronal communication. Beyond its role in synaptic function, RIMBP3C has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including colorectal cancer, where it is downregulated, and in genetic studies related to diabetes and 22q11.2 duplication syndrome (MosconaNissan2024Whole; Xiao2015Identification; Yu2019Genotypic).

## Function
RIMBP3C (RIMS binding protein 3C) is a crucial component of the synaptic vesicle release machinery, playing a significant role in regulating neurotransmitter release. This protein contains multiple domains that facilitate interactions with other proteins involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle, underscoring its importance in synaptic transmission and neuronal communication (Mehrabipour2023A). The presence of these domains allows RIMBP3C to engage with various components of the synaptic machinery, potentially influencing the efficiency and regulation of neurotransmitter release. This interaction is essential for maintaining proper neuronal function and signaling, as it ensures the precise release of neurotransmitters at synaptic junctions (Mehrabipour2023A).

RIMBP3C's involvement in the synaptic vesicle cycle highlights its role in the broader context of synaptic function, where it contributes to the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. This process is vital for efficient synaptic transmission, as it ensures that neurotransmitters are released in a controlled manner, facilitating communication between neurons. The protein's activity at the presynaptic terminal is crucial for the proper execution of these molecular processes, which are fundamental to the organismal outcomes of neural signaling and function (Mehrabipour2023A).

## Clinical Significance
RIMBP3C has been identified as a gene with altered expression in colorectal cancer (CRC). In a study by Xiao et al., RIMBP3C was found to be significantly downregulated in both colon cancer and rectal cancer compared to normal tissues, with a more pronounced downregulation in colon cancer (-15.01-fold) than in rectal cancer (-1.04-fold) (Xiao2015Identification). This suggests that RIMBP3C may play a role in the molecular mechanisms of CRC, although its specific clinical significance in cancer progression or prognosis remains unclear.

In the context of diabetes, RIMBP3C has been associated with genetic variants in non-Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (non-MODY) groups, which include Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and healthy controls. The gene harbored variants exclusive to this group, indicating a potential role in the genetic landscape of T2DM, although it was not exclusive to any specific diabetes type (MosconaNissan2024Whole).

RIMBP3C is also mentioned in the context of 22q11.2 microduplications, which can lead to 22q11.2 duplication syndrome. It was part of the additional region carried by a patient with severe congenital abnormalities, though the study did not provide specific information on the clinical significance of RIMBP3C mutations in this condition (Yu2019Genotypic).

## Interactions
RIMBP3C is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is part of the synaptic vesicle release machinery and plays a role in regulating neurotransmitter release. The SH3 domains within RIMBP3C are essential for mediating these interactions, allowing it to bind with multiple partner proteins involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle (Mehrabipour2023A).

In the context of cancer, RIMBP3C has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in colorectal cancer, where it is downregulated. Although specific interactions in this context are not detailed, the study emphasizes the importance of understanding protein interactions to elucidate regulatory mechanisms in colorectal cancer (Xiao2015Identification).

RIMBP3C is also noted for its interaction with the protein IIIG9, a regulatory subunit that interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) isoforms. This interaction suggests potential roles for RIMBP3C in physiological and pathological processes, including the regulation of phosphatases (Oviedo2022Is).

In renal cell carcinoma, RIMBP3C has been implicated in sunitinib resistance and tumor progression, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Peng2021Key).
