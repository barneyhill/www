# IRF4

## Overview
IRF4, or interferon regulatory factor 4, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the IRF family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune system development and function. The protein product, also named IRF4, is characterized by its DNA-binding domain and IRF association domain, which facilitate its function as a transcriptional regulator. IRF4 is crucial in the differentiation and function of B and T lymphocytes, influencing processes such as T-cell receptor signaling and B-cell maturation. It forms complexes with other transcription factors, such as PU.1 and BATF, to modulate gene expression. Clinically, IRF4 is significant due to its involvement in various hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where its dysregulation contributes to disease pathogenesis (Huber2014IRF4; Maffei2022The). Additionally, mutations in IRF4 are linked to immune disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis (Fornes2023A).

## Structure
IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) is a transcription factor with a complex molecular structure. It consists of two main domains: a highly conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) and a C-terminal IRF association domain (IAD), connected by a flexible linker (Sundararaj2021Structural; Sundararaj2021Molecular). The DBD features an α/β structural architecture with three α-helices and four anti-parallel β-sheets forming a helix-turn-helix motif, characterized by five conserved tryptophan residues essential for DNA recognition (Sundararaj2021Structural; Sundararaj2021Molecular). The IAD adopts a modified MH2 fold typical of the SMAD family, with a predominance of β-sheets and a sickle-like shape (Remesh2015Structural; Sundararaj2021Molecular).

IRF4 can form homodimers or heterodimers with other transcription factors, such as PU.1, SPIB, or BATF, influencing its DNA binding affinity and regulatory functions (Sundararaj2021Molecular). The protein's quaternary structure involves these dimeric interactions, which are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation (Sundararaj2021Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, modulate IRF4's interaction with DNA and its binding partners (Sundararaj2021Molecular). The presence of a flexible autoinhibitory region in the IAD regulates DNA interaction by binding to the DBD, maintaining the protein in an autoinhibited state until interaction with binding partners occurs (Remesh2015Structural).

## Function
IRF4 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the differentiation and function of various immune cells, particularly B and T lymphocytes. In T cells, IRF4 is rapidly induced upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation and is expressed across all known T-cell subsets. Its expression levels correlate with the strength of TCR signaling, influencing the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T-cells into T helper cell subsets such as Th2, Th9, Th17, and Tfh cells, as well as effector regulatory T (eTreg) cells (Huber2014IRF4). IRF4 also plays a crucial role in the differentiation and function of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, affecting their expansion, effector phenotype, and memory formation (Huber2014IRF4).

In B cells, IRF4 is involved in development, affinity maturation, and terminal differentiation. It interacts with transcription factors like PU.1 to regulate gene expression, and its absence leads to defective B cell maturation and reduced immunoglobulin levels (Hagman2017Critical). IRF4 also plays a role in the genomic programming of Langerhans cells, a type of dendritic cell, where it regulates antigen processing and presentation, balancing immune activation and homeostasis (Sirvent2020Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the IRF4 gene are implicated in various hematological malignancies. In multiple myeloma (MM), IRF4 is often overexpressed due to chromosomal translocations, such as t(6;14)(p25;q32), and activating mutations, which are crucial for the survival of MM cells. The IRF4-MYC feedback loop is essential for maintaining the malignant phenotype in MM (Maffei2022The; Yanai2012The). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), particularly the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype, IRF4 overexpression is linked to aberrant NF-κB activation, and its downregulation can mimic the effects of lenalidomide, a drug that inhibits NF-κB (Maffei2022The; Yanai2012The).

IRF4 also plays a role in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), where it is upregulated by TCR, CD28, and NF-κB signaling pathways. Mutations such as K59R and L70V in IRF4 are associated with disease progression in ATL (Cherian2018An). In Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), the IRF4-C99R mutation alters DNA-binding properties, contributing to oncogenic transformation (Schleussner2023Transcriptional).

Additionally, the IRF4 T95R mutation causes a combined immunodeficiency, characterized by impaired B-cell maturation and increased susceptibility to infections (Fornes2023A). These findings underscore the diverse roles of IRF4 in various malignancies and immune disorders.

## Interactions
IRF4 (interferon regulatory factor 4) is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune cell regulation. In T cells, IRF4 interacts with NFATc2 to enhance the transcriptional activation of the IL-4 promoter, a process crucial for IL-4 gene expression. This interaction is specific to IRF4, as IRF8 does not associate with NFATc2 or enhance IL-4 transcriptional activity (Rengarajan2002Interferon). The interaction between IRF4 and NFATc2 is facilitated by a COOH-terminal region of IRF4, which is predicted to form an α-helix (Rengarajan2002Interferon).

In B cells, IRF4 forms complexes with the Ets family transcription factor PU.1. This interaction is essential for regulating gene expression, with IRF4 binding to DNA in conjunction with PU.1 to form a ternary complex (Sundararaj2021Molecular; Brass1999Assembly). IRF4 can also interact with BATF and JUN in T cells, forming heterodimeric complexes that bind to AP-1/IRF composite elements (AICEs), which are crucial for transcriptional regulation in Th17 cells (Li2012BATF–JUN). These interactions highlight IRF4's role in modulating gene expression through both direct DNA binding and protein-protein interactions.
