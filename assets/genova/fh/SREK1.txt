# SREK1

## Overview
SREK1, or Serine/Arginine-Rich Splicing Factor 1, is a gene that encodes the protein splicing regulatory glutamic acid and lysine rich protein 1. This protein is categorized as a serine and arginine-rich (SR) protein, which plays a crucial role in RNA splicing and regulation. SREK1 is involved in the modulation of splicing events by interacting with other proteins and nucleic acids, thereby influencing the assembly of spliceosomes and the regulation of alternative splicing. The protein's interactions are significant in the context of various diseases, including Huntington's disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression levels and splicing variants have been linked to disease pathogenesis and progression (Hernández2020Pathogenic; Chang2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SREK1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Huntington's disease. In HCC, the aberrant upregulation of the exon 10-inclusive variant of SREK1, known as SREK1 L, acts as an oncogenic driver. This upregulation is mediated by the splicing regulator SRSF10, which promotes the inclusion of exon 10 in SREK1, leading to increased expression of SREK1 L in tumor tissues. The presence of SREK1 L is associated with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival in HCC patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chang2022The).

In Huntington's disease, a decrease in SREK1 expression has been observed, which mimics the effects seen in X-linked dystonia parkinsonism by lowering TAF1 levels. This reduction in SREK1 expression is linked to striatal atrophy and motor symptoms in Huntington's disease models. Overexpression of SREK1 in transgenic mice has been shown to correct TAF1 deficiency and alleviate these symptoms, indicating that SREK1 dysregulation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (Hernández2020Pathogenic).

## Interactions
SREK1, a serine and arginine-rich protein, is involved in RNA splicing and regulation. It interacts with other proteins and nucleic acids to modulate splicing events. SREK1 is known to interact with SRSF6, another SR protein, which binds mutant huntingtin (mHTT) CAG repeat RNA in Huntington's disease. This interaction is crucial for maintaining SREK1 protein stability, as interference with SRSF6 leads to decreased levels of SREK1 and TAF1 proteins (Hernández2020Pathogenic). 

SREK1 also forms complexes with splicing factors and may interact with RNA-binding proteins, influencing the assembly of spliceosomes and the regulation of alternative splicing. In the context of Huntington's disease, SREK1 overexpression in transgenic mice corrects TAF1 deficiency, suggesting a role in modulating gene expression patterns associated with the disease (Hernández2020Pathogenic). 

Additionally, SREK1 has been identified as an RNA-binding protein involved in RNA splicing and mRNA processing. It was found among the top hits in a study using CRUIS, a tool for capturing RNA-protein interactions, highlighting its role in RNA-centric studies (Zhang2020Capturing). These interactions underscore SREK1's significant influence on RNA processing and its potential impact on various diseases.
