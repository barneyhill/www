# NANP

## Overview
The NANP gene encodes the enzyme N-acetylneuraminic acid phosphatase, which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) enzyme family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of sialic acids by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of Neu5Ac 9-phosphate to produce free sialic acid, a key component in various biological processes such as cell-cell interactions and pathogen recognition (Willems2019Activity). Despite its involvement in sialic acid biosynthesis, NANP activity is not deemed essential for de novo synthesis, indicating the presence of alternative compensatory pathways (Willems2019Activity). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to the production of CMP-sialic acid, which is crucial for the sialylation of glycoconjugates in the Golgi apparatus (Willems2019Activity). The dispensability of NANP in certain contexts underscores the complexity and redundancy of metabolic pathways in cellular homeostasis (Willems2019Activity).

## Function
N-acetylneuraminic acid phosphatase (NANP) is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of sialic acids, which are important for various biological functions, including cell-cell interactions and pathogen recognition. NANP catalyzes the dephosphorylation of Neu5Ac 9-phosphate to yield free sialic acid, a crucial step in the sialic acid biosynthesis pathway (Willems2019Activity). Despite its role in this pathway, studies have shown that NANP activity is not essential for de novo sialic acid biosynthesis, suggesting the existence of alternative pathways that can compensate for its function (Willems2019Activity).

In healthy human cells, NANP is part of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) enzyme family, which is known for its substrate specificity and some degree of substrate promiscuity (Willems2019Activity). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the production of CMP-sialic acid, a substrate for the sialylation of glycoconjugates in the Golgi apparatus (Willems2019Activity). Although NANP is traditionally considered essential for sialic acid synthesis, its dispensability in certain contexts highlights the complexity and redundancy of metabolic pathways in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Willems2019Activity).
