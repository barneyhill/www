# POLRMT

## Overview
POLRMT is a gene that encodes the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase, a single-subunit enzyme crucial for mitochondrial transcription and DNA replication. This enzyme is responsible for transcribing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into RNA, a process essential for mitochondrial function and energy production. The RNA polymerase mitochondrial protein, categorized as a polymerase, plays a pivotal role in synthesizing RNA primers necessary for mtDNA replication and interacts with various transcription factors and components of the mitochondrial replication machinery to facilitate these processes. POLRMT's activity is vital for the production of mitochondrial mRNAs, rRNAs, and tRNAs, which are necessary for mitochondrial protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. Mutations in the POLRMT gene have been associated with several neurological disorders and have implications in cancer biology, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2022The; Miranda2022Starting; Oláhová2021POLRMT).

## Structure
The POLRMT protein, responsible for mitochondrial transcription, is a single-subunit RNA polymerase with a molecular weight of approximately 134 kDa, consisting of 1230 amino acids (Arnold2012Human). It is composed of several distinct regions: the N-terminal extension (NTE), the N-terminal domain (NTD), and the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Arnold2012Human). The CTD, spanning residues 648-1230, resembles a cupped right hand with 'fingers', 'palm', and 'thumb' subdomains, crucial for catalytic activity and DNA binding (Basu2020Structure; Arnold2012Human). The palm subdomain contains key structural motifs and invariant aspartic acids essential for catalysis (Arnold2012Human).

The NTD, consisting of residues 369-647, is structurally similar to the promoter-binding domain of phage RNA polymerases and includes elements for promoter recognition (Arnold2012Human). The NTE includes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain and a mitochondrial targeting sequence, playing a role in transcriptional initiation through interactions with transcription factors like TFAM and TFB2M (Oláhová2021POLRMT; Bouda2019Mechanisms).

POLRMT undergoes large-scale conformational changes during transcription initiation and mtDNA replication, with the N-terminal extension acting as a 'tether helix' to anchor the active site near the transcription start site (Oláhová2021POLRMT). The protein's structure is flexible, particularly in the N-terminal domain, which becomes more ordered upon complex assembly with other transcription factors (Yakubovskaya2014Organization).

## Function
POLRMT, the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase, plays a crucial role in mitochondrial transcription and DNA replication. It is the sole RNA polymerase in mammalian mitochondria, responsible for transcribing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into RNA, which is essential for mitochondrial function, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Miranda2022Starting; Oláhová2021POLRMT). POLRMT synthesizes RNA primers necessary for mtDNA replication, particularly at the OriL site, acting as a primase for lagging-strand synthesis (Oláhová2021POLRMT; Wanrooij2008Human).

In healthy human cells, POLRMT interacts with transcription factors such as TFAM and TFB2M to initiate transcription from mitochondrial promoters. This process involves forming a complex at the promoter region, followed by transcription elongation facilitated by the transcription elongation factor TEFM (Miranda2022Starting). POLRMT's activity is essential for the production of mitochondrial mRNAs, rRNAs, and tRNAs, which are necessary for mitochondrial protein synthesis and energy production (Arnold2012Human).

POLRMT also plays a role in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis, independent of its transcriptional function, by interacting with h-mtTFB1 to enhance 12S rRNA methylation, which is crucial for the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes (Surovtseva2013Transcriptionindependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLRMT gene, which encodes the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, have been linked to a variety of neurological diseases. These mutations can impair mitochondrial transcription, leading to conditions such as developmental delays, speech and intellectual disabilities, hypotonia, short stature, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (Oláhová2021POLRMT). Specific mutations, like the Δ881-3 variant, have a dominant negative effect on transcription dynamics, while others, such as P810S and R1013C, result in a near-complete loss of transcription in vitro (Oláhová2021POLRMT).

Alterations in POLRMT expression levels are also significant in cancer. In skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), POLRMT is overexpressed, promoting cell growth and survival. Its depletion leads to reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2022The). Similarly, in prostate cancer, POLRMT overexpression enhances cancerous activities, while its inhibition impairs mitochondrial functions and reduces tumor growth (Li2023Identification).

In breast cancer patients treated with epirubicin, a single nucleotide variant near POLRMT is associated with increased risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, highlighting its role in mitochondrial function and potential impact on cardiac health (VelascoRuiz2021POLRMT).

## Interactions
POLRMT, the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate mitochondrial transcription and replication. It requires the assistance of transcription factors TFAM and TFB2M to initiate transcription. TFAM binds to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), inducing structural changes that allow POLRMT to recognize and bind to promoters. TFB2M then facilitates the melting of the DNA promoter, enabling transcription initiation (Gaspari2004The; Bouda2019Mechanisms).

During transcription elongation, POLRMT interacts with the transcription elongation factor TEFM, which enhances its processivity by increasing its affinity for DNA. TEFM acts as a sliding clamp, binding near the RNA exit channel of POLRMT, and is crucial for overcoming transcriptional termination and facilitating the bypass of oxidative lesions (Bouda2019Mechanisms).

POLRMT also plays a role in mtDNA replication by generating RNA primers necessary for replication initiation. It interacts with the replication machinery, including mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLγ), the helicase TWINKLE, and single-stranded DNA binding protein 1 (SSBP1), to facilitate this process (Kühl2016POLRMT). These interactions highlight POLRMT's central role in coordinating mitochondrial transcription and replication.
