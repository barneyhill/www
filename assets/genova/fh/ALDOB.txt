# ALDOB

## Overview
The ALDOB gene encodes the enzyme aldolase B, a key player in fructose metabolism, primarily expressed in the liver, kidney, and small intestine. Aldolase B is a tetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible cleavage of fructose 1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde, which are further metabolized in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways (Ali1998Hereditary). This enzyme is crucial for the proper metabolism of dietary fructose, and its deficiency leads to hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a condition characterized by the accumulation of toxic intermediates due to impaired fructose metabolism (Chang2018Roles; Ali1998Hereditary). Beyond its metabolic role, aldolase B interacts with various proteins, influencing cellular processes such as tumor suppression and Wnt signaling (He2020Loss; Caspi2014Aldolase). Mutations in the ALDOB gene, such as p.Ala150Pro, are linked to HFI, necessitating early diagnosis and dietary management to prevent severe organ damage (Pinheiro2021Epidemiological; Ferri2012Integration).

## Structure
The ALDOB protein, also known as aldolase B, is a crucial enzyme in fructose metabolism, primarily expressed in the liver. Its primary structure is composed of a 364-amino acid polypeptide chain encoded by exons 2-9 of the ALDOB gene (Esposito2010Hereditary). The secondary structure of ALDOB includes local folding patterns such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context (Esposito2010Hereditary). The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape of a single polypeptide chain, which is sensitive to temperature changes. The A149P mutation in ALDOB affects the tertiary structure, leading to decreased stability, but the presence of glycine can help restore stability by shifting the melting temperature closer to that of the wild-type protein (Stopa2011Stabilization).

The quaternary structure of ALDOB is a tetramer formed by four identical monomers, which is essential for its enzymatic function (Esposito2010Hereditary). The A149P mutation disrupts this structure, causing the enzyme to predominantly exist as a dimer, but glycine can shift it back to a tetrameric form, enhancing thermal stability (Stopa2011Stabilization). The enzyme's quaternary structure is crucial for its function, as mutations affecting this level can lead to hereditary fructose intolerance (Stopa2011Stabilization).

## Function
The ALDOB gene encodes the enzyme aldolase B, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of fructose in human cells. Aldolase B is primarily active in the liver, kidney, and small intestine, where it catalyzes the reversible cleavage of fructose 1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde. These products are then further metabolized in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, contributing to energy production and glucose synthesis (Ali1998Hereditary).

In healthy cells, aldolase B is essential for the proper metabolism of dietary fructose, preventing the accumulation of toxic intermediates. The enzyme's activity is regulated by dietary intake, with increased expression following a carbohydrate-rich diet, which enhances its role in fructose metabolism (Ali1998Hereditary). The enzyme is a tetramer with a central active site pocket crucial for substrate binding, and it is involved in the movement of substrates in and out of its barrel structure (Ali1998Hereditary).

Aldolase B's function is vital for maintaining normal fructose metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to hereditary fructose intolerance, a condition characterized by the inability to properly metabolize fructose (Chang2018Roles; Ali1998Hereditary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALDOB gene are primarily associated with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition arises from a deficiency in the aldolase B enzyme, which is crucial for metabolizing fructose in the liver, kidney, and intestine. Individuals with HFI experience symptoms such as hypoglycemia, abdominal pain, vomiting, and liver dysfunction after consuming fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol. If untreated, HFI can lead to severe liver and kidney damage, potentially resulting in liver cirrhosis and death, especially in infants (DavitSpraul2008Hereditary; SanchezGutierrez2002Molecular; Ferri2012Integration).

The most common mutations in the ALDOB gene associated with HFI include p.Ala150Pro, p.Ala175Asp, and p.Asn335Lys, which account for a significant proportion of cases worldwide (Pinheiro2021Epidemiological; Ferri2012Integration). These mutations lead to a loss of enzyme activity, resulting in the accumulation of toxic metabolites in the liver. Early diagnosis and management through a fructose-free diet are critical to prevent the progression of symptoms and organ damage (Santer2005The; Esposito2010Hereditary). Genetic testing is essential for accurate diagnosis and management of the condition (Ferri2012Integration).

## Interactions
ALDOB, or aldolase B, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ALDOB forms a complex with Akt and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), acting as a scaffold to facilitate the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) by PP2A. This interaction suppresses Akt activity, which is crucial for its tumor-suppressive function in HCC (He2020Loss). The loss of ALDOB disrupts this complex, leading to increased Akt activity and promoting tumor growth (He2020Loss).

ALDOB also interacts with GSK-3β, a component of the β-catenin degradation complex, in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction enhances Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription by disrupting the GSK-3β-Axin interaction, which is necessary for the regulation of the Wnt pathway (Caspi2014Aldolase). In colon adenocarcinoma, ALDOB interacts with DNA repair-related proteins, affecting DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathways and apoptosis. Overexpression of ALDOB impairs MMR by downregulating MLH1 and is associated with increased apoptosis through the regulation of proteins like Bcl-2 and p53 (Lian2019Aldolase).
