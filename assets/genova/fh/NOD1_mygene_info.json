"This gene encodes a member of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) family of proteins. The encoded protein plays a role in innate immunity by acting as a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) that binds bacterial peptidoglycans and initiates inflammation. This protein has also been implicated in the immune response to viral and parasitic infection. Major structural features of this protein include an N-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD), a centrally located nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), and 10 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in its C terminus. The CARD is involved in apoptotic signaling, LRRs participate in protein-protein interactions, and mutations in the NBD may affect the process of oligomerization and subsequent function of the LRR domain. Mutations in this gene are associated with asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, Behcet disease and sarcoidosis in human patients.
