# ETNK1

## Overview
ETNK1 (ethanolamine kinase 1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme ethanolamine kinase 1, which is a critical component of the phospholipid biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a kinase due to its role in catalyzing the phosphorylation of ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine, a key step in the Kennedy pathway for synthesizing phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, essential constituents of cell membranes (Fontana2020ETNK1). The activity of ethanolamine kinase 1 is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial complex II activity and preventing excessive reactive oxygen species production (Fontana2020ETNK1). Mutations in the ETNK1 gene have been linked to various hematological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing oxidative stress (Lasho2015Novel; Fontana2020ETNK1).

## Structure
ETNK1 (ethanolamine kinase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine, an essential component of cell membranes. The primary structure of ETNK1 is defined by its specific amino acid sequence, which determines its functional properties. The secondary structure of ETNK1 includes common elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function.

The tertiary structure of ETNK1 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is critical for its enzymatic activity. This folding allows the protein to form specific domains, such as kinase domains, which are essential for its role in catalyzing the phosphorylation of ethanolamine. The quaternary structure of ETNK1 may involve the assembly of multiple subunits, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context.

ETNK1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions with other cellular components. Additionally, ETNK1 may exist in different splice variant isoforms, leading to variations in its functional properties and potentially affecting its role in cellular processes. These structural and functional characteristics underscore the importance of ETNK1 in maintaining cellular membrane integrity and function.

## Function
ETNK1 (ethanolamine kinase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the phosphorylation of ethanolamine to phosphoethanolamine (P-Et), a key step in the Kennedy pathway. This pathway is the primary metabolic route for synthesizing phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), two of the most abundant phospholipids in cell membranes (Fontana2020ETNK1). In healthy cells, ETNK1 ensures the proper concentration of P-Et, which is essential for optimal mitochondrial respiratory activity and the function of ubiquinone (Fontana2020ETNK1).

ETNK1 activity is critical for maintaining normal mitochondrial function by regulating mitochondrial complex II activity. P-Et acts as a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a component of complex II, thereby modulating mitochondrial activity and preventing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Fontana2020ETNK1). This regulation is vital for preventing DNA damage and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Fontana2020ETNK1).

The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to membrane integrity and cell signaling by facilitating the production of phospholipids, which are essential components of cell membranes (Fontana2020ETNK1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ETNK1 gene have been implicated in several hematological disorders, including systemic mastocytosis (SM) with eosinophilia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML). These mutations are often associated with significant eosinophilia in SM patients and are found in 6% of SM cases and 14% of CMML cases (Lasho2015Novel). The mutations identified, such as N244S, N244T, N244K, and G245A, affect the kinase domain of ETNK1 and are predicted to disrupt its function (Lasho2015Novel).

ETNK1 mutations lead to decreased enzymatic activity, resulting in reduced intracellular phosphoethanolamine (P-Et) levels. This reduction causes mitochondrial hyperactivation and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, contributing to a mutator phenotype characterized by increased DNA damage and genomic instability (Fontana2020ETNK1). The mutator phenotype can be reversed by treatment with P-Et or tigecycline, which normalizes mitochondrial activity and ROS production (Fontana2020ETNK1). These findings suggest that ETNK1 mutations may play a role in the pathogenesis of these hematological disorders by promoting oxidative stress and clonal evolution (Fontana2020ETNK1).
