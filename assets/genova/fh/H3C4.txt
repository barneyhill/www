# H3C4

## Overview
The H3C4 gene encodes the H3 clustered histone 4 protein, a variant of the histone H3 family, which plays a pivotal role in the structural organization of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. As a core component of the nucleosome, the H3 clustered histone 4 protein is integral to the packaging of DNA, facilitating the compaction necessary for efficient DNA replication, repair, and transcriptional regulation (Yang2023The). The gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential function in maintaining chromosomal stability and regulating gene expression (Yang2023The). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as methylation and acetylation, which are crucial for modulating chromatin dynamics and epigenetic regulation (Yang2023The). Additionally, the H3C4 gene is implicated in clinical contexts, including its association with pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and aging-related processes, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Yang2023The; Huang2023bamSliceR:).

## Structure
The H3C4 gene encodes a variant of histone H3, which is a core component of the nucleosome involved in the packaging of DNA into chromatin. The primary structure of histone H3, including H3C4, is highly conserved across species, with a sequence similarity of 90.51% between humans, mice, and Drosophila (Yang2023The). This conservation suggests a critical role in maintaining chromosomal stability and gene expression regulation (Yang2023The).

The secondary structure of histone H3 typically involves alpha helices, which contribute to the formation of the histone fold. This fold is crucial for the tertiary structure, facilitating interactions with DNA. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of histone H3 with other histones, such as H2A, H2B, and H4, to form nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin.

Histone H3, including the H3C4 variant, undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation. These modifications play significant roles in chromatin dynamics and gene expression regulation (Yang2023The). The H3C4 gene's involvement in epigenetic regulation and nucleosome assembly underscores its importance in cellular processes and its potential impact on aging and longevity (Yang2023The).

## Function
The H3C4 gene encodes a member of the histone H3 family, which is integral to the structure and function of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. Histones, including those encoded by H3C4, are responsible for packaging DNA into nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin. This packaging is crucial for DNA compaction and plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, DNA replication, and repair processes (Yang2023The; Zhang2023Exploring).

H3C4 is a replication-dependent histone, meaning its expression is tightly linked to DNA synthesis during the cell cycle. It is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, influencing which genes are active or silenced at any given time. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular identity and function (Yang2023The).

The protein encoded by H3C4 also contributes to nucleosome assembly and telomere organization, which are vital for chromosomal stability. Proper telomere maintenance is associated with aging and longevity, highlighting the gene's role in these processes (Yang2023The). The conservation of H3C4 across species such as humans, mice, and fruit flies underscores its fundamental role in these cellular and organismal functions (Yang2023The).

## Clinical Significance
The H3C4 gene, a member of the histone H3 family, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in chromatin structure and gene expression. In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations in histone genes, including H3C4, have been identified. The H3K27M mutation, found in histone genes such as H3C4, is associated with chemoresistance and aggressive disease progression in some pediatric AML patients. This mutation is clonal and contributes to the refractory nature of the disease, highlighting its clinical significance in AML (Huang2023bamSliceR:).

In addition to its role in cancer, the H3C4 gene is involved in aging-related processes. The interaction between tRNA-derived small RNA tRF-Trp-CCA-014 and H3C4 suggests a regulatory mechanism that may influence aging and cellular senescence. This interaction affects H3C4 mRNA and protein levels, indicating a potential role in chromosomal stability and aging-related signaling pathways (Yang2023The). The regulatory role of tRF-Trp-CCA-014 on H3C4 expression is further supported by evidence of its binding to the H3C4 3' UTR, affecting gene expression in aged cells (Yang2023The).

## Interactions
The H3C4 gene encodes a histone protein that is part of the histone H3 family, which plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation. H3C4 is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, which are fundamental units of chromatin that regulate DNA accessibility. The protein interacts with DNA to form these nucleosomes, acting as a negative regulator for DNA access, but can be displaced by polymerases and remodeling complexes (Patwal2021Histone).

H3C4 also participates in interactions with tRNA-derived fragments, specifically tRF-Trp-CCA-014. This interaction occurs at the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the H3C4 mRNA, as demonstrated by a dual luciferase reporter gene assay. The binding of tRF-Trp-CCA-014 to the H3C4 3' UTR results in the modulation of H3C4 protein levels, with mimics of tRF-Trp-CCA-014 increasing and inhibitors decreasing H3C4 protein expression in mouse NIH3T3 cells (Yang2023The). This interaction suggests a regulatory role of tRF-Trp-CCA-014 on H3C4 expression, potentially impacting cellular processes related to aging and gene expression (Yang2023The).
