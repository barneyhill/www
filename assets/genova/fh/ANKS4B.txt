# ANKS4B

## Overview
ANKS4B is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and sterile alpha motif domain containing 4B, which is integral to the structural and functional organization of the brush border in enterocytes. This protein is categorized as a structural component due to its role in the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), where it facilitates the assembly and maintenance of microvilli, enhancing nutrient absorption and providing a barrier function in the intestine (Graves2020A; Crawley2016ANKS4B). The ANKS4B protein is characterized by its ankyrin-repeat domain, which aids in protein-protein interactions, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is involved in oligomerization and localization to the brush border (Graves2020A; Crawley2016ANKS4B). Disruptions in ANKS4B expression or function can lead to significant clinical implications, including intestinal pathologies and increased susceptibility to viral infections (Lin2020ANKS4B; Crawley2016ANKS4B).

## Structure
The ANKS4B protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its structural and functional properties. It contains an N-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain (ANKRmin), a central unstructured region, and a C-terminal sterile α-motif (SAM) ending in a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) (Graves2020A). The ankyrin-repeat domain is known for its helix-loop-helix structure, which facilitates protein-protein interactions (Crawley2016ANKS4B). The SAM domain is involved in oligomerization, a key aspect of the protein's quaternary structure (Graves2020A).

The ANKS4B protein also features a coiled-coil (CC) motif and a basic-hydrophobic-basic (BHB) membrane-binding repeat sequence within its LK segment, which are crucial for its targeting to the brush border of enterocytes (Graves2020A). The BHB motif is characterized by two basic sequences separated by a hydrophobic sequence, which associates with acidic phospholipids as unstructured membrane-binding sites (Graves2020A).

The protein's CEN domain interacts with Myosin-7b, while the SAM-PBM domain binds with high affinity to USH1C, another component of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) (Graves2020A). These interactions are essential for the protein's role in stabilizing the mature adhesion complex in enterocytes.

## Function
The ANKS4B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and maintenance of the brush border in enterocytes, which are cells lining the intestine. This protein is a key component of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), essential for organizing microvilli into tightly packed arrays that enhance nutrient absorption and provide a barrier function in the intestine (Graves2020A; Crawley2016ANKS4B). ANKS4B is targeted to the apical microvilli of enterocytes through a cryptic sequence that includes a coiled-coil motif and a basic-hydrophobic repeat sequence, which are necessary for its localization and function (Graves2020A).

In healthy cells, ANKS4B interacts with other IMAC components, such as USH1C and Myosin-7b, forming a stable tripartite complex that is crucial for the structural integrity of the brush border (Crawley2016ANKS4B). The protein's ankyrin repeat domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, while its sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain is involved in its localization to the brush border (Crawley2016ANKS4B). Loss of ANKS4B disrupts microvillar organization, leading to disorganized and less dense microvilli, highlighting its critical role in maintaining intestinal health (Graves2020A; Crawley2016ANKS4B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the ANKS4B gene can have significant clinical implications. The L48P mutation in the ANKR domain of ANKS4B disrupts its folding, leading to impaired targeting to the brush border in enterocytes. This mutation is relevant to Usher syndrome, a condition characterized by sensory dysfunction, suggesting that similar mutations in ANKS4B could affect microvillar adhesion and contribute to intestinal pathologies (Crawley2016ANKS4B).

Altered expression of ANKS4B has been linked to severe inflammatory enteropathy. In USH1C knockout mice, the absence of ANKS4B and Myo7b from apical microvilli results in severe brush border assembly defects, which are associated with inflammatory enteropathy and intractable diarrhea in patients with USH1C genetic defects (Graves2020A).

ANKS4B also plays a role in viral infections. During Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, ANKS4B expression is downregulated, leading to increased viral replication. This suggests that ANKS4B acts as a restriction factor against ZIKV, and its downregulation may facilitate viral proliferation (Lin2020ANKS4B). The gene's involvement in autophagy modulation further underscores its potential impact on viral pathogenesis (Lin2020ANKS4B).

## Interactions
ANKS4B is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC) in enterocytes. It interacts with other IMAC components, specifically MYO7B and USH1C, forming a stable tripartite complex essential for the organization of microvilli during brush border assembly (Crawley2016ANKS4B). The interactions between ANKS4B and MYO7B are dependent on activation by USH1C, indicating a hierarchical binding mechanism (Crawley2016ANKS4B). 

ANKS4B contains a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (PBM) that interacts with USH1C, which is crucial for its apical targeting in intestinal microvilli (Graves2020A). The NPDZ1 tandem of USH1C interacts with the SAMPBM tandem of ANKS4B with strong binding affinity, while the CEN region of ANKS4B binds to the N-terminal MyTH4-FERM domain of MYO7B (He2019Myosin). These interactions facilitate the formation of condensed molecular assemblies via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), which is important for the structural stability of microvilli (He2019Myosin).

ANKS4B also exhibits oligomerization properties, as demonstrated by the formation of oligomers similar to the Myo10 CC motif (Graves2020A). This oligomerization is independent of direct interactions with other known IMAC components (Graves2020A).
