# ULBP3

## Overview
ULBP3 (UL16 binding protein 3) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the MHC class I-related family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system. The protein, also known as UL16 binding protein 3, functions as a ligand for the NKG2D receptor, a critical component in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells. This interaction is essential for the immune system's ability to identify and eliminate stressed, infected, or transformed cells, such as tumor cells. ULBP3 is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, facilitating its stable presence on the cell surface. The expression of ULBP3 is typically low in healthy cells but can be upregulated in response to cellular stress or damage, enhancing immune surveillance and response. The protein's role in immune modulation and its involvement in diseases such as cancer highlight its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (López‐Cobo2015Transfer; Poggi2004Vδ1; Kubin2001ULBP1).

## Structure
ULBP3 (UL16 binding protein 3) is a member of the MHC class I-related family of proteins and serves as a ligand for the NKG2D receptor on natural killer (NK) cells. The protein is characterized by an immunoglobulin-like domain structure, which is typical of its family. ULBP3 is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which facilitates its stable insertion into the plasma membrane (López‐Cobo2015Transfer). 

Post-translational modifications of ULBP3 include glycosylation, which is crucial for its stability and function. This modification is common among proteins in the MHC class I-related family and plays a significant role in maintaining the protein's structural integrity and biological activity (Kubin2001ULBP1). 

ULBP3 does not form multimeric complexes, indicating that it lacks a quaternary structure. This suggests that ULBP3 functions as a monomer when interacting with the NKG2D receptor on NK cells (Kubin2001ULBP1). The protein's structure and modifications are essential for its role in immune response modulation, particularly in the activation of NK cells and the enhancement of cytotoxic activities.

## Function
ULBP3 (UL16 binding protein 3) is a member of the NKG2D ligand family, which plays a crucial role in immune surveillance by activating natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells. It binds to the NKG2D receptor, a key component in the immune system's ability to detect and eliminate stressed, infected, or transformed cells. ULBP3 is typically expressed on the cell surface and can be upregulated in response to cellular stress, infection, or transformation, thereby enhancing the immune system's capacity to recognize and target abnormal cells (Rager2013DNA; Kubin2001ULBP1).

In healthy human cells, ULBP3 expression is generally low but can be induced under conditions of cellular stress or damage, facilitating the recognition and destruction of potentially harmful cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes. This process is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the development of diseases such as cancer (Rager2013DNA). ULBP3's interaction with the NKG2D receptor on NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes is essential for the activation of these immune cells, leading to increased cytokine production, proliferation, and cytotoxic activity, which are critical for effective immune responses against tumors and viral infections (Kubin2001ULBP1).

## Clinical Significance
ULBP3 (UL16 binding protein 3) plays a significant role in the immune response against B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) by interacting with the NKG2D receptor on Vδ1 T lymphocytes. Alterations in ULBP3 expression can impact disease progression and prognosis in B-CLL patients. The expression of ULBP3 on leukemic B cells is up-regulated by trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), enhancing the recognition and cytotoxic activity of Vδ1 T cells against these cells (Poggi2004Vδ1). Low expression of ULBP3 is associated with unfavorable prognostic factors, such as the presence of CD38 and unmutated IgVH genes, leading to disease progression (Poggi2004Vδ1). Conversely, high ULBP3 expression correlates with favorable prognostic factors and disease stability (Poggi2004Vδ1).

The presence of soluble MIC-A, another ligand for NKG2D, can inhibit Vδ1 T-cell function by occupying the NKG2D receptor, which may impair the immune response against B-CLL. Soluble MIC-A is often detected in patients with poor prognostic markers and low Vδ1 T-cell counts, further complicating the disease outcome (Poggi2004Vδ1). These findings suggest that targeting ULBP3 expression could be a potential therapeutic strategy in managing B-CLL (Poggi2004Vδ1).

## Interactions
ULBP3 (UL16 binding protein 3) is a ligand for the NKG2D receptor, which is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. This interaction is crucial for the activation of NK cells, leading to the destruction of stressed or transformed cells, such as tumor cells (Kubin2001ULBP1). ULBP3 can be transferred from target cells to NK cells through a process called trogocytosis, which involves the acquisition of membrane fragments and proteins by NK cells. This transfer is dependent on cell-cell contact and results in the stable insertion of ULBP3 into the plasma membrane of NK cells (López‐Cobo2015Transfer). 

The interaction between ULBP3 and the NKG2D receptor is not only important for NK cell activation but also for the regulation of immune responses. ULBP3 can be retransferred to other NK cells, suggesting a mechanism for immune response modulation (López‐Cobo2015Transfer). Additionally, ULBP3 is involved in the immune response against viral infections, as it can bind to the human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein UL16, which may help the virus evade the host immune system by inhibiting ULBP-mediated activation of NK cells (Kubin2001ULBP1).
