# ITGA1

## Overview
The ITGA1 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 1, a critical component of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion and signaling. The protein product, integrin subunit alpha 1, forms a heterodimer with the beta 1 subunit to create the integrin α1β1 complex, which functions primarily as a receptor for extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and laminin. This interaction is pivotal in various physiological processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and signaling, which are essential for tissue integrity and repair. The integrin α1β1 complex is involved in numerous cellular pathways, influencing cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Dysregulation of ITGA1 expression has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Li2020Integrin; Su2024Elevated; Cheli2007Transcriptional).

## Structure
The ITGA1 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 1, which is part of the integrin family of transmembrane receptors involved in cell adhesion and signaling. The primary structure of ITGA1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of ITGA1 is characterized by a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail. This structure allows ITGA1 to interact with extracellular matrix components and transmit signals across the cell membrane.

In its quaternary structure, ITGA1 pairs with the beta 1 subunit to form the α1β1 integrin heterodimer, which is crucial for its role in ligand binding and cell adhesion. The protein contains specific domains, such as the I-domain, which is essential for binding to ligands like collagen. Common post-translational modifications of ITGA1 include glycosylation, which can affect its stability and interactions. Splice variant isoforms of ITGA1 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties and interactions within the cell (Cheli2007Transcriptional).

## Function
The ITGA1 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 1, which pairs with beta 1 to form the integrin α1β1 complex. This protein functions as a receptor for collagen and laminin, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. Integrin α1β1 is primarily active in the extracellular matrix and cell membrane, where it mediates interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix, contributing to processes such as wound healing and tissue remodeling (Cheli2007Transcriptional).

In healthy human cells, ITGA1 is involved in cell adhesion, which is essential for maintaining tissue structure and function. The integrin α1β1 complex facilitates cell-matrix interactions that are critical for cellular communication and signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, migration, and survival (Li2020Integrin). These interactions are vital for normal physiological processes, including the maintenance of tissue integrity and repair mechanisms.

The transcriptional regulation of ITGA1 involves epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, which can modulate its expression during cell differentiation. For instance, ITGA1 is selectively suppressed in the megakaryocyte lineage through CpG methylation, indicating its role in cell differentiation processes (Cheli2007Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ITGA1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ITGA1 is overexpressed, leading to the activation of the Ras/Erk signaling pathway, which promotes cell proliferation, survival, and tumor invasiveness. This overexpression is associated with increased tumor growth and progression, making ITGA1 a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in CRC (Li2020Integrin).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ITGA1 is significantly upregulated and is linked to poor prognosis. It plays a crucial role in cell survival, migration, and therapy resistance, particularly against gemcitabine, a standard PDAC treatment. ITGA1's interaction with collagen is essential for these processes, contributing to the metastatic progression of PDAC. Its expression is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the viability of tumorigenic stem-like cells, highlighting its role in cancer progression and therapy resistance (Gharibi2017ITGA1).

In individuals with type 2 diabetes, elevated ITGA1 levels are associated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). High ITGA1 levels correlate with left ventricular remodeling and impaired diastolic function, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cardiac dysfunction in these patients (Su2024Elevated).

## Interactions
ITGA1, also known as integrin subunit alpha 1, forms a heterodimer with the beta 1 subunit to create the integrin α1β1 complex. This integrin is involved in various interactions with extracellular matrix proteins, particularly collagen, which is crucial for cell adhesion and signaling. In the context of cancer, ITGA1 interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and src kinase, forming a signaling complex that promotes cancer cell invasion. This interaction is facilitated by the clustering of α1-integrins, which recruits the FAK/src signaling complex, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways such as p130Cas and JNK (Van2007Activation).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ITGA1 interacts with collagen and TGFβ, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and therapy resistance. This interaction is distinct from other integrin-collagen interactions and is crucial for maintaining viable mesenchymal populations necessary for metastasis (Gharibi2017ITGA1).

In glioma, ITGA1 is involved in temozolomide resistance through its interaction with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction is modulated by hsa_circ_0110757, which sponges hsa-miR-1298-5p, leading to increased ITGA1 expression and activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Li2021Hsacirc0110757).
