# PTPRJ

## Overview
Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ) is a gene that encodes the protein DEP-1, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. DEP-1 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its single-pass, type I structure, and is involved in the dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target proteins. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, and adhesion, by modulating signaling pathways through its interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases and other cellular components (Sacco2012PTPRJ; Li2022The). PTPRJ is expressed in a wide range of cell types and is essential for processes such as angiogenesis and platelet function. Its clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in diseases such as cancer and inherited thrombocytopenia, where alterations in PTPRJ expression or function can lead to pathological outcomes (Smart2012Expression; Marconi2019Lossoffunction).

## Structure
The PTPRJ gene encodes the protein DEP-1, a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. DEP-1 is a single-pass, type I transmembrane protein with a molecular weight of 200-250 kDa. Its structure includes a 35-residue signal peptide, a 940-residue extracellular region, a 21-residue helical transmembrane domain, and a 341-amino acid intracellular tail. The extracellular portion contains nine fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats and 34 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, with glycosylation confirmed at seven asparagine residues (Sacco2012PTPRJ). The protein has a single catalytic domain at the carboxy-terminus, which is typical of subtype R3 phosphotyrosine phosphatase receptors (R3 RPTPs) (Chicote2017Phosphotyrosine).

DEP-1 can dimerize through its transmembrane domain, although it is monomeric in solution as shown by sedimentation velocity measurements (Sacco2012PTPRJ). The protein is involved in dephosphorylating tyrosine residues, playing significant roles in cellular processes such as cell growth and differentiation (Chicote2017Phosphotyrosine). The evolutionary origin of R3 RPTPs, including PTPRJ, is traced back to the common ancestor of animals, with diversification occurring in deuterostomes (Chicote2017Phosphotyrosine).

## Function
Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ), also known as DEP-1, is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in regulating cell metabolism, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins (Sacco2012PTPRJ; Li2022The). PTPRJ acts as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by dephosphorylating JAK2, which inhibits leptin signaling, and is involved in maintaining NFATc1 expression during osteoclastogenesis, promoting bone-resorbing osteoclast maturation (Li2022The).

PTPRJ is expressed in various cell types, including fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, epithelial cells, hematopoietic cells, and neurons, and is essential for angiogenesis during embryonic development (Sacco2012PTPRJ; Li2022The). It regulates angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and migration by negatively regulating the activity of several protein tyrosine kinases, such as PDGFR, HGFR, EGFR, VEGFR2, and RET (Li2022The; Ortuso2013Discovery). PTPRJ also plays a role in platelet function by dephosphorylating Src family kinases, which is crucial for platelet activation and production (Li2022The; Marconi2019Lossoffunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTPRJ gene have been implicated in several diseases. In breast cancer, PTPRJ acts as a tumor suppressor, with its expression often reduced or mislocalized in tumors. This reduction is associated with poorer survival rates and loss of tissue architecture, contributing to cancer progression (Smart2012Expression). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), decreased PTPRJ expression is linked to worse prognosis, and its regulation is influenced by the pVHL-HIF axis (Casagrande2013The).

PTPRJ mutations also cause a novel form of inherited thrombocytopenia, characterized by small platelets and defective platelet responses. These mutations lead to impaired megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production, resulting in symptoms like spontaneous bleeding and easy bruising (Marconi2019Lossoffunction).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PTPRJ acts as a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, including FLT3. Mutations affecting PTPRJ's oligomerization can restore its phosphatase activity, counteracting oncogenic signaling and reducing leukemic cell proliferation (Schwarz2022Disrupting). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PTPRJ in various cancers and blood disorders.

## Interactions
PTPRJ, also known as CD148, is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), where it acts as a negative regulator by dephosphorylating these receptors, thereby attenuating their signaling pathways (Li2022The; Ortuso2013Discovery).

PTPRJ also interacts with components of the Src family kinases, modulating their activity. It activates Src family members by dephosphorylating the negative regulatory carboxyterminal phosphotyrosine, which is crucial for platelet function and other cellular processes (Smart2012Expression; Marconi2019Lossoffunction). In the context of cancer, PTPRJ is involved in dephosphorylating ERK1/2, impacting cell proliferation and migration (Ortuso2013Discovery).

Additionally, PTPRJ interacts with proteins involved in cell adhesion, such as VE-cadherin, influencing cell-cell signaling and adhesion dynamics (Li2022The). These interactions highlight PTPRJ's role as a critical regulator in various signaling pathways, making it a potential therapeutic target for diseases like cancer and metabolic disorders.
