# ASB4

## Overview
The ASB4 gene encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 4, which is a member of the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box (ASB) family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by tagging specific proteins for degradation. The ASB4 protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a C-terminal SOCS box that is essential for forming a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Li2011Ankyrin; Ferguson2007ASB4). ASB4 is notably involved in vascular development and differentiation, particularly during early embryonic stages, and interacts with various proteins, including the Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), to modulate cellular responses to oxygen levels (Ferguson2007ASB4). Additionally, alterations in ASB4 expression have been linked to certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Miyamoto2018The; Au2014Expression).

## Structure
The ASB4 protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains and a C-terminal SOCS box. The ankyrin repeats, numbering nine in total, are involved in protein-protein interactions and form helix-loop-helix motifs, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Li2011Ankyrin). These repeats are crucial for binding to specific substrates, such as the Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), with AR6 and AR7 being particularly important for this interaction (Ferguson2007ASB4). The SOCS box domain is involved in forming a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets proteins for degradation (Li2011Ankyrin; Ferguson2007ASB4).

The primary structure of ASB4 includes conserved residues such as E244, V245, N246, and A247, with asparagine 246 being hydroxylated by FIH in an oxygen-dependent manner (Ferguson2007ASB4). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of ankyrin repeats and the SOCS box, which are essential for its function and interactions (Ferguson2007ASB4). Although the quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, the interaction with FIH suggests a complex formation (Ferguson2007ASB4). ASB4 may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which could affect its functional roles (Li2011Ankyrin).

## Function
The ASB4 gene encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by tagging specific proteins for degradation. This process is essential for regulating various cellular activities, particularly in vascular development and differentiation. ASB4 is highly expressed in the vascular lineage during early embryonic development, especially in Flk1-positive cells, which are precursors to endothelial and other vascular-related cells (Ferguson2007ASB4). 

ASB4 promotes trophoblast differentiation by targeting the degradation of the inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (ID2), a protein known for its anti-differentiation role. By ubiquitinating ID2, ASB4 facilitates its proteasomal degradation, thereby promoting the expression of differentiation markers in trophoblast stem cells (TownleyTilson2014The). This activity is crucial for proper placental development and vascular differentiation, as evidenced by the immature vascular patterning observed in ASB4-deficient models (TownleyTilson2014The).

ASB4 also interacts with the factor inhibiting HIF1α (FIH) and is subject to hydroxylation, which is oxygen-dependent. This interaction suggests that ASB4 may modulate vascular differentiation in response to oxygen levels, coordinating endothelial differentiation or maturation during development (Ferguson2007ASB4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ASB4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In colorectal cancer, ASB4 is significantly overexpressed in cancer stem cells (CSCs) compared to non-CSCs and normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with the potential for ASB4 to serve as a target for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunotherapy, as it allows for the selective targeting of tumorigenic CSCs, which are resistant to conventional therapies and responsible for tumorigenesis and relapse (Miyamoto2018The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, ASB4 is overexpressed in a significant portion of tumors, with 54% of cases showing more than a twofold increase in expression. This upregulation is associated with metastatic properties, such as enhanced cell migration and invasion. The expression of ASB4 in HCC is regulated by microRNA-200a, which can bind to the 3' untranslated region of ASB4 and reduce its levels, affecting cell migration and invasion (Au2014Expression).

ASB4 also plays a role in vascular differentiation, where its expression is regulated by oxygen levels. It is involved in the formation of vascular precursors and commitment to the vascular lineage, suggesting its importance in early blood vessel formation (Ferguson2007ASB4).

## Interactions
ASB4 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 4) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. ASB4 interacts with Insulin Receptor Substrate 4 (IRS4) in hypothalamic neurons, where it mediates the degradation of IRS4 through a mechanism involving the SOCS box, which facilitates polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Li2011Ankyrin). This interaction affects insulin signaling pathways, potentially influencing food intake regulation (Li2011Ankyrin).

ASB4 also interacts with G-protein pathway suppressor 1 (GPS1), inhibiting c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activity and modulating insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation (Li2007Akyrin). This interaction occurs in the cytosol and does not require the SOCS box, indicating a novel mechanism (Li2007Akyrin).

In vascular development, ASB4 interacts with Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), acting as a hydroxylation substrate in an oxygen-dependent manner, which promotes vascular differentiation (Ferguson2007ASB4). ASB4 also functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacting with ID2 to mediate its degradation, which is crucial for regulating ID2 protein levels in placental cells (TownleyTilson2014The).
