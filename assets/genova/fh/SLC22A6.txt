# SLC22A6

## Overview
The SLC22A6 gene encodes the protein known as organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), which is a member of the solute carrier family 22. This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a critical role in the renal excretion of organic anions, including drugs, toxins, and endogenous metabolites. OAT1 is primarily expressed in the kidneys, where it facilitates the uptake of organic anions into proximal tubule cells, contributing to their elimination from the body (Nigam2018The; Bhatnagar2006Analyses). Structurally, OAT1 is characterized by a 12-transmembrane alpha-helical topology, typical of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters, and undergoes conformational changes to transport substrates (Perry2006A; Volk2013OCTs). The protein's function is essential for maintaining homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful substances, impacting interorgan communication and metabolic pathways (Nigam2018The; Nigam2015The).

## Structure
The SLC22A6 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), which is a member of the solute carrier family 22. The protein is characterized by a 12-transmembrane alpha-helical topology, typical of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters (Perry2006A; Tsigelny2011Conformational). These helices are arranged with 2-fold symmetry, forming a central binding cavity that is crucial for substrate recognition and transport (Perry2006A). 

The tertiary structure of OAT1 includes a large cleft accessible from the aqueous phase, with an inner cavity containing interaction sites for various substrates (Volk2013OCTs). The protein undergoes conformational changes, including outward-open and inward-open states, which facilitate the transport cycle (Volk2013OCTs). 

Specific residues, such as Tyr 230, Lys 431, and Phe 438, are important for substrate interaction and transport, as demonstrated by mutational studies (Perry2006A). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are common in the SLC22 family and may play a role in oligomerization and transporter activity regulation (Volk2013OCTs).

## Function
The SLC22A6 gene encodes the organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), which is primarily expressed in the kidneys, specifically on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells. OAT1 plays a crucial role in the renal excretion of a wide variety of organic anions, including drugs, toxins, and endogenous metabolites. It functions as a major basolateral transporter, facilitating the uptake of organic anions like para-aminohippurate (PAH) into proximal tubule cells, which is essential for their elimination from the body (Nigam2018The; Bhatnagar2006Analyses).

OAT1 operates as a secondary active transporter, exchanging organic anions with dicarboxylates such as α-ketoglutarate, driven by the sodium gradient established by the Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase (Koepsell2013The; Yee2021Emerging). This transport mechanism is critical for maintaining homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful substances. OAT1 is also involved in the transport of signaling molecules and metabolites, impacting interorgan communication and metabolic pathways (Nigam2018The; Nigam2015The).

In addition to its role in drug and toxin excretion, OAT1 is implicated in the transport of uric acid, prostaglandins, and other compounds, contributing to the regulation of various physiological processes (Koepsell2013The; Vávra2022Functional). Its activity is essential for the detoxification processes and overall renal function in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC22A6 gene, which encodes the organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), have significant clinical implications. Variants in SLC22A6 can affect drug pharmacokinetics, potentially leading to altered drug efficacy and increased risk of nephrotoxicity. For instance, the R50H variant has been associated with decreased affinity for nucleoside phosphonate analogs such as adefovir, cidofovir, and tenofovir, which may influence the risk of drug-induced nephrotoxicity (Bleasby2005Functional; Cheong2011Screening).

In patients with gout and hyperuricemia, rare variants like p.P104L and p.A190T have been identified, although they do not significantly impact uric acid transport. However, the p.R149C variant in the related transporter OAT3 (SLC22A8) significantly reduces uric acid transport, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism between these transporters (Vávra2022Functional).

Alterations in the expression of SLC22A6 can also occur in various pathological conditions, such as endotoxemia and renal insufficiency, leading to decreased OAT1 abundance and altered drug excretion (Koepsell2013The). These changes can result in drug-drug interactions and impact the safety and efficacy of medications in affected individuals.

## Interactions
SLC22A6, also known as OAT1, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in renal excretion and drug clearance. OAT1 has been shown to form homo-oligomers, which are detected as double-sized bands on western blots. This oligomerization is reduced in the presence of a TMD6 peptide, which affects its cell membrane expression and substrate uptake (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). The GXXXG motifs in transmembrane domains 1 and 5 are essential for OAT1 expression, and mutations in these motifs can lead to a loss of expression at the plasma membrane (Zhang2019Proteinprotein).

OAT1 also interacts with cytoskeletal proteins such as β-actin and myosin, which are involved in lipid raft formation, influencing its function (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). These interactions are important for the proper localization and stabilization of OAT1 at the cell membrane, facilitating its role in the transport of organic anions. The presence of cholesterol in the plasma membrane can also affect OAT1's function, indicating that its activity is modulated by the lipid environment (Zhang2019Proteinprotein). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern the activity of SLC22A6 in the kidney.
