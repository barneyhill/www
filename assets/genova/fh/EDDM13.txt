# EDDM13

## Overview
The EDDM13 gene encodes the epididymal protein 13, which is primarily expressed in the male reproductive system, particularly within the epididymis. This protein is believed to play a crucial role in sperm maturation and fertility, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Epididymal protein 13 is categorized as a secretory protein, contributing to the complex milieu of the epididymal fluid that is essential for the acquisition of sperm motility and fertilization capability. The gene's expression and regulation are of significant interest due to their implications in male reproductive health and potential links to infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
