# LRRC20

## Overview
LRRC20, or leucine rich repeat containing 20, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeats, which are typically involved in protein-protein interactions. The LRRC20 protein is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, indicating its potential role in muscle-specific functions and development (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). It is associated with regulatory elements such as intragenic enhancers and super-enhancers, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of gene expression within muscle tissues (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The protein's coexpression with other muscle-related proteins, including those involved in muscle contraction and structural integrity, further supports its role in maintaining muscle function (Duek2019Worming). Despite these associations, the precise molecular mechanisms and cellular functions of LRRC20 remain to be fully elucidated, warranting further research into its biological and clinical significance.

## Structure


## Function
LRRC20, or leucine rich repeat containing 20, is a gene that encodes a protein potentially involved in muscle function and development. In humans, LRRC20 is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle, suggesting a role in muscle-specific gene expression. The gene is associated with intragenic enhancer chromatin, which indicates its involvement in gene regulation, particularly in muscle tissues (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). The presence of super-enhancers and DNA hypomethylation in skeletal muscle further supports its role in regulating muscle-specific transcription (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics).

LRRC20 is coexpressed with proteins involved in muscle contraction, development, glycogen catabolism, and calcium transport, as well as proteins that bind titin, calmodulin, and actin, which are structural constituents of muscle proteins (Duek2019Worming). This coexpression pattern suggests that LRRC20 may play a role in maintaining muscle structure and function. The localization of LRRC20 to the nucleoplasm implies a potential role in controlling gene expression related to muscle function or development (Duek2019Worming). Despite these insights, the specific molecular processes and cellular roles of LRRC20 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The LRRC20 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A genome-wide association study identified a significant association between the LRRC20 rs10762360 G allele and anti-La antibodies in African-American SLE patients, although this association was not observed in European and Hispanic-American subjects (Kariuki2010Traitstratified). The study also found that the LRRC20 gene might influence serum interferon alpha (IFN-α) levels independently of autoantibody associations, suggesting a potential role in modulating immune responses in SLE (Kariuki2010Traitstratified).

In addition to its role in SLE, LRRC20 has been associated with paclitaxel resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that LRRC20 is expressed at low levels in ESCC tumor samples and paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, indicating a negative association with tumor status and potential involvement in drug resistance mechanisms (Shen2021Identification).

Furthermore, a study on carfilzomib-related cardiotoxicity in multiple myeloma patients identified a genetic variant in LRRC20 associated with human coronary artery disease, suggesting a possible link to cardiovascular conditions (Tantawy2023WholeExome). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of LRRC20 across different diseases.
