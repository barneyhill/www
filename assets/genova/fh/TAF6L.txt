# TAF6L

## Overview
TAF6L is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 6 like, which is a critical component of the human SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) coactivator complex. This protein is integral to the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and functional specificity of the SAGA complex. TAF6L is characterized by its histone fold domain, which facilitates its interaction with other subunits within the complex, contributing to the organization and assembly of the core module. The protein's involvement in transcriptional regulation is essential for processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal biology (Arede2021Buffering; Herbst2021Structure).

## Structure
TAF6L is a component of the human SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) coactivator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation. The protein is part of the core module of hSAGA, which is organized around nine subunits, including TAF6L itself. TAF6L contains a histone fold (HF) domain, which is central to its function. This domain allows TAF6L to bind centrally via the C-terminal end of helix ∝2 to the seven-bladed WD40 propeller of TAF5L, contributing to the organization of the core module (Herbst2021Structure).

The core module of hSAGA, including TAF6L, exhibits an asymmetric histone octamer-like fold, which is evolutionarily conserved and also found in the general transcription factor IID (Zhang2022CryoEM). TAF6L's HEAT repeat domain is part of the core module's structure, providing flexibility and acting as a tether for the SPL module (Herbst2021Structure).

TAF6L is also involved in the integration of the HAT and SPL modules within the hSAGA complex, highlighting its role in the assembly and structural integrity of the complex (Herbst2021Structure). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its function in transcription regulation and co-transcriptional splicing.

## Function
TAF6L is a component of the SAGA complex, which plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by RNA polymerase II. Within the SAGA complex, TAF6L is part of the central Core, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the complex and facilitating its interaction with transcription factors (Arede2021Buffering). TAF6L is specific to the SAGA complex, distinguishing it from other TAFs that are shared with the TFIID complex, a general transcription factor for RNA polymerase II (Arede2021Buffering).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, TAF6L contributes to the stabilization of transcriptional programs, which is vital for maintaining cell identity, particularly in processes such as development and cancer (Arede2021Buffering). Although specific details about the function of TAF6L in healthy human cells are not extensively covered, its role within the SAGA complex suggests it is involved in the regulation of gene expression by influencing the assembly and function of transcriptional machinery. This involvement is critical for the proper transcription of genes necessary for cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal biology.

## Interactions
TAF6L is a component of the SAGA complex, where it forms histone-fold domain (HFD) pairs with TAF9-9B. This interaction is crucial for the structural organization and functional specificity of the SAGA complex, distinguishing it from the TFIID complex, where TAF6 is present in two copies (Timmers2021SAGA). In the context of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), TAF6L interacts with c-MYC to regulate gene expression, impacting processes such as cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, and ribosome biogenesis. This interaction is part of the MYC regulatory network, which is essential for maintaining the self-renewal of mESCs (Seruggia2019TAF5L).

TAF6L also plays a role in the recruitment of transcription factors and histone modification. It is involved in the deposition of H3K9ac and the recruitment of c-MYC at target genes, facilitating RNA polymerase II pause release at promoters. This activity is crucial for the activation of gene expression in mESCs (Seruggia2019TAF5L). Although no direct physical association between TAF6L and c-MYC was detected, TAF6L is known to interact with other components of the transcriptional machinery, suggesting an indirect recruitment mechanism (Seruggia2019TAF5L).
