# MCAM

## Overview
MCAM, or melanoma cell adhesion molecule, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, commonly referred to as CD146. The protein plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion, signaling, and migration, and is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including angiogenesis, tumor progression, and immune response modulation. MCAM is expressed in a variety of cell types, such as endothelial cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, and T cells, where it influences cellular behaviors like proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as growth factor receptors and cytoskeletal components, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating complex signaling pathways. MCAM's involvement in cancer and autoimmune diseases highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker (Joshkon2020Role; Dagur2015Endothelialbinding; Ruma2016MCAM).

## Structure
The MCAM protein, also known as CD146, is a glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is characterized by a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular region composed of five immunoglobulin-like domains arranged in a V-V-C2-C2-C2 configuration (Wang2013CD146; Shih1999The). The extracellular portion is highly glycosylated, with carbohydrates constituting about 35% of its molecular mass, and contains multiple N-glycosylation sites (Lei2015The; Shih1999The). The protein's secondary structure is predominantly composed of beta-strands, typical of immunoglobulin domains (Lehmann1989MUC18).

MCAM exists in two isoforms, CD146-s and CD146-l, which differ in their cytoplasmic domains due to alternative splicing (Wang2013CD146; Lei2015The). The cytoplasmic domain contains potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinases, which may play a role in intracellular signaling (Wu2001Isolation; Shih1999The). The protein can also exist in a soluble form, generated by ectodomain shedding (Lei2015The). The structure of MCAM allows it to mediate interactions with growth factor receptors and intracellular signaling pathways, influencing tumor progression and cell adhesion (Lei2015The).

## Function
MCAM, also known as CD146, is a cell adhesion molecule involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a critical role in coordinating apical-basal (AB) polarity and planar cell polarity (PCP) during morphogenesis, which are essential for organ and tissue development. MCAM acts as an independent receptor for fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) and serves as a membrane anchor for phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-γ), which is involved in the activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. These pathways are crucial for processes such as lumenogenesis and ciliogenesis (Gao2017The).

In endothelial cells, MCAM functions as a co-receptor for VEGFR-2, enhancing its signaling and promoting angiogenesis. It also interacts with PDGFR-β, aiding in pericyte recruitment and vessel stabilization. MCAM's role in cell adhesion and migration is facilitated through interactions with ERM proteins, which are involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, and through the activation of RhoA, a key regulator of cell motility (Joshkon2020Role; Luo2011Recognition).

MCAM is expressed in various cell types, including endothelial cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, and T cells, where it influences cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It is also involved in maintaining the integrity of endothelial monolayers and supporting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Stopp2012Expression; Dagur2015Endothelialbinding).

## Clinical Significance
The MCAM gene, also known as melanoma cell adhesion molecule, plays a significant role in various diseases, particularly cancer. In breast cancer, MCAM expression is associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is linked to metastasis and poor prognosis. High levels of MCAM are correlated with increased cell motility, loss of cell-cell contacts, and resistance to chemotherapy, contributing to a poor prognosis in breast tumors (Imbert2012CD146; Mannion2023Pro). In colorectal cancer, MCAM is implicated in the CMS4 subtype, which is characterized by angiogenesis and stromal cell invasion. Elevated MCAM expression is associated with shorter relapse-free and overall survival, particularly in advanced-stage tumors (Stalin2023Targeting).

MCAM is also involved in autoimmune diseases, where elevated levels of circulating CD3+CD146+ T cells are found in conditions such as sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic sclerosis. In systemic sclerosis, high levels of soluble CD146 correlate with disease severity, including pulmonary fibrosis (Joshkon2020Role). In non-small cell lung cancer, MCAM expression is associated with shorter survival in adenocarcinomas, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Kristiansen2002Expression).

## Interactions
MCAM, also known as CD146, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It physically interacts with the neural transmembrane protease matriptase (MTP), where the CUB domains of MTP bind to MCAM, initiating signaling events in brain endothelial cells. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the neural stem cell vascular niche, involving pathways such as p38MAPK and GSK3β (Tung2017Physical).

MCAM also interacts with VEGFR2, acting as a co-receptor necessary for VEGF-induced activation of signaling pathways like AKT/p38MAPK/NFκB, which are important for endothelial migration and angiogenesis (Joshkon2020Role; Tung2017Physical). In the context of cancer, MCAM binds to the S100A8/A9 protein complex, activating NF-κB and inducing ROS formation, which are critical for melanoma progression and metastasis (Ruma2016MCAM).

MCAM's interaction with galectin-3 is modulated by its sialylation status, which affects its dimerization and subsequent activation of signaling pathways like AKT, influencing tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (Zou2022ST6GAL1). These interactions highlight MCAM's role in cell adhesion, signaling, and cancer progression.
