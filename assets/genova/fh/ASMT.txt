# ASMT

## Overview
The ASMT gene encodes the enzyme acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase, which is a critical component of the melatonin biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme belongs to the methyltransferase family and is responsible for the methylation of N-acetylserotonin to produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles. ASMT is primarily active in the pineal gland but also functions in extrapineal tissues such as the retina, skin, and gastrointestinal tract, where it contributes to local melatonin production and various protective roles (Acuña-Castroviejo2014Extrapineal; Rath2016Melatonin). The enzyme's activity is relatively stable throughout the day, distinguishing it from other enzymes in the melatonin synthesis pathway that exhibit diurnal variation (Rath2016Melatonin). Mutations and genetic variations in the ASMT gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions associated with melatonin synthesis and circadian regulation (Geoffroy2013An; Cai2008Multiplex).

## Structure
The ASMT protein, involved in melatonin biosynthesis, has a distinct molecular structure characterized by several key features. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids with conserved residues around the SAM (S-adenosyl methionine) binding site, such as F156, G187, G235, D236, F237, F238, W257, D210, and R252, which are crucial for maintaining hydrogen bonds to the SAM moiety (Zhang2017A). The secondary structure involves the intertwining of helices, forming a physiologically active dimer, indicating a quaternary structure (Zhang2017A). The N-terminal domain of ASMT intertwines with another monomer to form this dimer, which is essential for its function (Zhang2017A).

The tertiary structure of ASMT is implied by the formation of a dimer through these helices, and the protein's overall fold is similar to bacterial and plant O-methyltransferases, which are SAM-dependent methyltransferases (Zhang2017A). Variants in the conserved residues, such as Y108H, N302S, and E311Q, are present in ASMTL-ASMT sequences, potentially affecting the protein's activity (Zhang2017A). The ASMT protein is part of the methyltransferase family, characterized by a conserved SAM binding domain (Zhang2017A).

## Function
ASMT (acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of melatonin, a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles. ASMT catalyzes the methylation of N-acetylserotonin to melatonin, primarily in the pineal gland, but also in various extrapineal tissues such as the retina, skin, and gastrointestinal tract (Acuña-Castroviejo2014Extrapineal; Rath2016Melatonin). 

In the pineal gland, ASMT is expressed in a subpopulation of pinealocytes, indicating a specialized role in melatonin synthesis (Rath2016Melatonin). The enzyme's activity is relatively constant throughout the day, unlike other enzymes in the melatonin synthesis pathway, which show significant diurnal variation (Rath2016Melatonin). 

ASMT is also active in the retina, where it contributes to local melatonin production, which is important for modulating dopamine release and providing antioxidant protection to photoreceptor cells (Acuña-Castroviejo2014Extrapineal). In the skin and gastrointestinal tract, ASMT supports local melatonin synthesis, which is involved in protective functions such as antioxidative defense and regulation of cellular processes like hair growth and pigmentation (Acuña-Castroviejo2014Extrapineal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ASMT gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), duplications and mutations in the ASMT gene are linked to decreased melatonin levels, which are thought to contribute to the condition. A novel microduplication in the ASMT gene was identified in a significant proportion of individuals with ASD compared to controls, suggesting a potential genetic susceptibility factor (Cai2008Multiplex). Specific mutations, such as a splice site mutation (IVS5+2T>C), have been associated with low ASMT activity and reduced melatonin synthesis in ASD patients (Jonsson2010Mutation).

The ASMT gene has also been implicated in sleep disorders, particularly in children with ASD who experience sleep onset delay. Variations in ASMT, along with other melatonin pathway genes, have been linked to these sleep disturbances (Veatch2014Genetic). In bipolar disorder, a functional variant in the ASMT gene is associated with altered sleep patterns and circadian rhythm disruptions, indicating its broader role in mood disorders (Geoffroy2013An; Etain2012Genetic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ASMT in various conditions related to melatonin synthesis and circadian regulation.

## Interactions
The acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) enzyme is involved in melatonin biosynthesis and interacts with various proteins that influence its stability and function. Notably, ASMT does not directly interact with α-synuclein (α-SYN), but α-SYN promotes the degradation of ASMT through a pathway involving the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B). This interaction is crucial for the degradation of ASMT, as LC3B acts as an autophagy adapter protein in the autophagy-lysosome pathway. ASMT contains six LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs, which are essential for binding to LC3B. This binding is confirmed through immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining, showing co-localization of ASMT and LC3B. The binding capacity between ASMT and LC3B increases in cells overexpressing α-SYN, suggesting that LC3B is an intermediate molecule in α-SYN-induced ASMT degradation. This degradation pathway is linked to reduced melatonin synthesis, as ASMT is involved in melatonin biosynthesis (Jia2024αSynuclein). The interaction between ASMT and LC3B highlights a regulatory mechanism by which α-SYN affects melatonin levels, which is relevant to rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder associated with Parkinson's disease (Jia2024αSynuclein).
