# RPP40

## Overview
RPP40 is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p40, a protein that plays a critical role in RNA processing within the cell. This protein is a component of both the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes, which are essential for the maturation of precursor tRNA and the processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and certain mRNAs, respectively (Tang2022RPP40; Saito2014RNase). RPP40 is predominantly active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, thereby ensuring the fidelity of protein synthesis and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Tang2022RPP40). The protein's interactions within these complexes are crucial for its function, although it does not exhibit non-canonical roles outside of these interactions (Shaukat2021The). Additionally, RPP40 has been identified as a prognostic biomarker in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, with its expression levels correlating with disease progression and patient outcomes (Tang2022RPP40).

## Function
RPP40 is a protein subunit of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) complex, which plays a crucial role in the maturation of precursor tRNA molecules by cleaving their 5' leader sequences. This process is essential for the generation of mature tRNA molecules, which are vital for protein synthesis in cells (Tang2022RPP40). RPP40 is also a component of the RNase MRP complex, which is involved in cleaving pre-rRNA sequences, contributing to the processing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and certain mRNAs (Saito2014RNase).

In healthy human cells, RPP40 is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to RNA processing and the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes. This activity is critical for maintaining proper cellular function and ensuring the fidelity of protein synthesis (Tang2022RPP40). Although the specific molecular functions of RPP40 in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its involvement in RNA processing highlights its importance in cellular biology and organismal outcomes related to protein synthesis and cell cycle regulation (Tang2022RPP40). The protein's role in these fundamental processes underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
RPP40 has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Its mRNA and protein expression levels are significantly upregulated in UCEC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, as confirmed by multiple datasets and databases (Tang2022RPP40). High RPP40 expression is associated with poorer overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free interval in UCEC patients, making it an independent risk factor for these outcomes (Tang2022RPP40). The expression of RPP40 correlates with advanced clinical stages, higher histological grades, and poorer primary therapy outcomes, indicating its potential role in tumor progression and poor prognosis (Tang2022RPP40).

RPP40 is also involved in the tumor microenvironment, particularly in extracellular matrix dysregulation and immune cell infiltration. Its expression is negatively correlated with the infiltration of immune cells such as NK cells and CD8 T cells, suggesting a role in immune escape mechanisms (Tang2022RPP40). These findings highlight the potential of RPP40 as a therapeutic target in UCEC, although specific diseases directly linked to RPP40 mutations are not well-documented (Tang2022RPP40).

## Interactions
RPP40 is a component of the human RNase P holoenzyme, which is involved in the maturation of precursor tRNAs. It interacts with several other protein subunits within the RNase P complex. Structurally, RPP40 interacts with the C domain of RPPH1 through extensive contacts with stems P1, P2, and P19, playing a role in stabilizing the helical core of the C domain. The N-terminus of RPP40 interacts with RPP14 and fits into the center of the Pop5-RPP14-(RPP30)2 tetramer, making contacts with Pop5 and one RPP30 protein subunit. RPP40 is also connected to the 'wrist' module through interactions between RPP29 and another RPP30 molecule (Shaukat2021The).

RPP40 is associated with both RNase MRP and RNase P complexes, indicating a stable association with these complexes. It is found in 12S and 60-80S fractions, suggesting its involvement in interactions within these complexes (Welting2006Differential). However, RPP40 does not show specific interactions with H1 RNA or its P3 domain, as demonstrated by UV-crosslinking experiments (JIANG2001Protein–RNA). Despite its interactions within the RNase P complex, RPP40 has not been associated with any non-canonical functions (Shaukat2021The).
