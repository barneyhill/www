# ELAPOR2

## Overview
ELAPOR2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as endosome-lysosome associated apoptosis and autophagy regulator family member 2. This protein is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy, two critical cellular processes that maintain cellular homeostasis and respond to stress conditions. As a regulatory protein, it plays a significant role in the endosome-lysosome pathway, which is essential for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The precise mechanisms by which ELAPOR2 influences these pathways are still under investigation, but its involvement suggests potential implications in various diseases where apoptosis and autophagy are dysregulated. Understanding the function and regulation of ELAPOR2 could provide insights into therapeutic targets for conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
