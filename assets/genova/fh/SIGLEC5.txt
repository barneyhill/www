# SIGLEC5

## Overview
SIGLEC5 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 5 (Siglec-5), which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Siglec-5 is primarily categorized as an inhibitory receptor and is expressed on various immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. The protein is characterized by its ability to recognize and bind sialic acid-containing glycoproteins, which are commonly found on the surfaces of both host cells and pathogens. This binding plays a critical role in modulating immune responses by transmitting inhibitory signals that help maintain immune homeostasis and prevent autoimmunity. The structural features of Siglec-5, such as its V-set and C2-set domains, facilitate its function in immune regulation and pathogen-host interactions (Zhuravleva2008Structural; Ali2014Siglec-5).

## Structure
Siglec-5 is a protein encoded by the SIGLEC5 gene, characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains. The primary structure of Siglec-5 includes a V-set domain and multiple C2-set domains, which are crucial for its function in recognizing sialylated carbohydrates and lipid ligands (Zhuravleva2008Structural; Suematsu2019Identification). The V-set domain features an Ig-like fold with two opposing anti-parallel β-sheets, which are wider than typical Ig-V folds due to a disulfide bond between strands B and E (Zhuravleva2008Structural). 

The secondary structure of Siglec-5 includes a split G-strand, divided into G and G' strands by a GG' linker, contributing to its unique structural scaffold (Zhuravleva2008Structural). The CC' loop in the V-set domain is in a 'closed' conformation, stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, creating a deep binding groove for sialic acid recognition (Zhuravleva2008Structural).

Tertiary structure analysis reveals that Siglec-5 forms a nearly linear tandem arrangement of its V-set and C2-set domains, linked by an inter-domain disulfide bond, which reduces conformational flexibility (Zhuravleva2008Structural). The quaternary structure includes dimeric and heptameric forms, which influence its binding properties and interactions with other proteins, such as PSGL1 (Pepin2016Soluble). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are present, with eight sites for N-linked glycosylation identified in the heptameric construct (Pepin2016Soluble). Splice variants of Siglec-5 exist, including a soluble isoform, which may have distinct functional roles (Pepin2016Soluble).

## Function
Siglec-5, encoded by the SIGLEC5 gene, is an inhibitory receptor expressed on various immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. It plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by binding to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins, which are often present on the surfaces of pathogens and host cells. This binding transmits inhibitory signals that help prevent overactivation of the immune system, maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity (Läubli2019Sialic; Ali2014Siglec-5).

Siglec-5 functions through a cytosolic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) that recruits tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, known for their inhibitory effects on cell signaling. This mechanism is particularly important in dampening inflammatory responses, as evidenced by reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-8 and TNF in the presence of Siglec-5 (Ali2014Siglec-5; Lin2021Functions).

In the context of bacterial infections, Siglec-5 can be exploited by pathogens such as Group B Streptococcus (GBS) to evade immune detection. GBS can engage Siglec-5 to suppress neutrophil killing functions, highlighting its role in pathogen-host interactions (Macauley2014Siglec-mediated; Bochner2015Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SIGLEC5 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of periodontitis, a genome-wide association study identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4284742 in SIGLEC5 as a significant genetic risk factor for both aggressive and chronic periodontitis. This SNP was associated with increased susceptibility to the disease, highlighting SIGLEC5's role in the immune response related to periodontitis (Tong2019Genetic; Munz2017A).

In primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), elevated levels of soluble SIGLEC5 in saliva have been identified as a potential biomarker. This alteration in SIGLEC5 expression correlates with disease severity indicators, such as salivary flow rate and xerostomia inventory score, suggesting its clinical significance in diagnosing and assessing pSS (Lee2019Soluble).

SIGLEC5 also plays a role in immune responses to bacterial infections. It acts as an inhibitory receptor on phagocytes, modulating responses to pathogens like Group B Streptococcus (GBS). The interaction between SIGLEC5 and its paired receptor SIGLEC14 can influence susceptibility to infections and conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations (Ali2014Siglec-5).

## Interactions
SIGLEC5 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in immune regulation. It binds to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL1) in a calcium-ion and sialic acid-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for modulating leukocyte rolling and adhesion, processes important in inflammation. Soluble forms of SIGLEC5, such as sSiglec-5/Fc and sSiglec-5/C4BP, can inhibit leukocyte rolling over E- and P-selectin, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role by blocking PSGL1-mediated interactions (Pepin2016Soluble).

SIGLEC5 also interacts with Toll-like receptors (TLRs), showing extensive cross-reactivity with multiple TLRs, including a strong interaction with TLR4. This interaction is part of a regulatory network involving host sialidases and TLRs, which may influence immune responses and offer therapeutic potential in conditions like endotoxemia (Chen2014Broad).

In the context of bacterial infections, SIGLEC5 interacts with Group B Streptococcus (GBS), where it can either suppress or enhance phagocytosis depending on the interaction. This engagement involves the cell wall-bound β-protein of GBS binding to SIGLEC5 on neutrophils, influencing immune responses (Läubli2019Sialic; Lin2021Functions).
