# MAEA

## Overview
The MAEA gene encodes the macrophage erythroblast attacher, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is integral to the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This protein is a key component of the CTLH complex, which is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of specific cell surface receptors, thereby modulating intracellular signaling pathways. MAEA is particularly crucial for maintaining HSC quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation by promoting autophagy and regulating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Its activity ensures mitochondrial homeostasis and manages metabolic and oxidative stress within HSCs. The absence or dysfunction of MAEA can lead to significant hematological disorders, highlighting its essential role in hematopoietic homeostasis and the balance between myeloid and lymphoid lineages (Wei2020MAEA; Maitland2019The).

## Function
The MAEA gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in maintaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by promoting autophagy and regulating intracellular signaling pathways. MAEA is highly expressed in HSCs and is essential for their quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation. It regulates the ubiquitination and degradation of surface cytokine receptors, such as FLT3, which is vital for maintaining HSC quiescence and preventing aberrant signaling (Wei2020MAEA). This regulation is achieved through autophagy, a process that MAEA promotes by facilitating the degradation of cytokine receptor tyrosine kinases in autolysosomes, thereby controlling receptor stability and signaling strength (Wei2020MAEA).

MAEA's activity is critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and managing metabolic and oxidative stress in HSCs. The absence of MAEA leads to impaired autophagy flux and prolonged receptor surface expression, which disrupts HSC function (Wei2020MAEA). MAEA also indirectly suppresses mTOR signaling, which is known to inhibit autophagy, thus supporting normal autophagosome maturation and HSC maintenance (Wei2020MAEA). These molecular processes underscore MAEA's role in ensuring the proper balance between myeloid and lymphoid lineages in HSCs and maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis (Wei2020MAEA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the MAEA gene can lead to significant hematological disorders. The MAEA gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is crucial for maintaining hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by regulating autophagy and cytokine receptor signaling. Deletion of MAEA in mice results in severe hematological abnormalities, including a myeloproliferative syndrome characterized by thrombocytosis, anemia, and increased infiltration of myeloid cells in vital organs. This condition is accompanied by a marked reduction in circulating leukocytes due to severe lymphopenia and an increase in HSC numbers and myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow, while lymphoid progenitors are reduced (Wei2020MAEA).

The absence of MAEA stabilizes the surface expression of several hematopoietic cytokine receptors, such as MPL and FLT3, prolonging their intracellular signaling and leading to impaired autophagy flux in HSCs. This results in aberrant activation and exhaustion of HSCs, contributing to hematological disorders (Wei2020MAEA). The study suggests that MAEA's role in regulating cytokine receptor stability and autophagy is essential for preventing these disorders, and alterations in its expression could impact HSC function and potentially contribute to hematopoietic diseases (Wei2020MAEA).

## Interactions
MAEA, a component of the CTLH complex, interacts with several proteins to perform its functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is a crucial subunit of the CTLH complex, which includes proteins such as RMND5A, TWA1, ARMC8, muskelin, WDR26, and GID4. MAEA and RMND5A form a RING heterodimer essential for the E3 ligase activity of the complex, facilitating ubiquitin transfer to substrates (Maitland2022Structural; Maitland2019The). The stability and activity of the CTLH complex are interdependent on the presence of MAEA and RMND5A, with both proteins exhibiting E3 ligase activity (Maitland2019The).

MAEA also plays a role in the ubiquitination and degradation of specific cell surface receptors, such as FLT3, which is crucial for regulating hematopoiesis (Wei2020MAEA). This interaction is part of MAEA's function in maintaining hematopoietic stem cells by modulating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and promoting autophagy (Wei2020MAEA). The interactions within the CTLH complex and with other proteins highlight MAEA's role in cellular processes like autophagy and receptor signaling.
