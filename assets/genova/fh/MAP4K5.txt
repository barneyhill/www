# MAP4K5

## Overview
MAP4K5 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 5, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular signaling pathways. This protein is a member of the mammalian STE20-like kinase family and plays a pivotal role in regulating processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and autophagy. It is particularly significant in the modulation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and MAPK kinase cascades, which are crucial for stress response and immune function (Seo2020MAP4K). MAP4K5 is also integral to the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, where it helps control cell growth and prevent tumorigenesis by influencing the phosphorylation and activity of key pathway components (Seo2020MAP4K). The protein's interactions with various adaptor proteins and its involvement in the STRIPAK complex further underscore its diverse roles in cellular signaling and oncogenic pathways (Seo2020MAP4K).

## Structure
MAP4K5, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 5, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a role in various signaling pathways. The protein contains a kinase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to phosphorylate target substrates. This domain is a defining feature of its primary structure and is essential for its function in signal transduction pathways.

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions with other proteins. These modifications are important for regulating the protein's function and ensuring proper cellular responses to external signals.

MAP4K5 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may result in variations in its structure and function. These isoforms can have different roles in cellular processes, potentially affecting the protein's interactions and signaling capabilities.

While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of MAP4K5 are not provided, the presence of a kinase domain suggests a conserved fold typical of serine/threonine kinases, which often includes a bilobed structure with an ATP-binding site. The structural configuration of MAP4K5 is likely to be similar to other kinases, facilitating its role in phosphorylation and signal transduction.

## Function
MAP4K5, a member of the mammalian STE20-like serine/threonine kinase family, plays a critical role in various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, and autophagy. It primarily functions through the control of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and MAPK kinase cascades, which are essential for stress response and immune function (Seo2020MAP4K). In healthy human cells, MAP4K5 is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and cell movement, as evidenced by its interaction with cortactin (CTTN) in cell lamellipodia, suggesting a role in cell migration and lamellipodia formation (Seo2020MAP4K).

MAP4K5 is also a key component of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway, which is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and regulating cell proliferation and survival. Within this pathway, MAP4K5 works alongside MST1/2 to phosphorylate and activate LATS1/2, leading to the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of YAP and TAZ, thereby preventing their nuclear entry and subsequent gene transcription (Seo2020MAP4K). This regulatory mechanism underscores MAP4K5's role in controlling cell growth and preventing tumorigenesis. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences these signaling pathways and cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAP4K5 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), low expression of MAP4K5 is associated with the loss of E-cadherin expression, which is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell integrity. This loss is linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that facilitates cancer metastasis. Low MAP4K5 expression in PDAC is also correlated with reduced CES2 expression, impacting the tumor's response to irinotecan therapy and leading to shorter overall survival, making it an independent prognostic factor for reduced survival in PDAC patients (Wang2016Prognostic).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of MAP4K5 is associated with favorable overall survival, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role in this context (Bai2019Prognostic). This contrasts with its downregulation in pancreatic cancer, indicating that MAP4K5 may have divergent roles in different cancers.

Additionally, MAP4K5 has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker for steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH), with its expression being down-regulated in affected patients. This suggests its involvement in immune and inflammatory pathways related to the condition (Yu2021ARG2).

## Interactions
MAP4K5, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 5, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with several adaptor proteins such as CRK, CRKL, NCK2, and GRB2, which are involved in signal transduction pathways, suggesting its role in these processes (Seo2020MAP4K). MAP4K5 is also implicated in endocytosis through its interaction with SH3GL proteins and in cell migration and lamellipodia formation via its association with CTTN (Seo2020MAP4K). 

The protein is part of the STRIPAK complex, interacting with STRN4, which is crucial for regulating the Hippo pathway. This interaction is important for the activation of YAP, a potential oncogene, indicating MAP4K5's involvement in oncogenic signaling pathways (Seo2020MAP4K). Additionally, MAP4K5 interacts with proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis and STRIPAK-complex-dependent protein de-phosphorylation, highlighting its diverse roles in cellular functions (Seo2020MAP4K).

In the context of cancer, MAP4K5 variants such as MAP4K5-V569E and MAP4K5-V569del have been studied for their protein-protein interactions. The V569E isoform interacts more with secretory or barrier function proteins, while the 569del form shows stronger interactions with ubiquitin regulator UBA1 and protein disulphide isomerases (Kurkowiak2021An). These interactions suggest that MAP4K5 variants may alter protein interaction networks, impacting protein function across different species.
