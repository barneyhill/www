# CANT1

## Overview
CANT1, or calcium activated nucleotidase 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) within cartilage. The CANT1 protein functions as a nucleoside diphosphatase, primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a critical role in protein folding, degradation, and calcium homeostasis. This enzyme is essential for maintaining the proper synthesis and organization of GAGs, which are vital components of the extracellular matrix, contributing to the structural integrity and function of cartilage (Calì2012Ca2+activated; Paganini2019Calcium). Mutations in the CANT1 gene are linked to Desbuquois dysplasia, a rare skeletal disorder, underscoring its significance in normal bone development and growth (Furuichi2010CANT1; Nizon2012Further).

## Function
CANT1 (calcium activated nucleotidase 1) encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis, particularly in cartilage and endochondral ossification. In healthy human cells, CANT1 is involved in the proper synthesis and organization of GAGs, which are essential components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cartilage. These GAGs contribute to the mechanical and biological functions of cartilage by providing structural support to chondrocytes and influencing the diffusion of growth factors, signaling molecules, and nutrients (Paganini2019Calcium).

CANT1 functions as a nucleoside diphosphatase, hydrolyzing UDP to UMP and phosphate, which is crucial for preventing the inhibition of glycosyltransferases and facilitating the exchange of UMP with cytosolic UDP-sugars. This activity is essential for maintaining the flux of UDP-glucose from the cytosol, necessary for the proper functioning of the calnexin/calreticulin chaperone cycle (Calì2012Ca2+activated; Paganini2019Calcium).

The protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it supports protein folding and degradation processes. CANT1's role in these cellular compartments is linked to its involvement in protein quality control and Ca2+ homeostasis, impacting the secretion efficiency of glycoproteins and the degradation of folding-defective proteins (Calì2012Ca2+activated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CANT1 gene are associated with Desbuquois dysplasia (DD), a rare autosomal recessive chondrodysplasia characterized by skeletal abnormalities such as short stature, joint laxity, and advanced carpal ossification. There are two main types of DD: type 1, which includes hand anomalies, and type 2, which does not. The Kim variant is another form characterized by short metacarpals and elongated phalanges (Furuichi2010CANT1; Nizon2012Further). 

CANT1 mutations, including nonsense and missense mutations, lead to a loss of function, disrupting normal bone development. These mutations have been identified in various populations, indicating a broad genetic heterogeneity (Huber2009Identification; Laccone2011Desbuquois). The mutations can result in severe prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, respiratory problems, and cognitive impairment (Asif2023In). 

In mouse models, CANT1 deficiency has been shown to impair glycosaminoglycan synthesis and chondrocyte differentiation, contributing to the skeletal manifestations of DD (Kodama2020CANT1). The gene's role in proteoglycan synthesis and vesicular trafficking in the Golgi apparatus is crucial for normal cartilage development (Paganini2019Calcium).

## Interactions
CANT1, a calcium-activated nucleotidase, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. In retinoblastoma cells, CANT1 interacts with the promoter region of the PI3Kγ gene, influencing its expression by blocking the recruitment of the histone methyltransferase hSET1. This interaction prevents hSET1-mediated histone H3K4 trimethylation, thereby inhibiting PI3Kγ expression and affecting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Ni2020LncRNA).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, CANT1 is upregulated and interacts with several proteins involved in nucleobase-containing small molecule biosynthesis and ribonucleotide metabolism, such as UPRT, HPRT1, ADSS, ATIC, IMPDH1, ITPA, PKLR, HDDC3, PKM, and ENPP1. These interactions are crucial for tumor development and immune cell infiltration, particularly with Th2 cells, which may contribute to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (Liu2023Upregulated).

CANT1 is also implicated in protein folding and degradation processes within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. It is regulated by the transcriptional repressor DREAM, which affects CANT1's role in protein quality control and calcium homeostasis (Calì2012Ca2+activated).
