# RNF20

## Overview
RNF20 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 20, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the monoubiquitination of histone H2B, a post-translational modification that plays a pivotal role in regulating transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin dynamics (Foglizzo2016Structure; Hahn2011The). The RNF20 protein functions primarily in the nucleus, where it forms a heterodimeric complex with RNF40, enhancing its ubiquitin ligase activity (Foglizzo2016Structure). Beyond its role in histone modification, RNF20 is involved in various biological processes, including adipogenesis and energy metabolism, highlighting its significance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Liang2020Rnf20; Jeon2024Ubiquitin). Alterations in RNF20 expression or function have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Jääskeläinen2012Histone; Wang2020RNF20).

## Structure
The RNF20 protein is characterized by a C-terminal RING domain, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the monoubiquitylation of histone H2B (Foglizzo2016Structure). The RING domain of RNF20 forms a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the interaction with the E2 enzyme and stabilizing ubiquitin in a closed conformation (Foglizzo2016Structure). This domain is structurally similar to other RING domains, featuring two zinc ions coordinated in a cross-braced arrangement by one histidine and seven cysteine side chains (Foglizzo2016Structure).

The dimer interface of the RNF20 RING domain includes residues from the core RING domain, the N-terminal α-helix, and the C-terminal tail, with a critical aromatic residue, Y973, stabilizing the E2~Ub conjugate (Foglizzo2016Structure). The RNF20 RING domain is selective for the E2 enzyme Ube2B, despite a weak interaction, and does not interact with more promiscuous E2s like UbcH5b (Foglizzo2016Structure).

RNF20 can form stable heterodimers with RNF40, another E3 ligase, which enhances its ubiquitin transfer activity (Foglizzo2016Structure). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
RNF20 is a RING E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the monoubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 120 (H2B-K120), a modification essential for regulating transcription, DNA repair, and maintaining chromatin integrity. This process is crucial for transcriptional elongation, as it facilitates the passage of RNA polymerase II through the nucleosomal barrier, thereby influencing gene expression (Foglizzo2016Structure; Hahn2011The). RNF20 functions as part of a heterodimeric complex with RNF40, and this complex is involved in the DNA damage response and chromatin dynamics (Hahn2011The).

In addition to its role in histone modification, RNF20 is involved in adipose tissue development and energy metabolism. It regulates adipogenesis and thermogenesis in brown and beige adipose tissues by influencing the expression of key thermogenic genes and transcription factors (Liang2020Rnf20; Jeon2024Ubiquitin). RNF20's activity in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining metabolic balance and energy homeostasis in the organism (Liang2020Rnf20).

RNF20 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with the E2 enzyme Ube2B to facilitate ubiquitin transfer, a process that is critical for its function in histone modification and transcription regulation (Foglizzo2016Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF20 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In ciliopathies, RNF20 mutations can lead to abnormal cilia motility, resulting in phenotypes such as incorrect cardiac left-right patterning, congenital heart disease, continuous pulmonary infections, chronic respiratory failure, and hydrocephalus (Sakthinathan2024An). In male fertility, RNF20 is crucial for the function of Sertoli cells, and its absence can lead to spermatogenesis dysfunction and male infertility, mimicking Sertoli cell-only syndrome in humans (Lai2023RNF20).

In cancer, RNF20 has a complex role. It is often underexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer and breast cancer, where its promoter is frequently hypermethylated, suggesting a tumor suppressor function (Jääskeläinen2012Histone; Shema2008The). RNF20 knockdown can lead to decreased p53 activity, increased cell migration, and enhanced tumorigenicity, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Shema2008The). Conversely, overexpression of RNF20 in breast cancer is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and increased tumorigenic capabilities (Wang2020RNF20). In metabolic disorders, RNF20 influences adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity, with implications for conditions like type 2 diabetes (Jeon2019RNF20).

## Interactions
RNF20, a component of the RNF20/40 complex, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The RNF20/40 complex interacts with the motor protein Eg5, facilitating its monoubiquitination at lysine 745. This interaction is essential for spindle assembly during mitosis and is implicated in breast carcinogenesis (Duan2016Ubiquitin). RNF20 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction is enhanced following DNA damage and is important for p53-dependent transcription of genes such as p21. The RNF20/40 complex is recruited to the p21 promoter region, enhancing histone H2B ubiquitination, which is crucial for transcription elongation (Wu2019The).

The RNF20 RING domain interacts with the E2 enzyme Ube2B, forming a complex that is essential for histone H2B monoubiquitination. Specific residues in RNF20, such as N961, are critical for this interaction (Foglizzo2016Structure). RNF20 also forms a stable heterodimer with RNF40, which is necessary for its E3 ligase activity (Foglizzo2016Structure). Additionally, RNF20 interacts with eEF1B␦L, a protein involved in heat shock-responsive gene expression, suggesting a role in stress response regulation (In2019RNF2040mediated).
