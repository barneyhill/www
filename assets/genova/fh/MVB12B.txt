# MVB12B

## Overview
MVB12B is a gene that encodes the multivesicular body subunit 12B protein, a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-I) in humans. The MVB12B protein is characterized by the presence of a MVB12-associated β-prism (MABP) domain, which plays a significant role in membrane targeting and binding to acidic lipids, such as phosphatidylserine (Boura2012Structural). This protein is involved in the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo proteins from the plasma membrane to endosomal vesicles, a process essential for receptor downregulation and the formation of multivesicular bodies (Audhya2007MVB12; Tsunematsu2010Distinct). MVB12B interacts with other ESCRT-I components, such as TSG101, VPS28, and VPS37B, forming stable complexes necessary for endosomal sorting and viral budding processes (Morita2007Identification). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its stability and function within the ESCRT-I complex (Tsunematsu2010Distinct).

## Structure
The MVB12B protein is a component of the human ESCRT-I complex, featuring a MVB12-associated β-prism (MABP) domain. This domain is characterized by a β-prism fold, which is organized into three β-sheet subdomains arranged around a pseudothreefold axis. The structure includes a hydrophobic membrane-anchoring loop and an electropositive phosphoinositide-binding patch, which are critical for its function in membrane binding (Boura2012Structural).

The MABP domain binds to liposomes containing acidic lipids, with a preference for phosphatidylserine, although this preference is marginal. The binding is primarily charge-dependent rather than specific to particular lipid head groups (Boura2012Structural). The domain's membrane-binding site is described as an electropositive patch, similar to the KA1 domain, allowing it to bind nonspecifically to acidic lipids (Boura2012Structural).

Post-translational modifications of MVB12B include phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Phosphorylation occurs at Tyr241 and Tyr243, while ubiquitination sites include Lys264 and Lys290. These modifications regulate the protein's stability and subcellular localization (Tsunematsu2010Distinct).

## Function
MVB12B is a component of the ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo proteins from the plasma membrane to endosomal vesicles. This process is crucial for receptor downregulation and the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which facilitate the lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins (Audhya2007MVB12; Tsunematsu2010Distinct). MVB12B undergoes posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination at Lys264 and Lys290, which influence its stability and subcellular localization. These modifications are regulated by EGF stimulation and are crucial for MVB12B's function in the ESCRT-I complex (Tsunematsu2010Distinct).

The MVB12B protein contains a MABP domain, which is essential for membrane targeting. This domain binds to acidic lipids, such as phosphatidylserine, and facilitates the recruitment of the ESCRT-I complex to specific cellular locations, including endosomes and the plasma membrane (Boura2012Structural). MVB12B's interaction with other ESCRT-I components, such as TSG101, suggests its role in modulating endosomal sorting and receptor downregulation (Audhya2007MVB12). These activities are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating signaling pathways and preventing constitutive signaling that could lead to developmental abnormalities or tumorigenesis (Audhya2007MVB12).

## Interactions
MVB12B is a component of the human ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in endosomal sorting and viral budding processes. It interacts with other ESCRT-I subunits, including TSG101, VPS28, and VPS37B, forming stable quaternary complexes. These interactions are crucial for the proper assembly and function of the ESCRT-I complex, which is necessary for processes such as HIV-1 budding (Morita2007Identification).

MVB12B has two splice isoforms, with the longer isoform (MVB12B 1-319) containing regions EBB1 and EBB2 that are essential for binding to the ESCRT-I complex. The shorter isoform (MVB12B 1-221) lacks these regions and does not bind to the complex (Morita2007Identification). The binding of MVB12B to the ESCRT-I complex requires the presence of a TSG101-VPS37 binary complex, as MVB12B does not bind to TSG101, VPS37B, or VPS28 alone (Morita2007Identification).

MVB12B is also involved in posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which affects its stability and interaction with other proteins. Ubiquitination at Lys264 and Lys290 is crucial for its subcellular localization and protein stability (Tsunematsu2010Distinct). Additionally, MVB12B undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation, which influences its interaction with the EGF receptor (Tsunematsu2010Distinct).
