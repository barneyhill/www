# TMEM178A

## Overview
TMEM178A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 178A, which is primarily involved in the regulation of calcium signaling within myeloid cells. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. It plays a critical role in modulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) by interacting with STIM1, a key protein in calcium influx pathways. Through its regulatory functions, TMEM178A helps maintain calcium homeostasis and prevents calcium overload, which is crucial for cellular health and function (Yang2019Tmem178). Additionally, TMEM178A is significant in controlling the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby influencing inflammatory responses and immune homeostasis (Khanna2023Tmem178). Its involvement in these processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.

## Function
TMEM178A, also known as transmembrane protein 178A, plays a crucial role in regulating calcium signaling and homeostasis in myeloid cells. It is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it interacts with STIM1, a key protein involved in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Yang2019Tmem178). TMEM178A acts as a negative regulator of SOCE by associating with STIM1, thereby reducing STIM1 puncta formation, which is essential for calcium influx into cells (Yang2019Tmem178). This interaction is crucial for maintaining calcium homeostasis and preventing calcium overload, which can lead to cytotoxicity (Yang2019Tmem178).

In healthy human cells, TMEM178A's regulation of calcium levels is vital for controlling the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a component of the innate immune response. By modulating calcium fluxes, TMEM178A helps prevent excessive inflammasome activation and the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β (Khanna2023Tmem178). This function is particularly important in macrophages, where TMEM178A helps maintain normal inflammatory responses and cellular function (Khanna2023Tmem178). The protein's role in calcium signaling and inflammasome regulation underscores its importance in immune homeostasis and inflammation control.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TMEM178 gene have been implicated in several inflammatory conditions, particularly those involving excessive cytokine production. TMEM178 acts as a negative regulator of inflammatory responses in myeloid cells, including macrophages and monocytes. Its downregulation is associated with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1β, contributing to conditions like cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) (Khanna2023Tmem178; Mahajan2019Plcγ2Tmem178).

In CSS, TMEM178 deficiency leads to heightened macrophage activation and severe inflammatory responses, characterized by increased spleen size, liver infiltrates, and elevated circulating IL-6 levels (Mahajan2019Plcγ2Tmem178). In sJIA, reduced TMEM178 expression correlates with elevated IL-1β levels, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Khanna2023Tmem178).

TMEM178 also regulates store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) in myeloid cells by interacting with STIM1. Alterations in this interaction can lead to increased intracellular calcium levels, further promoting inflammatory cytokine production and osteoclastogenesis, which are relevant to inflammatory bone loss in conditions like sJIA (decker2015role; Yang2019Tmem178). These findings highlight TMEM178's potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
TMEM178A, a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, is known to interact with several key proteins involved in calcium signaling pathways. One of its primary interactions is with STIM1, a crucial component of store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). TMEM178A binds to STIM1 through their transmembrane domains, specifically involving residues G225 of STIM1 and L212/M216 of TMEM178A. This interaction negatively regulates SOCE by inhibiting the formation of STIM1 puncta, which are essential for activating the calcium channel ORAI1 (Wang2021Proteins; Yang2019Tmem178).

The interaction between TMEM178A and STIM1 is dependent on the calcium content of the endoplasmic reticulum. When ER calcium is depleted, the association between TMEM178A and STIM1 is reduced, allowing for increased STIM1/ORAI1 complex formation and subsequent calcium influx (Wang2021Proteins; Yang2019Tmem178). TMEM178A also competes with ORAI1 for binding to STIM1, further modulating calcium entry into the cell (Yang2019Tmem178).

These interactions play a significant role in regulating calcium-dependent processes in myeloid cells, including the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is linked to inflammatory responses (Khanna2023Tmem178).
