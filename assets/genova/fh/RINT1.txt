# RINT1

## Overview
RINT1 (RAD50 interactor 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes essential for maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis. The protein, also referred to as RAD50 interactor 1, is integral to the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, through its interaction with the RAD50 protein. Additionally, RINT1 is a crucial component of the NRZ complex, which is involved in retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum, playing a significant role in protein sorting and vesicle trafficking. The protein is also implicated in autophagy and cell cycle regulation, contributing to centrosome integrity and chromosomal segregation. Mutations in the RINT1 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including hereditary spastic paraplegia and certain cancers, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Cousin2019RINT1; Gomes2020RINT1; Launay2023RINT1).

## Function
RINT1 (RAD50 interactor 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the DNA damage response, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through its interaction with RAD50 (Gomes2020RINT1; Grigaravicius2015Rint1). RINT1 is also a key component of the NRZ complex, which is crucial for retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ensuring proper protein sorting and cellular homeostasis (Cousin2019RINT1; Launay2023RINT1).

In the context of the Golgi apparatus, RINT1 is involved in the assembly of SNARE complexes at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), interacting with the COG complex to facilitate vesicle trafficking and maintain Golgi structure (Arasaki2013A). It also plays a role in autophagy, with its dysfunction leading to impaired autophagic flux and ER stress (Launay2023RINT1; Grigaravicius2015Rint1).

RINT1 is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, centrosome integrity, and chromosomal segregation, contributing to proper cell division and development (Gomes2020RINT1; Launay2023RINT1). Its involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RINT1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, including infantile-onset recurrent acute liver failure (RALF) and skeletal abnormalities. These conditions are characterized by episodes of liver failure often triggered by fever or infection, and skeletal abnormalities such as vertebral body irregularities and femoral head epiphyses irregularities (Cousin2019RINT1). RINT1 mutations also contribute to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a condition marked by spastic paraplegia, ataxia, and optic nerve hypoplasia, due to disruptions in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function (Launay2023RINT1; Quiroz2024Biallelic).

In the context of cancer, RINT1 has been implicated as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene. Overexpression and somatic missense mutations of RINT1 are associated with colorectal cancer, while germline variants are linked to increased risk of Lynch syndrome-associated cancers, including breast, colorectal, endometrial, and gastric cancers (Otterpohl2017Evaluation). These mutations may alter protein-protein interactions, affecting vesicle trafficking and contributing to tumorigenesis (Otterpohl2017Evaluation).

RINT1 deficiency is also linked to neurodegenerative disorders due to its role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing ER stress and autophagy inhibition, which are crucial for neuronal health (Grigaravicius2015Rint1).

## Interactions
RINT1 (RAD50 interactor 1) is involved in various protein interactions critical for cellular processes. It is a component of the NRZ complex, which includes NBAS and ZW10, and plays a role in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Cousin2019RINT1; Launay2023RINT1). RINT1 interacts with SNARE proteins such as syntaxin 18 at the ER and syntaxin 16 at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), facilitating SNARE complex assembly (Arasaki2013A; Launay2023RINT1). It also binds to components of the COG complex, specifically Cog1 and Cog3, which are involved in maintaining TGN protein localization (Arasaki2013A).

RINT1's interaction with the COG complex is mediated by its N-terminal region, which also interacts with ZW10, indicating that RINT1 can interact with the COG complex independently of ZW10 (Arasaki2013A). The protein also forms a subcomplex with ZW10, p31, and NAG, crucial for membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi (kaminska2016post). Additionally, RINT1 interacts with UVRAG, which is involved in autophagy initiation and Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport (Cousin2019RINT1). These interactions highlight RINT1's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in various transport pathways.
