# MATN4

## Overview
MATN4 is a gene that encodes the protein matrilin 4, a member of the matrilin family of extracellular matrix proteins. Matrilin 4 is characterized as a modular, multisubunit adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the structural organization and biogenesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM). It is primarily expressed in cartilage and connective tissues, where it facilitates interactions between collagen-containing fibrils and other matrix components, thereby contributing to tissue integrity and development (Korpos2005Expression; Paulsson2018Matrilins). The protein is notable for its structural features, including von Willebrand factor A domains and epidermal growth factor-like domains, which are essential for its function in cell signaling and protein binding. Matrilin 4 is also implicated in the differentiation and function of chondrocytes and osteoblasts, highlighting its importance in cartilage and bone development (Korpos2005Expression). Despite its recognized roles, the specific molecular activities of matrilin 4 in healthy human cells remain incompletely understood (paakkonen2008comparative).

## Structure
MATN4 (matrilin 4) is a member of the matrilin family of extracellular matrix proteins, characterized by its distinct molecular structure. The protein typically features a von Willebrand factor A domain, which is crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions. It also contains epidermal growth factor-like domains, which are often involved in cell signaling and protein binding. Additionally, MATN4 includes a coiled-coil domain, which facilitates the formation of oligomeric structures through the assembly of multiple protein subunits.

The quaternary structure of MATN4 is defined by its ability to form oligomers, primarily through disulfide bonds. These covalent bonds contribute to the stability and functional integrity of the protein. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in MATN4 and play a significant role in enhancing its stability and function. Glycosylation can affect the protein's solubility, resistance to proteolysis, and interactions with other extracellular matrix components.

The combination of these structural features allows MATN4 to perform its role in the extracellular matrix effectively, contributing to the structural organization and mechanical properties of tissues. The presence of these domains and modifications underscores the complexity and functional versatility of MATN4 within the matrilin protein family.

## Function
MATN4 (matrilin 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the organization and biogenesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Matrilin 4 is a modular, multisubunit adaptor protein that mediates interactions between collagen-containing fibrils and other matrix constituents, contributing to the structural integrity of tissues (Paulsson2018Matrilins). It is primarily expressed in cartilage and connective tissues, where it plays a role in cell adhesion and tissue development (Korpos2005Expression).

In odontoblasts, MATN4 is specifically expressed and is thought to have a role in dentine formation, although its precise function in healthy human cells remains unclear (paakkonen2008comparative). The protein forms trimers and contains von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domains, which are involved in its structural configuration and interactions within the ECM (Paulsson2018Matrilins).

Matrilin 4 is also involved in the differentiation and function of chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as evidenced by its expression during cartilage and bone development (Korpos2005Expression). Despite its significant role in ECM interactions, the specific molecular activities of matrilin 4 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed in the available literature.
