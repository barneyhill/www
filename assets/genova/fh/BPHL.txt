# BPHL

## Overview
The BPHL gene encodes the biphenyl hydrolase-like protein, a serine hydrolase enzyme that is part of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. This enzyme is characterized by a catalytic triad and a Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Kim2004A; Marsillach2014Human). BPHL is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, with lower expression levels in other tissues, and plays a crucial role in both detoxification processes and drug metabolism. It is particularly noted for its efficiency in hydrolyzing homocysteine thiolactone, a metabolite associated with cardiovascular diseases, and for activating antiviral prodrugs such as valacyclovir and valganciclovir (Marsillach2014Human; Hu2018Effect). The enzyme's activity and expression have significant implications in clinical contexts, including cancer progression and genetic disorders (Ren2023Inhibition; Kırsaçlıoğlu2023Veryearlyonset).

## Structure
The human biphenyl hydrolase-like protein (BPHL) is a serine hydrolase characterized by a Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif and a catalytic triad consisting of Ser 122, His 255, and Asp 227, which are typical features of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family (Kim2004A; Marsillach2014Human). The primary structure of BPHL includes a sequence of amino acids that form this catalytic triad, essential for its enzymatic activity. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, common in proteins with the alpha/beta hydrolase fold, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of BPHL involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its function as a hydrolase, accommodating hydrophobic acyl groups and nucleoside analogues within its substrate-binding pocket (Kim2004A). This structural arrangement allows BPHL to exhibit substrate specificity, particularly for hydrophobic amino acid ester prodrugs (Kim2004A).

There is no specific information on the quaternary structure of BPHL or any post-translational modifications in the provided context. The protein's role in hydrolyzing and activating antiviral prodrugs like valacyclovir and valganciclovir suggests its importance in xenobiotic metabolism (Kim2004A).

## Function
The BPHL gene encodes a serine hydrolase enzyme known as biphenyl hydrolase-like protein, which plays a significant role in detoxifying homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL), a reactive metabolite associated with various diseases, including cardiovascular disorders. BPHL functions as a highly efficient homocysteine thiolactonase (HCTLase), with a catalytic efficiency surpassing other known HCTL detoxifying enzymes like paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and bleomycin hydrolase (Blmh) (Marsillach2014Human). This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidney, with lower levels in the intestine, heart, and skeletal muscle, indicating its role in maintaining cellular health by preventing the toxic effects of HCTL (Marsillach2014Human).

BPHL is also involved in drug metabolism, particularly in the hydrolytic activation of antiviral prodrugs such as valacyclovir and valganciclovir, converting them into their active forms. This activity highlights its importance in pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy (Marsillach2014Human; Hu2018Effect). The enzyme's activity is inhibited by valacyclovir and L-proline benzyl ester, suggesting its role in drug metabolism extends to interactions with other compounds (Marsillach2014Human).

## Clinical Significance
The BPHL gene, encoding the biphenyl hydrolase-like enzyme, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in drug metabolism and cellular processes. In lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, alterations in BPHL expression have been associated with tumor progression. Studies have shown that BPHL knockdown in lung cancer cell lines results in decreased proliferation, increased apoptosis, and reduced metastasis, suggesting that BPHL may promote tumor growth by enhancing proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Ren2023Inhibition).

BPHL also plays a significant role in detoxifying homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL), a metabolite linked to cardiovascular and other diseases. Its high catalytic efficiency in hydrolyzing HCTL suggests that BPHL is crucial in preventing the toxic effects associated with elevated homocysteine levels, which are risk factors for cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neurological diseases (Marsillach2014Human).

Additionally, a case of very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) in an infant was linked to a partial deletion involving the BPHL gene, highlighting the potential for severe clinical presentations due to genetic defects affecting BPHL (Kırsaçlıoğlu2023Veryearlyonset).
