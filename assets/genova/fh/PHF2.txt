# PHF2

## Overview
PHF2 (PHD finger protein 2) is a gene that encodes a histone demethylase protein involved in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. The protein, also named PHD finger protein 2, is characterized by the presence of a plant homeodomain (PHD) and a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which are crucial for its function in recognizing specific histone marks and influencing transcriptional activity. PHF2 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell differentiation, metabolism, and maintaining chromatin structure, particularly in neural stem cells. It acts as a transcriptional corepressor by modulating histone methylation states, specifically targeting histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), and is involved in the repression of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene transcription. The protein's interactions with other transcription factors and its involvement in adipogenesis and cancer progression highlight its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Shi2014PHD; Wen2010Recognition; Yang2018Epigenetic).

## Structure
PHF2 (PHD finger protein 2) is characterized by the presence of a plant homeodomain (PHD) and a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain. The PHD domain is crucial for recognizing and binding to histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), which is essential for its function in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Shi2014PHD; Wen2010Recognition). The PHD finger of PHF2 forms a hydrophobic cage with specific residues, including Tyr 7, Tyr 14, Met 20, and Trp 29, which are critical for binding H3K4me3 (Shi2014PHD).

The PHF2 protein structure includes two zinc finger motifs within the PHD domain, coordinated by specific residues, and features two antiparallel β-sheets and three short α-strands (Wen2010Recognition). The Jumonji domain, although structurally similar to other Jumonji domains, does not exhibit demethylase activity on histone peptides, possibly due to the unique presence of tyrosine (Y321) instead of histidine as a metal ligand (Horton2011Structural).

PHF2's structure allows it to interact with metal ions, forming an octahedral coordination with Fe2+ or Ni2+, involving the HxD motif and other ligands (Horton2011Structural). Despite its structural features, PHF2's demethylase activity is not required for its role in repressing rRNA transcription, indicating its function may involve other regulatory mechanisms (Shi2014PHD).

## Function
PHF2 (PHD finger protein 2) is a histone demethylase that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. It specifically targets histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), a mark associated with transcriptional repression, and is involved in chromatin remodeling processes that influence cell differentiation and metabolism (Wen2010Recognition; Yang2018Epigenetic).

PHF2 functions as a transcriptional corepressor by repressing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene transcription. It achieves this by antagonizing PHF8, another PHD finger protein, and recruiting the methyltransferase SUV39H1 to the rDNA promoter. This repression is dependent on PHF2's ability to bind to H3K4me3, a histone mark associated with transcriptional activation, rather than its demethylase activity (Shi2014PHD).

In neural stem cells, PHF2 is crucial for maintaining chromatin structure and preventing DNA damage. It regulates cell cycle gene transcription, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and genome stability. PHF2 binds to gene promoters, particularly around transcription start sites, and is associated with H3K4me2/3 histone marks, which are linked to transcriptional activation (Pappa2019PHF2).

PHF2's activity is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it contributes to transcriptional regulation and cellular homeostasis (Wen2010Recognition).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PHF2 gene, which encodes a histone demethylase, have been implicated in various cancers. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly B-cell ALL (B-ALL), low PHF2 expression is associated with poor prognostic markers, such as higher bone marrow blast percentage and delayed remission after chemotherapy. This suggests that PHF2 expression levels could serve as a marker for disease severity and treatment response in B-ALL (Ge2017Plant). In breast cancer, PHF2 is analyzed for genetic alterations, including deletions and methylation, which may contribute to genetic instability and increased cellular proliferation (Sinha2008Alterations).

In lung cancer, PHF2 phosphorylation by AMPK is crucial for suppressing metastasis, and its reduced expression correlates with poor prognosis. High PHF2 expression and phosphorylation are linked to better survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Dong2023Phosphorylation). In colorectal and gastric cancers, PHF2 is often downregulated or mutated, affecting its tumor suppressor functions, particularly in cancers with high microsatellite instability (Lee2016Histone). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, high PHF2 expression is associated with favorable clinicopathological features and better survival, although it is not an independent prognostic factor (Lee2017Implication).

## Interactions
PHF2 (PHD finger protein 2) is known to participate in several physical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in epigenetic regulation. It interacts with major adipogenic transcription factors, specifically C/EBPα and C/EBPδ, through its Jumonji domain. These interactions are crucial for forming transcriptional complexes necessary for adipogenesis, as PHF2 binds to the promoters of key adipogenic genes such as PPARG, CEBPA, and FABP4 during fat cell differentiation (Lee2014The).

PHF2 also contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger that specifically recognizes trimethylation on histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). This recognition is essential for PHF2's function in demethylating H3K9me1 at rDNA promoters, which regulates rRNA expression. The PHD finger's ability to bind H3K4me3 is necessary for PHF2's occupancy at these promoters, highlighting its role in histone modification cross-talk (Wen2010Recognition).

In the context of cancer, PHF2 is overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), suggesting its involvement in tumor progression. However, specific interactions with other proteins in this context are not detailed (Sun2013Overexpression).
