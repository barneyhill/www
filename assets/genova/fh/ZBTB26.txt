# ZBTB26

## Overview
ZBTB26 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 26, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding, and a BTB domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. ZBTB26 plays a significant role in thyroid development and function, as evidenced by its expression in the thyroid gland and its involvement in the development of thyroid precursor tissue. The protein is part of a network of genes associated with congenital hypothyroidism, interacting with other key genes such as PAX8 and NKX2-1. Variants in the ZBTB26 gene have been linked to congenital hypothyroidism, highlighting its clinical significance in thyroid dysgenesis (Vick2021Identification).

## Function
ZBTB26 is a gene that encodes a DNA-binding protein involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein contains zinc finger and BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-Ã -brac) domains, which are typically associated with DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, suggesting a role in regulating gene expression patterns. In healthy human cells, ZBTB26 is implicated in thyroid development, as it is expressed in the thyroid gland and plays a crucial role in the development of thyroid precursor tissue. Knockdown experiments in model organisms, such as the African clawed frog, have shown that ZBTB26 is essential for normal thyroid development, with its absence leading to reduced thyroid anlage and impaired tissue development (Vick2021Identification).

ZBTB26 is also part of a network of proteins that includes other genes involved in congenital hypothyroidism, such as PAX8, NKX2-1, and UBEI, indicating its involvement in thyroid genesis and function (Vick2021Identification). The gene's function in healthy cells involves transcription regulation, and it may influence growth and development, as suggested by its association with traits like height and birth weight in genome-wide association studies (Vick2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZBTB26 gene have been identified as a potential risk factor for congenital hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by impaired thyroid development in newborns. Studies have identified specific variants in ZBTB26, such as the c.707T>C substitution, which results in an amino acid change (p.H236R) and is associated with congenital hypothyroidism due to thyroid dysgenesis. This variant has a low allele frequency in Europeans and is absent in East Asians, but it is present in Africans, indicating population-specific differences (Vick2021Identification). Another study identified a de novo missense mutation in ZBTB26 in a newborn with congenital hypothyroidism, further supporting its role in this condition (Vick2021Identification).

Functional studies using animal models, such as Xenopus laevis, have demonstrated that knockdown of zbtb26 leads to smaller thyroid anlagen, suggesting its critical role in thyroid development. The reduction in thyroid size was linked to decreased expression of pax2, a gene involved in thyroid development, indicating that ZBTB26 may regulate pax2 expression (Vick2021Identification). These findings suggest that mutations and alterations in ZBTB26 expression can disrupt normal thyroid development, potentially leading to congenital hypothyroidism.

## Interactions
ZBTB26 is a zinc finger transcription factor that has been identified to interact with specific DNA motifs. It binds to the DNA motif UW.Motif.0146 (ATTTCTGG) as demonstrated through enhanced yeast one-hybrid (eY1H) assays, but does not bind to its mutated version. This interaction is supported by the enrichment of gene promoters containing this motif in ChIP-seq peaks for ZBTB26, indicating a functional relationship between ZBTB26 and its target DNA sequences (Shrestha2018Discovering).

In terms of protein interactions, ZBTB26 has been linked to other genes involved in primary hypothyroidism through network analysis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed connections between ZBTB26 and genes such as UBE2I, NKX2-1, and PAX8, which are all located in the nucleus. Protein-protein interactions were identified between ZBTB26 and UBE2I, as well as between UBE2I and NKX2-1, and an interaction between PAX8 and NKX2-1 was also described. These interactions suggest that ZBTB26 may play a role in the regulation of thyroid development and function (Vick2021Identification). However, specific physical interactions of ZBTB26 with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available excerpts.
