# SOWAHC

## Overview
The SOWAHC gene encodes the protein sosondowah ankyrin repeat domain family member C, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. While the specific biological functions of the SOWAHC protein are still under investigation, it has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders. The gene's expression and methylation status have been associated with prognostic outcomes in cancers such as pancreatic and bladder cancer, as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Guo2021HELQ; Yang2019Prognostic; Xiao2022A). Additionally, genetic variations involving SOWAHC have been linked to cognitive abilities, suggesting a broader role in human health and disease (Huguet2024Effects).

## Clinical Significance
The SOWAHC gene has been implicated in various cancers and other conditions through alterations in its expression and methylation status. In pancreatic cancer, SOWAHC is part of a four-gene signature associated with poor prognosis. High expression levels of SOWAHC correlate with poor overall survival and are linked to immune dysregulation, including a negative correlation with CD8+ T cells and a positive association with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Xiao2022A). In bladder cancer, SOWAHC's methylation status is negatively correlated with its mRNA expression, and both are significantly associated with patient prognosis, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for survival prediction (Yang2019Prognostic).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), SOWAHC expression is associated with unmutated CLL and shows potential prognostic value, although its role in treatment response is less clear (Guo2021HELQ). Additionally, a duplication involving SOWAHC at 2q12.3 has been linked to positive effects on cognitive ability, indicating a potential role in neurological processes (Huguet2024Effects). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of SOWAHC across different diseases.
