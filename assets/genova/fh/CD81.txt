# CD81

## Overview
CD81 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tetraspanin family, which is characterized by four transmembrane domains and is involved in various cellular processes, including immune cell function and viral entry. The CD81 protein, also known as TAPA-1, plays a pivotal role in the formation of the CD19 complex on B cells, which is essential for effective antibody responses and memory B cell formation (van2010CD81). It is also involved in signal transduction and cell adhesion, forming complexes with other proteins such as CD19, CD21, and Leu-13, which are crucial for reducing the activation threshold of B cells (Levy1998CD81). Additionally, CD81 serves as a co-receptor for the hepatitis C virus, facilitating viral entry into liver cells (Bruening2018Hepatitis). The protein's interactions and structural features, such as its extracellular loops, enable it to participate in the formation of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, which are important for its function in cellular communication and immune response (Seigneuret2006Complete; Schmidt2016Oligomerization).

## Structure
The CD81 protein is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, characterized by four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops: a small extracellular loop (EC1) and a large extracellular loop (EC2) (Seigneuret2006Complete; Rajesh2012Structural). The transmembrane domain is organized as a four-stranded left-handed coiled coil, with the helices forming a compact cylindrical structure (Seigneuret2006Complete). The EC2 domain is crucial for interaction capabilities and is organized into a conserved membrane-proximal subdomain and a variable subdomain (Seigneuret2006Complete).

The protein's structure includes several key features: the N- and C-terminal regions are close to the intracellular membrane surface, with the N-terminal region containing cysteine residues that are palmitoylated (Seigneuret2006Complete). CD81 is not glycosylated, unlike other tetraspanins (Seigneuret2006Complete). The transmembrane domain is predominantly hydrophobic, with a few polar residues, and contains six palmitoylable cysteines (Seigneuret2006Complete).

The EC2 domain has a mushroom shape, protruding from the bilayer, and is involved in binding the E2 glycoprotein of the hepatitis C virus (Seigneuret2006Complete). The protein forms tetraspanin-enriched microdomains by associating with other tetraspanins and interaction partners (Schmidt2016Oligomerization). The flexibility of the EC2 domain is thought to facilitate CD81 oligomerization (Schmidt2016Oligomerization).

## Function
The CD81 gene encodes a protein that is part of the tetraspanin family, which plays a significant role in immune cell function, particularly in B cells. CD81 is crucial for the formation of the CD19 complex on B cells, which is essential for proper antibody responses and memory B cell formation. It facilitates the correct expression and maturation of CD19 on the cell membrane, which is vital for B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and immune response (van2010CD81).

CD81 is involved in signal transduction and cell adhesion processes. It forms a complex with CD19, CD21, and Leu-13 on B cells, which reduces the threshold for B cell activation by bridging antigen-specific recognition and CD21-mediated complement recognition (Levy1998CD81). The protein is also associated with integrins, such as α4β1, facilitating adhesion in immune cells (Levy1998CD81).

In T cells, CD81 associates with CD4 and CD8, providing a costimulatory signal with CD3, which is important for T cell activation and function (Levy1998CD81). CD81's interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular processes highlight its importance in maintaining immune system function and facilitating communication between cells (Levy1998CD81).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD81 gene can lead to significant clinical consequences, particularly affecting the immune system. A notable example is a homozygous splice site mutation in CD81, which disrupts the formation of the CD19 complex, resulting in antibody deficiency. This mutation leads to a lack of CD81 and CD19 expression on B cells, causing severe hypogammaglobulinemia and impaired antibody responses to vaccinations (van2010CD81). Patients with this mutation may experience recurrent infections and autoimmune manifestations, such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura and thrombocytopenia (van2010CD81).

Alterations in CD81 expression levels are also implicated in various cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high CD81 expression is associated with poor prognosis, increased chemoresistance, and enhanced leukemia aggressiveness (Gonzales2023Tetraspanin). CD81 is also involved in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer, where it promotes tumor initiation and metastasis through interactions with CD44 (Ramos2022Machine).

CD81's role extends to viral infections, where it serves as a co-receptor for hepatitis C virus, influencing viral entry and infectivity (Bailly2023Targeting). These findings highlight CD81 as a critical factor in both immune function and disease pathogenesis.

## Interactions
CD81, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in various cellular processes. It forms complexes with proteins such as CD19, CD21, and Leu-13 on B cells, which are important for cell adhesion, costimulation, and reducing the activation threshold of B cells (Levy1998CD81). In T cells, CD81 associates with CD4 and CD8, providing a costimulatory signal alongside CD3 (Levy1998CD81). 

CD81 also plays a significant role in the entry of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) into liver cells. It interacts with the viral envelope protein E2 and forms a receptor complex with proteins like calpain-5 (CAPN5) and CBLB, which are essential for HCV entry (Bruening2018Hepatitis). The protein is involved in organizing signaling networks in liver cell membranes, facilitating pathways such as ephrin receptor signaling, which are relevant for viral entry (Bruening2018Hepatitis).

Additionally, CD81 interacts with other tetraspanins and integrins, forming a network known as the 'tetraspanin web'. These interactions are influenced by post-translational modifications like palmitoylation, which is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of CD81 in protein interactions (Delandre2009Mutation).
