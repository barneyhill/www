# CLOCK

## Overview
The CLOCK gene encodes the clock circadian regulator protein, a pivotal component of the molecular circadian clock in mammals. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating the expression of genes involved in circadian rhythms. The CLOCK protein forms a heterodimer with BMAL1, another core circadian protein, to drive the transcription of genes that control daily physiological and behavioral cycles. These include the Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) genes, which participate in a feedback loop that modulates the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex, thereby maintaining the circadian rhythm (Teboul2005Atypical; Mazzoccoli2012Clock). Beyond its role in circadian regulation, CLOCK is involved in chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation, processes essential for transcriptional activation (Mazzoccoli2012Clock). Mutations in the CLOCK gene have been linked to various mood and metabolic disorders, underscoring its significance in both mental health and metabolic regulation (Turek2005Obesity; McClung2007Circadian).

## Structure
The CLOCK protein is a core component of the circadian clock, characterized by its basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and PAS (PER-ARNT-SIM) domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions. The bHLH domain is crucial for dimerization and DNA binding, forming a four-helical bundle with BMAL1, essential for the stability of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex (Huang2012Crystal). The PAS domains, specifically PAS-A and PAS-B, are involved in intermolecular interactions, with the PAS-A domain forming a domain-swapped helical interface with BMAL1 (Huang2012Crystal). The PAS-B domain of CLOCK interacts with the CRY protein, a negative regulator in the circadian clock mechanism, through its α-helical face (Huang2012Crystal).

The tertiary structure of CLOCK within the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex reveals an asymmetric heterodimer with tightly intertwined domains, highlighting the importance of these interactions for the complex's stability and function (Huang2012Crystal). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a heterodimeric complex with BMAL1, which is essential for the periodicity of the circadian oscillator (Huang2012Crystal). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating the stability and function of the CLOCK protein (Partch2014Molecular).

## Function
The CLOCK gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the circadian molecular clock in mammals, playing a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms at the cellular level. In healthy human cells, the CLOCK protein forms a heterodimer with BMAL1, a transcriptional activator complex that binds to E-box cis-regulatory enhancer sequences in the promoters of target genes, such as Period (Per1-3) and Cryptochrome (Cry1-2), initiating their transcription (Teboul2005Atypical; Mazzoccoli2012Clock). This transcriptional activity is part of a feedback loop essential for maintaining circadian rhythms, where the PER and CRY proteins inhibit their own transcription by interacting with the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex (Mazzoccoli2012Clock).

CLOCK is also involved in protein acetylation and chromatin modification, which are crucial for transcriptional activation. It acetylates histones H3 and H4 and BMAL1, facilitating the recruitment of coactivator complexes and chromatin remodeling (Mazzoccoli2012Clock). The CLOCK protein's activity is modulated by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitylation, which are critical for maintaining the timing and amplitude of circadian oscillations (Mazzoccoli2012Clock). These molecular processes underscore CLOCK's importance in regulating metabolic rhythms and maintaining energy and nutrient homeostasis in alignment with daily activity cycles (Mazzoccoli2012Clock).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CLOCK gene are associated with several clinical conditions, particularly mood disorders and metabolic syndromes. In the context of mood disorders, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3′ flanking region of the CLOCK gene (3111 T to C) is linked to a higher recurrence rate of bipolar episodes, greater insomnia, and decreased need for sleep in bipolar patients. However, this SNP does not show a general association with major depressive disorder (MDD) (McClung2007Circadian). CLOCK gene mutations have also been implicated in mania-like behaviors, as demonstrated in Clock mutant mice, which exhibit hyperactivity, decreased sleep, and increased reward-seeking behavior. These behaviors can be mitigated by lithium, a common mood stabilizer, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Roybal2007Mania-like).

In terms of metabolic disorders, Clock mutant mice display symptoms of metabolic syndrome, including obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia. These mice also show altered expression of neuropeptides involved in appetite regulation, indicating the CLOCK gene's role in metabolic processes beyond circadian rhythm regulation (Turek2005Obesity). The Clock Δ19 mutation in mice leads to impaired glucose tolerance and hypoinsulinemia, highlighting its impact on glucose metabolism and diabetes (Marcheva2010Disruption).

## Interactions
The CLOCK protein is a central component of the circadian clock, forming a heterodimer with BMAL1 to activate transcription of target genes by binding to E-box elements in DNA. In mammals, CLOCK interacts with BMAL1 to activate the transcription of period (per) and cryptochrome (cry) genes, which are involved in a feedback loop that represses the transcriptional activity of the BMAL1/CLOCK complex (Mosier2021Circadian). PER2, a key circadian protein, directly interacts with CLOCK, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Langmesser2008Interaction). This interaction is significant in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and piriform cortex, suggesting a role in maintaining circadian rhythms in these brain regions (Langmesser2008Interaction).

CRY1 and CRY2, although not directly interacting with CLOCK in some systems, influence the interaction between PER2 and BMAL1, with CRY2 having a more pronounced effect on increasing reporter activity (Langmesser2008Interaction). The interactions of CLOCK with these proteins are crucial for the regulation of circadian rhythms, as they modulate the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex (Langmesser2008Interaction). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein-protein interactions that underlie the function of the circadian clock.
