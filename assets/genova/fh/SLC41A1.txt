# SLC41A1

## Overview
SLC41A1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 41 member 1, which functions as a magnesium transporter. This protein is an integral membrane protein characterized by its 10 transmembrane domains, which facilitate the transport of magnesium and other divalent cations across the plasma membrane (Goytain2005Functional). SLC41A1 is part of the solute carrier family 41 and shares structural similarities with prokaryotic MgtE Mg2+ transporters, indicating a conserved mechanism of action across species (Franken2022Structural). The protein plays a critical role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular processes, including bioenergetics and cell proliferation (Kolisek2013Substitution). SLC41A1's activity is regulated by magnesium levels and is involved in both the uptake and extrusion of Mg2+, functioning independently of sodium ions (Arjona2018SLC41A1). The gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and renal diseases, highlighting its significance in human health (Kolisek2013Substitution; Cibulka2019SNPs).

## Structure
The SLC41A1 protein is a magnesium transporter with a primary structure consisting of 513 amino acids and a molecular mass of approximately 56 kDa (Goytain2005Functionala; Kolisek2013Substitution). Its secondary structure includes 10 putative transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function as an integral membrane protein (Arjona2018SLC41A1; Goytain2005Functionala). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by these transmembrane domains, which facilitate the transport of magnesium and other divalent cations (Goytain2005Functional).

SLC41A1 shares structural similarities with the bacterial MgtE Mg2+ transporters, particularly in the transmembrane spanning helices and conserved motifs PX6GN and P(D/A)X4PX6D, which are important for cation transport (Franken2022Structural). These motifs form the Mg2+ selective pore, which is conserved across species (Arjona2018SLC41A1).

Post-translational modifications of SLC41A1 include phosphorylation at several sites, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C sites, which may regulate its function and localization (Goytain2005Functionala). The protein also contains a potential glycosylation site at amino acid residue N-475 (Goytain2005Functionala).

## Function
The SLC41A1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a magnesium (Mg2+) transporter, playing a crucial role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis in human cells. This protein is part of the solute carrier family 41 and is structurally similar to the prokaryotic MgtE Mg2+ transporters, featuring 10 transmembrane domains (Goytain2005Functional). SLC41A1 is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the transport of Mg2+ and other divalent cations such as Sr2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ba2+, and Cd2+, but not Ca2+, Mn2+, or Ni2+ (Goytain2005Functional).

The protein's activity is regulated by magnesium levels, with its expression increasing in response to low magnesium conditions, indicating its role in magnesium homeostasis (Goytain2005Functional). SLC41A1 is involved in both the uptake and extrusion of Mg2+, functioning independently of sodium ions, which challenges previous notions of it being a Na+-Mg2+ exchanger (Arjona2018SLC41A1). This transporter is essential for maintaining optimal intracellular Mg2+ concentrations, which are critical for various cellular processes, including bioenergetics, regulation of cellular pH, and cell proliferation (Kolisek2013Substitution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC41A1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and renal conditions. The p.Ala350Val mutation is a gain-of-function mutation that enhances magnesium efflux, potentially leading to chronic intracellular magnesium deficiency. This mutation has been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), as it may exacerbate neuronal damage through increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction (Kolisek2013Substitution). Another mutation, p.Arg244His, is a loss-of-function mutation linked to early-onset PD in the Taiwanese population, promoting magnesium retention (Cibulka2019SNPs).

The SLC41A1 gene is also associated with nephronophthisis-like phenotypes, a condition leading to renal failure. Although patients with this condition do not exhibit hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesuria, the magnesium conservation typically seen in kidney failure may mask magnesium reabsorption defects (Arjona2018SLC41A1). Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs708727 have been studied for their potential role in increasing the risk of PD, although findings have been inconsistent across different populations (Cibulka2022Alzheimer’s; Cibulka2019SNPs). These genetic variations highlight the clinical significance of SLC41A1 in magnesium homeostasis and its potential impact on disease progression.

## Interactions
SLC41A1, a magnesium transporter, is known to form high molecular mass complexes in mammalian cells, suggesting its involvement in multiprotein complexes. When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, SLC41A1 forms hetero-oligomeric complexes, potentially with other members of the SLC41 family, such as SLC41A2 and SLC41A3, which are co-expressed under magnesium starvation conditions (Kolisek2008SLC41A1). These interactions may be crucial for its function in magnesium homeostasis.

The protein is also implicated in interactions with signaling pathways. Insulin modulates SLC41A1 activity, influencing magnesium efflux through pathways involving protein kinase A (PKA) and p38 MAPK. Insulin's effect on SLC41A1 is mediated by the PI3K pathway, which is essential for many of its metabolic actions (Mastrototaro2015Insulin). The presence of phosphorylation sites within SLC41A1 suggests that it may be regulated by phosphorylation events, potentially involving protein kinase C (PKC) (Mastrototaro2015Insulin).

SLC41A1 is also linked to oxidative stress responses. It is part of a regulatory axis involving PARK7/DJ-1 and the androgen receptor (AR), where oxidative stress can lead to its overexpression, enhancing magnesium efflux capacity. This interaction is significant in the context of oxidative stress and magnesium homeostasis (Kolisek2015PARK7DJ1).
