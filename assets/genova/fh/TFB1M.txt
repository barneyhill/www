# TFB1M

## Overview
TFB1M is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial transcription factor B1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial gene expression and ribosomal RNA modification. The protein is categorized as a SAM-dependent methyltransferase, characterized by its ability to catalyze the dimethylation of adenines in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA, a modification essential for the stability and function of the mitochondrial ribosome (Metodiev2009Methylation; Guja2013Structural). This function is crucial for mitochondrial translation and energy production, as it impacts the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit and the expression of components necessary for oxidative phosphorylation (Liu2019Structural). TFB1M's interactions within the mitochondria, including its role in transcription initiation, underscore its dual function as both a transcription factor and an rRNA methyltransferase, integral to maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism (Gleyzer2005Control). Mutations and altered expression of TFB1M have been linked to various clinical conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia, type 2 diabetes, and hearing loss, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Wu2019The; Bykhovskaya2004Phenotype; Liu2019Structural).

## Structure
The TFB1M protein exhibits a two-domain architecture typical of SAM-dependent methyltransferases. The N-terminal domain (residues 32-236) forms a Rossman-like methyltransferase fold, characterized by a central seven-stranded beta-sheet flanked by three alpha-helices on each side, which is indicative of the active site (Guja2013Structural). This domain is highly conserved and features a SAM-binding pocket that is acidic and conserved among similar methyltransferases (Guja2013Structural). The C-terminal domain (residues 237-328) consists of five alpha-helices and is believed to mediate RNA substrate specificity (Guja2013Structural).

TFB1M also includes an N-terminal extension (residues 14-31) with a protruding alpha-helix, potentially involved in protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions (Guja2013Structural). The protein's structure is homologous to KsgA/Dim1 ribosomal RNA methyltransferases, with a conserved methyltransferase core that facilitates SAM binding and methyl transfer (Guja2013Structural). The electrostatic surface potential of TFB1M reveals a large basic groove and a negatively charged SAM-binding pocket, which are involved in RNA substrate interaction (Guja2013Structural).

TFB1M's structure is crucial for its role in mitochondrial gene expression, with polymorphisms linked to mitochondrial dysfunctions and diseases such as diabetes (Guja2013Structural).

## Function
TFB1M is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the dimethylation of adenines in the 12S rRNA, a modification essential for the stability and function of the mitochondrial ribosome. This modification is crucial for the assembly and stability of the small ribosomal subunit (28S) in mammalian mitochondria, which is necessary for mitochondrial translation and overall mitochondrial function (Metodiev2009Methylation; Liu2019Structural). TFB1M's activity is indispensable for the translation of mitochondrial genes, impacting ATP production and the expression of components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (Liu2019Structural).

In healthy human cells, TFB1M is involved in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis by ensuring proper ribosomal biogenesis and mitochondrial translation. Its function is vital for cellular energy production and overall cell health, as it regulates the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation (Liu2019Structural). The absence or dysfunction of TFB1M leads to impaired mitochondrial translation, reduced ATP production, and compromised mitochondrial function, highlighting its essential role in cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Metodiev2009Methylation; Liu2019Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TFB1M gene have significant clinical implications. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), upregulation of TFB1M is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including reduced overall survival and disease-free survival. This upregulation is linked to a higher frequency of NPM1 mutations, which are common in AML patients (Wu2019The). 

TFB1M is also implicated in mitochondrial dysfunctions that contribute to metabolic disorders. Deficiency in TFB1M can lead to impaired ATP production and mitochondrial protein translation, which are critical for cellular energy metabolism. This dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) due to reduced insulin release and mitochondrial dysfunction (Liu2019Structural).

In the context of hearing loss, TFB1M is involved in the phenotypic expression of the mitochondrial A1555G mutation, which is associated with non-syndromic deafness. TFB1M modifies mitochondrial RNA, and its altered expression can influence the severity of hearing loss in individuals with this mutation (Bykhovskaya2004Phenotype). Despite previous suggestions, overexpression of TFB1M does not appear to impact hearing or mitoribosomal methylation in mice, challenging its role as a therapeutic target for deafness (Lee2015Overexpression).

## Interactions
TFB1M is involved in several critical interactions within the mitochondria, primarily related to its role in mitochondrial gene translation and ribosome assembly. TFB1M interacts with mitochondrial 12S rRNA, where it catalyzes the dimethylation of adenines in the helix45 (h45) region, a modification essential for the assembly and maturation of mitochondrial ribosomes (Liu2019Structural). This interaction is facilitated by specific residues in TFB1M that form a binding pocket for the rRNA, with mutations in these residues significantly impairing the modification process (Liu2019Structural).

TFB1M also forms part of a complex with mitochondrial RNA polymerase and transcription factor A (TFAM), where it plays a role in transcription initiation. This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial transcription, although TFB1M's transcriptional activation function is largely independent of its RNA methyltransferase activity (Gleyzer2005Control). TFB1M's interaction with TFAM involves a specific domain necessary for transcriptional activation, highlighting its role in coordinating mitochondrial transcription and biogenesis (Gleyzer2005Control).

These interactions underscore TFB1M's dual function as both a transcription factor and an rRNA methyltransferase, integral to maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production.
