# SAMD14

## Overview
SAMD14 is a gene that encodes the protein sterile alpha motif domain containing 14, which is involved in critical cellular processes, particularly within hematopoietic systems. The protein is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for cellular signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, that are vital for cell survival and proliferation (Ray2020Sterile). Additionally, SAMD14 contains a non-canonical capping protein binding (CPB) domain, which interacts with the actin capping protein complex, playing a significant role in erythroid precursor activity and differentiation during stress erythropoiesis (Ray2022Functional). The gene's function is particularly significant in the context of hematopoiesis, where it enhances signaling through the Stem Cell Factor (SCF)/c-Kit pathway, crucial for the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Xu2020SAMD14). SAMD14 has also been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its role as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer and as a driver autoantigen in primary central nervous system lymphoma (Xu2020SAMD14; Thurner2018HyperNglycosylated).

## Structure
The SAMD14 protein is characterized by the presence of a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is a key structural feature located between amino acid residues 323-390. This domain is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrate species and is composed of 68 amino acids, predicted to form five α-helices based on in silico homology modeling (Ray2020Sterile). The SAM domain is crucial for protein self-association and interactions with other proteins, and it may also bind to lipids or RNA, although its specific functional role in SAMD14 is not fully established (Ray2020Sterile).

In addition to the SAM domain, SAMD14 contains a non-canonical capping protein binding (CPB) domain, which is distinct from the SAM domain. This CPB domain is essential for interactions with the actin capping protein (CP) complex, playing a significant role in erythroid precursor activity and differentiation during stress erythropoiesis (Ray2022Functional). The CPB domain includes specific sequences that mediate these interactions, particularly amino acids 37-55 (Ray2022Functional).

The SAMD14 protein's structure and interactions are critical for its function in cellular signaling and survival, particularly in erythroid progenitors (Ray2020Sterile).

## Function
The SAMD14 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling and survival, particularly in hematopoietic processes. In healthy human cells, SAMD14 is involved in hematopoiesis by enhancing signaling through the Stem Cell Factor (SCF)/c-Kit pathway, which is crucial for the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (Xu2020SAMD14). The SAM domain of SAMD14 is essential for mediating protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways, such as the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, which are critical for cell survival and proliferation (Ray2020Sterile).

SAMD14's function is particularly important in erythroid progenitors, where it promotes activity and signaling necessary for erythropoiesis. The SAM domain is unique to SAMD14 and cannot be substituted by similar domains from other proteins, highlighting its specific role in cellular signaling (Ray2020Sterile). SAMD14 also interacts with the F-actin capping protein complex, which is crucial for SCF/Kit signaling in erythroid precursors, further supporting its role in stress erythropoiesis (Ray2022Functional). These interactions and signaling pathways underscore SAMD14's importance in maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis and its potential role as a tumor suppressor gene (Xu2020SAMD14).

## Clinical Significance
The SAMD14 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling and gene expression regulation. In the context of stress erythropoiesis, SAMD14 is crucial for SCF-mediated Kit signaling, which is essential for the expansion and differentiation of erythroid precursors. Disruptions in SAMD14 function, such as the deletion of a regulatory element, lead to defective regenerative erythropoiesis and increased sensitivity to anemia, similar to defects observed in Kit signaling-deficient models (Ray2022Functional).

In gastric cancer, SAMD14 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its promoter hypermethylation strongly associated with reduced gene expression and poor prognosis. This hypermethylation is observed in a significant proportion of primary gastric cancer tissues compared to non-malignant tissues, correlating with advanced cancer stages and poorer differentiation. SAMD14 expression can be reactivated by demethylating agents, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xu2020SAMD14).

SAMD14 is also identified as a driver autoantigen in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), where it is hyper-N-glycosylated. This modification may contribute to its role as an autoantigen, leading to chronic B-cell receptor activation and lymphoma cell proliferation (Thurner2018HyperNglycosylated).

## Interactions
SAMD14 interacts with the barbed end actin capping protein (CP) complex through a non-canonical CP-interaction motif. This interaction is crucial for promoting erythroid precursor activity and differentiation, particularly under stress conditions such as anemia. The CP complex includes components like Capzβ, Capzα1, and Capzα2, and SAMD14's interaction with these proteins is independent of its SAM domain (Ray2022Functional). The SAMD14-CP complex is specifically required for SCF-dependent Kit signaling, which is essential for the expansion and differentiation of erythroid precursors during anemia (Ray2022Functional).

The interaction between SAMD14 and the CP complex is mediated by a non-canonical CP binding domain (CPB) within SAMD14, specifically amino acids 37-55. This domain is essential for the formation of the SAMD14-CP complex, which is dynamically regulated in response to anemia (Ray2022Functional). Mutations in central arginine residues of the CPB domain reduce the interaction with CP complex components, highlighting the importance of these residues for SAMD14's function in stress erythropoiesis (Ray2022Functional).
