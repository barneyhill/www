# RYR1

## Overview
The RYR1 gene encodes the ryanodine receptor 1, a critical transmembrane calcium release channel predominantly located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle cells. This receptor plays a pivotal role in excitation-contraction coupling, facilitating the release of calcium ions necessary for muscle contraction. Structurally, ryanodine receptor 1 is a homotetrameric protein, with each subunit comprising over 5,000 amino acids and organized into distinct domains that contribute to its complex architecture and function (BauerováHlinková2020Structure; Yan2014Structure). The receptor's activity is modulated by various factors, including phosphorylation and protein interactions, which are essential for its role in muscle physiology and adaptation (BravoSagua2020Sarcoplasmic; Ryan2011Identification). Mutations in the RYR1 gene are linked to several congenital myopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle-related diseases (Klein2012Clinical).

## Structure
The ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) is a large calcium release channel located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle cells. It is a homotetrameric protein, with each monomer consisting of over 5,000 amino acids and organized into multiple domains. The primary structure includes key domains such as the N-terminal domain (NTD), central domain, and transmembrane domain (BauerováHlinková2020Structure; Yan2014Structure).

The secondary structure of RYR1 features α-helices and β-strands, forming complex tertiary structures. The NTD is rich in β-strands and α-helices, contributing to armadillo repeats that form a superhelical scaffold (Yan2014Structure). The transmembrane domain is a chimera of voltage-gated sodium and pH-activated ion channels, with a unique assembly of transmembrane helices (BauerováHlinková2020Structure).

RYR1's quaternary structure is characterized by its homotetrameric assembly, with each protomer contributing to the formation of a large ion channel. The structure includes two α-solenoids, which are crucial for protein interactions and function (Efremov2014Architecture). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and nitrosylation regulate RYR1's function, and splice variants can affect its channel properties and tissue-specific expression (Ogawa2020Regulatory).

## Function
The RYR1 gene encodes the ryanodine receptor 1, a crucial calcium release channel located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle cells. This receptor plays a vital role in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, a process essential for muscle contraction. Upon activation by the L-type calcium channel Cav1.1, RYR1 facilitates the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm, triggering muscle contraction (BravoSagua2020Sarcoplasmic; Zorzato1990Molecular).

RYR1 is involved in calcium-induced calcium release (CICR), which is critical for propagating the contraction signal throughout the muscle cell. Unlike cardiac muscle, where calcium entry is necessary for receptor activation, skeletal muscle RYR1 does not require calcium as a ligand for activation (BravoSagua2020Sarcoplasmic). The receptor's activity is modulated by various factors, including phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which can increase the channel's open probability and influence muscle contraction (BravoSagua2020Sarcoplasmic).

In addition to its role in muscle contraction, RYR1 is involved in excitation-transcription coupling, influencing gene expression and contributing to muscle plasticity and adaptation. This includes the regulation of transcription factors and metabolic responses, which are essential for muscle fiber adaptation during exercise (BravoSagua2020Sarcoplasmic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RYR1 gene are associated with a range of congenital myopathies, including central core disease (CCD), malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS), multi-minicore disease (MmD), congenital fiber-type disproportion, centronuclear myopathy (CNM), and King Denborough syndrome. These conditions exhibit varying clinical presentations, from severe muscle weakness to individuals with MHS but no muscle weakness (Todd2018Novel; Klein2012Clinical). CCD is characterized by hypotonia, proximal muscle weakness, and orthopedic complications, while MHS is a pharmacogenetic reaction to certain anesthetics (Klein2012Clinical). 

RYR1 mutations can be inherited in both dominant and recessive patterns, with dominant mutations often being missense mutations located in specific hotspot regions of the gene, particularly in the C-terminal region (Klein2012Clinical). Recessive mutations are more widely distributed and can involve combinations of missense, nonsense, splice-site, and frameshift mutations (Klein2012Clinical). 

Histopathological findings in RYR1-related myopathies often include central cores, fiber-type disproportion, and increased internal nucleation (Klein2012Clinical). The genetic and clinical heterogeneity of these disorders underscores the importance of a genetics-led approach for diagnosis (Todd2018Novel).

## Interactions
RYR1, the ryanodine receptor 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in skeletal muscle cells. It interacts with the calcium homeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein (CHERP), which influences calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum via RyR1. This interaction is significant for the regulation of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle (Ryan2011Identification). CHERP co-localizes with RyR1 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a close functional relationship (Ryan2011Identification).

RYR1 also interacts with the Homer1 EVH1 domain, which binds to proline-rich motifs in RyR1. This interaction is modulated by calcium ion concentrations and involves specific sequences in the SPRY1 and Handle domains of RyR1. The binding of Homer1 EVH1 to these motifs suggests a regulatory role in RyR1 activity (Wang2019Interaction).

These interactions highlight the complex network of protein associations that modulate RYR1's role in calcium signaling and muscle contraction, emphasizing its importance in maintaining proper muscle function and its potential involvement in muscle-related diseases.
