# QRSL1

## Overview
QRSL1 is a gene that encodes the glutaminyl-tRNA amidotransferase subunit QRSL1, a critical component of the GatCAB complex involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This protein plays a pivotal role in the transamidation process, converting misacylated Glu-tRNA^Gln to Gln-tRNA^Gln, which is essential for accurate mitochondrial translation and the proper functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) (Kohda2016A; Friederich2018Pathogenic). As a mitochondrial protein, QRSL1 is integral to maintaining cellular energy metabolism and is implicated in various mitochondrial disorders when mutated, particularly affecting high-energy-demand tissues such as the heart and brain (Kamps2018Genetic; Friederich2018Pathogenic). The gene's significance extends to its involvement in disease mechanisms, including its potential role in cancer progression and mitochondrial stress responses (Auburger2022The; Xu2023ZDHHC9:).

## Structure


## Function
The QRSL1 gene encodes a subunit of the GatCAB complex, specifically the GatA subunit, which is crucial for mitochondrial protein synthesis. In healthy human cells, QRSL1 is involved in the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA, a critical step in protein synthesis within mitochondria (Friederich2018Pathogenic). The GatCAB complex, which includes QRSL1, facilitates the conversion of misacylated Glu-tRNA^Gln to Gln-tRNA^Gln, ensuring accurate translation of the genetic code (Kohda2016A). This process is essential for the proper assembly and function of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS), which is critical for ATP production and overall cellular energy metabolism (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

QRSL1's role in mitochondrial function is underscored by its involvement in the transamidation reaction that charges glutaminyl mt-tRNA (mt-tRNA^Gln) indirectly, a process necessary for mitochondrial protein translation (Murayama2018Recent). The QRSL1 gene is active in the mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy production, which is vital for cellular respiration and energy production (Kamps2018Genetic). Defects in QRSL1 can lead to impaired mitochondrial translation and deficiencies in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, particularly complexes I and IV (Friederich2018Pathogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the QRSL1 gene are associated with several severe mitochondrial disorders, primarily affecting the heart and brain. These mutations can lead to mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and early-onset brain disease, characterized by defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial translation (Kamps2018Genetic; Boczonadi2018Mitochondrial). Specifically, autosomal recessive mutations in QRSL1 have been linked to severe infantile multisystem disease, which includes symptoms such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, encephalomyopathy, and lactic acidosis (Kohda2016A; Friederich2018Pathogenic).

The QRSL1 gene encodes a subunit of the GatCAB complex, which is crucial for the transamidation of Glu-tRNA Gln to Gln-tRNA Gln, a process essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Mutations in QRSL1 can disrupt this process, leading to a combined deficiency in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, particularly complexes I and IV (Kohda2016A; Friederich2018Pathogenic). This disruption results in impaired mitochondrial function, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals.

Patients with QRSL1 mutations often exhibit severe clinical phenotypes, including cardiomyopathy and early lethality, due to the high energy demands of cardiac and neural tissues (Kamps2018Genetic; Friederich2018Pathogenic). The prognosis for individuals with these mutations is generally poor, with many cases resulting in fatal outcomes at a young age (Kamps2018Genetic).

## Interactions
QRSL1, a subunit of the glutaminyl-tRNA amidotransferase complex, plays a crucial role in the formation of correctly charged tRNA molecules. It interacts with other subunits of the complex, such as GatA and GatB, to facilitate the conversion of misacylated Glu-tRNA^Gln to Gln-tRNA^Gln, ensuring accuracy in protein synthesis. This interaction is essential for maintaining the fidelity of protein translation.

QRSL1 is also involved in mitochondrial RNA metabolism, particularly in mt-tRNA aminoacylation disorders. These processes are vital for the correct translation of mtDNA-encoded genes, and defects in these interactions can lead to mitochondrial diseases (Murayama2018Recent).

In the context of disease, QRSL1 has been identified as a significant contributor to the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). It is part of a co-expression module associated with the immune index, indicating its involvement in immune modulation and cancer progression (Xu2023ZDHHC9:).

Additionally, QRSL1 has been identified as a putative CLPP degradation substrate, suggesting a role in stress adaptation and mitochondrial protein degradation pathways (Auburger2022The). These interactions highlight QRSL1's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
