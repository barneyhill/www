# CTSV

## Overview
CTSV is a gene that encodes the protein cathepsin V, a member of the cysteine protease family, specifically the papain-like proteases. Cathepsin V is primarily expressed in tissues such as the thymus, corneal epithelium, and testis, where it plays a crucial role in protein degradation and processing within lysosomes. This protease is involved in various physiological processes, including immune function, tissue remodeling, and cellular homeostasis. Cathepsin V's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with inhibitors like cystatin M/E. It is also implicated in pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis through interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways (Sereesongsaeng2020Cathepsin; Cheng2023Overview).

## Structure
Cathepsin V (CTSV) is a cysteine protease that belongs to the papain-like family of proteases. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain that includes a catalytic triad typically involving cysteine, histidine, and asparagine, which are essential for its proteolytic activity. The secondary structure of CTSV is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure forms a globular shape, which is common among proteases in this family. CTSV is generally monomeric, indicating that it does not typically form quaternary structures with other proteins (Cheng2006Cystatin).

CTSV undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its activity, stability, and localization within the cell. These modifications are crucial for its function in various cellular processes, including its role in cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Cheng2023Overview).

The protein is also known to have specific binding sites that allow it to interact with inhibitors like cystatin M/E, which regulates its activity by binding to distinct non-overlapping sites (Cheng2006Cystatin). These structural features and modifications are integral to CTSV's function in both normal physiology and disease states.

## Function
Cathepsin V (CTSV) is a cysteine protease enzyme primarily expressed in the thymus, corneal epithelium, and testis, where it plays a significant role in protein degradation and processing within lysosomes (Sereesongsaeng2020Cathepsin). In the thymus, CTSV is involved in the processing of the invariant chain during MHC-II antigen presentation, which is crucial for immune function (Sereesongsaeng2020Cathepsin). This activity highlights its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and facilitating proper immune responses.

CTSV is also implicated in tissue remodeling and cellular homeostasis through its role in extracellular matrix degradation (Toss2019Prognostic). It exhibits potent elastase activity, which contributes to its function in tissue remodeling processes (Sereesongsaeng2023Cathepsin). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining cellular protein turnover, ensuring that proteins are adequately processed and degraded within the lysosomal compartment (Wang2022Cathepsin).

While CTSV's specific functions in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed, its expression in normal tissues such as the thymus and testis suggests roles in immune regulation and reproductive processes (Sereesongsaeng2020Cathepsin). The enzyme's involvement in antigen processing and tissue remodeling underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Cathepsin V (CTSV) is implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, where its altered expression is associated with poor prognosis and disease progression. In breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), high CTSV expression correlates with poor prognostic features such as larger tumor size, higher grade, and HER2 amplification. It is linked to shorter local recurrence-free intervals, particularly in patients treated with breast-conserving surgery (Toss2019Prognostic). In ER-positive breast cancer, CTSV expression is associated with poor outcomes by promoting the degradation of GATA3, a transcription factor linked to favorable prognosis. This degradation occurs via the Akt-GSK-3β-FBXW7α pathway, suggesting CTSV as a potential therapeutic target to restore GATA3 expression and improve clinical outcomes (Sereesongsaeng2020Cathepsin).

CTSV also plays a role in cell cycle progression and histone stability in breast cancer cells. It regulates the expression of histones H3 and H4 through the chaperone sNASP, impacting cell proliferation. Depletion of CTSV results in impaired cell proliferation and delayed progression through the G2/M phase, indicating its critical role in cancer cell growth (Sereesongsaeng2023Cathepsin). Elevated CTSV expression is also noted in other malignancies, such as colorectal and thymic epithelial cancers, and is associated with higher tumor grades in hepatocellular and endometrial carcinomas (Sereesongsaeng2020Cathepsin).

## Interactions
Cathepsin V (CTSV) is involved in several interactions with other proteins that influence its role in cancer progression. In breast cancer, CTSV interacts with the zinc finger transcription factor GATA3, promoting its degradation via the proteasome. This interaction is mediated through the Akt-1 and GSK-3β signaling pathways, where CTSV facilitates GATA3 phosphorylation at Ser308, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the E3 ligase FBXW7α (Sereesongsaeng2020Cathepsin). 

In lung cancer, CTSV interacts with adhesion molecules such as fibronectin, E-cadherin, and N-cadherin. These interactions result in the cleavage and downregulation of these molecules, which are crucial for cell adhesion. The degradation of these adhesion molecules by CTSV facilitates cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Wang2022Cathepsin).

CTSV also plays a role in regulating histone stability in breast cancer cells. It influences the expression of the histone chaperone sNASP, which is essential for the stability of histones H3 and H4. CTSV's nuclear localization, facilitated by a bipartite nuclear localization signal, is crucial for maintaining histone stability and proper cell cycle progression (Sereesongsaeng2023Cathepsin).
