# KCNQ2

## Overview
KCNQ2 is a gene that encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 2, a crucial component of the Kv7.x subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels. This protein plays a significant role in regulating neuronal excitability by forming the M-current, which is essential for stabilizing the resting membrane potential and controlling action potential firing. The KCNQ2 protein is characterized by its six transmembrane segments and is primarily active in the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier, where it modulates axonal excitability and signal propagation. It can form heterotetramers with KCNQ3, creating functional M-channels that are vital for neuronal function. Mutations in the KCNQ2 gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental and epileptic disorders, including benign familial neonatal epilepsy and developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Devaux2004KCNQ2; Nappi2020Epileptic; Garofalo2022Molecular).

## Structure
The KCNQ2 protein is a member of the Kv7.x subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels, characterized by a topological arrangement of six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and intracellular NH2 and COOH termini (Garofalo2022Molecular). The S1-S4 segments form the voltage-sensing domain (VSD), with the S4 segment containing positively charged residues that act as the main voltage sensor (Garofalo2022Molecular). The S5-S6 region forms the pore domain, which includes a P-loop that imparts K+ ion selectivity (Garofalo2022Molecular). 

The KCNQ2 channel adopts a domain-swapping conformation, with S5-S6 forming a central ion conduction pore and S1-S4 forming voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) (Li2020Molecular). The VSD is in an activated state, similar to the activated conformation of the VSD in HsKCNQ1-CaM (Li2020Molecular). The channel's central pore domain is surrounded by four voltage-sensing domains that respond to membrane depolarization, triggering structural rearrangements that open the channel gate for ion conduction (Garofalo2022Molecular). 

KCNQ2 can form heterotetramers with KCNQ3, known as M-channels, which are primary regulators of neuronal excitability (Garofalo2022Molecular). The protein's structure is crucial for its function, with mutations linked to various diseases, including epilepsy (Garofalo2022Molecular).

## Function
The KCNQ2 gene encodes a subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically involved in forming the M-current, which is crucial for regulating neuronal excitability. These channels are primarily active in the axon initial segment and nodes of Ranvier, where they play a significant role in modulating axonal excitability and signal propagation (Devaux2004KCNQ2). The M-current, mediated by KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 heteromeric channels, is characterized by its slow activation and deactivation kinetics and its ability to activate at subthreshold membrane potentials without inactivating. This current helps stabilize the resting membrane potential and controls action potential firing, thereby preventing neuronal hyperexcitability (Shahidullah2005Expression; Rogawski2000KCNQ2KCNQ3).

Calmodulin (CaM) acts as an auxiliary subunit for KCNQ2 channels, binding to specific motifs in the C-terminal domain. This interaction is essential for channel function, as it modulates the M-current and membrane excitability (Wen2002Calmodulin; Shahidullah2005Expression). The binding of CaM to KCNQ2 is constitutive, occurring regardless of calcium presence, although certain motifs bind CaM only in the presence of calcium (Wen2002Calmodulin). This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal function and excitability in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNQ2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and epileptic disorders. The gene encodes a subunit of the voltage-gated potassium channel, which is crucial for neuronal excitability. Pathogenic variants in KCNQ2 can lead to benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE), characterized by neonatal seizures with generally normal development, but with a higher risk of seizure recurrence (Milh2015Variable; Dirkx2020The). More severe conditions include developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), known as KCNQ2-encephalopathy, which involves developmental delay and is the most common genetic cause of neonatal-onset DEE (Nappi2020Epileptic; Dirkx2020The).

The phenotypic expression of KCNQ2 mutations is heterogeneous, ranging from benign to severe forms, and can include non-epileptic neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (Nappi2020Epileptic). Specific mutations, such as R201C/H, R144Q, and R198Q, are associated with varying clinical severities and can lead to increased neuronal excitability (Nappi2020Epileptic). The R207W mutation, for example, is linked to myokymia and neonatal epilepsy, suggesting a shared genetic etiology (Dedek2001Myokymia).

KCNQ2 mutations can be either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, affecting the channel's voltage sensitivity and neuronal signaling (Nappi2020Epileptic). These mutations can disrupt normal interactions with proteins like calmodulin, further contributing to the pathophysiology of related disorders (Borgatti2004A).

## Interactions
The KCNQ2 gene encodes a subunit of the potassium voltage-gated channel, which interacts with several proteins, most notably calmodulin (CaM). CaM acts as an auxiliary subunit for KCNQ2 channels, and its binding is crucial for channel function. The interaction between KCNQ2 and CaM is both constitutive and Ca2+-dependent, involving specific binding sites within the KCNQ2 C-terminal tail. These sites are essential for the tethering of CaM, and mutations in these regions can disrupt the interaction, leading to non-functional channels (Wen2002Calmodulin).

CaM binding to KCNQ2 is influenced by calcium ions (Ca2+), which can modulate the interaction. In the presence of Ca2+, CaM undergoes conformational changes that affect its binding to the KCNQ2 channel. This interaction is critical for the channel's activity, as CaM binding is necessary for proper channel function and regulation (Wen2002Calmodulin; Kosenko2013A).

KCNQ2 also forms heterotetramers with KCNQ3, creating functional M-channels that are important for neuronal excitability. These interactions are significant for the channel's role in regulating electrical properties in neurons (Garofalo2022Molecular).
