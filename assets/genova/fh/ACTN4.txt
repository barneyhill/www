# ACTN4

## Overview
ACTN4 is a gene that encodes the protein actinin alpha 4, a member of the α-actinin family, which is primarily involved in the cross-linking of actin filaments. Actinin alpha 4 is categorized as an actin-binding protein and plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is particularly significant in podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney, where it contributes to the stability and mechanosensation of the glomerular filtration barrier (Perico2016Podocyte–actin; Kaplan2000Mutations). Beyond its structural role, actinin alpha 4 is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and gene regulation, through its interactions with other proteins and involvement in transcriptional regulation (Khotin2010Proteomic; Kriger2022Alphaactnin4). Mutations and dysregulation of ACTN4 are associated with diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Tentler2019Role; Kaplan2000Mutations).

## Structure
The ACTN4 protein, encoded by the ACTN4 gene, is a member of the α-actinin family and plays a crucial role in actin filament cross-linking. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form several distinct domains: an actin-binding domain (ABD), a neck region, spectrin repeats, and a C-terminal calmodulin-like domain (CaM-like domain) (Sjöblom2008αActinin; Travers2013Modeling).

The ABD is composed of two calponin homology (CH) domains, CH1 and CH2, which typically adopt a closed conformation stabilized by interdomain interactions. The actin-binding site is located on helix G of CH1, and the opening of the CH domains is necessary for actin binding (Sjöblom2008αActinin; Travers2013Modeling).

The tertiary structure of ACTN4 forms a rod-like shape, with the spectrin repeats contributing to its structural rigidity. These repeats are involved in forming an antiparallel homodimer, which is the quaternary structure of the protein (Sjöblom2008αActinin).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues (Y4, Y31, and Y265), play a significant role in regulating the protein's conformation and actin-binding ability (Travers2013Modeling). The protein also interacts with calcium ions and phosphatidylinositol intermediaries, which are crucial for its function in cell motility and response to external signals (Travers2013Modeling).

## Function
The ACTN4 gene encodes α-actinin-4, a protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and function of the actin cytoskeleton in healthy human cells. α-actinin-4 is an actin-binding and crosslinking protein that is highly enriched in podocyte foot processes, where it contributes to the structural integrity and mechanosensation of these specialized kidney cells (Perico2016Podocyte–actin; Kaplan2000Mutations). It acts as a scaffold for assembling large protein complexes and is involved in crosslinking actin filaments, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and stability (Goode2004Expression).

In podocytes, α-actinin-4 is critical for maintaining adhesion to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) by interacting with integrins and other focal adhesion components (Blaine2020Regulation). This interaction is vital for the normal localization of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, which are necessary for the structural organization of the cytoskeleton and the mechanical characteristics of podocytes (Kaplan2000Mutations). The protein's role extends to signal transduction pathways, indicating its involvement in cellular responses to environmental changes (Goode2004Expression). Overall, α-actinin-4 is essential for the proper function of podocytes and the maintenance of the kidney's filtration barrier.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ACTN4 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disorder characterized by scarring in the glomeruli. Mutations such as K228E, K255E, and G195D in ACTN4 lead to protein aggregation, rapid degradation, and disrupted cytoskeletal functions, contributing to the pathogenesis of FSGS (Yao2004αActinin4Mediated; Feng2016Functional; Bartram2016Threelayered). These mutations often result in increased actin-binding activity and altered protein interactions, which can lead to podocyte dysfunction and proteinuria (Zhao2015αActinin; Kaplan2000Mutations).

In cancer, overexpression of ACTN4 is linked to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It enhances NF-kappaB signaling, promoting cancer cell migration and drug resistance, as seen in cisplatin-resistant and radio-resistant cancer cells (Tentler2019Role). ACTN4's interaction with proteins like Akt1 and its role in regulating p53 stability further contribute to cancer progression and resistance to apoptosis (Tentler2019Role). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ACTN4 in both kidney disease and cancer.

## Interactions
ACTN4 (actinin alpha 4) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the cytoplasm, ACTN4 interacts with structural cytoskeletal proteins, playing a role in the organization of the cytoskeleton by cross-linking actin filaments (Khotin2010Proteomic). In the nucleus, ACTN4 is associated with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) such as hnRNP A1, A2/B1, K, L, C1/C2, and M, suggesting a role in mRNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA packaging, maturation, and trafficking (Khotin2010Proteomic). It also interacts with RNA helicase DDX5 but not with hnRNP F/H (Khotin2010Proteomic).

ACTN4 is known to interact with transcription factors like NF-kB and NF-Y, and with chromatin remodeling proteins such as the INO80 complex and histone deacetylase HDAC7, indicating its involvement in gene regulation (Khotin2010Proteomic; Kriger2022Alphaactnin4). It also forms part of a protein complex with FHL1, ACTN1, and PDLIM1, which is involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation (Sharma2011Identification).

In cancer cell contexts, ACTN4 interacts with MTBP, which inhibits ACTN4-induced cell migration and filopodia formation, highlighting its role in cancer metastasis (Agarwal2012MTBP). These interactions underscore ACTN4's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and transcriptional regulation.
