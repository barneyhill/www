# FAM47C

## Overview
FAM47C is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 47, specifically member C. This protein is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. However, it is implicated in various cellular processes due to its involvement in different pathways. The FAM47C gene has been associated with several medical conditions, including non-obstructive azoospermia, colorectal cancer, and major depressive disorder, suggesting its potential role in both reproductive and mental health, as well as cancer biology. The gene's mutations and variants have been identified in specific contexts, indicating its possible contribution to disease pathogenesis and highlighting the need for further research to understand its functional roles (Teng2018Identification; Oh2024Integration; Zhang2022Whole).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM47C gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. In the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a severe form of male infertility characterized by the absence of sperm due to failed spermatogenesis, a specific frameshift mutation in FAM47C (p.Val118Leufs*40) was identified in a patient, suggesting its potential role as a genetic cause of NOA. This mutation, along with others in meiosis-related pathways, indicates that FAM47C may significantly contribute to the development of NOA, although further functional evidence is needed to confirm its pathogenicity (Zhang2022Whole).

In colorectal cancer, FAM47C was found to be mutated in a subset of tumor samples, specifically in KRAS wild-type tumors, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis independent of KRAS mutations. The mutations included missense and silent mutations, highlighting the need for further research to understand their functional implications in colorectal cancer (Teng2018Identification).

Additionally, rare variants in FAM47C have been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), indicating that these variants may play a role in the genetic predisposition to MDD (Oh2024Integration). These findings suggest that FAM47C may have diverse roles in different diseases, warranting further investigation.
