# TOMM34

## Overview
TOMM34 is a gene that encodes the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34, a protein primarily involved in the import of precursor proteins into mitochondria. This protein functions as a cochaperone, interacting with heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90, and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Although initially thought to be part of the Translocase of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane (TOM) complex, TOMM34 is predominantly cytosolic and facilitates the correct import of newly transcribed precursor proteins into mitochondria. The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its interactions with other proteins, such as 14-3-3 proteins, impacting cellular energy production and metabolism. TOMM34 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including purine metabolism, DNA replication and repair, and protein degradation. Its expression is notably high in the testis and is associated with maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Additionally, TOMM34 has been linked to several cancers, where its altered expression levels contribute to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Poverennaya2023Exploiting; Shimokawa2006Identification; Trcka2020The).

## Structure
TOMM34 is a protein involved in mitochondrial protein import, characterized by its molecular structure that includes two tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains connected by a flexible interdomain linker. These TPR domains are crucial for interactions with heat shock proteins HSP70 and HSP90, accommodating their C-terminal EEVD motifs (Trcka2020The). The phosphorylation of TOMM34 by protein kinase A (PKA) at serine residues S93, S160, and S280 induces structural changes in its TPR domains, affecting its interaction with other proteins (Trcka2020The). Phosphorylation at S93 destabilizes the TPR1 domain, while S280 affects the TPR2 domain (Trcka2020The). 

The interaction with 14-3-3γ proteins is regulated by phosphorylation at S160, which is necessary for binding and leads to further destabilization of the TPR domains (Trcka2020The). The presence of a flexible interdomain linker allows the TPR1 and TPR2 domains to orient freely, but binding with 14-3-3γ may impose constraints on this flexibility (Trcka2020The). These structural features and post-translational modifications highlight the dynamic nature of TOMM34's molecular structure and its role in mitochondrial protein import.

## Function
TOMM34 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the import of precursor proteins into mitochondria, a critical process for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production. Although initially thought to be a part of the Translocase of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane (TOM) complex, TOMM34 is primarily cytosolic and acts as a cochaperone, interacting with heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90. These interactions are crucial for the correct import of newly transcribed precursor proteins into mitochondria (Poverennaya2023Exploiting; Trcka2020The).

The function of TOMM34 is regulated by phosphorylation, specifically at serine residues S93 and S160, which facilitates its binding to 14-3-3 proteins. This binding induces structural changes that modulate its interaction with Hsp70, allowing for efficient protein refolding and preventing aggregation (Trcka2020The). TOMM34 is also involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function, impacting cellular energy production and metabolism (Poverennaya2023Exploiting).

In healthy human cells, TOMM34 plays a role in purine metabolism, DNA replication and repair, protein degradation, and cellular signaling. Its expression is notably high in the testis, and it is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Poverennaya2023Exploiting).

## Clinical Significance
TOMM34 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. It is frequently upregulated in colorectal cancer, where it contributes to cancer cell growth and is considered a potential target for anticancer therapies (Shimokawa2006Identification; Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). In ovarian cancer, high TOMM34 expression is associated with higher cancer stages and poor prognosis, particularly in serous cancers and those with p53 mutations (Muller2019Tomm34). Similarly, in oral squamous cell carcinoma, TOMM34 expression correlates with advanced clinical stages and poor survival outcomes (Cai2021High).

In colon cancer, TOMM34 is linked to immune cell infiltration and poor prognosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression and immunosuppression (Li2023TOMM34). The gene's expression is also associated with tumor mutation burden and microsatellite instability, indicating its involvement in genomic instability (Li2023TOMM34). TOMM34's role in mitochondrial protein import and its interaction with chaperones like Hsp70 and Hsp90 further highlight its significance in cancer pathogenesis (Shimokawa2006Identification). These findings suggest that TOMM34 could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
TOMM34 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in mitochondrial protein import. It primarily interacts with the chaperone proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90, forming a large cytosolic complex essential for the import of newly transcribed precursor proteins into mitochondria (Poverennaya2023Exploiting). The interaction with Hsp70 is regulated by phosphorylation at serine residues S93 and S160, mediated by protein kinase A (PKA). This phosphorylation facilitates the binding of TOMM34 to 14-3-3 proteins, which are adaptors involved in various cellular processes (Trcka2020The). 

The binding of 14-3-3 proteins to phosphorylated TOMM34 induces structural changes that prevent TOMM34 from interacting with ATP-bound Hsp70, allowing Hsp70-mediated refolding to proceed. However, TOMM34 in complex with 14-3-3 can still bind to Hsp90, suggesting a role in the chaperone-assisted transport of precursors to mitochondria (Trcka2020The). The phosphorylation of TOMM34 and its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins suggest a novel mechanism in the regulation of mitochondrial protein import, providing new hypotheses for further research (Trcka2020The). These interactions highlight TOMM34's role as a cochaperone in mitochondrial protein import and its involvement in cellular signaling pathways.
