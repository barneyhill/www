# ABHD18

## Overview
ABHD18 is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 18, which is part of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family. This protein is characterized by its hydrolase activity, which involves the catalysis of the hydrolysis of chemical bonds. Although the specific biological functions of the ABHD18 protein are not fully elucidated, it is believed to play a role in various cellular processes due to its enzymatic activity. The gene has been studied in the context of its potential involvement in psychological health and cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting that it may have broader implications in human health (Rashmi2022PanCancer; Turner2024Genomic). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional roles and clinical significance of ABHD18 and its encoded protein.

## Clinical Significance
The ABHD18 gene has been implicated in various health conditions, although its phenotypic associations are not fully understood. In veterans, genetic variants of ABHD18 have been linked to alcohol dependence and its impact on depression levels, suggesting a role in psychological health outcomes (Turner2024Genomic). Additionally, ABHD18 is identified as a genetic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Asian populations, indicating its potential involvement in cancer (Rashmi2022PanCancer).

Despite these associations, there is limited information on specific diseases directly caused by mutations in ABHD18. In a study involving a four-generation family, a deletion spanning exon 1 of the ABHD18 gene was identified, but no specific diseases or conditions were associated with this alteration (Neitzel2022Transmission). Similarly, another study predicted the ABHD18 gene to be located in the extracellular region, yet no phenotypes were linked to its sequence variants (Neitzel2022Transmission).

Overall, while ABHD18 is associated with certain health conditions, further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance and the mechanisms by which it may contribute to disease.
