# LAS1L

## Overview
The LAS1L gene encodes the LAS1-like ribosome biogenesis factor, a nucleolar protein that plays a pivotal role in ribosome assembly and cellular proliferation. This protein is categorized as an endoribonuclease, characterized by its HEPN domain, which is essential for its RNA cleavage activity. LAS1L is integral to the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, specifically involved in processing precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) by removing the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region. It functions within a complex that includes the polynucleotide kinase Grc3, forming a critical component of the ribosome biogenesis machinery. The LAS1L protein's interactions with other nucleolar components, such as PELP1, TEX10, and WDR18, further underscore its essential role in ribosome assembly and cellular homeostasis (Pillon2020It; Castle2012LAS1L; Castle2010Las1L).

## Structure
The LAS1L protein is characterized by its HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain, which is crucial for its endoribonuclease activity. This domain contains a conserved RHxhTH motif, essential for RNA cleavage, with invariant arginine and histidine residues playing critical roles in the catalytic process (Pillon2019It; Pillon2020It). The HEPN domain forms a homodimer, with each protomer contributing to the active site, and the motif is embedded within an alpha-helix at the interface of the dimer (Pillon2020It).

The LAS1L protein is part of a larger complex known as RNase PNK, which includes the Grc3 polynucleotide kinase. This complex is necessary for the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA, specifically the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) (Frazier2021Structural; Pillon2020It). The interaction with Grc3 is crucial for the activation and stability of LAS1L, forming a tetrameric complex with a butterfly-like structure, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (Pillon2019It; Pillon2020It).

The protein's structure includes a poorly conserved coiled-coil domain and a conserved C-terminal tail, which are involved in its functional interactions and stability (Pillon2019It). The LAS1L protein's molecular architecture and its interaction with Grc3 highlight its essential role in ribosome biogenesis.

## Function
The LAS1L gene encodes a nucleolar protein that is essential for ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation in healthy human cells. LAS1L is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it plays a critical role in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It is involved in the processing of precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), specifically the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region, which is crucial for the synthesis of mature 28S rRNA (Schillewaert2012The; Castle2010Las1L). 

LAS1L functions as an endoribonuclease, collaborating with the polynucleotide kinase Grc3 to cleave pre-rRNA at specific sites, facilitating the removal of ITS2 and the subsequent maturation of rRNA (Pillon2020It; Pillon2017Grc3). This process is vital for the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit, which is necessary for protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Castle2012LAS1L).

The protein interacts with several other nucleolar components, forming a complex that includes PELP1, TEX10, WDR18, and SENP3, which are involved in pre-rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (Castle2012LAS1L). Depletion of LAS1L leads to defects in ribosome biogenesis, resulting in cell cycle arrest and nucleolar stress, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cell function (Castle2012LAS1L; Castle2010Las1L).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LAS1L gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in ribosome biogenesis. A de novo mutation in LAS1L has been linked to a congenital progressive motor neuron disease that resembles Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Respiratory Distress type 1 (SMARD1). This condition is characterized by early respiratory insufficiency and severe motor neuron disorder, with the mutation leading to impaired ribosomal maturation and function (Butterfield2014Congenital).

LAS1L mutations are also implicated in Wilson-Turner syndrome (WTS), an X-linked neurological disorder. This syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, speech impairment, obesity, and hypogonadism. The mutations affect ribosomal biogenesis and transcription regulation, contributing to the clinical manifestations of WTS (Stembalska2022Severe; Hu2015Xexome).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), alterations in LAS1L expression, particularly the LAS1L-L isoform, are associated with increased metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The regulation of LAS1L splicing by hnRNPA1 influences cancer progression, highlighting its role in tumor metastasis (Han2022Knockdown). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LAS1L in various diseases, emphasizing its critical role in cellular processes.

## Interactions
The LAS1L protein is involved in several critical interactions essential for ribosome biogenesis. It forms a complex with the RNA kinase Grc3, creating a dimer of Las1-Grc3 heterodimers. This complex is crucial for processing precursor ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), specifically in the removal of the ITS2 spacer between the 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. The interaction between Las1 and Grc3 is highly cooperative, with each enzyme dependent on the other for stability, assembly, and activation (Pillon2019CryoEM; Pillon2017Grc3).

LAS1L also interacts with several proteins to form a novel nucleolar complex essential for ribosome biogenesis. It interacts with PELP1, TEX10, WDR18, NOL9, and SENP3, which are the mammalian homologues of the yeast Rix1 complex. This complex is required for the proper processing of the pre-rRNA internal transcribed spacer 2 region (Castle2012LAS1L). The interactions of LAS1L with these proteins are crucial for the maturation of rRNA, as evidenced by the accumulation of pre-rRNA intermediates upon their depletion (Castle2012LAS1L). These interactions highlight LAS1L's significant role in ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation (Castle2012LAS1L).
