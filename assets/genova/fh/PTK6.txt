# PTK6

## Overview
PTK6, or protein tyrosine kinase 6, is a gene that encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as breast tumor kinase (Brk). This kinase is part of the Src family of protein kinases and is characterized by its SH2 and SH3 domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a kinase domain that phosphorylates target substrates on tyrosine residues (Harvey2018Protein). Unlike many kinases, PTK6 lacks an amino-terminal myristoylation site, which influences its cellular localization, allowing it to function in various compartments such as the membrane and nucleus (Harvey2018Protein). PTK6 is involved in numerous cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, and its activity is regulated by growth factors and intracellular localization (Ostrander2010BrkPTK6; Liu2013Protein). The protein plays a significant role in normal epithelial tissues and is implicated in the progression of several cancers, where it can influence signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and STAT (Gilic2020Targeting; Ostrander2010BrkPTK6).

## Structure
Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), also known as breast tumor kinase (Brk), is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase related to the Src family of protein kinases. Its molecular structure includes SH2 and SH3 domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. The SH2 domain typically interacts with phosphorylated tyrosines, while the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences (Harvey2018Protein). PTK6 also contains a kinase domain responsible for phosphorylating target substrates on tyrosine residues.

PTK6 lacks an amino-terminal myristoylation site, which affects its ability to associate directly with the plasma membrane, influencing its cellular localization. Despite this, PTK6 is found in various cellular compartments, including the membrane and nucleus, through interactions with binding partners (Harvey2018Protein). This localization is significant for its function, as PTK6 plays different roles in normal tissues and tumors.

PTK6 can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can impact its activity and function. It may also act as an adaptor molecule, stabilizing signaling complexes to facilitate phosphorylation by other kinases. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of PTK6 can result in different functional properties, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context (Harvey2018Protein).

## Function
Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), also known as breast tumor kinase (BRK), is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. PTK6 is expressed in differentiated epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, prostate, and oral cavity, where it plays a crucial role in promoting cellular differentiation and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Gilic2020Targeting; Ostrander2010BrkPTK6). In the intestine, PTK6 is involved in inhibiting β-catenin transcription, which is essential for regulating epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation (Gilic2020Targeting).

PTK6 is primarily localized in the nuclei of epithelial cells in the prostate, where it inhibits cell proliferation by negatively regulating the activity of RNA-binding proteins like Sam68 and inhibiting β-catenin transcription (Wozniak2017PTEN). It also plays a role in DNA-damage induced apoptosis, contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability (Brauer2011The).

The kinase activity of PTK6 is regulated by growth factors and is involved in the activation of signaling pathways such as the PI3K/Akt and STAT pathways, which are important for controlled cell proliferation and differentiation (Ostrander2010BrkPTK6). PTK6's function is context-dependent, influenced by its intracellular localization and interaction with other proteins (Liu2013Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) is implicated in the progression and poor prognosis of several cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), PTK6 is upregulated, promoting carcinogenesis and metastasis by enhancing STAT3 phosphorylation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers like N-cadherin and ZEB1. This upregulation is linked to decreased DNA methylation, suggesting epigenetic deregulation as a mechanism for its increased expression (Hsieh2022Epigenetic).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), PTK6 overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation, chemoresistance, and stemness. It activates the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, contributing to poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. PTK6 expression is higher in advanced stages of CRC and correlates with poor overall survival (Liu2021Pharmacological).

In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), PTK6 is overexpressed and linked to aggressive cancer phenotypes. It mediates cancer progression through the activation of RhoA and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling, correlating with decreased survival rates. Targeting PTK6 and its pathways may offer therapeutic benefits in advanced breast cancer (Dwyer2021Breast).

## Interactions
PTK6, also known as protein tyrosine kinase 6, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with several proteins, including members of the ErbB family such as EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4, enhancing EGF-induced proliferation and PI3K/Akt signaling (Ostrander2010BrkPTK6). PTK6 also phosphorylates RNA-binding proteins like Sam68, SLM-1, and SLM-2, affecting RNA stability, translation, and transport (Gilic2020Targeting). It phosphorylates transcription factors such as STAT3 and STAT5, enhancing their transcriptional activity (Ostrander2010BrkPTK6).

PTK6 interacts with SOCS3, where SOCS3 can inhibit PTK6 expression, indicating a regulatory relationship. This interaction is significant in uveal melanoma, where SOCS3 can attenuate the effects of PTK6 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Liu2023PTK6). PTK6 also forms a complex with PTEN in prostate cancer cells, where PTEN dephosphorylates PTK6 at tyrosine residue 342, inhibiting its kinase activity (Wozniak2017PTEN).

PTK6's interactions extend to adaptor proteins like STAP2, paxillin, and BCAR1, affecting cell migration and activation (Gilic2020Targeting). These interactions highlight PTK6's role in modulating various signaling pathways and cellular processes.
