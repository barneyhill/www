# UGT2B17

## Overview
UGT2B17 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B17, which is part of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family. This enzyme plays a critical role in the glucuronidation process, a biochemical pathway that facilitates the detoxification and excretion of various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including steroid hormones and xenobiotics. UGT2B17 is predominantly expressed in the liver and prostate, where it is involved in the metabolism of androgens such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone, thereby modulating androgen receptor signaling and maintaining hormone homeostasis (Chouinard2004Cellular; Meech2019The). The gene is located on chromosome 4q13 and is part of a cluster of UGT2B genes, indicating a history of gene duplication events (BEAULIEU1997Chromosomal). Variability in UGT2B17, including gene deletions and polymorphisms, has been associated with altered drug metabolism and disease susceptibility, underscoring its significance in pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine (Bhatt2018Hepatic).

## Structure
UGT2B17 is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, involved in the glucuronidation of steroid hormones. The enzyme is composed of two functional domains: a variable N-terminal domain and a highly conserved C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain includes a signal peptide for ER-lumen integration, an aglycone binding site, and a membrane interacting region, while the C-terminal domain contains most of the UDPGA cofactor binding site and a transmembrane helix (Trane2021Molecular). The enzyme is predicted to form dimers in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, which may affect its function and ligand specificity (Trane2021Molecular).

The primary structure of UGT2B17 is highly similar to that of UGT2B15, with 95% identity, but differs in regio-specificity due to specific amino acid residues. For instance, the serine residue at position 121 in UGT2B17 is crucial for activity towards the 3a position of C19 steroids (Dubois1999Alteration). The enzyme's tertiary structure involves a catalytic cleft between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Trane2021Molecular). The UGT2B17 gene is located on human chromosome 4q13, where it is clustered with other UGT2B genes, suggesting gene duplication events (BEAULIEU1997Chromosomal).

## Function
UGT2B17 is an enzyme involved in the glucuronidation of androgens, a process that inactivates these hormones and facilitates their excretion. This enzyme is highly expressed in the liver and shows significant activity in extrahepatic tissues, including the prostate, where it plays a crucial role in modulating androgen levels and terminating androgen receptor (AR) signaling (Chouinard2004Cellular; Meech2019The). UGT2B17 is responsible for the glucuronidation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone, with a preference for DHT, and is expressed in the basal cells of the prostate epithelium (GauthierLandry2015Multiple; Meech2019The).

In the liver, UGT2B17 contributes to the detoxification of various xenobiotics, including therapeutic drugs and dietary compounds, by making them more polar and easier to excrete (Turgeon2003Glucuronidation; Meech2019The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining androgen homeostasis, and genetic variations in UGT2B17 have been linked to prostate cancer risk (Meech2019The). UGT2B17's expression is influenced by steroid hormones, with androgens reducing its levels in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a complex regulatory loop that impacts intratumoral androgen levels (Meech2019The).

## Clinical Significance
UGT2B17 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in drug metabolism and steroid hormone regulation. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), high expression of UGT2B17 is associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis. It contributes to the inactivation of anti-leukemic drugs like fludarabine, leading to reduced treatment efficacy (Allain2020UGT2B17). UGT2B17's glucuronidation activity also affects prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) metabolism, potentially impacting CLL progression by reducing the anti-oncogenic effects of PGE2 (Allain2019Inactivation).

In prostate cancer, UGT2B17 is involved in androgen metabolism, with its expression influencing disease progression. Alterations in UGT2B17 expression can affect androgen levels and are linked to prostate cancer risk and progression (GauthierLandry2015Multiple; Lévesque2020Alternative). The gene's deletion is associated with decreased fat mass and insulin sensitivity, and it influences testosterone metabolism, impacting conditions like obesity and prostate cancer (Bhatt2018Hepatic).

UGT2B17 variability, including gene deletions and polymorphisms, can significantly affect drug metabolism and disease risk, highlighting its clinical significance in personalized medicine and treatment strategies (Bhatt2018Hepatic).

## Interactions
UGT2B17 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function in glucuronidation processes. Chimeric forms of UGT2B17, resulting from intergenic splicing, have been shown to interact with wild-type UGT proteins, such as UGT2B7, through protein-protein interactions. These chimeric proteins can inhibit the glucuronidation activity of wild-type UGTs, including UGT2B7, by forming heterodimers, which suggests a mechanism for their inhibitory effects (Hu2018Intergenic). Specifically, chimeric UGT2B17 proteins were found to inhibit UGT2B7-mediated morphine glucuronidation by 70%-85% (Hu2018Intergenic).

The interactions of UGT2B17 are not limited to its chimeric forms. The enzyme is part of a broader network of interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum, where it may form oligomers with other UGT isoforms, such as UGT1A1, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, and UGT1A9, as well as with cytochrome P450 enzymes and other drug-metabolizing proteins (Fujiwara2016Structure; Fujiwara2014Extensive). These interactions are crucial for its role in drug metabolism and the detoxification of various compounds.
