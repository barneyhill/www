# UNC5D

## Overview
UNC5D is a gene that encodes the protein unc-5 netrin receptor D, which is a member of the UNC5 family of netrin receptors. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane receptor and plays a significant role in axon guidance and cell migration, particularly within the central nervous system. The UNC5D protein is involved in mediating axon repulsion and functions as a dependence receptor, capable of inducing apoptosis in the absence of its ligand, netrin. This apoptotic function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper tissue development. UNC5D is expressed in various normal tissues, including the brain, kidney, and colon, and is implicated in tumor suppression, with its expression often downregulated in cancers due to promoter hypermethylation (Wang2017Genomewide; Lu2013The). The protein's interactions, particularly with glypican-3, are crucial for cell migration and neuronal guidance, highlighting its importance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Akkermans2022GPC3Unc5D).

## Structure
The UNC5D protein is a member of the UNC5 family of netrin receptors, characterized by a conserved domain architecture. It includes two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, two extracellular thrombospondin-like (TSP) domains, a transmembrane helix, and a C-terminal intracellular supramodule. This supramodule comprises a ZO-1/Unc5 (ZU5) domain, a Unc5/PIDD/Ankyrin (UPA) domain, and a death domain (DD) (Akkermans2022GPC3Unc5D). The protein's structure is stabilized by C-mannosylation at tryptophan residues, which is crucial for its interaction with glypican-3 (GPC3) (Akkermans2022GPC3Unc5D).

In terms of quaternary structure, UNC5D forms an octameric complex with GPC3, consisting of four UNC5D molecules and four GPC3 molecules. This complex is organized in an antiparallel bundle, with interactions mediated by N-linked glycans from GPC3 and C-mannosylated tryptophans of UNC5D (Akkermans2022GPC3Unc5D). The protein-protein interfaces involve significant charge complementarity and hydrophobic interactions, with specific domains of UNC5D engaging different lobes of GPC3 (Akkermans2022GPC3Unc5D). The structural integrity and function of UNC5D are maintained through these specific interactions and post-translational modifications.

## Function
The UNC5D gene encodes a receptor that is part of the UNC5 family, which plays a crucial role in axon guidance and cell migration. In healthy human cells, UNC5D is involved in mediating axon repulsion of neuronal growth cones during neurodevelopment, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS) (Wang2017Genomewide). It is expressed in layer 4 of primary sensory areas of the developing neocortex, with its expression peaking during mid to late pregnancy and decreasing after birth (Wang2017Genomewide).

UNC5D functions as a dependence receptor, which means it can induce apoptosis when not bound to its ligand, netrin. This apoptotic function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper tissue development (Wang2017Genomewide). The gene is broadly expressed in normal tissues, including the brain, kidney, prostate, testis, small intestine, and colon, suggesting its involvement in the normal functioning of these tissues (Lu2013The).

In addition to its role in neurodevelopment, UNC5D has been implicated in tumor suppression. It is often downregulated in various cancers due to promoter hypermethylation, which silences its expression and may contribute to tumorigenesis (Lu2013The).

## Clinical Significance
UNC5D is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and promoter methylation. In colorectal cancer (CRC), UNC5D is frequently hypermethylated, leading to its downregulation. This hypermethylation is associated with poor progression-free and overall survival, making it a potential independent predictor of CRC outcomes (Dong2021Promoter; Uhan2020Hypermethylated). The hypermethylation of UNC5D in CRC is so prevalent that it is considered a potential diagnostic biomarker, with studies showing aberrant methylation in nearly all CRC samples analyzed (Uhan2020Hypermethylated).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), UNC5D acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is often silenced due to promoter hypermethylation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), contributing to tumorigenesis. Reintroduction of UNC5D in RCC cell lines inhibits cell proliferation and migration, suggesting its role in cell-cycle arrest (Lu2013The).

UNC5D is also involved in prostate cancer through a novel gene fusion with NRG1, identified in high-grade prostate carcinoma. This fusion may act as an oncogenic driver, highlighting the gene's role in cancer development (Ptáková2021Identification). Additionally, decreased expression of UNC5D has been linked to impaired neurite growth in neurons with DISC1 mutations, suggesting its involvement in psychiatric conditions (Srikanth2018Convergence).

## Interactions
UNC5D interacts with various proteins, forming complexes that play significant roles in cell signaling and migration. It is part of a trimeric complex with FLRT3 and LPHN3, where UNC5D and LPHN3 bind to distinct sites on FLRT3, facilitating trans-cellular adhesion (Lu2015Structural). UNC5D also interacts with glypican-3 (GPC3) to form an octameric glycoprotein complex, which is involved in guiding migrating neurons and cancer cells. This complex is characterized by glycan-glycan interactions between N-linked glycans from GPC3 and C-mannosylated tryptophans of UNC5D's thrombospondin-like domains (Akkermans2022GPC3Unc5D).

The interaction between UNC5D and GPC3 is crucial for cell migration, particularly in the developing mouse cortex, where UNC5D is expressed in neurons and GPC3 in apical progenitors. This interaction is essential for radial neuronal migration, as demonstrated by experiments showing that disrupting UNC5D-GPC3 binding impairs neuronal movement (Akkermans2022GPC3Unc5D). UNC5D also forms complexes with netrin, FLRT, and FLRT/Lphn, indicating its involvement in a network of protein interactions that influence cell migration and signaling (Akkermans2022GPC3Unc5D). These interactions highlight UNC5D's role in mediating both adhesive and repulsive forces necessary for proper neuronal guidance.
