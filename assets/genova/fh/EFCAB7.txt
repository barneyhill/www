# EFCAB7

## Overview
EFCAB7, or EF-hand calcium binding domain 7, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular signaling pathways, particularly the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. The protein encoded by EFCAB7 is characterized by its EF-hand calcium-binding domains, which are crucial for its function in cellular processes. EFCAB7 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Hh signaling by forming part of the EFCAB7-IQCE complex, which is essential for recruiting the EVC-EVC2 complex to the EvC zone within primary cilia. This recruitment is vital for the proper localization and function of the EVC-EVC2 complex, impacting skeletal development and being associated with ciliopathies such as Ellis van Creveld syndrome and Weyers acrofacial dysostosis (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2). Additionally, EFCAB7's interactions with other proteins, including viral proteins, suggest its broader role in cellular signaling and potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Structure


## Function
EFCAB7 (EF-hand calcium binding domain 7) is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, a pathway essential for embryogenesis and stem cell regulation. EFCAB7 is part of the EFCAB7-IQCE complex, which is responsible for recruiting the EVC-EVC2 complex to the EvC zone, a specific subcompartment within primary cilia. This recruitment is crucial for the proper localization and function of the EVC-EVC2 complex in Hh signaling, which is vital for skeletal development and is associated with ciliopathies such as Ellis van Creveld syndrome and Weyers acrofacial dysostosis (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

The interaction between EFCAB7 and the EVC-EVC2 complex is mediated by specific motifs within the EVC2 protein, such as the phenylalanine-valine (FV) motif, which are essential for binding to EFCAB7 and facilitating the complex's targeting to the EvC zone (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2). Sumoylation of the EVC-EVC2 complex enhances its localization to the EvC zone, with EFCAB7 playing a role in this process by interacting with the complex through its ECH2 domain (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the EFCAB7 gene can significantly impact cellular processes, potentially contributing to various diseases. EFCAB7 is involved in calcium signaling pathways, which are crucial for numerous cellular functions. Disruptions in these pathways due to EFCAB7 mutations may lead to the development or progression of cancer. The gene's role in calcium signaling suggests that its dysregulation could affect cell proliferation and apoptosis, processes often implicated in oncogenesis.

In addition to cancer, alterations in EFCAB7 expression or function may be linked to neurodegenerative disorders. Calcium homeostasis is vital for neuronal health, and any imbalance can contribute to neurodegeneration. The interactions of EFCAB7 with other proteins are also critical, as they may influence disease progression by affecting cellular signaling networks. These interactions could potentially modify the cellular response to stress or damage, further implicating EFCAB7 in disease mechanisms.

Overall, the clinical significance of EFCAB7 lies in its potential to influence disease outcomes through its role in calcium signaling and protein interactions. Understanding these mechanisms may provide insights into therapeutic targets for conditions associated with EFCAB7 dysregulation.

## Interactions
EFCAB7, or EF-hand calcium-binding domain 7, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. One of its primary interactions is with the EVC-EVC2 complex, where it serves as a docking site in the EvC zone, a specific subcompartment of the ciliary structure. This interaction is mediated by the Weyers peptide on EVC2, which contains essential motifs for recruitment (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2). The EFCAB7 protein, as part of the EFCAB7-IQCE complex, facilitates the targeting of the EVC-EVC2 complex to the EvC zone, with the interaction being enhanced by sumoylation of the EVC-EVC2 complex (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

EFCAB7 also interacts with the NSm protein of the Rift Valley fever virus, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays. This interaction, although moderate, suggests a potential role for EFCAB7 in viral protein interactions (Engdahl2012The). Additionally, EFCAB7 is upregulated in cord blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells, indicating its involvement in cellular processes related to endothelial function, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Wang2020Identification).
