# LALBA

## Overview
The LALBA gene encodes the protein alpha-lactalbumin, a glycosylated metalloprotein that plays a pivotal role in lactose synthesis within the mammary glands. As a regulatory subunit of the lactose synthase complex, alpha-lactalbumin modulates the activity of galactosyltransferase, facilitating lactose production during lactation (Stinnakre1994Creation). Structurally, the protein is characterized by a compact, globular form stabilized by disulfide bridges, and it features a calcium-binding loop essential for its stability and function (Sadovnikova2021A; Mehra2022Molecular). Beyond its role in lactose synthesis, alpha-lactalbumin is involved in apoptotic processes, particularly in its dimeric form, which can induce apoptosis in various cell types, including cancer cells, by modulating chromatin structure and gene expression (Sharp2017Dimeric). This multifaceted protein is thus integral to both milk production and cellular regulation within the mammary gland.

## Structure
The LALBA protein, also known as lactalbumin alpha, is a glycosylated metalloprotein composed of 123 amino acids, with a molecular mass ranging from approximately 14.5 to 18.5 kilodaltons (Sadovnikova2021A). Its primary structure includes lysine, cysteine, threonine, leucine, and tryptophan residues (Manzoor2019Polymorphism). The secondary structure of LALBA is characterized by a large α-helical domain and a small β-sheet domain, linked by a calcium-binding loop (Mehra2022Molecular). This loop is stabilized by a disulfide bond between residues 73 and 91, and it plays a crucial role in calcium ion binding, which is essential for the protein's stability and function (Sadovnikova2021A).

The tertiary structure of LALBA is compact and globular, stabilized by four disulfide bridges, contributing to its thermostability and rigidity (Mehra2022Molecular). LALBA can form a quaternary structure by interacting with β-1,4-galactosyltransferase to form the lactose synthase complex, which is vital for lactose synthesis in the mammary gland (Sadovnikova2021A). Post-translational modifications of LALBA include glycosylation, which occurs variably at Asn-45 and other sites, although its biological significance is not fully understood (Sadovnikova2021Aa; Sadovnikova2021A).

## Function
The LALBA gene encodes alpha-lactalbumin, a protein that plays a crucial role in lactose synthesis within the mammary glands. It functions as a regulatory subunit of lactose synthase by modifying the activity of galactosyltransferase, facilitating the production of lactose during lactation (Stinnakre1994Creation). This protein is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus of mammary epithelial cells, where it influences milk production and composition.

In addition to its role in lactose synthesis, alpha-lactalbumin has been implicated in apoptotic processes. The dimeric form of alpha-lactalbumin, particularly in bovine models, has been shown to induce apoptosis in various cell types, including mammary epithelial cells and cancer cell lines. This apoptotic activity is linked to the upregulation of ATF3 and the reduction of histone deacetylase activity, which affects chromatin structure and gene expression (Sharp2017Dimeric). The protein's involvement in apoptosis suggests a role in mammary gland involution, a process critical for tissue remodeling post-lactation (Sharp2017Dimeric).

Overall, alpha-lactalbumin is essential for both the synthesis of lactose and the regulation of cell death, highlighting its multifaceted role in mammary gland function and development.

## Interactions
LALBA (lactalbumin alpha) interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is known to bind with histone proteins, particularly histone HIII, through electrostatic interactions. This binding is cooperative, with a stoichiometry of four LALBA molecules per histone molecule, and is accompanied by aggregation. This interaction suggests potential implications for antitumor activity by disrupting chromatin structure (Permyakov2004No).

LALBA can also interact with positively charged poly-amino acids such as poly-Lys and poly-Arg, further supporting the electrostatic nature of its interactions. The binding site on LALBA likely involves carboxylic groups in the Ca2+-binding loop, which affects the protein's thermal stability and calcium ion affinity (Permyakov2004No).

In its dimeric form, LALBA can potentiate apoptosis by upregulating ATF3 and reducing histone deacetylase activity. This form of LALBA is capable of entering the nucleus and binding to histones, affecting chromatin structure and potentially activating apoptotic pathways (Sharp2017Dimeric). The dimeric form's apoptotic activity is linked to the inhibition of histone deacetylase activity, which is significant in modulating gene expression and apoptosis (Sharp2017Dimeric).
