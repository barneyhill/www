# SLC29A1

## Overview
The SLC29A1 gene encodes the protein known as solute carrier family 29 member 1, also referred to as the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) or Augustine blood group. This protein is a transmembrane transporter that plays a crucial role in the cellular uptake of nucleosides, such as adenosine, across cell membranes. hENT1 is characterized by its 11 transmembrane domains and is predominantly involved in maintaining cellular nucleotide pools by facilitating nucleoside salvage pathways, particularly in cells that lack de novo nucleotide synthesis capabilities (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters; Podgorska2005Recent). The protein is widely expressed in various tissues, including endothelial and erythroid cells, where it influences vascular reactivity and erythrocyte production, respectively (Westermeier2009Equilibrative; Zwifelhofer2020GATA). Additionally, hENT1 is significant in pharmacology as it mediates the transport of therapeutic nucleoside analogs, impacting the efficacy and toxicity of drugs used in cancer and viral infection treatments (Vlachodimou2019Labelfree).

## Structure
The SLC29A1 gene encodes the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), which is involved in the transport of nucleosides across cell membranes. The primary structure of hENT1 consists of 456 amino acids, forming 11 transmembrane domains (TMDs) with an intracellular amino terminus and an extracellular carboxyl terminus (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters; Podgorska2005Recent). The secondary structure includes hydrophobic transmembrane α-helices (Podgorska2005Recent). 

The tertiary structure of hENT1 is organized into N-and C-terminal pseudo-symmetric domains, with the C-domain comprising five TMDs (Schaller2019The). Specific regions and amino acids are crucial for its function, such as the region between TMD3 and TMD6, which is responsible for sensitivity to inhibitors, and TMDs 1 and 6, which are involved in deoxynucleoside recognition (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters). 

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at Asn48, which is important for targeting the protein to the plasma membrane (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters). Splice variants of ENT1 have been identified, affecting its affinity for nucleosides and inhibitors (Cano‐Soldado2011Transporters). The protein functions as a monomer, with no detailed quaternary structure information available.

## Function
The SLC29A1 gene encodes the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), which is a critical protein for the transport of nucleosides, such as adenosine, across cell membranes. ENT1 is the most abundant nucleoside transport protein in the human body and plays a vital role in maintaining cellular nucleotide pools by participating in the salvage pathways of nucleotide synthesis, especially in cells lacking de novo biosynthetic pathways (Vlachodimou2019Labelfree). This transporter is essential for regulating extracellular adenosine levels, as it rapidly transports adenosine into cells, maintaining low intracellular concentrations (Vlachodimou2019Labelfree).

ENT1 is active in various tissues, including endothelial cells, where it is involved in the uptake of adenosine, impacting vascular reactivity and endothelial function (Westermeier2009Equilibrative). In erythroid cells, SLC29A1 is regulated by GATA transcription factors and is crucial for erythroblast survival and differentiation, promoting erythrocyte production and preventing anemia (Zwifelhofer2020GATA). ENT1 also plays a role in drug transport, facilitating the cellular uptake of therapeutic agents like gemcitabine and ribavirin, which are used in cancer and viral infection treatments (Vlachodimou2019Labelfree).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC29A1 gene, which encodes the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of cancer treatment, genetic variations in SLC29A1 have been associated with bevacizumab-induced hypertension. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genomic region between SLC29A1 and HSP90AB1, such as rs9381299, have been linked to early grade 3 hypertension in patients treated with bevacizumab, suggesting that these genetic variations may influence blood pressure regulation through adenosine and nitric oxide signaling pathways (Li2018Identification).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), certain SNPs in SLC29A1, such as rs9394992 and rs324148, have been identified as prognostic predictors for survival. These SNPs are associated with differences in overall survival and disease-free survival, potentially affecting the efficacy of Ara-C based chemotherapy by modifying drug transport and toxicity (Wan2014SLC29A1).

Additionally, polymorphisms in SLC29A1 have been linked to resistance and toxicity in treatments involving nucleoside analog drugs, such as 5-FU and gemcitabine, highlighting the gene's role in influencing drug efficacy and adverse effects (Lemstrová2014Role; Fernandes2021Influence).

## Interactions
The SLC29A1 gene encodes the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1), which is involved in the transport of nucleosides across cell membranes. hENT1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing its activity and cellular localization. One significant interaction involves the transcription factor specific protein 1 (Sp1), which binds to the SLC29A1 promoter. This interaction is particularly notable under high D-glucose conditions, where increased Sp1 binding leads to reduced SLC29A1 promoter activity and decreased hENT1-mediated adenosine transport. This process is modulated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MEK/ERKs), and protein kinase C (PKC), which are involved in the transcriptional repression of SLC29A1 (Puebla2007High).

hENT1 also interacts with adenosine receptors (ARs), where its inhibition leads to increased extracellular adenosine concentration, enhancing AR signaling. This interaction is monitored using an impedance-based label-free assay, which provides insights into the regulatory role of adenosine kinase in maintaining low intracellular adenosine concentrations (Vlachodimou2019Labelfree). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving hENT1 and its role in cellular processes and drug transport.
