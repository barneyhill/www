# METTL21A

## Overview
METTL21A is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase 21A, HSPA lysine, which is a member of the lysine-specific methyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of heat shock proteins, particularly those in the HSP70 family, through the methylation of lysine residues. This modification is crucial for regulating protein folding, stability, and interactions, thereby playing a significant role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and stress responses (Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike; Jakobsson2015Saccharomyces). METTL21A is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with its substrates to facilitate proper protein function and cellular stress management (Cloutier2013A). The enzyme's activity is essential for the cell's ability to respond to and recover from stress, ensuring the maintenance of protein quality control and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins (Shimazu2014SeleniumBased).

## Structure


## Function
METTL21A is a lysine-specific methyltransferase that primarily targets heat shock proteins (HSP70 family) in human cells. This post-translational modification plays a crucial role in protein folding, stability, and interactions, which are essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and stress responses (Jakobsson2015Saccharomyces). METTL21A is part of a small group of methyltransferases that specifically methylate non-histone proteins, highlighting its unique substrate specificity compared to other methyltransferase families (Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike).

The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with its substrates to facilitate proper protein function and cellular stress management. The methylation of HSP70 proteins by METTL21A is significant for cellular processes, as it influences the chaperone activity of these proteins, thereby affecting protein folding and stability under stress conditions (Jakobsson2015Saccharomyces). This activity is vital for the cell's ability to respond to and recover from stress, ensuring the maintenance of protein quality control and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. The specific function of METTL21A in healthy human cells, while not fully detailed, is inferred to be integral to these cellular processes (Zoabi2020Methyltransferaselike).

## Interactions
METTL21A is a lysine methyltransferase that primarily interacts with members of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family, including HSPA1, HSPA5, and HSPA8. These interactions are significant as METTL21A methylates specific lysine residues on these chaperones, which can regulate their activity and stability (Cloutier2013A; Shimazu2014SeleniumBased). The methylation site on Hsp70 proteins, such as lysine 561 on HSPA8, is crucial for this modification, and mutation of this site significantly reduces methylation, indicating a specific protein-protein interaction (Shimazu2014SeleniumBased).

The interaction between METTL21A and Hsp70 isoforms is not only biochemical but also spatial, as immunofluorescence studies have shown that METTL21A and HSPA8 colocalize within the same cellular compartments, suggesting a direct physical interaction (Cloutier2013A). METTL21A's role in methylating Hsp70 isoforms suggests it may influence the specificity of these chaperones towards their substrates and cofactors, potentially affecting the functional organization of the proteome (Cloutier2013A). There is no evidence from the provided context that METTL21A interacts with nucleic acids.
