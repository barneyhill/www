# PCDH20

## Overview
PCDH20, or protocadherin 20, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cadherin superfamily, specifically categorized within the non-clustered δ-protocadherins (NC-Pcdh) subfamily. The protein, protocadherin 20, is characterized by its transmembrane domain and six extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, which facilitate homophilic interactions crucial for cellular adhesion processes (Huang2023Protocadherin; Hulpiau2009Molecular). Protocadherin 20 plays significant roles in various biological systems, including the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity and the development of olfactory and auditory systems. It is also implicated in cancer biology, acting as a tumor suppressor in several types of cancer, such as hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its expression is often downregulated (Wu2016Decreased; Gong2019PCDH20). The gene's expression and function are influenced by epigenetic modifications, such as promoter hypermethylation, which can lead to its silencing in certain cancers (Imoto2006Frequent).

## Structure
Protocadherin 20 (PCDH20) is a member of the cadherin superfamily, specifically classified within the non-clustered δ-protocadherins (NC-Pcdh) subfamily. The molecular structure of PCDH20 includes a transmembrane domain connected to six repeated extracellular cadherin (EC) domains and a cytoplasmic peptide tail that lacks conserved motifs, distinguishing it from other δ-PCDHs (Huang2023Protocadherin; Hulpiau2009Molecular). The primary structure of PCDH20 is characterized by a long exon encoding most of the ectodomain and a short cytoplasmic domain of only 40 amino acids (Hulpiau2009Molecular).

PCDH20 forms homophilic trans dimers through antiparallel binding of the EC1-EC4 regions, a common feature among δ-protocadherins, although it does not participate in cis interactions (Harrison2020Familywide). The protein's structure is stabilized by calcium ions, which rigidify the linear arrangement of its EC domains (Harrison2020Familywide). PCDH20's lack of CM motifs and its distinct classification within the δ0-Pcdh subfamily suggest unique functional roles compared to other protocadherins (Hulpiau2009Molecular). The protein's expression and solubility are enhanced by the inclusion of a 'stalk' region in its ectodomain sequence (Harrison2020Familywide).

## Function
PCDH20 (protocadherin 20) is a member of the cadherin superfamily, primarily expressed in the colonic epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal barrier function and homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of adherens junctions, which are essential for preserving epithelial integrity and preventing inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease. PCDH20 regulates the ATF6/CHOP/β-catenin/p120-catenin signaling pathway, which is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the intestinal lining by supporting epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation (Huang2023Protocadherin).

In the olfactory system, PCDH20 is expressed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and is involved in their development and differentiation. It is associated with axon outgrowth and the establishment of synaptic connections, contributing to the formation of olfactory circuitry. PCDH20 expression is higher in immature OSNs and is down-regulated in mature OSNs, indicating its role in the transition from immature to mature neurons (Lee2007Olfactory).

In the auditory system, PCDH20 is expressed in the cochlea, particularly in sensory hair cells, suggesting a role in auditory function through cellular adhesion processes (Vuckovic2015Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PCDH20 gene have been implicated in several cancers. In hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC), PCDH20 acts as a tumor suppressor gene, and its reduced expression is associated with advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and poorer overall survival (Gong2019PCDH20). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), decreased PCDH20 expression correlates with poor prognosis, including higher mortality risk and advanced cancer stages. It is suggested as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target due to its role in increasing chemosensitivity to cisplatin (Wu2016Decreased).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PCDH20 is frequently silenced through promoter hypermethylation, which is linked to worse clinical outcomes and reduced overall survival. This epigenetic alteration is considered an independent prognostic marker (Imoto2006Frequent). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PCDH20 silencing due to promoter hypermethylation leads to increased cell proliferation and migration, implicating its role in tumor suppression (Ning2022PCDH20).

PCDH20 also plays a role in maintaining intestinal barrier function, with its deficiency linked to increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease. This is due to its involvement in the ATF6-mediated ER stress pathway, affecting epithelial integrity (Huang2023Protocadherin).

## Interactions
Protocadherin 20 (PCDH20) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in maintaining intestinal barrier function and influencing cancer cell behavior. One of the key interactions of PCDH20 is with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress chaperone ATF6. This interaction is crucial for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity, particularly during inflammatory conditions such as Crohn's disease. PCDH20 interacts with ATF6 in the ER membrane or nucleus, and this interaction is essential for regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) and maintaining paracellular permeability during colitis (Huang2023Protocadherin). 

In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), PCDH20 interacts with MAP3K9, a component of the MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction leads to the suppression of the MAP3K9/Akt/β-catenin pathway, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and migration. The physical interaction between PCDH20 and MAP3K9 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting that PCDH20 exerts its tumor-suppressive effects by downregulating MAP3K9, which in turn affects the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Ning2022PCDH20). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PCDH20 in both maintaining epithelial integrity and acting as a tumor suppressor.
