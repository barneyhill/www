# RPH3A

## Overview
The RPH3A gene encodes the protein rabphilin 3A, which is a key player in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release. Rabphilin 3A is categorized as an effector protein, interacting primarily with small GTPases such as Rab3A and Rab27, which are crucial for the regulation of vesicle exocytosis. The protein is characterized by an N-terminal Rab-binding domain and two C-terminal C2 domains, which facilitate interactions with phospholipids and SNARE proteins, thereby promoting the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane (Li2022Rabphilin). Beyond its presynaptic roles, rabphilin 3A is also involved in postsynaptic processes, contributing to synaptic organization and receptor localization, which are essential for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Stanic2015Rabphilin). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical relevance (Nguyen2024Multiple; Maselli2018Presynaptic).

## Structure
Rabphilin 3A (RPH3A) is a protein characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function in synaptic vesicle trafficking. The primary structure of RPH3A includes a Rab-binding domain located at the N-terminus, spanning residues 40 to 157, which is crucial for its interaction with Rab3A, a small GTPase involved in vesicle docking (McKiernan1996Role; Avagliano2021Monoubiquitination). This domain contains a cysteine-rich region that functions as a zinc finger, binding two zinc ions, and is essential for the GTP-dependent interaction with Rab3A (McKiernan1996Role; Stahl1996Rab3).

The protein also features two C-terminal C2 domains, C2A and C2B, which are involved in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding. The C2A domain binds inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and calcium ions, while the C2B domain binds calcium ions and interacts with SNAP-25, promoting SNARE complex assembly (Stanic2015Rabphilin; Li2022Rabphilin). The C2 domains are crucial for membrane attachment and play a role in vesicle docking and fusion (Li2022Rabphilin).

RPH3A undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may modulate its interactions and functions (Li2022Rabphilin). The protein's structure allows it to act as an adapter, connecting Rab3A to other proteins, thereby facilitating efficient vesicle trafficking and exocytosis (McKiernan1996Role).

## Function
The RPH3A gene encodes the protein Rabphilin-3A, which plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release in neurons. Rabphilin-3A functions as an effector protein for Rab3A and Rab27, small GTPases that regulate vesicle exocytosis. It contains an N-terminal Rab-binding domain and two C-terminal C2 domains, which interact with phospholipids and SNARE proteins, facilitating the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane (Li2022Rabphilin).

Rabphilin-3A interacts with SNAP-25, a SNARE protein, promoting SNARE complex assembly, a key step in membrane fusion. This interaction is critical for the docking and fusion of vesicles, essential for neurotransmitter release (Li2022Rabphilin). Rabphilin-3A also plays a role in the stabilization of NMDA receptors at synaptic sites by interacting with the GluN2A subunit and PSD-95, forming a ternary complex that retains these receptors at synapses, which is crucial for synaptic signaling and plasticity (Stanic2015Rabphilin).

In addition to its presynaptic functions, Rabphilin-3A is involved in postsynaptic processes, contributing to synaptic organization and receptor localization, which are vital for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Stanic2015Rabphilin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RPH3A gene have been linked to several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), RPH3A expression is significantly reduced in affected brain regions such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. This reduction is associated with synaptic dysfunction, a hallmark of AD pathology, and is linked to increased levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and dementia severity (Nguyen2024Multiple). The gene's interactions with synaptic vesicle transport-related proteins and SNARE proteins are crucial for neurotransmitter release, and disruptions in these interactions may contribute to Aβ accumulation (Nguyen2024Multiple).

RPH3A mutations have also been implicated in presynaptic congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Specific mutations, such as p.Arg269Gln and p.Val464Leu, impair the binding of rabphilin 3a to its partners, affecting synaptic vesicle release and recycling, leading to neuromuscular transmission failure (Maselli2018Presynaptic). These mutations result in symptoms like limb weakness, hand tremors, and learning disabilities (Maselli2018Presynaptic).

Additionally, RPH3A is involved in kidney function, where alterations in its expression can lead to renal damage, as seen in studies involving Rab3A knockout mice (MartinezArroyo2021Small). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance in various diseases.

## Interactions
Rabphilin 3A (RPH3A) is involved in several protein interactions critical for synaptic function. It interacts with RAB3A, a small GTPase, which is essential for its stability and function in synaptic vesicle trafficking (Avagliano2021Monoubiquitination). RPH3A also binds to SNAP-25 (SN25), a component of the SNARE complex, promoting SNARE complex assembly crucial for exocytosis. This interaction is mediated by the N-peptide of SN25 and is essential for vesicle docking and fusion (Li2022Rabphilin).

RPH3A forms a ternary complex with GluN2A and PSD95, which stabilizes GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors at synaptic sites, preventing receptor endocytosis and maintaining synaptic function (Stanic2015Rabphilin). This interaction is crucial for the synaptic localization and clustering of GluN2A, as RPH3A undergoes phase separation to regulate GluN2A mobility and surface clustering (Yang2023Rabphilin3A).

RPH3A also interacts with RABAPTIN5, a component of the endocytic machinery, suggesting a role in vesicle endocytosis and neurotransmitter release (Avagliano2021Monoubiquitination). These interactions highlight RPH3A's multifaceted role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and receptor stabilization.
