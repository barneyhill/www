# RPS6KL1

## Overview
RPS6KL1, or ribosomal protein S6 kinase like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the kinase family, specifically involved in cellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by RPS6KL1 plays a critical role in the regulation of endocytosis, particularly within the context of the TOR signaling pathway, which is essential for nutrient-dependent signaling and the control of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Pelkmans2005Genomewide). This kinase is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with early endosomes, where it functions as an adapter to recruit various proteins, facilitating intracellular trafficking and signaling (Jacobsen2017The). The gene's expression and methylation patterns have been linked to various cancers, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Southekal2021PanCancer; Essegian2020The).

## Structure


## Function
RPS6KL1, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase like 1, is involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of endocytosis. It is part of the TOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for nutrient-dependent signaling and controls multiple steps of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) pathway in human cells. This pathway is essential for the internalization of ligands and intracellular trafficking, impacting processes such as viral infections and nutrient uptake (Pelkmans2005Genomewide).

RPS6KL1 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in cell proliferation and survival. It is associated with early endosomes, where it acts as an adapter to recruit various proteins, including kinases, to the endosomal compartment. This function suggests its involvement in intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways by facilitating the assembly of protein complexes at endosomes (Jacobsen2017The).

Silencing of RPS6KL1 has been shown to block vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection and transferrin internalization, indicating its role in the regulation of ligand uptake and intracellular trafficking. This highlights its contribution to the broader control exerted by the TOR signaling pathway over endocytic processes in human cells (Pelkmans2005Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
The RPS6KL1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and DNA methylation patterns. A significant negative correlation between DNA methylation in the promoter region of RPS6KL1 and its gene expression has been observed, particularly in cancers such as breast cancer, stomach adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. This suggests that changes in the methylation status of RPS6KL1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of these cancers and could serve as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis or prognosis (Southekal2021PanCancer).

Mutational hotspot analysis has identified RPS6KL1 as one of the kinases with significant mutations across various cancer types. These mutations can lead to tumorigenesis and cancer progression, highlighting the potential of RPS6KL1 as a target for personalized cancer treatment strategies (Essegian2020The). The inverse relationship between methylation and expression of RPS6KL1 near the transcription start site further underscores its role in oncogenic pathways, suggesting that it may be a valuable target for therapeutic intervention in cancers where it is dysregulated (Southekal2021PanCancer).
