# RUNX1

## Overview
RUNX1, also known as AML1, is a gene that encodes the RUNX family transcription factor 1, a pivotal regulator in the transcriptional control of gene expression. This transcription factor is integral to hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation, and plays a significant role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation. RUNX1 functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, depending on its interactions with various cofactors and coregulators. It is characterized by a Runt Homology Domain (RHD), which is essential for DNA binding and interaction with the cofactor CBFβ, enhancing its regulatory capabilities. RUNX1 is involved in maintaining genomic stability and is expressed in nearly all tissues except the brain and heart. Mutations in the RUNX1 gene are associated with several hematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM), highlighting its clinical significance (Khan2017Clinical; Mikhail2005Normal).

## Structure
RUNX1, also known as AML1, is a transcription factor characterized by its Runt Homology Domain (RHD), which is crucial for DNA binding and heterodimerization with the cofactor CBFβ. This domain forms a 12-stranded β-barrel with an s-type immunoglobulin fold, facilitating specific DNA base recognition (Asou2003The; Mikhail2005Normal). The RHD is highly conserved and essential for the protein's function in hematopoiesis (Luo2019ClinGen).

RUNX1 contains several functional domains, including a transactivation domain (TAD) and a VWRPY motif, which are involved in transcriptional regulation (Luo2019ClinGen). The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, which influence its activity and stability (Mikhail2005Normal).

RUNX1 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including RUNX1a, RUNX1b, and RUNX1c. These isoforms differ in their N-terminal regions and have distinct roles in transcriptional regulation (Asou2003The; Mikhail2005Normal). The presence or absence of specific exons, such as exon 6, can significantly impact RUNX1's transcriptional activity and its interactions with other proteins (Ghanem2018Poly(C)Binding page 6 of 8).

## Function
RUNX1, a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It functions as both a transcription activator and repressor, depending on its interactions with various transcription factors and coregulators. RUNX1 requires dimerization with the cofactor CBF-beta to be fully functional, enhancing its DNA-binding affinity and regulatory capabilities (Mikhail2005Normal). As an activator, RUNX1 interacts with coactivators like p300 and CREB-binding protein, which possess histone acetyl transferase activity, leading to chromatin relaxation and enhanced transcription (Mikhail2005Normal). As a repressor, it interacts with factors like EAR-2, Sin3A, and TLE, which are involved in promoter repression and chromatin compaction (Mikhail2005Normal).

RUNX1 is essential for hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation, and is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation (Mikhail2005Normal). It acts as a transcription organizer, recruiting other factors into a nucleoprotein complex that stimulates lineage-restricted transcription (Mikhail2005Normal). RUNX1 is also involved in maintaining genomic stability, preventing genetic instability and the acquisition of secondary mutations (Mikhail2005Normal). The gene is expressed in almost all tissues except the brain and heart, indicating its widespread role in normal cellular functions (Mikhail2005Normal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RUNX1 gene are implicated in several hematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). RUNX1 mutations are found in approximately 10-16% of AML patients and are associated with poor prognosis, particularly in older patients (Khan2017Clinical). These mutations often occur alongside other genetic alterations, such as FLT3 and ASXL1, and are linked to intermediate-risk cytogenetics (Metzeler2017Clinical; Khan2017Clinical).

In FPDMM, germline mutations in RUNX1 lead to thrombocytopenia and a high lifetime risk of developing MDS and AML. These mutations are often dominant-negative or loss of function, affecting the RHD and TAD domains of the RUNX1 protein (Sood2017Role). The progression to leukemia in FPDMM typically requires additional somatic mutations (Förster2022Beyond).

RUNX1 is also involved in chromosomal translocations, such as the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion resulting from the t(8;21) translocation, which is associated with a favorable prognosis in AML (Mangan2011RUNX1). However, RUNX1 point mutations generally predict unfavorable outcomes, with lower complete remission rates and shorter overall survival (Metzeler2017Clinical).

## Interactions
RUNX1, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. It forms a heterodimeric complex with core-binding factor beta (CBFβ), which significantly enhances its DNA-binding affinity by 6- to 10-fold. This interaction is mediated by the Runt domain of RUNX1, which binds to DNA and CBFβ, facilitating transcriptional regulation (Zhang2003Structural).

RUNX1 also interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, associating with subunits such as BRG1 and INI1. This interaction is essential for the transcription of hematopoietic-specific genes, as RUNX1 recruits the SWI/SNF complex to target gene promoters, facilitating chromatin modifications and transcriptional activation (Bakshi2010The).

In megakaryocyte development, RUNX1 forms multiprotein complexes with transcription factors like FLI-1. This interaction is differentiation-dependent and enhances the transcriptional activation of megakaryocyte-specific genes. The interaction between RUNX1 and FLI-1 is regulated by the phosphorylation state of FLI-1, which affects RUNX1 binding and megakaryocyte differentiation (Huang2009DifferentiationDependent).

RUNX1 also interacts with other transcription factors such as GATA1, AP-1, and ETS, which are crucial for its role in hematopoiesis and megakaryocytic differentiation (Pencovich2011Dynamic).
