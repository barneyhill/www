# CTAGE9

## Overview
CTAGE9 is a gene that encodes the CTAGE family member 9 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. The CTAGE family member 9 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a crucial role in intracellular transport and membrane trafficking. This protein is implicated in the regulation of vesicular transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein processing. The gene's expression and the protein's function are significant in understanding certain cellular pathways and may have implications in disease mechanisms, although specific clinical significances are still under investigation.
