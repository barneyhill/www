# ARHGEF12

## Overview
ARHGEF12 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 12, commonly referred to as Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG). This protein is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a pivotal role in the activation of RhoA subfamily GTPases, which are integral to various cellular processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and cytoskeletal organization (Ghanem2021Regulation). LARG is characterized by several structural domains, including a Regulators of G protein Signalling (RGS) homology domain, a PDZ domain, and a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which are essential for its function and interaction with other proteins (Sternweis2007Regulation; Ghanem2021Regulation). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its role in physiological and pathological contexts, including immune response, platelet function, and cancer progression (Ghanem2021Regulation; LesseyMorillon2014The).

## Structure
The ARHGEF12 gene encodes the Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) protein, which is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates RhoA subfamily GTPases. The LARG protein is composed of 1544 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 173 kDa (Ghanem2021Regulation). It is a member of the RH-RhoGEF subfamily and features several important structural domains. The N-terminal region contains a Regulators of G protein Signalling (RGS) homology domain, which interacts with small G proteins Gα12 and Gα13 to activate LARG's GEF activity. This region also includes a PDZ domain that mediates protein-protein interactions (Sternweis2007Regulation; Ghanem2021Regulation).

The C-terminal domain of LARG includes a Dbl homology (DH) domain responsible for its GEF activity, followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The DH domain has a novel N-terminal extension that interacts with RhoA, essential for guanine exchange activity, while the PH domain stabilizes the active conformation for RhoA binding and is involved in membrane localization (Sternweis2007Regulation; Ghanem2021Regulation). Mutations in the PH domain, such as at Ser-1118 and Glu-1023, reduce guanine exchange activity (Ghanem2021Regulation).

LARG also contains a coiled-coil sequence at the C-terminus that controls localization and oligomerization. The coiled-coil domain mediates oligomerization, and substitutions at isoleucines 1507/1510 can block homo-oligomerization without affecting GEF activity (Ghanem2021Regulation). Phosphorylation, particularly at serine 1288, is a key post-translational modification that regulates LARG's activity and interactions (Gógl2019Rewiring; Ghanem2021Regulation).

## Function
ARHGEF12, also known as Leukemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG), is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically activates the RhoA subfamily of GTPases, including RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC. These GTPases are part of the Ras superfamily and play crucial roles in regulating various cellular processes such as cell migration, proliferation, polarization, adhesion, gene transcription, and cytoskeletal structure (Ghanem2021Regulation). LARG facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on RhoA subfamily GTPases, thus activating them, which is essential for the regulation of cell motility and invasion (Ghanem2021Regulation).

In endothelial cells, LARG mediates ICAM-1-dependent mechanotransduction, which is crucial for the process of transendothelial migration (TEM) of leukocytes. This involves leukocytes crossing the endothelial barrier to enter underlying tissues, a key step in immune response and inflammation (LesseyMorillon2014The). LARG is also involved in platelet function, where it is highly expressed and crucial for normal hemostasis. It promotes platelet aggregation by activating RhoA in response to thrombin and thromboxane (Ghanem2021Regulation). Additionally, LARG plays a role in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells under hypoxic conditions, contributing to the development of pulmonary hypertension by regulating cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (Ghanem2021Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARHGEF12 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of glaucoma, ARHGEF12 is associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) due to its role in regulating intraocular pressure (IOP). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs58073046 in ARHGEF12 is significantly linked to POAG, particularly high-tension glaucoma, by influencing IOP through the RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling pathway (Springelkamp2015ARHGEF12).

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients undergoing chemotherapy, the ARHGEF12 gene is associated with erythropoiesis and erythroid regeneration. The SNP rs10892563 affects the binding site of the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA1, leading to reduced ARHGEF12 expression and increased susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced anemia (Xie2019ARHGEF12).

ARHGEF12 is also involved in retinal dysplasia, as demonstrated in the Crb1rd8 mouse model. Mutations in ARHGEF12, such as those found in the Tvrm266 mouse model, lead to decreased protein expression and exacerbate retinal dysplasia, suggesting its role in maintaining cell apicobasal polarity (Weatherly2022Identification).

Additionally, a KMT2A-ARHGEF12 fusion has been identified in cases of high-grade B-cell lymphoma and acute leukemias, indicating its potential role in tumor progression (Schafernak2021Identification).

## Interactions
ARHGEF12, also known as LARG, participates in various protein interactions that regulate its activity and localization. It interacts with small G proteins Gα12 and Gα13 through its RGS domain, which activates its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity (Ghanem2021Regulation). LARG also interacts with RhoA, mDia2, and Diaphanous-related formin (DRF) or Dia1, which stimulate its GEF activity (Ghanem2021Regulation). The protein is recruited to the plasma membrane by receptors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, Plexin B, or LPA-1/2, which bind to its N-terminal PDZ domain (Ghanem2021Regulation).

LARG forms oligomers through its C-terminal region, which regulates its activity in vivo. It can form both homo- and hetero-oligomers with PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), while p115RhoGEF only forms homooligomers (Chikumi2004Homo). The oligomerization of LARG is inhibitory, as deletion of the C-terminal region enhances its GEF activity and transforming potential (Chikumi2004Homo).

In the context of cancer, LARG interacts with RSK2, and its phosphorylation at serine 1288 is crucial for its role in glioblastoma cell migration and invasion (Ghanem2021Regulation). Additionally, curcumin treatment may inhibit colon cancer cell invasion by preventing ARHGEF12 from binding to RhoA (Wu2023Bioinformatics).
