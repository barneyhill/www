# GJA4

## Overview
GJA4 is a gene that encodes the gap junction protein alpha 4, commonly known as Connexin 37 (Cx37), which is a transmembrane protein involved in forming gap junction channels. These channels facilitate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, playing a critical role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and coordinating cellular functions (Beyer2018Gap). Connexin 37 is expressed in various tissues, including the vascular endothelium, where it is involved in regulating vascular tone and blood pressure, as well as in the kidney, where it contributes to renal function and development (Kosovic2020Connexin). The protein's structure, characterized by four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, allows it to form hexameric connexons that dock with connexons from neighboring cells to create functional gap junctions (Vaiyapuri2012Gap; Bai2021Differential). Mutations in GJA4 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including vascular anomalies and complications in cystic fibrosis, highlighting its significance in human health (Horn2020Impact; Hongo2022Somatic).

## Structure
The GJA4 gene encodes Connexin 37, a protein that forms gap junction channels facilitating intercellular communication. Connexin 37 is composed of four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, a cytoplasmic loop, and both amino and carboxyl termini located on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane (Bai2021Differential). The structured domains include the N-terminal (NT), M1, E1, and M2 domains, which face the gap junction pore, while the M3, E2, and M4 domains face away from the pore. The cytoplasmic loop (CL) and C-terminal (CT) domains are unstructured and considered unstable (Bai2021Differential).

Connexin 37 assembles into hexameric structures known as connexons, which can dock with connexons from adjacent cells to form gap junction channels (Vaiyapuri2012Gap). These channels allow the passage of ions and small molecules between cells, playing a crucial role in cellular communication. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the function of these channels (Vaiyapuri2012Gap). The protein's structure and function are highly conserved across species, with significant sequence identity observed between human and sheep connexins, supporting the use of sheep Cx46 as a model for studying human connexins (Bai2021Differential).

## Function
GJA4, also known as connexin 37 (Cx37), encodes a protein that forms gap junction channels, facilitating direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. This communication is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and coordinating cellular functions (Beyer2018Gap). In healthy human cells, Cx37 is expressed in various tissues, including the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary artery endothelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. It plays a role in regulating monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, particularly in inflammatory conditions (Horn2020Impact).

In the context of the kidney, Cx37 is expressed in the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA), a specialized structure involved in blood pressure regulation and kidney function. During kidney development, Cx37 expression increases, suggesting its role in signal transfer and maintenance of kidney function (Kosovic2020Connexin). Cx37 is also involved in the regulation of vascular tone and renin secretion, which are essential for blood pressure control (Kosovic2020Connexin).

Overall, GJA4 is integral to various physiological processes, including vascular function, inflammation, and renal homeostasis, through its role in gap junctional intercellular communication.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJA4 gene, which encodes the gap junction protein Connexin 37, have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In breast cancer patients, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GJA4 gene, such as the C→T mutation in rs3543, are associated with an increased risk of developing secondary lymphedema following surgery. The presence of CT and TT genotypes in this SNP is linked to the occurrence of secondary lymphedema, while the CC genotype is more common in patients without the condition (Hadizadeh2018GJA4Connexin).

In the context of vascular anomalies, a somatic missense mutation, c.121G > T (p.Gly41Cys), in the GJA4 gene has been identified in orbital cavernous venous malformations (OCVM). This mutation results in hyperactive hemichannels, disrupting cellular integrity in endothelial cells, and is found in a high percentage of individuals with OCVM (Hongo2022Somatic).

In cystic fibrosis patients homozygous for the F508del mutation, a variant in the GJA4 gene is associated with more severe clinical outcomes, including higher mortality rates and increased risk of severe lung disease. This variant is linked to elevated levels of inflammatory markers, suggesting a role in neutrophilic inflammation (Horn2020Impact).

## Interactions
The human gene GJA4 encodes the gap junction protein connexin37 (Cx37), which is involved in cell-cell communication within the vasculature. Cx37 interacts with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in endothelial cells, a relationship that influences the function of Cx37 channels and nitric oxide production. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal domain of Cx37 (Cx37CT), which binds to eNOS, particularly the eNOS(843-854) peptide sequence. This binding has been confirmed through techniques such as surface plasmon resonance and cross-linking experiments (Pfenniger2010Gap).

A polymorphism in the Cx37 gene, C1019T, results in a P319S substitution in Cx37CT, affecting its binding affinity to certain peptides. This polymorphism leads to different peptide binding preferences between the Cx37-319P and Cx37-319S isoforms, suggesting selective binding interactions (Pfenniger2010Gap).

Cx37 is also part of multiprotein complexes that include scaffolding proteins, which are crucial for channel localization and activity. These interactions enhance the efficiency and specificity of signal transduction pathways, linking signaling enzymes, substrates, and effectors into a structure often anchored to the cytoskeleton (Hervé2004Diversity).
