# CARTPT

## Overview
CARTPT is a gene that encodes the CART prepropeptide, which is subsequently processed into CART peptides, functioning primarily as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. These peptides play a significant role in the regulation of appetite, energy homeostasis, and reward pathways within the central nervous system. The CART prepropeptide undergoes post-translational modifications to form active peptides, such as CART 42-89 and CART 49-89, which are characterized by specific structural features, including cysteine knots and disulfide bonds, essential for their biological activity (AhmadianMoghadam2018Cocaine; Rogge2008CART). CART peptides interact with various neurotransmitter systems and are involved in multiple physiological processes, including glucose metabolism and stress response. The gene's expression and its polymorphisms have been linked to several clinical conditions, such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and treatment response (Owe-Larsson2023The; Singh2021Demystifying).

## Structure
The CARTPT gene encodes the CART prepropeptide, which is processed into biologically active CART peptides. In humans, only the short form of CART exists, specifically proCART 1-89, which is processed into active peptides such as CART 42-89 and CART 49-89 (Rogge2008CART). The primary structure of the CART peptide includes a sequence of amino acids that undergo post-translational modifications, resulting in active fragments. The mature peptide contains several cleavage sites and three disulfide bonds at the C-terminal end, which are crucial for its biological activity (AhmadianMoghadam2018Cocaine).

The secondary structure of the human CART peptide is characterized by seven alpha helices, seven beta sheets, two coils, and four turns (AhmadianMoghadam2018Cocaine). The structure of active CART peptides includes cysteine knots formed by six conserved cysteine residues, which are essential for their biological function (AhmadianMoghadam2018Cocaine). The tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available context. The peptide also has a conserved C-terminus that, when fused to a transcription factor, exhibits transcriptional function (AhmadianMoghadam2018Cocaine).

## Function
The CARTPT gene encodes the CART prepropeptide, which is processed into CART peptides that function as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the brain. These peptides are involved in regulating appetite, energy homeostasis, and reward pathways. In the central nervous system, CART peptides are primarily anorexigenic, meaning they suppress appetite, and are expressed in brain regions such as the arcuate nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, and paraventricular nucleus, which are critical for appetite regulation (Rogge2008CART; Gilon2016Cocaine). CART peptides interact with various neurotransmitter systems, including neuropeptide Y and serotonin-4 receptors, influencing feeding behavior and energy balance (Rogge2008CART).

CART peptides also play a role in the regulation of the pituitary-thyroid axis, affecting energy expenditure by influencing the release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone (Rogge2008CART). In the pancreas, CART is expressed in islet endocrine cells and is involved in glucose metabolism by stimulating insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon release, contributing to glucose homeostasis (Gilon2016Cocaine). These peptides are also implicated in stress responses and mood regulation, with potential roles in anxiety and depression (Rogge2008CART).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CARTPT gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, CARTPT expression is upregulated in mucinous adenocarcinoma and is associated with decreased overall survival in ER-positive, lymph node-negative breast cancer. It also impairs the response to tamoxifen treatment, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis and treatment response (Owe-Larsson2023The). 

In glioma, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CARTPT gene, such as rs2239670 and rs11575893, have been linked to increased susceptibility, particularly in the Chinese population (Owe-Larsson2023The). High expression levels of CARTPT are also associated with worse survival rates in stomach adenocarcinoma (Owe-Larsson2023The).

CARTPT is involved in metabolic disorders, with genetic variations influencing conditions like obesity and type-2 diabetes. Mutations in the gene are linked to impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance (AhmadianMoghadam2018Cocaine). The gene's expression is also associated with obesity, as alterations in CARTPT can lead to increased food intake and weight gain (Singh2021Demystifying). 

CARTPT polymorphisms have been associated with alcoholism, with increased levels observed in the nucleus accumbens following alcohol consumption (AhmadianMoghadam2018Cocaine).

## Interactions
The CARTPT gene encodes the CART peptide, which participates in various interactions with other proteins and systems. CART peptides are known to interact with the endocannabinoid system, where they are involved in the orexigenic effects of anandamide, a compound that increases appetite through Cb1 receptors (Rogge2008CART). CART peptides also interact with the dopaminergic system, particularly in the nucleus accumbens, where they modulate dopamine activity and blunt the locomotor-activating effects of stimulants like amphetamine and cocaine (Rogge2008CART).

CART peptides are involved in G-protein signaling pathways, specifically through inhibitory G proteins (Gi/o), suggesting the existence of a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for CART peptides. This interaction leads to the inhibition of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling (Rogge2008CART). Recent studies have identified GPR160 as a potential receptor for CART, mediating CART-induced cellular responses such as ERK phosphorylation (Yosten2021Past; Singh2021Demystifying).

CART peptides also interact with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, influencing hormone release and stress responses. They stimulate the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone and regulate prolactin secretion (Rogge2008CART).
