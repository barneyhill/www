# SH2D6

## Overview
SH2D6 is a gene that encodes the SH2 domain containing 6 protein, which is primarily involved in intracellular signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by its SH2 domain, which facilitates binding to phosphotyrosine residues, a critical function in signal transduction processes. SH2D6 is implicated in various cellular activities, including cell growth, differentiation, and immune responses, by participating in transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (Wu2023DNA). Additionally, SH2D6 may interact with kinesin-light chain 1 (KLC1) through a potential KLC1-binding motif, suggesting a role in intracellular transport mechanisms (Nguyen2018Characterization). The protein's involvement in colorectal cancer as a trans-eQTL target highlights its significance in genomic regulation and tuft cell differentiation (Harris2022Transcriptional).

## Function
SH2D6, also known as SH2 domain containing 6, is a protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to signal transduction and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (Wu2023DNA). The SH2 domain of SH2D6 is known for binding phosphotyrosine residues, which is crucial for signal transduction in cells. This protein plays a role in cellular communication, affecting processes like cell growth, differentiation, and immune responses.

SH2D6 is suggested to have a potential role in intracellular signal transduction, as it is involved in pathways that are essential for cellular communication and function (Wu2023DNA). It is also noted for having a potential KLC1-binding motif, which may facilitate its interaction with the TPR domain of kinesin-light chain 1 (KLC1), suggesting a role in kinesin1 transport (Nguyen2018Characterization). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence various organismal outcomes by modulating these pathways.

In the context of colorectal cancer, SH2D6 has been identified as a trans-eQTL target involved in tuft cell-specific expression, indicating its role in the genomic regulation landscape and potential involvement in tuft cell differentiation (Harris2022Transcriptional).
