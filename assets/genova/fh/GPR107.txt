# GPR107

## Overview
GPR107 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 107, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family characterized by a seven transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is involved in various cellular processes, including receptor-mediated endocytosis and retrograde transport, playing a crucial role in the trafficking and recycling of plasma membrane receptors. The GPR107 protein is essential for cellular homeostasis and response to external stimuli, with significant implications in glucose metabolism and toxin transport. It is particularly important in pancreatic α-cells for neuronostatin signaling, which affects glucagon secretion. The gene's disruption can lead to embryonic lethality in mice, underscoring its critical role in development and nutrient transport. While GPR107's involvement in certain cellular processes is well-documented, specific human diseases directly linked to its mutations or expression changes remain to be fully elucidated (Edgar2007Human; Zhou2014Deficits; Tafesse2014GPR107).

## Structure
The GPR107 protein is encoded by the human GPR107 gene located at 9q34.2-3 and spans 86.4 kb with 18 exons (Edgar2007Human). The protein consists of 552 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 61,976 Da (Edgar2007Human). It features a seven transmembrane domain (7TM), known as the LUSTR domain, which is characteristic of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Edgar2007Human). The LUSTR domain is composed of seven predicted transmembrane alpha-helices, with conserved cytoplasmic loops 2 and 3, and a conserved glycine-polar-glycine sequence in loop 2, suggesting a role in G-protein binding (Edgar2007Human).

The protein's structure includes an amino-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide sequence, a long extracellular domain, and a carboxy-terminal domain with seven transmembrane helices (Edgar2007Human). The amino-terminal half is extracellular and contains a cleaved membrane signal peptide sequence, while the carboxy-terminal half contains the LUSTR domain (Edgar2007Human). GPR107 undergoes proteolytic cleavage by furin, resulting in two fragments connected by a disulfide bond, which is essential for its function (Tafesse2014GPR107). The protein also contains predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (Tafesse2014GPR107). There are reports of splice variant isoforms, but only isoform 2 has been detected in certain studies (Tafesse2014GPR107).

## Function
GPR107 is a G protein-coupled receptor involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in receptor-mediated endocytosis and recycling. It plays a significant role in the trafficking of plasma membrane receptors, such as transferrin receptor type 1 (TRFC1), LRP1, and integrin a5, which are involved in clathrin-coated vesicular recycling. GPR107 interacts with clathrin and VPS35, indicating its involvement in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and early endocytic processing (Zhou2014Deficits).

In pancreatic α-cells, GPR107 is crucial for neuronostatin signaling, which increases proglucagon mRNA levels through a cAMP-independent pathway involving protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. This interaction suggests a role in glucose metabolism and regulation of glucagon secretion (Elrick2016Neuronostatin).

GPR107 is also localized to the trans-Golgi network and is involved in retrograde transport processes, such as the transport of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. It undergoes proteolytic cleavage by furin, although this cleavage is not essential for its function in toxin transport (Tafesse2014GPR107). These roles highlight GPR107's importance in cellular homeostasis and response to external stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the GPR107 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. The disruption of GPR107 in mice leads to embryonic lethality, highlighting its critical role in development. This lethality is associated with impaired receptor-mediated endocytosis and recycling, particularly affecting the cubilin-megalin endocytic receptor complex, which is crucial for nutrient transport during embryogenesis (Zhou2014Deficits). GPR107-null cells exhibit defects in the internalization and recycling of transferrin, impacting iron uptake and potentially leading to conditions related to impaired iron metabolism (Zhou2014Deficits).

GPR107 is also involved in the cellular uptake of bacterial toxins, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A and cholera toxin. Cells lacking GPR107 show resistance to these toxins, suggesting that alterations in GPR107 expression or function could influence susceptibility to toxin-related diseases (Tafesse2014GPR107). The gene's role in retrograde transport and its interactions with proteins like clathrin and VPS35 further underscore its importance in cellular processes that, when disrupted, may contribute to disease (Zhou2014Deficits). However, specific human diseases directly linked to GPR107 mutations or expression changes are not detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
GPR107, a G protein-coupled receptor, is involved in several cellular processes, including retrograde transport and signal transduction. It is localized in the trans-Golgi network and is cleaved by the protease furin, resulting in two fragments that remain associated through a disulfide bond, which is crucial for its function (Tafesse2014GPR107). This cleavage and the resulting structural configuration suggest a role in protein trafficking, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available studies (Tafesse2014GPR107).

In pancreatic α-cells, GPR107 interacts with neuronostatin, a peptide that increases proglucagon mRNA levels. This interaction is specific to α-cells, as GPR107 is not expressed in β-cells. The colocalization of GPR107 and neuronostatin has been demonstrated using confocal microscopy, indicating a physical interaction on the α-cell membranes (Elrick2016Neuronostatin).

In the context of liver tumor initiating cells, GPR107 expression is regulated by the long noncoding RNA lncGPR107, which recruits the SRCAP complex to the GPR107 promoter, facilitating its transcriptional activation. This interaction highlights the role of GPR107 in liver tumorigenesis, although the article discussing this finding has been retracted (Huang2018RETRACTED).
