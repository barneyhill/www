# RBM4

## Overview
RBM4 (RNA binding motif protein 4) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including alternative splicing, mRNA translation, and RNA stability. The protein, characterized by its two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a CCHC-type zinc finger domain, functions primarily as a splicing factor and is involved in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (Foroushani2020Posttranscriptional; Niu2022GQuadruplex). RBM4 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and plays critical roles in cellular processes such as muscle cell differentiation, pancreatic cell differentiation, and stress response (Lin2013RBM4; Markus2016Transcriptome-wide). Its involvement in cancer biology is complex and tissue-specific, acting as an oncogene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma while serving as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer (Chen2023RBM4; Yong2019RNABinding).

## Structure
RBM4 (RNA binding motif protein 4) is characterized by its structural components that facilitate its role in RNA processing. The protein contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a CCHC-type zinc finger domain, which are indicative of its function as a splicing factor and its potential role in RNA binding (Foroushani2020Posttranscriptional; Niu2022GQuadruplex). The RRMs are crucial for its interaction with RNA, while the zinc finger domain suggests a role in nucleic acid binding, although the zinc finger is not necessary for its interaction with WT1 (Markus2006WT1).

RBM4 also features a C-terminal alanine-rich domain (CAD), which is important for protein-protein interactions and splicing effects (Markus2006WT1). This domain is distinct from the RS-rich domains found in other splicing regulators, highlighting RBM4's unique structural properties. The protein's structure allows it to bind specifically to G-quadruplex structures in RNA, which is crucial for its role in regulating translation under stress conditions (Niu2022GQuadruplex).

RBM4 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which may differ in their functional roles, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
RBM4 (RNA binding motif protein 4) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, mRNA translation, and RNA stability. It plays a significant role in modulating alternative splicing of precursor mRNAs, influencing the expression of specific isoforms critical for various cellular functions (Markus2006WT1; Lin2013RBM4). RBM4 contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a zinc finger, which are essential for its function in RNA processing (Sutherland2004RNA).

In the context of pancreatic cell differentiation, RBM4 regulates the alternative splicing of transcription factors such as Isl1 and Pax4, promoting insulin gene expression and contributing to the differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells (Lin2013RBM4). It also influences glucose-induced insulin expression and insulin receptor isoform switches, enhancing glucose uptake and signaling (Lin2013RBM4).

RBM4 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and is involved in various cellular processes, including muscle cell differentiation and stress response. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it modulates splicing, and in the cytoplasm, where it influences mRNA turnover and translation under stress conditions (Foroushani2020Posttranscriptional; Markus2016Transcriptome-wide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RBM4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, demonstrating its clinical significance. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), RBM4 is overexpressed, promoting a malignant phenotype by facilitating glutamine-dependent survival and proliferation of cancer cells. This overexpression disrupts the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway, allowing cancer cells to bypass senescence and sustain growth. Clinically, ESCC patients with high RBM4 and low LKB1 expression have poorer overall survival, and this expression pattern increases sensitivity to the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Chen2023RBM4).

In contrast, RBM4 acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, where its expression is significantly reduced. Lower RBM4 levels are associated with poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and reduced overall survival, making it an independent prognostic factor. The downregulation of RBM4 in gastric cancer suggests its potential role in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, possibly through the MAPK signaling pathway (Yong2019RNABinding; Yong2016Prognostic).

RBM4's role in cancer appears to be tissue-specific, acting as an oncogene in ESCC while serving as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, highlighting its complex involvement in cancer biology (Chen2023RBM4; Yong2019RNABinding).

## Interactions
RBM4 (RNA binding motif protein 4) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with SR-proteins in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli, and associates with eIF4-containing complexes during stress conditions to switch mRNA binding (Markus2016Transcriptome-wide). RBM4 is also involved in microRNA-guided gene silencing by associating with argonaute (Ago) proteins, which are crucial for RNA silencing (Markus2016Transcriptome-wide).

RBM4 interacts with the Wilm's tumor protein (WT1), specifically the WT1(+KTS) isoform, which can inhibit RBM4's effect on alternative splicing. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal region of RBM4, which is necessary for its splicing effect (Markus2006WT1). The interaction between RBM4 and WT1 is significant as WT1 is involved in various molecular processes, including differentiation and cancer (Markus2006WT1).

RBM4 also binds to human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), particularly HERV-K and HERV-H transcripts, regulating their expression through specific binding motifs. This interaction is primarily with the 5′ and 3′ long terminal repeats (LTRs) of HERV-K (Foroushani2020Posttranscriptional). These interactions highlight RBM4's role in modulating gene expression and its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways (Markus2016Transcriptome-wide).
