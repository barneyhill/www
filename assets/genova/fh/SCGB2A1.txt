# SCGB2A1

## Overview
SCGB2A1 is a gene that encodes the protein secretoglobin family 2A member 1, also known as Mammaglobin-B. This protein is a member of the secretoglobin superfamily, which is characterized by its small, secreted proteins with roles in anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. SCGB2A1 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues such as the breast and prostate, where it is involved in cellular signaling and maintaining tissue homeostasis. The protein is implicated in various metabolic and signaling pathways, including lipid metabolism and the regulation of androgen biosynthesis, highlighting its potential role in hormone-related processes and cancer biology (Zhang2019LINC00365‑SCGB2A1; Zhou2020Decreased).

## Function
SCGB2A1, also known as secretoglobin family 2A member 1, is a gene that encodes a small secreted protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is part of the secretoglobin superfamily, which is typically associated with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. SCGB2A1 is expressed in several epithelial tissues, including the breast and prostate, where it plays roles in cellular signaling and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Zhang2019LINC00365‑SCGB2A1).

In healthy human cells, SCGB2A1 is involved in regulating lipid metabolism and may influence cell proliferation through the MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways (Zhou2020Decreased). It is also implicated in the regulation of androgen biosynthesis and the androgen receptor/steroid signaling pathway, particularly in prostate cancer, suggesting a broader role in hormone-related cellular processes (Zhou2020Decreased).

SCGB2A1's expression is linked to pathways such as fatty acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cytochrome P450 drug metabolism, indicating its involvement in metabolic processes (Zhou2020Decreased). The protein's activity in these pathways suggests it may contribute to maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis by modulating metabolic and signaling processes.

## Clinical Significance
The SCGB2A1 gene, also known as secretoglobin family 2A member 1, has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of endometrial cancer. Alterations in the expression of SCGB2A1 are associated with various adverse clinicopathological features in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Decreased expression of SCGB2A1 is linked to older age at diagnosis, higher tumor grade, presence of residual tumor, positive peritoneal cytology, lymph node metastasis, and advanced clinical stage (Zhou2020Decreased). 

Low SCGB2A1 expression is correlated with worse survival outcomes, making it an independent prognostic factor for UCEC. Patients with lower levels of SCGB2A1 expression tend to have poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhou2020Decreased). The gene's expression is also associated with specific biological pathways, such as the TGF-β signaling pathway, JAK-STAT pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway, which are linked to tumor proliferation and progression (Zhou2020Decreased). 

These findings highlight the potential of SCGB2A1 as a target for novel therapeutic strategies in endometrial cancer, emphasizing the need for further evaluation of its role in cancer prognosis and treatment (Zhou2020Decreased).

## Interactions
SCGB2A1, also known as Mammaglobin-B, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It has been identified as an interactor with PIK3CA, a gene frequently mutated in breast cancer. This interaction was discovered using affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) in MCF7 cells, where SCGB2A1 was shown to interact with PIK3CA, acting as a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Knockdown of SCGB2A1 led to increased AKT phosphorylation, indicating its role in inhibiting this pathway (Kim2021A).

In breast cancer, SCGB2A1 is part of the LINC00365-SCGB2A1 axis, which modulates the NF-κB signaling pathway. Overexpression of SCGB2A1 in breast cancer cell lines has been shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of IκBα, suppressing NF-κB activity and reducing cell viability. This suggests that SCGB2A1 may interact with components of the NF-κB pathway to exert its effects (Zhang2019LINC00365‑SCGB2A1).

SCGB2A1 is also associated with other members of the secretoglobin family, such as SCGB1D1 and SCGB1D2, forming heterodimers and potentially tetramers with SCGB2A2. These interactions suggest a role in modulating cellular processes through complex formation (Heinonen2015Identification).
