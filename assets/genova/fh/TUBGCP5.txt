# TUBGCP5

## Overview
TUBGCP5, or tubulin gamma complex component 5, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), a key player in microtubule nucleation. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the γ-TuRC, which is essential for organizing microtubules at the centrosome, thereby facilitating proper chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle formation during cell division (Maver2019Rare; TeixidóTravesa2012The). TUBGCP5 contributes to the structural integrity of the γ-TuRC through its conserved Grip domains, which are crucial for the helical arrangement of subcomplexes within the complex (TeixidóTravesa2012The). The protein's interactions with other γ-TuRC components and its regulation by kinases like glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3b) underscore its role in the spatial and temporal control of microtubule arrays, impacting various cellular processes (TeixidóTravesa2012The).

## Structure


## Function
TUBGCP5, also known as tubulin gamma complex component 5, is a crucial part of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which plays a significant role in microtubule nucleation, a process essential for cell division and maintaining cellular structure. The γ-TuRC is responsible for organizing microtubules at the centrosome, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle formation during cell division (Maver2019Rare; TeixidóTravesa2012The).

TUBGCP5 is involved in the structural assembly of the γ-TuRC, contributing to its integrity through conserved Grip domains. These domains are important for the helical arrangement of smaller subcomplexes within the γ-TuRC, which are necessary for microtubule nucleation (TeixidóTravesa2012The). TUBGCP5 may also play a role in targeting γ-TuRCs to specific cellular locations, such as non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) during processes like oogenesis in Drosophila (TeixidóTravesa2012The).

In human cells, TUBGCP5 is a substrate for glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3b), which may regulate the localization of gamma-tubulin at mitotic centrosomes, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (TeixidóTravesa2012The). The protein's activity is crucial for the spatial and temporal control of microtubule arrays, impacting cellular processes such as chromosome segregation and organelle transport (TeixidóTravesa2012The).

## Clinical Significance
The TUBGCP5 gene, located on chromosomal band 15q11.2, is implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders due to its role in the gamma-tubulin complex, which is essential for microtubule organization. Alterations in TUBGCP5 expression or mutations are associated with conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, epilepsy, and microcephaly (Rafi2020The). The gene is part of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion syndrome, a common cytogenetic abnormality linked to ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (Rafi2020The).

TUBGCP5 is not associated with Angelman syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, or peripheral nervous system diseases (Rafi2020The). However, it is linked to neurobehavioral psychiatric problems, including autism, dyslexia, and schizophrenia/paranoid psychosis (Rafi2020The). The gene's interactions with other proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization may contribute to its role in these disorders (Rafi2020The).

The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion, which includes TUBGCP5, is associated with developmental delays, intellectual disability, and neurobehavioral disturbances, with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity (Zhuang2024Prenatal; Butler2017Clinical).

## Interactions
TUBGCP5, a component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions essential for microtubule nucleation and organization. It interacts with other gamma-tubulin complex proteins, including TUBGCP2, TUBGCP3, TUBGCP4, and TUBGCP6, forming a stable complex that is crucial for the assembly of the γ-TuRC (Ramesh2023Prediction; Würtz2022Modular). These interactions facilitate the formation of the γ-TuRC, which is vital for microtubule nucleation at the centrosome (Ramesh2023Prediction).

TUBGCP5 also plays a role in the assembly of the γ-TuRC by interacting with MZT1, forming a structural module that contributes to the stabilization of the complex (Würtz2022Modular). This interaction is part of a larger assembly process involving the formation of a 6-spoked core, which is a minimal stable intermediate in the γ-TuRC assembly (Würtz2022Modular). The presence of MZT1-GCP modules on the outer surface of the γ-TuRC suggests a role in providing extended intersubunit interfaces, which are important for the structural integrity and function of the complex (Würtz2022Modular).
