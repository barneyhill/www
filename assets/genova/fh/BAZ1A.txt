# BAZ1A

## Overview
BAZ1A is a gene that encodes the protein bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 1A, also known as ACF1, which is a non-catalytic subunit of the ISWI family of chromatin remodelers. This protein plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling, a process essential for DNA accessibility during transcription, recombination, and repair. ACF1 is characterized by its bromodomain (BD) and plant homeodomain (PHD), which facilitate interactions with DNA and histones, respectively, contributing to its function in DNA damage response and chromatin organization (Zaghlool2016A; Oppikofer2017Noncanonical). The BAZ1A gene is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription regulation, and cellular senescence, and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Mohan2024Alternative; Li2019Chromatin).

## Structure
The BAZ1A gene encodes the ACF1 protein, a multi-domain protein involved in chromatin remodeling. ACF1 consists of 1556 amino acids and includes several conserved motifs that facilitate interactions with DNA, histones, and other components of the ACF complex (Zaghlool2016A). The protein features a bromodomain (BD) and a plant homeodomain (PHD) near its C-terminus. The PHD module is unusual in that it binds DNA rather than histones, facilitated by lysine residues K1181 and K1183, which create a positively charged surface for DNA interaction (Oppikofer2017Noncanonical). The BD contains a non-canonical glutamic acid gatekeeper residue, which affects its binding affinity for acetylated histone peptides (Oppikofer2017Noncanonical).

BAZ1A is a subunit of the ISWI-family chromatin remodelers ACF and CHRAC, which are crucial for DNA access during transcription, recombination, and repair (Dowdle2013Mouse). The protein interacts with nucleosome-adjacent linker DNA, enhancing the affinity and processivity of the ATPase on nucleosomal substrates (Dowdle2013Mouse). BAZ1A undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as BAZ1A-LF and BAZ1A-SF, which differ in their ability to repair DNA damage due to structural changes (Mohan2024Alternative). These structural features and interactions highlight BAZ1A's role in chromatin remodeling and DNA damage response.

## Function
The BAZ1A gene encodes a non-catalytic subunit of the ISWI family of chromatin remodelers, which are crucial for mobilizing nucleosomes to control DNA accessibility. In healthy human cells, BAZ1A plays a significant role in DNA damage recovery by recruiting the ATPase SMARCA5 to sites of damaged chromatin, thereby promoting survival and recovery from DNA damage (Oppikofer2017Noncanonical). BAZ1A is involved in nucleotide excision repair and double-stranded DNA break repair, facilitating processes like G2/M checkpoint activation and recruiting repair complexes (Oppikofer2017Noncanonical).

BAZ1A contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) and a bromodomain (BD), which are critical for its function. The PHD module has the unusual ability to bind DNA, while the BD binds weakly to acetylated histone peptides. These domains are important for regulating the loading of ISWI factors at DNA lesions and supporting transcriptional programs necessary for cell survival (Oppikofer2017Noncanonical). BAZ1A also plays a role in maintaining chromatin structure and facilitating DNA repair mechanisms, which are crucial for genomic stability (Oppikofer2017Noncanonical). Additionally, BAZ1A is involved in chromatin remodeling and has been shown to regulate cellular senescence in both normal and cancer cells (Li2019Chromatin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BAZ1A gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers. A de novo mutation in BAZ1A, specifically a p.Phe1348Cys variant, has been identified in a child with intellectual disability (ID). This mutation affects chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation, leading to altered expression of genes involved in vitamin D metabolism, such as CYP24A1, and is associated with clinical features like severe ID, autism, and seizures (Zaghlool2016A). BAZ1A mutations have also been linked to neurodevelopmental impairment and syndromic brain malformations, highlighting its role in neural development (Weitensteiner2018Exome).

In cancer, BAZ1A is overexpressed in colorectal cancer, where it plays a critical role in cell proliferation and survival. Knockdown of BAZ1A in colon cancer cell lines results in decreased cell viability, increased DNA damage, and apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in the DNA damage response and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways (Mohan2024Alternative). Additionally, BAZ1A knockdown in both cancer and normal cells induces cellular senescence by upregulating SMAD3 and CDKN1A (p21), indicating its role in regulating cellular senescence (Li2019Chromatin). These findings underscore the clinical significance of BAZ1A in various diseases.

## Interactions
BAZ1A, also known as ACF1, is a component of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex ACF and interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a complex with SMARCA5 (also known as SNF2H), a chromatin remodeler, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including DNA damage repair and chromatin remodeling (Li2019Chromatin; Oppikofer2017Noncanonical). BAZ1A recruits SMARCA5 to sites of DNA damage, promoting cell survival and facilitating DNA repair processes such as nucleotide excision repair and nonhomologous end joining (Oppikofer2017Noncanonical).

BAZ1A also interacts with chromatin through its plant homeodomain (PHD) and bromodomain (BD), which bind to DNA and acetylated histones, respectively. These interactions are essential for its role in chromatin organization and transcription regulation (Oppikofer2017Noncanonical). The PHD module of BAZ1A binds directly to DNA, a feature distinct from other PHD modules that typically recognize histone tails (Oppikofer2017Noncanonical).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, BAZ1A is involved in cellular senescence through the SMAD3-p21 signaling axis, where it binds to the promoter region of SMAD3, influencing gene expression and cell proliferation (Li2019Chromatin).
