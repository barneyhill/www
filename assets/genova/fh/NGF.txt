# NGF

## Overview
The NGF gene encodes the nerve growth factor protein, a pivotal neurotrophin involved in the regulation of growth, maintenance, and survival of certain target neurons. As a member of the neurotrophin family, NGF plays a crucial role in the development and function of the peripheral nervous system by promoting neuronal differentiation and survival. The protein is characterized by a complex structure, including a cystine knot motif, and functions primarily through interactions with its high-affinity receptor TrkA and low-affinity receptor p75 NTR. These interactions initiate signaling pathways that are essential for neuronal health and development (Frade1998Nerve; Bradshaw1994Nerve). Beyond its neurological roles, NGF is also involved in immune responses and skin physiology, influencing processes such as lymphocyte proliferation and melanocyte behavior (Yaar1991Evidence; LeviMontalcini1996Nerve). Mutations in the NGF gene are linked to hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies, highlighting its clinical significance in pain perception and neurodegenerative conditions (Carvalho2010A; Sung2018Swedish).

## Structure
The nerve growth factor (NGF) protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several levels of organization. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain with 118 amino acids, featuring three intrachain disulfide bonds that contribute to its stability (Bradshaw1994Nerve). The secondary structure of NGF is rich in beta-pleated strands, forming two pairs of antiparallel beta-pleated strands in an elongated configuration (Bradshaw1994Nerve). 

In its tertiary structure, NGF exhibits a unique protein fold, which is crucial for its biological function and interaction with receptors (McDonald1991New). The quaternary structure of NGF is a homodimer, formed by two protomers oriented head-to-head, with an extensive subunit interface largely composed of hydrophobic interactions involving aromatic residues like tryptophans and tyrosines (Bradshaw1994Nerve). 

NGF also contains a cystine knot motif, a structural feature that contributes to its stability and function. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are present in NGF, influencing its stability and activity (Earl2006Posttranslational). These structural characteristics are essential for NGF's role in nerve growth and development.

## Function
Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) is a critical neurotrophin involved in the survival, growth, and differentiation of neurons, particularly in the peripheral nervous system. It primarily exerts its effects through binding to the high-affinity receptor TrkA and the low-affinity receptor p75 NTR. The interaction with TrkA initiates signaling pathways that promote neuronal survival and differentiation, while p75 NTR can modulate these effects and, in some contexts, induce apoptosis (Frade1998Nerve).

In human mast cells, NGF is expressed and can interact with TrkA receptors, leading to phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways. This interaction influences cellular processes such as gene expression and neurite outgrowth, indicating a functional role for NGF in these cells (Nilsson1997Human). NGF is also involved in the immune system, where it affects the proliferation of B- and T-lymphocytes and acts as an autocrine survival factor for memory B lymphocytes (LeviMontalcini1996Nerve).

In the skin, NGF is synthesized by keratinocytes and influences melanocyte behavior, suggesting a paracrine role in the epidermis. It modulates gene expression and enhances dendricity in melanocytes, potentially contributing to skin pigmentation and response to ultraviolet exposure (Yaar1991Evidence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NGF gene are associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type V (HSAN V), a condition characterized by a loss of pain perception and orthopedic issues such as painless fractures. The NGF R100W mutation allows NGF to bind to TrkA receptors but not to p75 NTR, affecting pain signaling pathways and leading to a loss of C and A delta sensory fibers, reduced sensory innervation of the skin, and reduced sympathetic innervation of sweat glands (Sung2018Swedish; Capsoni2011Taking). This mutation results in nociceptor priming without causing acute sensitization, unlike wild-type NGF (Sung2018Swedish).

Another mutation, c.[680C>A]+[681_682delGG], results in a frameshift that alters the terminal amino acids of the NGF protein, impairing its function and contributing to the HSAN5 phenotype. This mutation leads to a complete inability to perceive pain, mental retardation, anhidrosis, and chronic immunodeficiency (Carvalho2010A).

Alterations in NGF expression levels and its interactions are also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, where an imbalance between proNGF and mature NGF levels can drive neurodegeneration (Cattaneo2019Painless).

## Interactions
Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) interacts with several proteins, primarily through its receptors TrkA and p75. NGF binds to the TrkA receptor, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, which is crucial for its biological functions such as neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival. This interaction induces tyrosine phosphorylation, essential for signal transduction (Bradshaw1994Nerve; Woo1998Characterization). The binding of NGF to TrkA involves a 2:2 stoichiometry, with the Ig-C2 domain of TrkA directly engaging with NGF, forming a complex that resembles a crab structure (Wehrman2007Structural).

NGF also interacts with the p75 receptor, which binds NGF but does not transduce signals leading to differentiation. Instead, it may be involved in apoptosis (Bradshaw1994Nerve). The NGF-p75 complex has been structurally characterized, revealing an NGF homodimer asymmetrically bound to a single p75, suggesting a mechanism for neurotrophin signaling through p75 (He2004Structure).

Additionally, NGF forms a complex with α and γ subunits in the mouse 7S NGF complex, where these subunits potentially inhibit NGF's binding to its receptors (Bax1997Structure). These interactions highlight NGF's role in modulating neuronal functions through complex receptor interactions.
