# TRPM4

## Overview
TRPM4 is a gene that encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4, a calcium-activated non-selective cation channel. This protein is part of the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) subfamily and is characterized by its ability to conduct monovalent cations, such as sodium and potassium, while being impermeable to calcium ions. The TRPM4 channel plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including the regulation of membrane potential and calcium homeostasis across different cell types. It is involved in critical functions within the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems, influencing cardiac rhythm, neuronal excitability, and T cell activation, respectively (Launay2004TRPM4; Dienes2021Pharmacological). The channel's widespread expression and functional diversity underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis, while its dysregulation is implicated in several pathophysiological conditions, including cardiac arrhythmias, neurological disorders, and certain cancers (Syam2016Variants; Dienes2021Pharmacological).

## Structure
The TRPM4 protein is a member of the transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) subfamily and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. It consists of six transmembrane domains (TM1-6) with a pore region between TM5 and TM6, and it lacks the classic voltage sensor found in other voltage-gated ion channels (Huang2020A; Nilius2006From). The protein's N terminus contains the TRPM homology domain, while the C terminus includes a coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for forming a homotetramer via parallel coiled-coils (Chen2019Emerging; Nilius2006From).

TRPM4 features several functional domains, including calmodulin binding sites, phosphorylation sites for PKA and PKC, and a pleckstrin homology domain (Nilius2006From). The protein also contains Walker B ATP binding motifs and a selectivity filter formed by the FGQ motif, which is important for its ion selectivity, particularly for monovalent ions like Na+ and K+ (Chen2019Emerging).

The quaternary structure of TRPM4 involves the assembly of multiple subunits, with the C-terminal domain forming an umbrellalike structure where the four C termini create a homotetramer (Chen2019Emerging). The protein's structure is stabilized by a conserved disulfide bond in the pore region, which is crucial for ion permeability and gating mechanisms (Chen2019Emerging).

## Function
TRPM4 is a calcium-activated non-selective cation channel that plays a crucial role in regulating membrane potential and calcium homeostasis in various cell types. It primarily conducts sodium ions, which leads to membrane depolarization, influencing calcium signaling pathways without directly conducting calcium ions (Launay2004TRPM4; Dienes2021Pharmacological). In T cells, TRPM4 modulates calcium oscillations following activation, which is essential for interleukin-2 production and T cell activation (Launay2004TRPM4). 

In the cardiovascular system, TRPM4 is involved in cardiac conduction and rhythm regulation. It affects the action potential duration in atrial cells and is implicated in cardiac arrhythmias when mutated (Dienes2021Pharmacological). TRPM4 is also expressed in the pancreas, where it regulates insulin secretion, and in vascular smooth muscle, influencing vascular tone (Dienes2021Pharmacological).

In the nervous system, TRPM4 contributes to neuronal excitability and signaling. It is involved in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons and affects the firing patterns of various neuron types (Dienes2021Pharmacological). TRPM4's widespread expression and regulatory functions highlight its importance in maintaining physiological processes across different organ systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TRPM4 gene are linked to various diseases, particularly affecting cardiac and central nervous systems, as well as certain cancers. In the heart, TRPM4 mutations are associated with cardiac conduction disorders such as atrioventricular block, Brugada syndrome, and progressive familial heart block type I. These mutations can lead to either gain-of-function or loss-of-function effects, impacting cardiac electrical activity and potentially causing life-threatening arrhythmias (Hu2023The; Syam2016Variants; Kruse2009Impaired). 

In the central nervous system, the TRPM4 channel, particularly in complex with SUR1, is implicated in edema formation following injury or stroke, contributing to cytotoxic and vasogenic edema (Dienes2021Pharmacological). 

TRPM4 is also overexpressed in several cancers, including prostate, breast, cervical, and endometrial cancers, as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Its expression correlates with poor prognosis and survival in some cancers, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Dienes2021Pharmacological). 

Overall, TRPM4's role in these conditions highlights its clinical significance as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TRPM4 interacts with various proteins that influence its function and localization. It forms multimeric complexes necessary for its channel activity, with the C-terminal region being crucial for this multimerization (Launay2004TRPM4). TRPM4 also interacts with TRPV4 in human trabecular meshwork cells, where it is involved in calcium oscillations. This interaction is essential for TRPV4-dependent calcium signaling, as TRPM4 knockdown significantly reduces these oscillations (Yarishkin2022Emergent).

In vascular smooth muscle cells, TRPM4 is activated by noradrenalin and is involved in myogenic vasoconstriction. It cooperates with TRPC6, where TRPC6 activation leads to calcium influx and further activation of the IP3 receptor, which co-localizes with TRPM4, resulting in depolarization and smooth muscle contraction (Dienes2021Pharmacological).

Despite hypotheses suggesting a potential interaction between TRPM4 and the sulfonylurea receptor SUR1, studies have shown no functional or structural association between them. Electrophysiological and FRET analyses indicate that SUR1 does not modify TRPM4 channel properties, suggesting that these proteins do not form a complex (SalaRabanal2012On).
