# YEATS4

## Overview
YEATS4 is a gene that encodes the YEATS domain-containing protein 4, a member of the YEATS domain protein family, which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. The YEATS4 protein functions as an epigenetic reader, specifically recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histones, such as H3K27ac and H3K14ac, thereby promoting transcriptional activation of target genes (Xian2023Mechanistic; Still2018YEATS4). It is a crucial component of the SRCAP and Tip60 complexes, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair processes (Xian2023Mechanistic). The protein's involvement in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell proliferation, and immune cell differentiation, underscores its importance in maintaining cellular functions and its potential implications in cancer progression and drug resistance (Liu2019Yeats4; Xian2023Mechanistic).

## Structure
The YEATS4 protein, encoded by the YEATS4 gene, is a member of the YEATS domain protein family and is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. It consists of 227 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 26.7 kDa (Xian2023Mechanistic). The protein contains a highly conserved YEATS domain located between amino acid residues 44 and 123, which is crucial for its role as an acetyllysine reader, specifically binding to acetylated lysines on histones such as H3K27ac and H3K14ac (Klein2017Yaf9; Still2018YEATS4). This domain is characterized by an immunoglobulin fold structure with eight antiparallel β-strands and two α-helices (Wang2018Identification).

The C-terminus of YEATS4 features a negatively charged α-helix structure, which is involved in protein interactions and dimerization, enhancing its binding affinity to diacetylated histones (Xian2023Mechanistic). YEATS4 also contains a coiled-coil domain starting at amino acid 168, which is essential for its incorporation into the human TIP60 complex (Still2018YEATS4). The protein exists in two isoforms: isoform 1, which is 227 amino acids long, and isoform 2, which is 173 amino acids long and lacks part of the YEATS domain (Still2018YEATS4).

## Function
The YEATS4 gene encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular functions. YEATS4 is a component of the SRCAP and Tip60 complexes, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription (Xian2023Mechanistic; Still2018YEATS4). It functions as an epigenetic reader, recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histones, specifically binding to H3K27ac and H3K14ac, which promotes transcriptional activation of target genes (Xian2023Mechanistic). 

YEATS4 is also involved in DNA repair during replication, where its upregulation promotes DNA damage repair and prevents cell death, while its downregulation inhibits DNA replication and induces apoptosis (Xian2023Mechanistic). It interacts with various proteins, including those related to spindle formation, playing a critical role in cell proliferation and cycle formation (Still2018YEATS4). 

In the immune system, YEATS4 is highly expressed in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and their progenitors, where it regulates the differentiation of common lymphoid progenitors towards ILC lineages, essential for immune responses (Liu2019Yeats4).

## Clinical Significance
The YEATS4 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its role in chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. Overexpression of YEATS4 is associated with tumor progression in several cancers, including breast, ovarian, liver, glioblastoma, uterine fibroids, liposarcoma, pancreatic, gastric, non-small cell lung, colorectal, and acute leukemia (Xian2023Mechanistic). In breast cancer, YEATS4 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression by recognizing H3K27ac in the ZEB1 promoter (Xian2023Mechanistic). In glioblastoma, YEATS4 interacts with n-Myc and c-Myc, affecting the P21/P53 pathway and impairing apoptosis and migration (Xian2023Mechanistic). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), YEATS4 overexpression decreases P53 activity, enhancing chemoresistance (Xian2023Mechanistic). In pancreatic cancer, YEATS4 upregulation promotes cell proliferation and migration, potentially through the Wnt pathway (Still2018YEATS4). In gastric cancer, YEATS4 enhances Wnt/β-Catenin signaling, increasing invasiveness (Xian2023Mechanistic). 

YEATS4 is also involved in drug resistance in ovarian cancer, where it regulates drug resistance alongside TFEB1 (Xian2023Mechanistic). In colorectal cancer, YEATS4 knockdown inhibits cell growth, and its expression is negatively regulated by miR-218 (Xian2023Mechanistic). These findings suggest that YEATS4 is a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
YEATS4, also known as GAS41, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. It is a component of the human Tip60 and SRCAP complexes, which are involved in gene regulation and DNA repair (Xian2023Mechanistic; Still2018YEATS4). YEATS4 interacts with several proteins, including MYC, MYCN, TACC1, TACC2, NuMa, AF10, PFDN1, and KIAA1009, although its knockdown does not affect their expression at the mRNA level (Xian2023Mechanistic; Pikor2013YEATS4). It also interacts with transcription factors such as TFAP2A and MYC family members, influencing the regulation of genes like CTNNB1, CCND1, CDK4, CDK6, BCL2, and BAX (Still2018YEATS4).

YEATS4 acts as a chromatin modification reader, recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histones, specifically binding to histone H3, including H3K27ac and H3K14ac, which promotes transcriptional activation (Xian2023Mechanistic). It also interacts with lncRNA lncAKHE to enhance recognition of the NOTCH2 promoter region, promoting transcription and translation of the NOTCH2 gene (Xian2023Mechanistic). These interactions highlight YEATS4's role in various cellular processes, including spindle formation and chromatin remodeling.
