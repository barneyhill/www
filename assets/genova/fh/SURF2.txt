# SURF2

## Overview
The SURF2 gene encodes the surfeit 2 protein, which plays a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis by modulating the nucleolar stress response. Surfeit 2 is primarily located in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus, where it functions as a regulatory protein, particularly in the context of the p53 pathway. It acts as an antagonist to MDM2, a key negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53, by binding to free 5S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles. This interaction prevents MDM2 from binding to these particles, thereby influencing p53 activation and cell cycle progression. The regulatory activities of surfeit 2 are significant in the context of diseases such as ribosomopathies and certain cancers, where its expression levels can impact disease progression and patient prognosis (Tagnères2024SURF2).

## Structure


## Function
The SURF2 gene plays a critical role in regulating the nucleolar stress response in healthy human cells. It functions as an antagonist to MDM2, a primary negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein p53. SURF2 binds to free 5S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles, preventing their interaction with MDM2. This interaction is crucial because, under normal conditions, MDM2 ubiquitinates p53, promoting its degradation and preventing unnecessary cell cycle arrest (Tagnères2024SURF2).

During nucleolar stress, ribosome synthesis is impaired, leading to an accumulation of free 5S RNPs. In the absence of SURF2, these free 5S RNPs bind to MDM2, stabilizing p53 and causing cell cycle arrest. Conversely, overexpression of SURF2 allows it to compete with MDM2 for binding to free 5S RNPs, enabling MDM2 to ubiquitinate p53 and resist nucleolar stress (Tagnères2024SURF2).

SURF2 is primarily located in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus, where it acts as a buffer for free 5S RNP particles, maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating the p53 pathway and cell cycle progression (Tagnères2024SURF2). This regulatory function is significant in diseases like ribosomopathies and certain cancers (Tagnères2024SURF2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SURF2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. High levels of SURF2 expression are associated with poor overall survival in certain cancers, such as adrenocortical carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. This correlation is particularly noted in tumors with wild-type TP53, suggesting that SURF2 expression affects patient survival by modulating the p53 pathway (Tagnères2024SURF2). SURF2 acts as an antagonist to MDM2, preventing the interaction between MDM2 and free 5S RNPs, which would otherwise lead to p53 stabilization and cell cycle arrest. This mechanism is relevant in the context of ribosomopathies, such as Diamond-Blackfan Anemia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, where defects in ribosome production lead to increased free 5S RNPs and subsequent p53 activation (Tagnères2024SURF2).

In cancer cells, SURF2 overexpression impedes p53 activation and cell cycle arrest, which are typically induced by nucleolar stress. This suggests that cancer cells may exploit SURF2's buffering capacity to resist p53 activation, highlighting the potential of targeting SURF2 to enhance cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy (Tagnères2024SURF2). The study of SURF2's role in these processes suggests it could be a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in cancer treatment (Tagnères2024SURF2).

## Interactions
The SURF2 gene encodes a protein that interacts with several key proteins involved in the nucleolar stress response. SURF2 is identified as an antagonist of MDM2, a protein that regulates the tumor suppressor p53. SURF2 competes with MDM2 for binding to free 5S ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), which are composed of 5S rRNA and ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL11. This interaction prevents MDM2 from binding to these particles, thereby modulating p53 activation and influencing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Tagnères2024SURF2).

SURF2 directly interacts with RPL5 and RPL11, with a preference for RPL11, suggesting a competitive mechanism for binding to free 5S RNPs. This interaction is crucial for regulating the nucleolar stress response, as it affects the stabilization and activation of p53, a key factor in cellular stress responses and cancer progression (Tagnères2024SURF2).

In addition to its role in the nucleolar stress response, SURF2 is involved in the regulation of p53 activation independent of nucleolar stress, as its depletion promotes p53 activation and the expression of its target gene p21/CDKN1A (Tagnères2024SURF2).
