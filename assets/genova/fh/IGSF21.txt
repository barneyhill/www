# IGSF21

## Overview
IGSF21 is a gene that encodes the protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 21, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains and plays a pivotal role in the differentiation and organization of inhibitory synapses in the brain. The IGSF21 protein interacts specifically with neurexin2α (NRXN2α), a presynaptic organizer, to facilitate inhibitory presynaptic differentiation, a process crucial for maintaining normal GABA-mediated synaptic transmission (Tanabe2017IgSF21). Predominantly expressed in the brain, IGSF21 is involved in synaptic inhibition, with significant implications for normal brain function and potential links to neuropsychiatric disorders (Tanabe2017IgSF21).

## Structure
The IGSF21 protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains. It has two main isoforms: a longer isoform (IgSF21 L) with three immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig1-3) and a shorter isoform (IgSF21 S) with only Ig1 and Ig3 domains (Chofflet2024Structural). The Ig1 domain is crucial for binding to Neurexin2α (Nrxn2α) and is responsible for the synaptogenic activity of IgSF21 (Tanabe2017IgSF21). 

IgSF21 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, which means it is tethered to the cell membrane via a GPI-anchor, a common post-translational modification for proteins involved in cell signaling and adhesion (Tanabe2017IgSF21). The protein lacks a transmembrane domain, which is consistent with its GPI-anchored nature (Tanabe2017IgSF21).

The tertiary structure of the IgSF21-Nrxn2α complex has not been experimentally determined, but predictions using AlphaFold2 suggest that the Ig1 domain of IgSF21 interacts with the LNS1 domain of Nrxn2α, involving hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Chofflet2024Structural). The specific residues involved in this interaction have been identified through site-directed mutagenesis, highlighting the precise nature of the binding interface (Chofflet2024Structural).

## Function
IGSF21 is a protein-coding gene that plays a crucial role in the differentiation and organization of inhibitory synapses in the brain. It encodes a GPI-anchored membrane protein that interacts specifically with neurexin2α (NRX2α), a presynaptic organizer, to promote inhibitory presynaptic differentiation. This interaction is mediated through the Ig1 domain of IGSF21, which is essential for its synaptogenic activity (Tanabe2017IgSF21). IGSF21 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly during the peak period of synaptogenesis, and is found in regions such as the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and pons (Tanabe2017IgSF21).

In healthy cells, IGSF21 localizes postsynaptically and recruits axonal NRX2α in a trans-interaction manner, facilitating the differentiation of inhibitory synapses through trans-synaptic adhesion (Tanabe2017IgSF21). This process is crucial for maintaining normal GABA-mediated synaptic transmission, as evidenced by impaired synaptic organization and reduced GABA release in Igsf21 knockout mice (Tanabe2017IgSF21). The protein's activity is specific to inhibitory synapses, as it does not affect excitatory synapses (Tanabe2017IgSF21). IGSF21's role in synaptic inhibition is significant for normal brain function and may have implications in neuropsychiatric disorders (Tanabe2017IgSF21).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the IGSF21 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. IGSF21 is crucial for the organization of inhibitory synapses, and its disruption can lead to impaired synaptic transmission. In Igsf21 knockout mice, there is a notable reduction in inhibitory synaptic components, leading to sensorimotor gating deficits, a condition also observed in patients with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders (Tanabe2017IgSF21). The impaired organization of GABAergic synapses, particularly in the ventral hippocampus, is suggested to underlie these deficits (Tanabe2017IgSF21).

The interaction between IGSF21 and its binding partner, neurexin2α (NRX2α), is essential for maintaining synaptic balance. Alterations in NRX2α, encoded by the human NRXN2 gene, are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia, suggesting that disruptions in the IGSF21-NRX2α complex may contribute to these conditions (Tanabe2017IgSF21). The study proposes that sequencing the IGSF21 gene locus in patients with schizophrenia, ASD, and anxiety disorders could provide further insights into its role in these diseases (Tanabe2017IgSF21). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of IGSF21 in understanding and potentially treating neurological disorders linked to inhibitory synaptic dysfunction.

## Interactions
IGSF21 is known to interact specifically with Neurexin2α (NRXN2α), a presynaptic organizer protein. This interaction is crucial for the differentiation and organization of inhibitory synapses. IGSF21 acts as a high-affinity receptor for NRXN2α, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.7 nM, indicating a strong binding affinity (Tanabe2017IgSF21; Chofflet2024Structural). The binding is mediated by the Ig1 domain of IGSF21 and the LNS1 domain of NRXN2α, involving hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Tanabe2017IgSF21; Chofflet2024Structural).

Mutations at the binding interface of either IGSF21 or NRXN2α disrupt this interaction, highlighting the specificity and importance of the binding sites (Chofflet2024Structural). IGSF21 does not interact with other Neurexin isoforms such as Nrxn1α, Nrxn3α, or β-Nrxns, underscoring its selectivity for NRXN2α (Chofflet2024Structural).

The interaction between IGSF21 and NRXN2α is essential for the synaptogenic activity of IGSF21, which promotes the differentiation of inhibitory synapses by recruiting axonal NRXN2α in a trans-interaction manner (Tanabe2017IgSF21). This interaction is critical for maintaining inhibitory synaptic components and normal GABA-mediated synaptic transmission (Tanabe2017IgSF21). There is no evidence of IGSF21 interacting with nucleic acids (Tanabe2017IgSF21).
