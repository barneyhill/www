# PPP3CB

## Overview
The PPP3CB gene encodes the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, immune response, and neuronal signaling, by modulating the phosphorylation state of target proteins (Shibasaki2002Calcineurin). The protein phosphatase 3 catalytic subunit beta, produced by PPP3CB, is characterized by a conserved phosphatase domain and a unique proline-rich region that influences substrate specificity (Chen2015A). As a serine/threonine phosphatase, it is involved in critical physiological functions such as T-cell activation, vascular patterning, and cardiac development (Nolze2023Calcineurin). Additionally, PPP3CB has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and a contributor to drug resistance, depending on the context (Gazzeri2024PPP3CB; Qiu2024PPP3CB).

## Structure
The PPP3CB protein, encoded by the PPP3CB gene, is a catalytic subunit of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. The protein contains a conserved catalytic domain known as the phosphatase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Chen2015A). This domain is shared among calcineurin isoforms, but PPP3CB is distinguished by a unique proline-rich region in its N-terminus, spanning residues 11 to 21, which is absent in other isoforms like PPP3CA (Chen2015A). This proline-rich region is suggested to influence substrate specificity, contributing to the selective interaction with proteins such as ATOH8 (Chen2015A).

The protein also includes a CnB binding site, a calmodulin binding site, and an inhibitory domain, which are typical features of calcineurin's regulatory region (Chen2015A). In terms of quaternary structure, PPP3CB forms a heterodimer with a regulatory subunit, calcineurin B, which is essential for its function as a phosphatase (Nolze2021Calcineurin). Common post-translational modifications of PPP3CB include phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may regulate its activity and stability. The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in various cellular processes, including T-cell activation and calcium signaling pathways.

## Function
PPP3CB encodes the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by modulating the phosphorylation state of proteins, which is a key mechanism in signal transduction (Shibasaki2002Calcineurin). In the immune system, calcineurin is essential for T-cell activation, where it dephosphorylates the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), enabling its nuclear translocation and subsequent gene transcription (Shibasaki2002Calcineurin).

In the cardiovascular system, PPP3CB is involved in vascular patterning, myocardial development, and heart valve morphogenesis. It influences vessel outgrowth and is necessary for proper vascular system patterning, mediated by VEGF-A expression (Nolze2023Calcineurin). In the context of cardiac health, reduced activity of PPP3CB results in a decreased hypertrophic response of the heart under stress conditions, but its loss increases sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion injury, suggesting a protective role in maintaining myocyte viability (Nolze2023Calcineurin).

PPP3CB also plays a role in neuronal signaling, where it is involved in dephosphorylating DARPP-32 in striatal neurons, affecting neuronal excitability, and regulating neurotransmitter release in hippocampal neurons (Shibasaki2002Calcineurin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the PPP3CB gene have been implicated in various cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), overexpression of PPP3CB, particularly its Ex16 splice variant, is associated with resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This resistance is mediated through the activation of the calcineurin/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which reduces apoptosis in response to EGFR TKIs (Gazzeri2024PPP3CB). In bladder cancer, PPP3CB acts as a negative regulator of glucose metabolism, and its downregulation leads to increased glycolysis and tumor growth, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Qiu2024PPP3CB).

In neuroblastoma, a gain-of-function mutation in PPP3CB is linked to poor prognosis. This mutation results in a constitutively active protein that enhances cell proliferation by activating NFAT signaling pathways (Shakhova2018PPP3CB). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, low PPP3CB expression correlates with poor prognosis, and its overexpression impairs cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Hang2024PPP3CB). These findings highlight the diverse roles of PPP3CB in cancer progression and resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
PPP3CB, the beta isoform of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, engages in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It specifically interacts with the transcription factor ATOH8, a basic helix-loop-helix protein involved in various developmental processes. This interaction is mediated by the unique proline-rich region in the N-terminus of PPP3CB, which influences substrate selectivity and is crucial for the nuclear localization of ATOH8 (Chen2015A).

PPP3CB also forms a complex with Smurf1 and Galectin-3 (Gal3), where Gal3 is necessary for recruiting PPP3CB to interact with Smurf1. This interaction is dependent on the N-terminal domain of PPP3CB and the carbohydrate recognition domain of Gal3. The complex is involved in the regulation of TFEB, a transcription factor important for lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, by promoting its nuclear translocation (Dong2022Smurf1).

In the context of bladder cancer, PPP3CB interacts with pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1), leading to its destabilization and degradation. This interaction inhibits glycolysis and cell proliferation, suggesting a role for PPP3CB in regulating cancer metabolism (Qiu2024PPP3CB).
