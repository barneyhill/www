# BRCA1

## Overview
BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1) is a gene located on chromosome 17q21, which encodes a protein known as BRCA1 DNA repair associated. This protein is a crucial component of the cellular machinery responsible for maintaining genomic stability, primarily through its role in DNA repair processes. As a tumor suppressor, BRCA1 is involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks via homologous recombination, a high-fidelity repair mechanism. The BRCA1 protein is characterized by several functional domains, including a RING domain with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and tandem BRCT domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. Mutations in the BRCA1 gene are strongly associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers, underscoring its critical role in tumor suppression (Nelson2005Genetic; Takaoka2017BRCA1).

## Structure
The BRCA1 protein is composed of 1863 amino acids and features several distinct domains that contribute to its function in DNA repair and tumor suppression. At the N-terminus, the protein contains a RING domain, which is a cysteine-rich, zinc-binding motif crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This domain facilitates the formation of a heterodimer with the BRCA1-associated RING domain protein (BARD1), enhancing its ubiquitin ligase function (Savage2014BRCA1; Takaoka2017BRCA1).

The C-terminal region of BRCA1 contains tandem BRCT domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are essential for recognizing phosphorylated peptides with a phospho-SXXF motif. These domains are critical for the transcriptional activation function of BRCA1 and are involved in DNA repair processes (Huyton2000The).

The central region of BRCA1, largely encoded by exon 11, is predicted to be intrinsically disordered, lacking a stable 3-D structure. This region interacts with various proteins involved in DNA repair, such as RAD50 and RAD51, and is characterized by a high net charge and low hydrophobicity, typical of natively unfolded proteins (Savage2014BRCA1; Yadav2015Functional).

BRCA1 also contains nuclear localization signals and a nuclear export signal, facilitating its transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Savage2014BRCA1). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulate its interactions and functions in DNA repair pathways (Huyton2000The).

## Function
The BRCA1 gene plays a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity through its involvement in DNA repair processes, particularly in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) via homologous recombination. BRCA1 interacts with proteins such as RAD51 to facilitate accurate DNA repair, preventing genomic instability (Moynahan1999Brca1). It is also involved in the DNA damage response, acting as a scaffold for the phosphorylation of p53 by ATM, which leads to cell cycle arrest and repair (Wu2010The). BRCA1 regulates cell cycle checkpoints, including the G1/S, S-phase, and G2/M checkpoints, ensuring that damaged DNA is not replicated or passed on to daughter cells (Wu2010The; Rosen2003BRCA1).

BRCA1 is active primarily in the nucleus, where it participates in transcriptional regulation by interacting with various transcription factors and coactivators. It influences the expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, such as p21 and Gadd45 (Rosen2003BRCA1). The protein also plays a role in transcription-coupled repair and interacts with DNA mismatch repair proteins, contributing to its function in maintaining genomic stability (Rosen2003BRCA1). Through these activities, BRCA1 acts as a tumor suppressor, crucial for preventing mutations that could lead to cancer.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BRCA1 gene are significantly associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. These mutations impair the gene's role as a tumor suppressor, leading to genomic instability and a predisposition to cancer development (Takaoka2017BRCA1). Women carrying BRCA1 mutations have a lifetime breast cancer risk of 60% to 85% and an ovarian cancer risk of 26% (Nelson2005Genetic). The prevalence of BRCA1 mutations varies across populations, with higher frequencies observed in certain ethnic groups, such as Ashkenazi Jews (Nelson2005Genetic).

BRCA1 mutations can lead to different cancer risks depending on the mutation's location within the gene. For instance, mutations affecting the RING domain can disrupt interactions with the BARD1 protein, impairing E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and increasing cancer risk (Takaoka2017BRCA1). Specific regions within the BRCA1 gene, known as breast cancer cluster regions (BCCRs) and an ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR), are associated with varying risks of breast and ovarian cancer (Takaoka2017BRCA1).

In addition to breast and ovarian cancers, BRCA1 mutations are linked to increased risks of other cancers, including prostate cancer (Nelson2005Genetic). Genetic testing and counseling are recommended for individuals with a strong family history of these cancers to guide preventive measures and management strategies (Nelson2005Genetic).

## Interactions
BRCA1 is involved in numerous physical interactions with various proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining genome integrity and tumor suppression. It interacts with tumor suppressors such as p53, RB, BRCA2, and ATM, and oncogenes like c-Myc and E2F. BRCA1 also associates with DNA damage repair proteins, including RAD50 and RAD51, and cell-cycle regulators such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Deng2000Roles).

The interaction between BRCA1 and p53 is significant, with BRCA1 acting as a coactivator of p53-dependent transcription, enhancing the transcription of genes like p21 and bax, which are involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Chai1999The; Zhang1998BRCA1). The BRCT domain of BRCA1 is sufficient for binding to p53 and stimulating its target gene activation (Chai1999The).

BRCA1 also interacts with the Ku80 protein, particularly in the context of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of chromosomal double-strand breaks during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This interaction enhances the fidelity of NHEJ repair (Jiang2013BRCA1Ku80).

In addition, BRCA1 forms complexes with the Rad51 protein in both mitotic and meiotic cells, suggesting a role in DNA repair and recombination processes (Scully1997Association). These interactions highlight BRCA1's involvement in transcription, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation through multiple protein complexes.
