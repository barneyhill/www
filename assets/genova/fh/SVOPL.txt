# SVOPL

## Overview
SVOPL is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the solute carrier family, specifically characterized by its structural similarity to synaptic vesicle proteins. The protein encoded by SVOPL, often referred to as SVOP like, is a transmembrane protein predicted to have 12 transmembrane regions, which is a common feature among solute carrier family members. This structural configuration suggests a role in transport across cellular membranes. Although the precise biological function of the SVOPL protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to be involved in synaptic vesicle processes, potentially influencing neuronal development and synaptic function. The protein's structural resemblance to synaptic vesicle proteins SVOP and SV2A-C implies a possible role in vesicular transport and neurotransmitter release, which are critical for synaptic transmission and neuronal communication (Jacobsson2007Identification).

## Structure
SVOPL is a protein encoded by the SVOPL gene, characterized by its structural similarity to the solute carrier family 22 (SLC22). The protein consists of 491 amino acids and is composed of 13 exons (Jacobsson2007Identification). It shares 39% amino acid identity with SVOP and 29% with SLC22A15, indicating a degree of structural resemblance within the SLC22 family (Jacobsson2007Identification).

SVOPL is predicted to have 12 transmembrane (TM) regions, a common feature among members of the SLC22 family, which suggests a role in transport across cellular membranes (Jacobsson2007Identification). The protein also contains conserved domains and motifs, such as the sugar transporter domain, which are characteristic of the SLC22 family (Jacobsson2007Identification). 

The SVOPL sequence was initially annotated without the last three coding exons, which include the final amino acids in TM12 and the entire C terminus, but these were later supported by mRNA and EST data (Jacobsson2007Identification). The presence of alternative splicing is suggested by the identification of an alternative C terminus in one of the mRNA sequences, although no ESTs support this variant (Jacobsson2007Identification).

## Function
SVOPL (SVOP like) is a gene that encodes a protein structurally similar to synaptic vesicle protein SVOP, suggesting a potential role in synaptic vesicle processes. Although the specific function of SVOPL in healthy human cells has not been fully elucidated, it is thought to be involved in neuronal development and synaptic function. SVOPL is grouped with synaptic vesicle proteins SVOP and SV2A-C, which are known to participate in vesicular transport and neurotransmitter release, indicating that SVOPL may share similar roles in synaptic function and neuronal communication (Jacobsson2007Identification).

The protein is believed to be active in synaptic vesicles within neurons, contributing to the transport processes essential for synaptic transmission. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that SVOPL, like its paralog SVOP, may have a specialized function in the brain, potentially influencing synaptic activity and neuronal signaling (Jacobsson2007Identification). Despite its structural similarity to the SLC22 family, which is involved in the transport of organic cations and anions, the specific substrate specificity and transport mechanisms of SVOPL remain to be determined (Jacobsson2007Identification). Further research is needed to clarify the precise molecular activities and cellular roles of SVOPL.

## Clinical Significance
SVOPL has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) through its involvement in allelic switching and expression changes during tumorigenesis. In CRC, SVOPL exhibits allelic switching, where the most expressed allele in normal tissue becomes the least expressed in tumors, and vice versa. This switching is associated with a significant downregulation of SVOPL expression in tumor samples, with a median 8-fold decrease compared to normal tissue. This downregulation occurs regardless of allelic switching or changes in allele-specific expression status, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism during cancer development (Boot2019Allelic).

In the context of neurological disorders, SVOPL has been identified as a potential candidate gene for Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have shown that SVOPL may play a role in mitochondrial dynamics and quality control, which are crucial in PD pathogenesis. Functional assays have demonstrated SVOPL's involvement in mitochondrial morphology and Parkin translocation, indicating its potential contribution to PD susceptibility. Loss of function in SVOPL homologs may enhance α-synuclein-induced retinal degeneration, suggesting a link between SVOPL dysfunction and neurodegenerative processes (Jansen2017Discovery).
