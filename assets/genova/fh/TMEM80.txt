# TMEM80

## Overview
TMEM80 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 80, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. TMEM80 has been studied in the context of several diseases, including alcohol use disorder (AUD) and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome. Research indicates that TMEM80 may play a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions through its altered expression and genetic polymorphisms, which can have sex-specific influences on gene expression (Lindén2017Sex; Friske2024A; Lu2021Detection). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and mechanisms of TMEM80 remain an active area of investigation.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM80 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression and potential genetic associations. In the context of alcohol use disorder (AUD), TMEM80 is identified as one of the genes with a convergent transcriptomic signature in the prefrontal cortex across humans, rodents, and monkeys. Its dysregulation is noted in AUD patients and alcohol-dependent animals, although its precise function and relevance in health and disease remain unclear (Friske2024A). The study suggests that while single gene findings like TMEM80 are significant, focusing on dysregulated pathways and physiological processes may offer more promising intervention strategies for AUD (Friske2024A).

In autoimmune diseases, TMEM80 has been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A study identified TMEM80 as one of the genes newly associated with SLE, suggesting it may be a candidate gene for the disease (Lu2021Detection). Additionally, genetic polymorphisms affecting TMEM80 expression have been linked to SLE and primary Sjögren's syndrome, with sex-specific influences on gene expression noted (Lindén2017Sex). These findings highlight the potential role of TMEM80 in the pathogenesis of these autoimmune conditions.
