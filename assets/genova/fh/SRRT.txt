# SRRT

## Overview
The SRRT gene encodes the serrate RNA effector molecule, a protein that plays a pivotal role in RNA processing and gene regulation. This protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein due to its involvement in the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) and its essential function in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and gene silencing. The SRRT gene is located on chromosome 7 (q22.1) in humans and is expressed across a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, with the exception of budding yeast. The serrate RNA effector molecule is integral to various cellular processes, including stem-cell renewal, proliferation, and hematopoiesis, and is particularly significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its interactions with other proteins, such as FLASH and NCBP3, highlight its role as a key adaptor in RNA metabolism. Furthermore, SRRT has been implicated in cancer-related pathways, with its expression levels associated with oncogenic mutations and poor prognosis in certain cancers (Schulze2018Structural; Gamallat2023Serrate).

## Structure
The SRRT protein, also known as the serrate RNA effector molecule, is involved in RNA processing and has a complex molecular structure. The human ARS2 protein, which is related to SRRT, has been structurally analyzed to reveal a unique architecture. It features a helical 'body' composed of five parallel α-helices and distinct N- and C-terminal 'legs' (Schulze2018Structural). The C-terminal leg ends in a 'foot'-like structure with a three-stranded β-sheet, and the protein includes a metazoan-specific RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain that is crucial for RNA binding (Schulze2018Structural).

The structure of ARS2, which is homologous to SRRT, includes a folded core corresponding to residues 147-270 and 408-763, with a large unstructured region in between (Schulze2018Structural). This unstructured region suggests that SRRT may be an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), which is consistent with its degradation via the ubiquitin-independent 20S proteasome pathway (Li2020Degradation). The RRM domain is essential for RNA binding, while a basic patch in the C-terminal leg mediates interaction with other proteins like FLASH (Schulze2018Structural). The protein's structure is relatively inflexible, indicating that its function in forming complexes is more about overlapping binding sites than conformational changes (Schulze2018Structural).

## Function
The SRRT gene, also known as the serrate RNA effector molecule homolog, is located on chromosome 7 (q22.1) in humans and is widely expressed throughout eukaryotes, excluding budding yeast (Gamallat2023Serrate). SRRT plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, including stem-cell renewal, proliferation, hematopoiesis, and RNA-mediated gene silencing. It is a key component of the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), which allows it to modulate the expression of various microRNAs (miRNAs) (Gamallat2023Serrate). In healthy human cells, SRRT is essential for regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in miRNA biogenesis and gene silencing (Gamallat2023Serrate).

SRRT is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to RNA stability and processing, influencing cellular growth and differentiation. It is involved in the biogenesis of miR-21, a microRNA implicated in various cellular functions, including those related to cancer (Gamallat2023Serrate). The gene's involvement in stem-cell renewal and proliferation underscores its importance in normal cellular function and development (Gamallat2023Serrate).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The SRRT gene encodes the serrate RNA effector molecule, which is involved in various protein interactions critical for RNA processing. SRRT interacts with the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC), forming a ternary complex with NCBP3, a putative cap-binding protein involved in mRNA export. This interaction is mutually exclusive with the CBC-ARS-PHAX complex, which is involved in snRNA export (Schulze2018Structural). SRRT also interacts with FLASH, a protein involved in histone mRNA biogenesis, with FLASH and NCBP3 having overlapping binding sites on SRRT (Schulze2018Structural).

In the context of cancer, SRRT expression is associated with various oncogenic driver mutations and genomic aberrations, such as PTEN loss and TP53 mutations, which are linked to poor prognosis in prostate cancer (Gamallat2023Serrate). Although these studies focus on expression levels rather than direct physical interactions, they highlight the potential regulatory role of SRRT in cancer progression (Gamallat2023Serrate).

Overall, SRRT's interactions with CBC, NCBP3, and FLASH underscore its role as a key adaptor protein in RNA metabolism and its potential involvement in cancer-related pathways.
