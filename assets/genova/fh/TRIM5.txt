# TRIM5

## Overview
The TRIM5 gene encodes the tripartite motif-containing protein 5 (TRIM5α), a member of the TRIM protein family, which is characterized by its tripartite motif comprising a RING finger domain, a B-box type 2 domain, and a coiled-coil region. TRIM5α is primarily recognized for its role as a cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor with significant antiviral activity, particularly against retroviruses such as HIV-1. The protein functions by recognizing and binding to retroviral capsids, leading to their destabilization and degradation, thereby restricting viral replication (Sanchez2014The; Cloherty2021Human). Beyond its antiviral properties, TRIM5α is involved in cellular processes such as mitophagy and the innate immune response, highlighting its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune defense (Cloherty2021Human; Saha2021Interactomic). Variations in the TRIM5 gene can influence susceptibility to retroviral infections and disease progression, underscoring its clinical significance in the context of infectious diseases (Deng2015TRIM5α; Cagliani2010Longterm).

## Structure
TRIM5 is a protein encoded by the TRIM5 gene, characterized by its tripartite motif, which includes a RING finger domain, a B-box type 2 domain, and a coiled-coil region. The RING domain is involved in E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which are crucial for its antiviral function (Keown2016Characterisation). The coiled-coil domain forms an elongated antiparallel dimer, essential for dimerization and higher-order assembly into a hexagonal lattice that matches the symmetry of retroviral capsid surfaces (Skorupka2019Hierarchical; Sanchez2014The).

The C-terminal B30.2/SPRY domain is critical for recognizing and binding to retroviral capsids, such as those of HIV-1. This domain interacts with the capsid proteins through a multivalent binding mechanism, enhancing the protein's avidity for capsid binding (Roganowicz2017TRIM5α; Biris2012Structure). The SPRY domain is positioned at the center of the hexagon edges in the lattice structure, acting as a bivalent unit engaging two binding epitopes (Skorupka2019Hierarchical).

Mutations in the SPRY/coiled-coil interface can impair capsid binding and restriction activity, highlighting the importance of these interactions in TRIM5's function (Roganowicz2017TRIM5α). The protein's structure allows it to function as a cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor, intercepting retroviral capsids and restricting viral replication (Sanchez2014The).

## Function
The TRIM5 gene encodes the TRIM5α protein, which plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune defense in healthy human cells. TRIM5α is traditionally recognized for its antiviral activity, particularly in restricting retroviral infections such as HIV-1 by recognizing and destabilizing viral capsids, leading to their degradation via the proteasome system (Cloherty2021Human). Beyond its antiviral functions, TRIM5α is involved in mitophagy, a process crucial for mitochondrial quality control. It interacts with mitochondrial proteins and recruits autophagy proteins to damaged mitochondria, facilitating their degradation and maintaining mitochondrial health (Saha2021Interactomic). TRIM5α operates in both Parkin-dependent and independent mitophagy pathways, indicating its role as an upstream factor in this process (Saha2021Interactomic).

TRIM5α also acts as an innate immune sensor, recognizing retroviral capsids and activating signaling pathways that lead to the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Cloherty2021Human). It is involved in restricting LINE-1 retroelements, thereby protecting genomic integrity by interacting with LINE-1 ribonucleoprotein complexes and triggering innate immune responses (Volkmann2020Human). These functions highlight TRIM5α's importance in both cellular homeostasis and immune defense.

## Clinical Significance
The TRIM5 gene plays a significant role in the innate immune response against retroviral infections, including HIV-1. Variations in this gene can influence susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and disease progression. The H43Y polymorphism in TRIM5α has been associated with a decreased risk of HIV-1 infection, particularly in Asian populations, although its restriction activity against HIV-1 is reduced in vitro (Nakayama2012Role; Deng2015TRIM5α). The R136Q variant has shown a protective effect against HIV-1 after the emergence of CXCR4-using variants, suggesting it may influence disease progression (van2008The). 

Other polymorphisms, such as G249D and H419Y, have been linked to slower disease progression, though these associations are not statistically significant (Goldschmidt2006Role). The TRIM5α rs904375 AG genotype is more frequent in HIV patients, indicating a potential role in disease susceptibility (Singh2018Impact). Additionally, high levels of TRIM5 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been associated with a reduced risk of HIV-1 infection, suggesting that expression variability may modulate susceptibility to viral infections (Cagliani2010Longterm).

## Interactions
TRIM5α, a member of the TRIM protein family, is known for its interactions with various proteins and its role in restricting retroviral infections. It interacts with components of the proteasome, a multiprotein complex, specifically with proteasomal subunits such as PSMC2, RPT3, RPT6, and RPN8. These interactions were identified through yeast two-hybrid screens and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays and fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating the co-localization of proteasomes and TRIM5α in cytoplasmic bodies (Lukic2011TRIM5α).

TRIM5α forms assemblies around HIV-1 virions, leading to the recruitment of proteasomal subunits, which are crucial for the restriction process. The exact mechanism of proteasome involvement in restriction is not fully understood, but it may involve direct degradation of viral components or TRIM5α itself, leading to viral core disassembly (Lukic2011TRIM5α).

TRIM5α also interacts with ubiquitin, and its RING domain, which has E3-ubiquitin ligase activity, is crucial for its restriction function. This domain promotes polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of viral capsids, a process that can occur via the proteasome or autophagy pathways (Lukic2011TRIM5α; Cloherty2021Human).
