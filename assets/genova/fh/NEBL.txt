# NEBL

## Overview
The NEBL gene encodes the protein nebulette, which is predominantly expressed in cardiac muscle tissue. Nebulette is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcomere, particularly at the Z-line, by stabilizing thin filaments and facilitating protein-protein interactions. Structurally, nebulette is characterized by a modular domain architecture, including an acidic N-terminal domain, a repeat domain with nebulin-like modules, a serine-rich linker region, and a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. These domains enable nebulette to interact with various proteins such as actin, α-actinin, and desmin, contributing to the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the maintenance of cardiac muscle cell structure. Mutations in the NEBL gene have been implicated in several cardiomyopathies, including dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting the protein's significance in cardiac function and disease (Hernandez2016Nebulette; Perrot2016Mutations; Bang2015Roles).

## Structure
Nebulette (NEBL) is a protein primarily expressed in cardiac muscle, characterized by a modular domain architecture similar to that of nebulin. It consists of four main domains: an acidic N-terminal domain, a repeat domain, a linker domain, and a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (Millevoi1998Characterization; Moncman1999Functional). The repeat domain contains 22 to 23 nebulin-like modules, each approximately 35 residues long, marked by the SD/EXXYK consensus motif (Millevoi1998Characterization; Moncman1999Functional). Unlike nebulin, these modules do not form super-repeats, which suggests that nebulette may not function as a molecular ruler for thin filament length (Millevoi1998Characterization).

The SH3 domain at the C-terminus is highly conserved, sharing 85% sequence identity with nebulin's SH3 domain, indicating a role in Z-disc regulation (Millevoi1998Characterization). Nebulette is predominantly phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues, with conserved phosphorylation sites for kinase A, protein kinase C, and tyrosine kinase, which may influence its biochemical functions (Moncman2000ArchitectureofthethinfilamentZlinejunction:lessonsfromnebuletteandnebulinhomologies). The protein's structure and interactions are further modulated by alternative splicing, resulting in polymorphic forms that differ between adult and fetal cardiac tissues (Moncman1999Functional).

## Function
Nebulette, encoded by the NEBL gene, is a protein specifically expressed in cardiac muscle, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcomere, particularly at the Z-line. It is structurally similar to the C-terminal region of nebulin, a protein found in skeletal muscle, and contains 23 nebulin repeats, a serine-rich linker region, and an SH3 domain (Millevoi1998Characterization; Bang2015Roles). Nebulette is involved in stabilizing thin filaments and is localized at the Z-line, where it helps maintain Z-line alignment and integrity, potentially influencing thin filament length and actomyosin interactions (Bang2015Roles).

The SH3 domain of nebulette binds to proline-rich regions within proteins such as myopalladin and palladin, which are associated with α-actinin in the Z-line, suggesting a role in protein-protein interactions crucial for sarcomere function (Bang2015Roles). Nebulette also binds to the actin cross-linking protein filamin C and contains phosphorylation sites in its serine-rich linker region, indicating its involvement in actin cytoskeleton regulation (Bang2015Roles). Mutations in the NEBL gene have been linked to dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its importance in cardiac function (Bang2015Roles).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEBL gene, which encodes the cardiac-specific protein nebulette, are associated with various cardiomyopathies. These include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) (Perrot2016Mutations). At least 20 distinct mutations in nebulette have been linked to these conditions, with some mutations located in nebulin-like repeats responsible for actin binding, and others in the C-terminal serine-rich linker region (Hernandez2016Nebulette; Perrot2016Mutations).

Specific mutations such as Q128R and A592E have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and endocardial fibroelastosis, conditions characterized by low desmin targeting and myofibril disorganization (Hernandez2016Nebulette). The Q128R mutation, for instance, has been shown to disrupt the localization of nebulette and decrease desmin Z-line localization, indicating its critical role in maintaining muscle structure (Hernandez2016Nebulette).

The NEBL mutations are rare and often found in highly conserved regions, suggesting a pathogenic role. These mutations can lead to changes in the I-band and Z-disk composition, affecting cardiac function and potentially leading to heart failure and arrhythmias (Perrot2016Mutations).

## Interactions
Nebulette (NEBL) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cardiac muscle cells. It binds to actin, α-actinin, and tropomyosin, with the SH3 and repeat domains showing the strongest affinity for actin (Moncman1999Functional). The interaction with α-actinin is isoform-specific, as nebulette binds sarcomeric α-actinin but not smooth muscle α-actinin (Moncman1999Functional). Nebulette also interacts with desmin, forming high-molecular-weight complexes, which suggests multiple binding sites on both proteins. This interaction is primarily mediated through the α-helical rod domain of desmin (Hernandez2016Nebulette).

Nebulette's SH3 domain interacts with XIRP2, a member of the xin-repeat protein family, with a dissociation constant of 12.9 μM, indicating a specific binding mode (Eulitz2013Identification). This interaction is involved in myofibril formation and remodeling, particularly in association with Xin proteins (Eulitz2013Identification). The nebulette-desmin interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of cardiac muscle cells, as disruptions can lead to myofibrillar disorganization and disease (Hernandez2016Nebulette). These interactions highlight nebulette's role as a cytolinker, organizing actin and desmin filaments in the heart.
