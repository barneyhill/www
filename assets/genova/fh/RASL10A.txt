# RASL10A

## Overview
RASL10A is a gene that encodes the protein RAS like family 10 member A, which is part of the RAS superfamily of small GTPases. These proteins are involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. RAS like family 10 member A is implicated in intracellular signaling pathways and may play a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and survival. The gene's expression and the protein's function have been studied in the context of cancer biology, where alterations in RAS signaling pathways are often observed (Qiu2020aarFDC).
