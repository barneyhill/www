# ANXA1

## Overview
ANXA1 is a gene that encodes the protein annexin A1, a member of the annexin family known for its calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties. Annexin A1 is primarily involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and immune system modulation. It functions as an anti-inflammatory mediator by inhibiting phospholipase A2, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory molecules. The protein is also implicated in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation, and plays a role in tissue repair and regeneration. Annexin A1 interacts with formyl peptide receptors, influencing cell motility and migration, and is involved in the resolution of inflammation by promoting the clearance of apoptotic cells. Its expression and activity are regulated through post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which affect its localization and function. ANXA1 has clinical significance in cancer biology, where its expression levels are associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Han2020Annexin; Guo2013Potential; Bizzarro2012Annexin).

## Structure
Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is a protein characterized by its ability to bind phospholipids in a calcium-dependent manner. The primary structure of ANXA1 includes a core domain with four annexin repeats, each consisting of approximately 70 amino acids, which are responsible for its calcium and phospholipid binding properties (Bizzarro2012Annexin; Lim2007Annexin). The secondary structure of ANXA1 is predominantly composed of alpha-helices, contributing to its stability and function.

The tertiary structure of ANXA1 forms a compact, globular shape, which is typical of annexin proteins. This structure facilitates its interaction with cellular membranes and other proteins. ANXA1 can also form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, which may be important for its biological activity.

ANXA1 undergoes several post-translational modifications, with phosphorylation being the most significant. Phosphorylation occurs on various residues, including tyrosine and serine, and is crucial for regulating its localization, binding properties, and functions (D’Acunto2014The). These modifications influence ANXA1's role in processes such as apoptosis, inflammation, and membrane repair (Bizzarro2012Annexin). The N-terminal region of ANXA1 is unique among annexins and contains sites for phosphorylation and proteolysis, which are essential for its regulatory functions (Lim2007Annexin).

## Function
Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating inflammation and immune responses in healthy human cells. It acts as an anti-inflammatory mediator by inhibiting the activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), thereby preventing the formation of arachidonic acid, a precursor of inflammatory mediators (Han2020Annexin). ANXA1 is involved in the resolution of inflammation by promoting the phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages, which aids in clearing inflammation and promoting tissue repair (Sugimoto2017Plasmin).

ANXA1 is active in both the cytoplasm and cell membrane, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. It modulates T-cell activation and differentiation by enhancing T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, which affects transcription factors such as NF-kB, NFAT, and AP-1, leading to increased T-cell proliferation and cytokine production (D’Acquisto2006Annexin1). ANXA1 also plays a role in skeletal muscle biology by promoting myoblast differentiation and satellite cell migration, which are essential for muscle regeneration (Bizzarro2012Annexin).

The protein's functions are mediated through its interaction with formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), particularly FPRL-1/ALX, which are involved in cell motility and migration (Hayhoe2006Annexin). ANXA1's ability to bind to cellular membranes in a calcium-dependent manner is crucial for its role in cellular signaling and inflammation regulation (Han2020Annexin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in ANXA1 expression are implicated in various cancers, influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. In pancreatic cancer, high ANXA1 expression is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increased cell proliferation, and poor survival outcomes. It is linked to mutations in key genes like TP53 and pathways such as TGF-β signaling, contributing to cancer progression and drug sensitivity variations (Oshi2021Annexin). In gliomas, elevated ANXA1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with immune checkpoint markers, affecting the tumor microenvironment and promoting cell migration and invasion (Lin2021ANXA1; Qian2021Molecular).

In breast cancer, ANXA1 is upregulated in metastatic cell lines, enhancing metastasis through TGF-β/Smad signaling and contributing to drug resistance (Guo2013Potential). Conversely, in prostate and esophageal cancers, ANXA1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation linked to cancer progression and poor differentiation (Guo2013Potential). ANXA1's role in drug resistance is also noted in endometrial and lung cancers, where its expression affects treatment efficacy (Guo2013Potential). These findings highlight ANXA1's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
Annexin A1 (ANXA1) is known to interact with various proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. In chronic myeloid leukemia KCL22 cells, ANXA1 interacts with proteins such as Shp1 and Shp2, which are phosphatases linked to imatinib sensitivity (Colavita2013Identification). ANXA1 also interacts with protein kinase C (PKC), where its phosphorylation by PKC affects its calcium requirements for chromaffin granule aggregation (Hoque2014Annexins). 

In the context of mammary tumorigenesis, ANXA1 interacts with proteins involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, such as Vimentin (VIM) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which are crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Swa2014Mass). ANXA1 is also associated with the actin cytoskeleton, interacting with profilin to influence actin polymerization, and is involved in cell migration processes (Bizzarro2012Annexin).

ANXA1's interactions extend to its role in membrane repair, where it associates with dysferlin in skeletal muscle cells, facilitating membrane fusion and repair (Bizzarro2012Annexin). Additionally, ANXA1 interacts with formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), mediating anti-inflammatory responses and influencing cell motility (Bizzarro2012Annexin).
