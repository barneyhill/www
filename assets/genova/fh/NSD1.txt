# NSD1

## Overview
The NSD1 gene encodes the nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1, a multifunctional nuclear protein that plays a critical role in chromatin modification and gene regulation. This protein is categorized as a histone methyltransferase due to its involvement in the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36) and histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20), which are key processes in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Qiao2011The; Pasillas2011NSD1). NSD1 contains several conserved domains, including the SET domain, which is essential for its catalytic activity, and multiple plant homeodomains (PHD) that facilitate interactions with methylated histones (Berardi2016Structural). The protein functions as both a coactivator and corepressor, modulating nuclear receptor activity in a ligand-dependent manner, and is implicated in various cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and development (Huang1998Two; Kurotaki2001Molecular). Mutations in NSD1 are associated with Sotos syndrome and other overgrowth conditions, highlighting its significance in human development and disease (TattonBrown2005GenotypePhenotype; Choufani2015NSD1).

## Structure
The NSD1 protein is a large multi-domain nuclear protein involved in chromatin modification and gene regulation. It contains several conserved domains, including two proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline (PWWP) domains, five plant homeodomains (PHD), a PHD finger-like Cys-His rich domain (C5HCH), and a catalytic SET domain (Berardi2016Structural). The SET domain is central to NSD1's function, involved in histone methylation, specifically dimethylating nucleosomal histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) (Qiao2011The). The SET domain is composed of three β-sheets and an exposed helix, forming a compact structure with the AWS and post-SET motifs (Qiao2011The).

The PHD domains of NSD1 are involved in binding methylated histones, such as histone H3 methylated at Lys4 and Lys9, and are crucial for NSD1-dependent transcriptional regulation (Berardi2016Structural; Pasillas2011NSD1). The PHD V C5HCH tandem domain forms a unique structural entity, characterized by a classical PHD finger fold and a C-terminal 3-10 α-helix linking to the C5HCH domain (Berardi2016Structural). This tandem domain interacts with the C2HR domain of the transcriptional repressor Nizp1, a process impaired by pathological mutations associated with Sotos syndrome (Berardi2016Structural).

NSD1 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different transcript variants, which may affect its function and interactions (Kurotaki2001Molecular). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by post-translational modifications, such as methylation, which are critical for its role in gene regulation (Qiao2011The).

## Function
The NSD1 gene encodes a nuclear protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. It contains several conserved domains, including the SET domain, which is crucial for histone methylation, specifically methylating histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36) and histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20). These modifications are associated with transcriptional activation and repression, chromatin condensation, and DNA-damage checkpoint signaling (Pasillas2011NSD1).

NSD1 acts as a bifunctional transcriptional intermediary factor, serving as both a corepressor and a coactivator by interacting with nuclear receptors through its distinct nuclear receptor interaction domains (NID-L and NID+L). These interactions are ligand-dependent, allowing NSD1 to modulate nuclear receptor activity and transcriptional regulation in response to ligands such as steroids and thyroid hormones (Huang1998Two).

The protein is localized in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in mediating interactions between general transcription factors and transcription regulatory factors, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and development (Huang1998Two; Kurotaki2001Molecular). NSD1's involvement in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular and developmental processes (Pasillas2011NSD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NSD1 gene are primarily associated with Sotos syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth, advanced bone age, distinctive facial features, and developmental delays (TattonBrown2005GenotypePhenotype; Choufani2015NSD1). Approximately 80-90% of individuals with Sotos syndrome have identifiable NSD1 mutations, which include intragenic mutations and 5q35 microdeletions (TattonBrown2005GenotypePhenotype; Bae2012Clinical). These mutations often result in haploinsufficiency, leading to the clinical manifestations of the syndrome (Testa2023Molecular).

NSD1 mutations have also been implicated in other overgrowth conditions, such as Weaver syndrome, although they are not a frequent finding in these phenotypes (Türkmen2003Mutations). The gene's role in chromatin regulation and transcriptional processes suggests that its disruption can have widespread effects on development and growth (Testa2023Molecular).

Alterations in NSD1 expression or function are linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, including neuroblastoma and glioma. In these cancers, NSD1 is often epigenetically inactivated, leading to poor outcomes (Berdasco2009Epigenetic). The gene's tumor-suppressor function is highlighted by its ability to reduce cellular growth when reintroduced into cancer cells (Berdasco2009Epigenetic).

## Interactions
NSD1 interacts with various nuclear receptors and proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It contains two distinct nuclear receptor interaction domains, NID-L and NID+L, which allow it to interact with nuclear receptors in both their apo- and holo-forms. NID-L interacts with unliganded forms of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), while NID+L interacts with liganded forms of TR, RAR, retinoid X receptor (RXR), and estrogen receptor (ER) (Huang1998Two). These interactions are dependent on the integrity of the AF-2 AD core, similar to other nuclear receptor coactivators (Huang1998Two).

NSD1 also interacts with the PRC2 complex in embryonic stem cells, influencing the demarcation of H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 domains, which are crucial for gene regulation. This interaction requires an intact PRC2 complex for its association with Ezh2 and Suz12, highlighting its role in chromatin modification processes (Streubel2018The).

Additionally, NSD1 interacts with Nizp1, a novel multitype zinc finger protein, through a unique C2HR motif. This interaction is metal-dependent and crucial for Nizp1's function as a transcriptional repressor, recruiting NSD1 as a corepressor (Nielsen2004Nizp1).
