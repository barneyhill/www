# HCFC1R1

## Overview
HCFC1R1 (host cell factor C1 regulator 1) is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in transcriptional modulation and chromatin remodeling. The protein, also named HCFC1R1, functions primarily within the nucleus, where it plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and nuclear translocation of proteins. It is particularly significant in the context of Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) infection, where it interacts with host cell factor C1 (HCFC1) to facilitate the nuclear entry of the viral protein VP16, thereby influencing viral replication and immediate-early gene expression (Shen2020HCFC1R1). Beyond its role in viral infection, HCFC1R1 is implicated in essential cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and development, although its specific functions in non-infected cells remain to be fully elucidated (Shen2020HCFC1R1). The protein's regulatory activities underscore its importance in both pathological and normal physiological contexts.

## Structure


## Function
HCFC1R1 (host cell factor C1 regulator 1) is a protein involved in regulating transcription and chromatin remodeling. It interacts with host cell factor C1 (HCFC1) to modulate gene expression, playing a crucial role in the nuclear translocation of proteins and the regulation of gene expression necessary for cell cycle progression and development (Shen2020HCFC1R1). HCFC1R1 is active in the nucleus, where it influences the localization and function of HCFC1, affecting the expression of immediate-early viral genes during Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) infection (Shen2020HCFC1R1). The HCFC1/HCFC1R1 complex is essential for the translocation of the viral protein VP16 into the nucleus, which is critical for viral replication (Shen2020HCFC1R1). In healthy human cells, HCFC1R1 is likely involved in similar nuclear transport processes, affecting protein complex formation and gene expression regulation, although specific details about its function in non-infected cells are not fully elucidated in the available literature (Shen2020HCFC1R1). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal development, highlighting its importance in both viral infection contexts and potentially in regular cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the HCFC1R1 gene are associated with various diseases, including developmental disorders and cancer. Alterations in the expression of HCFC1R1 can impact cell cycle control and chromatin remodeling, which are critical processes in maintaining normal cellular function. Disruptions in these processes may lead to pathological conditions, as the gene plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation. Changes in the interactions of HCFC1R1 with other cellular components can also contribute to disease development, as these interactions are essential for its regulatory functions. The gene's involvement in these critical cellular mechanisms underscores its potential impact on health when its normal function is compromised.

## Interactions
HCFC1R1 is a protein that plays a significant role in the context of Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) infection by interacting with Host Cell Factor C1 (HCFC1). It acts as a regulator of HCFC1, modulating its subcellular localization and is crucial for the nuclear translocation of the HSV-1 VP16 protein. This interaction is essential for the initiation of HSV-1 immediate early gene expression. HCFC1R1 forms a complex with HCFC1, which is necessary for the transport of the HSV capsid to the nucleus. The absence of HCFC1R1 disrupts this process, leading to the aggregation of HCFC1 and VP16 in the cytoplasm and inhibiting HSV-1 proliferation (Shen2020HCFC1R1).

HCFC1R1 can directly interact with both HCFC1 and VP16, facilitating the nuclear entry of VP16 by regulating the HCFC1 complex formation. This interaction is induced by HSV-1 infection but is suppressed in the absence of HCFC1R1. The study suggests that targeting the interaction between the HCFC1/HCFC1R1 complex and VP16 could be a strategy for treating HSV-1 infections (Shen2020HCFC1R1).
