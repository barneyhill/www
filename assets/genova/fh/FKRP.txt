# FKRP

## Overview
The FKRP gene encodes the fukutin-related protein, a type II transmembrane protein that functions as a ribitol-phosphate transferase. This protein is integral to the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a process essential for maintaining muscle integrity by anchoring the plasma membrane to the extracellular matrix. The FKRP protein is characterized by its two main domains: the N-terminal stem domain and the C-terminal catalytic domain, which adopts a nucleotidyltransferase fold. The protein's enzymatic activity is dependent on its oligomeric state, forming a tetramer that is crucial for its function. Mutations in the FKRP gene can lead to various muscular dystrophies, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle pathology (Esapa2023Misfolding; Henriques2019Functional; Kuwabara2020Crystal).

## Structure
The fukutin-related protein (FKRP) is a ribitol-phosphate transferase involved in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, crucial for muscle integrity. FKRP is composed of two main domains: the N-terminal stem domain (residues 45-287) and the C-terminal catalytic domain (residues 288-495) (Kuwabara2020Crystal). The catalytic domain adopts a nucleotidyltransferase fold, characterized by a twisted β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, and contains conserved acidic residues and a hG[GS] motif (Kuwabara2020Crystal). A Zn2+ ion stabilizes a loop in the catalytic domain, which is crucial for FKRP's function (Kuwabara2020Crystal).

FKRP forms a tetramer, consisting of two identical protomeric dimers, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Kuwabara2020Crystal). The tetrameric structure is maintained by significant contributions from both the stem and catalytic domains to the dimer-dimer interface (Kuwabara2020Crystal). The protein's activity is dependent on divalent metal ions, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, which are crucial for its catalytic function (Kuwabara2020Crystal).

Mutations in FKRP can lead to misfolding and affect its oligomerization state, enzymatic activity, and interactions with other molecules, contributing to various muscular dystrophies (Esapa2023Misfolding). The protein's structure and function are also influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity (OrtizCordero2021FukutinRelated).

## Function
The FKRP (fukutin-related protein) gene encodes a type II transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG), a key component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex in muscle cells. This glycosylation process is essential for anchoring the plasma membrane to extracellular matrix components like laminin, which is vital for membrane stabilization during muscle contraction and relaxation (Henriques2019Functional). FKRP is localized in the mid/trans-Golgi apparatus, where it functions as a ribitol-phosphate transferase, transferring ribitol-phosphate into the growing glycosylation chain of α-DG using CDP-ribitol as a substrate (Henriques2019Functional; Kuwabara2020Crystal).

The protein's enzymatic activity involves the transfer of ribitol-phosphate from CDP-ribitol to an acceptor glycopeptide, forming a tandem ribitol-phosphate structure that is unique to mammals and necessary for the interaction between α-DG and laminin (Kuwabara2020Crystal). FKRP's function is dependent on its oligomeric state, as it forms a dimer in vivo, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Kuwabara2020Crystal). Proper glycosylation of α-DG by FKRP ensures the structural integrity and function of muscle tissues, highlighting its importance in maintaining healthy muscle function (Henriques2019Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FKRP gene are associated with a range of muscular dystrophies, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I) and congenital muscular dystrophy type 1C (MDC1C). These conditions are characterized by muscle weakness and degeneration. LGMD2I presents with proximal muscle weakness, calf hypertrophy, and tightness of the Achilles tendon. It can vary in severity, with some patients experiencing a Duchenne-like progression, losing ambulation in their early teens, while others have a milder phenotype (Mercuri2003Phenotypic). MDC1C is more severe, with symptoms such as severe weakness from birth, inability to stand unsupported, and significant facial weakness (Mercuri2003Phenotypic).

FKRP mutations can lead to hypo-glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, contributing to disease pathology (Esapa2023Misfolding). Specific mutations, such as p.L276I, are commonly associated with LGMD2I (Esapa2023Misfolding). Misfolding of FKRP variants can result in protein aggregates and impaired intracellular transport, affecting the protein's function (Esapa2023Misfolding). Additionally, FKRP mutations can cause secondary laminin α2 deficiency, further impacting muscle integrity (Brockington2001Mutations). In some cases, FKRP mutations are linked to brain abnormalities, such as cerebellar cysts, expanding the clinical spectrum of FKRP-related conditions (Topaloglu2003FKRP).

## Interactions
Fukutin-related protein (FKRP) is involved in several critical interactions that are essential for its function in glycosylation processes. FKRP forms oligomers, functioning as a tetramer, with its dimerization being crucial for its enzymatic activity (Kuwabara2020Crystal; OrtizCordero2021FukutinRelated). It interacts with fukutin (FKTN) to transfer ribitol-phosphate units to the core M3 O-mannosyl glycan, a process vital for the proper function of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) (Nishihara2018Cell; Kuwabara2020Crystal). 

FKRP also interacts with TMEM5, a ribitol xylosyltransferase, forming a complex that enhances the efficiency of glycan synthesis. This complex formation is supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments and co-localization within the Golgi apparatus (Nishihara2018Cell). Additionally, FKRP is involved in the glycosylation of fibronectin, which is crucial for collagen binding and muscle basement membrane localization. This interaction affects muscle pathology in muscular dystrophy (Wood2021FKRPdependent).

Misfolded FKRP variants can interact with ER-resident chaperones such as calnexin, ERp72, and GRP94, which regulate its folding and transit through the secretory pathway (Esapa2023Misfolding). These interactions highlight FKRP's role in maintaining muscle integrity and its involvement in muscular dystrophies.
