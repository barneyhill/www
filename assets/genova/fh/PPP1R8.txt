# PPP1R8

## Overview
The PPP1R8 gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 8, commonly referred to as the nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (NIPP1). This protein is a regulatory subunit that plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in numerous cellular processes. NIPP1 is primarily located in the nucleus, where it is integral to the regulation of transcription and pre-mRNA splicing. It functions as a transcriptional repressor by facilitating the PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of specific motifs on histone methyltransferases, thereby influencing gene expression and cell cycle regulation (Hanaki2021PP1; Casamayor2020Controlling). Additionally, NIPP1 is involved in the assembly of the spliceosome, highlighting its importance in RNA processing (Beullens2002The). Through its interactions with various proteins, NIPP1 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to DNA damage, underscoring its significance in cellular function and integrity (Hanaki2021PP1).

## Structure


## Function
The PPP1R8 gene encodes the nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (NIPP1), a regulatory subunit that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by modulating the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). NIPP1 is involved in the regulation of transcription and splicing within the nucleus. It acts as a transcriptional repressor by participating in the PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of Thr-Pro motifs of the histone methyltransferase EZH2, which is part of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). This interaction is essential for the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation by silencing Polycomb target genes (Casamayor2020Controlling).

NIPP1 also plays a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing, targeting splicing factors like CDC5L and SAP155 for dephosphorylation by associated PP1, which is crucial for spliceosome assembly (Beullens2002The). In response to DNA damage, NIPP1 regulates transcription by modulating the dephosphorylation of histone H3 at threonine 11, affecting the expression of E2F1 target genes involved in cell cycle regulation (Hanaki2021PP1). NIPP1's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to DNA damage (Hanaki2021PP1).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PPP1R8, also known as NIPP1, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that participates in various protein interactions. It interacts with PP1 through an RVxF motif, which is crucial for its binding and regulatory functions (Casamayor2020Controlling). PPP1R8 is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes in the brain, potentially influencing synaptic transmission and other cellular processes (Esteves2012Protein). 

In the human testis, PPP1R8 has been identified as a known PP1 interacting protein, with the RVTF motif being a key element in its interaction with PP1 (Fardilha2011Identification). This interaction is significant for its role in the nucleus spliceosome machinery, where it influences pre-mRNA splicing (Fardilha2012The). 

PPP1R8 also interacts with other proteins such as CDC5L and SAP155, which are involved in RNA processing and transcriptional regulation (Casamayor2020Controlling). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PPP1R8 in cellular processes, including its involvement in the dephosphorylation of EZH2, a histone methyltransferase, affecting chromatin binding and gene silencing (Casamayor2020Controlling).
