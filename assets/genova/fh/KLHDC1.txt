# KLHDC1

## Overview
KLHDC1, or kelch domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic protein characterized by the presence of six kelch repeats, which form a β-propeller structure. This structural motif is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, a common feature among kelch domain-containing proteins (Chin2006Differential). Despite its structural similarity to its paralog KLHDC2, KLHDC1 exhibits distinct functional roles, as it does not bind to actin or inhibit LZIP/CREB3-mediated transcriptional activation (Chin2006Differential). KLHDC1 is expressed in various human tissues, with notable abundance in skeletal muscle, and is involved in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization (Chin2006Differential). The protein's cytoplasmic localization is maintained through interactions with unidentified partner proteins, highlighting its unique role in cellular dynamics (Chin2006Differential).

## Structure
KLHDC1 is a protein characterized by the presence of six kelch repeats, which form a β-propeller structure. This structure is composed of four-stranded antiparallel β sheets, a common feature of kelch repeat proteins, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Chin2006Differential). The kelch motif, approximately 50 amino acids in length, is evolutionarily conserved and contributes to the protein's tertiary structure (Chin2006Differential).

KLHDC1 shares about 47% identity and 64% similarity with its paralog KLHDC2 over 352 amino acid residues, indicating a significant degree of structural conservation between these proteins (Chin2006Differential). Despite this similarity, KLHDC1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, unlike KLHDC2, which is found in the nucleus (Chin2006Differential).

The protein does not bind to actin and does not inhibit LZIP/CREB3-mediated transcriptional activation, suggesting distinct functional roles compared to KLHDC2 (Chin2006Differential). The cytoplasmic retention of KLHDC1 is not due to CRM1-dependent nuclear export, implying the involvement of unidentified partner proteins in its localization (Chin2006Differential).

## Function
KLHDC1 (kelch domain containing 1) is a protein primarily localized in the cytoplasm of human cells, where it plays a role in various cellular processes through its kelch domain, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Chin2006Differential). These interactions are crucial for cellular functions such as signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. Despite its abundance in skeletal muscle, KLHDC1 does not associate with actin, a common function of many kelch repeat proteins, indicating a distinct role in cellular processes (Chin2006Differential).

KLHDC1 is expressed in various human tissues, with high expression levels in skeletal muscle and moderate-to-high levels in the pancreas and liver, but it is absent in peripheral blood leukocytes (Chin2006Differential). The protein's cytoplasmic localization is maintained as it prevents its partners from entering the nucleus, suggesting that KLHDC1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by unidentified partner proteins (Chin2006Differential). This cytoplasmic retention is not influenced by CRM1-mediated nuclear export, as treatment with leptomycin B does not alter its localization (Chin2006Differential). KLHDC1's inability to inhibit LZIP-mediated transcription, unlike its paralog KLHDC2, suggests that it may have distinct functions in vivo (Chin2006Differential).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
KLHDC1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and does not interact with actin, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cultured MCF7 cells. This suggests that its cytoplasmic retention is not due to actin binding (Chin2006Differential). Unlike its paralog KLHDC2, KLHDC1 does not interact with or inhibit the transcription factor LZIP, indicating a lack of involvement in LZIP-mediated transcriptional regulation (Chin2006Differential). The study suggests that KLHDC1 may be retained in the cytoplasm by unidentified partner proteins, although these interactions have not been specifically identified (Chin2006Differential).

KLHDC1 is part of a family of Kelch domain-containing proteins, which are known for their roles in protein-protein interactions. However, specific interactions involving KLHDC1, such as forming multiprotein complexes or engaging in transitory interactions, have not been detailed in the available literature (Scott2024Principles). The research primarily focuses on the differential localization and activity of KLHDC1 compared to its paralog KLHDC2, rather than on specific protein interactions involving KLHDC1 (Chin2006Differential).
