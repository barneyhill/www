# KCNJ4

## Overview
The KCNJ4 gene encodes the potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 4 (Kir2.3), a transmembrane protein that is part of the inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channel family. These channels are characterized by their ability to allow potassium ions to flow more easily into the cell than out, which is crucial for maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability across various tissues, including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle (Hamilton2012Basolateral; Hibino2010Inwardly). Kir2.3 channels are integral to the function of renal epithelial cells, where they contribute to potassium homeostasis, and cardiac cells, where they influence the repolarization of action potentials (Crotti2020Heritable; Szuts2013Altered). The protein's structure includes two transmembrane domains, an extracellular pore-forming region, and cytoplasmic domains, forming a tetrameric channel that can interact with various proteins to regulate its localization and function (Leonoudakis2004Protein; Hibino2010Inwardly). Alterations in KCNJ4 expression or function have been associated with diseases such as dilated cardiomyopathy and Parkinson's disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Tian2013Potassium; Szuts2013Altered).

## Structure
The KCNJ4 gene encodes the Kir2.3 protein, a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family. The primary structure of Kir2.3 includes two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2), an extracellular pore-forming region (H5), and cytoplasmic amino (NH2) and carboxy (COOH) terminal domains (Tian2013Potassium; Hibino2010Inwardly). The H5 region serves as the ion-selectivity filter, characterized by the signature sequence T-X-G-Y(F)-G (Hibino2010Inwardly).

The secondary structure of Kir2.3 involves alpha-helices in the transmembrane domains and beta-strands in the cytoplasmic domains, forming beta-sheets that contribute to the stability of the cytoplasmic region (Hibino2010Inwardly). The tertiary structure is defined by the folding of these elements into a functional channel, with the cytoplasmic domain forming a cylinder around the pore, extending the ion conduction pathway (Hibino2010Inwardly).

In terms of quaternary structure, Kir2.3 functions as a tetramer, with each subunit contributing to the formation of the channel pore (Hibino2010Inwardly). The protein can form both homomeric and heteromeric complexes, often within the same subfamily, such as Kir2.1/2.3 heteromers (Hibino2010Inwardly). Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence channel activity, although specific modifications for KCNJ4 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The KCNJ4 gene encodes the Kir2.3 channel, a member of the inward rectifier potassium channel family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability in various tissues. In the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, Kir2.3 channels are involved in setting the resting membrane potential by allowing potassium ions to flow more easily into the cell than out, contributing to the stabilization of the cell's electrical state (Hamilton2012Basolateral; Crotti2020Heritable).

In renal epithelial cells, KCNJ4 is expressed in the cortical collecting duct and is targeted to the basolateral membrane. Here, it contributes to potassium homeostasis by regulating potassium levels in the principal cells, which is essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential and proper cellular function (Hamilton2012Basolateral). The channel's strong inward rectification and high open probability make it sensitive to potassium channel blockers like Ba2+, highlighting its role in potassium handling (Hamilton2012Basolateral).

In cardiac cells, Kir2.3 channels are essential for maintaining the resting membrane potential of atrial and ventricular myocytes, influencing the repolarization of action potentials and contributing to cardiac function (Crotti2020Heritable; Szuts2013Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KCNJ4 gene, which encodes the Kir2.3 potassium channel, have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the expression of KCNJ4 is upregulated, which may contribute to the disease's pathophysiology. Although the mRNA levels of Kir2.3 are increased in DCM hearts, the protein levels do not show a significant change, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism at play (Szuts2013Altered). The altered expression of KCNJ4 in DCM is associated with changes in the inward rectifier potassium current (I_K1), which is crucial for maintaining the resting membrane potential and is implicated in arrhythmogenesis and ventricular arrhythmias (Szuts2013Altered).

KCNJ4 is also linked to Parkinson's disease, as noted in a systematic nomenclature of potassium channel genes and their associated diseases (Tian2013Potassium). The gene's involvement in neurological disorders highlights its importance in maintaining proper neuronal function. The regulation of Kir channels, including those encoded by KCNJ4, is influenced by various factors such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and mutations affecting these interactions can impact channel activity, potentially leading to disease (Tian2013Potassium).

## Interactions
KCNJ4, also known as Kir2.3, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function and localization. Kir2.3 channels possess a C-terminal PDZ binding motif, which facilitates interactions with scaffolding proteins containing PDZ domains. These interactions are essential for the regulation of channel trafficking, localization, and stability. Kir2.3 interacts with members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, including SAP97, PSD-95, and CASK, which are known to play roles in clustering and stabilizing ion channels at the plasma membrane (Leonoudakis2004Protein).

In the brain, Kir2.3 forms part of a multiprotein complex involving SAP97, CASK, Veli-1, Veli-3, and Mint1. These interactions are mediated by the PDZ binding motif of Kir2.3, with SAP97 acting as a scaffold that links Kir2.3 to CASK and other associated proteins (Leonoudakis2004A). The interaction with CASK is indirect, occurring through SAP97, which directly binds to the PDZ motif of Kir2.3 (Leonoudakis2004A).

Kir2.3 also associates with components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), such as syntrophin, dystrophin, and dystrobrevin, which are important for its localization and stabilization at specific subcellular locations (Leonoudakis2004Protein). These interactions highlight the role of Kir2.3 in forming large protein complexes that influence its cellular distribution and function.
