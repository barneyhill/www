# HERC5

## Overview
HERC5 is a gene that encodes the protein HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 5, which is a member of the small HERC family of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a HECT domain and an RCC1-like domain (RLD), which are crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. HERC5 plays a significant role in the post-translational modification process known as ISGylation, where it facilitates the conjugation of ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein, to target proteins. This process is essential for antiviral defense and immune response regulation, making HERC5 a key player in innate immunity (Shi2010Positive; SánchezTena2016Functional). The protein is highly expressed in the testis and fetal brain and is induced by interferons, contributing to its role in inhibiting viral replication, including that of HIV-1, through mechanisms that extend beyond its E3 ligase activity (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided). Additionally, HERC5 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels and interactions influence tumorigenesis and patient prognosis in various cancers, including colorectal and breast cancer (Zhu2021Downregulation; Tang2019Weighted).

## Structure
HERC5 is a member of the small HERC family of proteins, characterized by the presence of a single amino-terminal RCC1-like domain (RLD) and a carboxyl-terminal HECT domain. The RCC1-like domain is part of the RCC1 superfamily, known for its 7-bladed β-propeller structure, which is crucial for its function (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided). The HECT domain, spanning residues 676-1024, includes a conserved cysteine residue at position 994, typical of HECT-type protein ligases, and is responsible for its E3 ligase activity (Wong2006HERC5). 

HERC5 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like molecules to substrate proteins, and is involved in ISGylation, a process similar to ubiquitination (Wong2006HERC5). The protein is also associated with ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein, and is itself a target for ISG15 modification, indicating its role in post-translational modifications (Wong2006HERC5). 

The structural topology of the HECT and RCC1-like domains is highly conserved despite low sequence homology, suggesting an evolutionary strategy to maintain antiviral activity (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of HERC5 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
HERC5 is a HECT domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in the post-translational modification process known as ISGylation. This process involves the conjugation of ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein, to target proteins, which is crucial for antiviral defense and immune response regulation (Shi2010Positive; SánchezTena2016Functional). HERC5 is the primary ISG15 E3 ligase in human cells, and its activity is essential for the ISGylation of proteins, acting as a positive regulator of innate antiviral responses (SánchezTena2016Functional).

HERC5 is highly expressed in the testis and fetal brain, with lower expression in other organs (SánchezTena2016Functional). It is induced by interferons and plays a critical role in intrinsic immunity by inhibiting the replication of various viruses, including HIV-1, through mechanisms that are independent of its E3 ligase activity (Paparisto2018EvolutionGuided). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, where it interacts with and ISGylates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), preventing its degradation and sustaining its antiviral activity (Shi2010Positive). HERC5 also targets viral proteins for ISGylation, inhibiting their function and virus replication (SánchezTena2016Functional).

## Clinical Significance
HERC5 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HERC5 is considered a potential metastasis suppressor gene. Its promoter hypermethylation is associated with increased disseminated tumor cells and metastases, leading to poor survival outcomes. This suggests that HERC5 may serve as a prognostic biomarker for NSCLC progression (Wrage2014Identification). In colorectal cancer (CRC), HERC5 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation leads to reduced ubiquitination of CtBP1, resulting in the accumulation of CtBP1 and the suppression of proapoptotic genes, which promotes tumorigenesis. Lower HERC5 expression is linked to worse overall survival in CRC patients (Zhu2021Downregulation).

In breast cancer, HERC5 is identified as a prognostic candidate, with its expression negatively associated with patient prognosis. Knockdown of HERC5 in breast cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation, indicating its role in cancer cell growth (Tang2019Weighted). HERC5 is also a prognostic biomarker for survival and tumor recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, highlighting its broader significance in cancer prognosis (SánchezTena2016Functional).

## Interactions
HERC5 is known to interact with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in antiviral responses and cancer biology. It acts as an E3 ligase for ISG15, a ubiquitin-like protein, facilitating ISGylation, which is crucial for regulating antiviral responses. HERC5 interacts with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), catalyzing its ISGylation to inhibit degradation and sustain antiviral activity (SánchezTena2016Functional). It also targets viral proteins, such as the NS1 protein of influenza A virus, by conjugating ISG15, thereby inhibiting viral replication. HERC5 interacts with HIV-1 Gag particles, restricting their production and inhibiting HIV-1 replication (SánchezTena2016Functional).

In cancer biology, HERC5 interacts with nonmetastatic cells 23b (Nm23b/NME2), a metastasis suppressor gene, mediating its ubiquitination without degradation (Wrage2014Identification). In colorectal cancer cells, HERC5 forms a complex with CBP and CtBP1 proteins. It ubiquitinates CtBP1, leading to its degradation and influencing apoptosis pathways (Zhu2021Downregulation). The downregulation of HERC5 in colorectal cancer cells results in the accumulation of CtBP1, which forms a transcriptional complex with HDAC1 and c-MYC, suppressing proapoptotic gene expression and promoting tumorigenesis (Zhu2021Downregulation).
