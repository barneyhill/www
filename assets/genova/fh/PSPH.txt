# PSPH

## Overview
The PSPH gene encodes the enzyme phosphoserine phosphatase, which is a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase family. This enzyme is pivotal in the biosynthesis of the non-essential amino acid L-serine, catalyzing the conversion of phosphoserine to L-serine in the final step of the serine biosynthesis pathway. Phosphoserine phosphatase is characterized by its magnesium-dependent activity and operates as a homodimer, with a structure that includes a Rossmann-fold-like domain essential for its catalytic function. The enzyme's activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, and neurotransmitter production, particularly in the central nervous system. Mutations in the PSPH gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including Neu-Laxova syndrome and certain forms of male infertility, and alterations in its expression are associated with cancer progression (Tabatabaie2010l-Serine; AcunaHidalgo2014NeuLaxova; Haufroid2019Crystal; Rawat2021PSPH).

## Structure
The human phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) enzyme is involved in the serine biosynthesis pathway, catalyzing the conversion of phosphoserine to serine. The primary structure of PSPH consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the PSPH gene. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a Rossmann fold, which is common in enzymes that bind nucleotides (Haufroid2019Crystal; Peeraer2003Highresolution).

The tertiary structure of PSPH is a compact, globular shape, featuring a Rossmann-fold-like domain that forms the catalytic core. This domain is involved in the enzyme's catalytic activity and is crucial for its function (Haufroid2019Crystal). PSPH can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure, which is significant for its enzymatic activity (Peeraer2003Highresolution).

PSPH is part of a superfamily of enzymes that includes P-type ATPases and haloacid dehalogenases, sharing three conserved sequence motifs crucial for its catalytic process (Peeraer2003Highresolution). The enzyme's structure also includes a cap domain, which is involved in oligomerization states and features a squiggle/flap loop that opens and closes the active site (Haufroid2019Crystal). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, affecting the enzyme's function and regulation. There are known splice variant isoforms that may influence its activity and regulation.

## Function
The human gene PSPH encodes phosphoserine phosphatase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of the non-essential amino acid L-serine. This enzyme catalyzes the final and irreversible step in the serine biosynthesis pathway, converting phosphoserine to L-serine, which is essential for various cellular functions, including protein synthesis, nucleotide metabolism, and the production of other amino acids like glycine and cysteine (Tabatabaie2010l-Serine; Haufroid2019Crystal).

PSPH is part of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase family and operates as a magnesium-dependent enzyme. It functions as a dimer and is characterized by three conserved sequence motifs that form the active site, facilitating a stepwise phosphotransfer mechanism (Tabatabaie2010l-Serine; Haufroid2019Crystal). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for maintaining adequate levels of L-serine, particularly in the central nervous system, where it supports neuron survival and serves as a precursor for neurotransmitters (Tabatabaie2010l-Serine; Pollegioni2024Lserine).

In healthy human cells, PSPH activity is regulated by L-serine through negative feedback inhibition, making it the rate-limiting step in the serine biosynthesis pathway (Tabatabaie2010l-Serine; Peeraer2003Highresolution). This regulation ensures that the pathway is controlled by the demand for L-serine-derived metabolites, which are vital for cellular proliferation and various metabolic pathways (de2003lSerine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PSPH gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One significant disorder linked to PSPH mutations is Neu-Laxova syndrome (NLS), a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severe malformations and often resulting in prenatal or early postnatal lethality. NLS is caused by defects in the L-serine biosynthesis pathway, with mutations in PSPH, such as a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.267delC [p.Gly90Alafs*2]), leading to nonfunctional protein production and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (AcunaHidalgo2014NeuLaxova).

In the context of male infertility, PSPH gene mutations have been identified as a potential factor in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OA), a condition marked by low sperm count and motility. Studies have found novel, pathogenic missense mutations in the PSPH gene, particularly in exons 4 and 5, which are linked to reduced spermatogenesis and male infertility (Shemshaki2021Novel).

Alterations in PSPH expression are also implicated in cancer progression. In melanoma, PSPH is upregulated and plays a crucial role in tumor growth and metastasis. Knockdown of PSPH in melanoma cells leads to metabolic deregulation, affecting DNA and histone modifications, and results in reduced tumor growth (Rawat2021PSPH).
