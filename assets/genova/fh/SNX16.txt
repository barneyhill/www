# SNX16

## Overview
SNX16, or sorting nexin 16, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in endosomal dynamics and membrane trafficking. The protein, sorting nexin 16, is characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain and a coiled-coil (CC) domain, which are essential for its function in cellular processes. The PX domain facilitates the binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), targeting the protein to endosomal membranes, while the CC domain is crucial for oligomerization and higher-order assembly, enabling membrane tubulation and endosomal localization (Teasdale2011Insights; Wang2019Higherorder). SNX16 plays a significant role in the recycling of E-Cadherin and is involved in various signaling pathways, impacting processes such as cell migration, tumorigenesis, and synaptic growth (Hanley2020Sorting; Zhang2013SNX16). Its interactions with proteins like EGFR and eEF1A2 further underscore its importance in cellular dynamics and disease pathogenesis (Shen2020SNX16; Yuan2024SNX16).

## Structure
SNX16 (sorting nexin 16) is a protein characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain and a coiled-coil (CC) domain. The PX domain is responsible for binding phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), which targets SNX16 to endosomal membranes (Teasdale2011Insights; Zhang2013SNX16). The CC domain, located C-terminal to the PX domain, is crucial for SNX16's self-association and oligomerization, forming higher-order assemblies that are essential for its function in membrane tubulation and endosomal localization (Wang2019Higherorder).

The CC domain is predicted to have a helical structure, potentially forming a coiled-coil configuration that facilitates SNX16's distribution between early and late endosomes (Teasdale2011Insights). This domain also plays a role in the protein's interaction with other cellular components, such as Rab5 and Rab7, which influence its endosomal association and distribution (Wang2019Higherorder).

SNX16's structure allows it to participate in various cellular processes, including the regulation of endosomal trafficking and the inhibition of viral RNA export from late endosomes (Teasdale2011Insights; Shi2022A). The protein's ability to form membrane tubules is dependent on the CC domain, as demonstrated by the inability of a mutant lacking this domain to perform such functions (Tanasic2022Ecadherin).

## Function
Sorting nexin 16 (SNX16) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily associated with endosomal dynamics and membrane trafficking. SNX16 contains a phox homology (PX) domain that binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), a phosphoinositide present on early and late endosomes, facilitating its localization to these cellular compartments (Hanley2020Sorting; Wang2019Higherorder). The coiled-coil (CC) domain of SNX16 is crucial for its oligomerization and higher-order assembly, which are essential for its role in membrane tubulation and endosomal localization (Wang2018Higher; Wang2019Higherorder).

SNX16 plays a significant role in the recycling of E-Cadherin, a protein critical for cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues, by interacting with endosomal membranes and forming a pear-shaped homodimer (Hanley2020Sorting). In neuronal cells, SNX16 is involved in the distribution and maturation of endosomes, influencing synaptic growth and signaling pathways such as the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway (Wang2019Higherorder). SNX16's ability to regulate endosomal dynamics and membrane organization is vital for maintaining cellular adhesion and proper signal transduction, impacting processes like cell migration and tumorigenesis (Zhang2013SNX16).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of SNX16 have been implicated in several diseases, notably hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pre-eclampsia (PE). In HCC, SNX16 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. This overexpression is associated with enhanced tumor progression, increased cell proliferation, and invasion, primarily through the modulation of the EGFR-AKT signaling pathway. SNX16's interaction with EGFR is crucial, as it influences EGFR phosphorylation and downstream AKT activity, contributing to the malignancy of HCC. Targeting the EGFR/AKT signaling axis via SNX16 inhibition is suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC (Yuan2024SNX16).

In pre-eclampsia, SNX16 expression is upregulated due to the transcriptional repression of miR-196a-5p by BHLHE40, a gene activated under hypoxic conditions. This upregulation of SNX16 is linked to impaired trophoblast migration and invasion, contributing to the pathogenesis of PE. The BHLHE40/miR-196a-5p/SNX16 axis is considered crucial in PE, with potential therapeutic implications in modulating this pathway to alleviate symptoms (Mi2020BHLHE40).

In contrast, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, SNX16 overexpression has been shown to reduce cell migration and tumor formation, suggesting a complex role in different cancer types (Zhang2013SNX16).

## Interactions
SNX16 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It forms a pear-shaped homodimer through its PX and CC domains, which allows it to interact with E-Cadherin, a protein crucial for cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues, while simultaneously binding to endosomal membranes (Hanley2020Sorting). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SNX16 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), enhancing its phosphorylation and activating the EGFR-AKT signaling pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and survival. This interaction is supported by co-immunoprecipitation assays and immunofluorescence studies showing colocalization of SNX16 and EGFR in the cytoplasm of HCC cells (Yuan2024SNX16).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), SNX16 interacts with eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2), inhibiting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. This interaction stabilizes eEF1A2, leading to the activation of c-Myc signaling, which promotes tumorigenesis (Shen2020SNX16). SNX16 also interacts with Rab5, a GTPase, in neuronal cells, which influences its localization and function in endosome association and distribution (Wang2019Higherorder). These interactions highlight SNX16's role in regulating signaling pathways and cellular dynamics.
