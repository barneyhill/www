# MFRP

## Overview
The MFRP gene encodes the membrane frizzled-related protein, a type II transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium and ciliary body. This protein is characterized by its frizzled-related cysteine-rich domain, cubulin domains, and low-density lipoprotein receptor class A repeats, which are integral to its role in signal transduction and endocytosis (Kautzmann2019Membrane‐type; Collery2016Loss). MFRP is crucial for ocular development and function, particularly in maintaining retinal health and photoreceptor function through lipid metabolism regulation (Kautzmann2019Membrane‐type). It forms a functional complex with the C1QTNF5/CTRP5 gene product, which is essential for the structural integrity of photoreceptor cells and the prevention of retinal degenerative diseases (Kautzmann2019Membrane‐type; Mandal2006Spatial). Mutations in the MFRP gene are linked to ocular conditions such as nanophthalmos and posterior microphthalmia, underscoring its significance in eye growth regulation (Sundin2008Developmental; Almoallem2020The).

## Structure
The membrane frizzled-related protein (MFRP) is a type II transmembrane receptor characterized by several distinct structural domains. It includes an extracellular frizzled-related cysteine-rich domain, which is known for its role in recognizing frizzled Wnt receptors, and is involved in signal transduction processes (Kautzmann2019Membrane‐type; Collery2016Loss). Additionally, MFRP contains two cubulin domains and two low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLA) repeats, which are associated with proteolysis and endocytosis (Velez2017Gene; Collery2016Loss). 

The protein is glycosylated, a common post-translational modification that may affect its stability and function (Kautzmann2019Membrane‐type). MFRP is expressed as a dicistronic transcript with the C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein-5 (C1QTNF5/CTRP5) gene, suggesting a potential quaternary structure through interaction with CTRP5 (Kautzmann2019Membrane‐type; Mandal2006Spatial). These interactions are supported by co-immunoprecipitation studies, indicating that MFRP and CTRP5 can form complexes in vivo (Collery2016Loss; Mandal2006Spatial). The localization of MFRP to the apical and basal membranes of the retinal pigment epithelium and ciliary epithelium further underscores its role in ocular development and function (Mandal2006Spatial).

## Function
The MFRP (membrane frizzled-related protein) gene encodes a transmembrane protein primarily expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and ciliary body. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining retinal health and photoreceptor function by regulating lipid metabolism and transcription processes essential for photoreceptor cells (Kautzmann2019Membrane‐type). MFRP is involved in the enrichment of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the retina, which is vital for the organization of the retinal lipidome and visual function (Kautzmann2019Membrane‐type).

MFRP interacts with the CTRP5 gene, forming a complex that is crucial for ocular development and function. This interaction is significant in the retinal pigment epithelium and ciliary epithelium, where MFRP is localized to the apical membrane (Mandal2006Spatial). The protein's role extends to maintaining the structural integrity of photoreceptor cells by influencing actin polymerization and cell adhesion, which are essential for the morphology of RPE microvilli and photoreceptor cell homeostasis (Kautzmann2019Membrane‐type).

Disruptions in MFRP function can lead to retinal degenerative diseases, highlighting its importance in ocular growth regulation and the prevention of refractive errors (Soundararajan2014Gene; Koli2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MFRP gene are associated with several ocular conditions, most notably nanophthalmos and posterior microphthalmia. These conditions are characterized by small, hyperopic eyes due to reduced axial length, often leading to secondary complications such as angle closure glaucoma and retinal detachment (Sundin2008Developmental; Almoallem2020The). Nanophthalmos is a subtype of microphthalmia where the eye is small but structurally well-formed, and it is linked to severe mutations in the MFRP gene (Sundin2008Developmental).

MFRP mutations can also result in complex retinal involvement, including retinitis pigmentosa-like changes, reduced best-corrected visual acuity, and loss of normal foveal architecture (Almoallem2020The). Specific mutations, such as c498_499insC, have been studied in mouse models, showing progressive retinal degeneration and structural changes consistent with human pathology (Chekuri2019LongTerm).

The phenotypic expression of MFRP mutations can vary significantly, with some individuals exhibiting additional features like foveoschisis, retinal and choroidal folds, and foveal hypoplasia (Godinho2020A). The variability in clinical presentation suggests that both genetic and environmental factors may influence the severity and progression of symptoms (Li2024MFRP). Gene therapy has shown potential in restoring MFRP function and correcting associated ocular abnormalities in animal models (Velez2017Gene).

## Interactions
MFRP (membrane frizzled-related protein) is known to interact with CTRP5 (C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 5), forming a complex that plays a significant role in retinal function. This interaction has been demonstrated through colocalization studies in polarized epithelial cells, such as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and ciliary epithelium (CE). In these cells, MFRP localizes to the apical membrane, while CTRP5 is found on both apical and lateral membranes. The significant colocalization of MFRP and CTRP5 on the apical surface suggests a potential physical interaction (Mandal2006Spatial).

The interaction between MFRP and CTRP5 was further confirmed through immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of human RPE-choroid and mouse eye tissue extracts, which showed the presence of both proteins in the same immunocomplex. Heterologous expression systems in COS-7 cells also demonstrated this interaction, where tagged versions of MFRP and CTRP5 were co-expressed and co-immunoprecipitated (Mandal2006Spatial). The interaction is thought to occur through extracellular domains similar to those in the complement system, suggesting a role in ocular development and function (Mandal2006Spatial).
