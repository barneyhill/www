# ALG6

## Overview
The ALG6 gene encodes the enzyme dolichyl pyrophosphate Man9GlcNAc2 α1,3-glucosyltransferase, a crucial component of the N-glycosylation pathway in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme, categorized as an inverting glycosyltransferase, is responsible for the initial transfer of glucose moieties onto the pre-assembled GlcNAc2Man9 glycan within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, a step essential for the proper glycosylation of nascent glycoproteins (Bloch2020Structure). The ALG6 protein is characterized by its complex structure, featuring 14 transmembrane helices and a large hydrophilic cavity, which facilitates its enzymatic function (Bloch2020Structure). Mutations in the ALG6 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ic (CDG-Ic), resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations due to impaired glycosylation processes (Westphal2000Analysis). The study of ALG6 and its encoded protein is vital for understanding the molecular basis of these disorders and developing potential therapeutic strategies.

## Structure
The ALG6 protein is characterized by a unique topology consisting of 14 transmembrane helices and two long loops, EL1 and EL4, which form helices in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (Bloch2020Structure). A disulfide bridge links the ER-luminal end of TM14 with the external loop EL4, connecting TM7 and TM8 (Bloch2020Structure). The protein forms a large hydrophilic cavity facing the ER lumen and a groove-shaped cavity facing the lipid bilayer, lined with highly conserved residues (Bloch2020Structure).

The ALG6 protein is part of the GT-C superfamily, which includes enzymes with membrane-spanning helices that process isoprenoid-linked carbohydrate donor substrates (Bloch2020Structure). The structure of ALG6 reveals a modular architecture with conserved and variable modules, each serving distinct functional roles (Bloch2020Structure). The conserved module provides a scaffold and catalytic base, while the variable module allows for diverse glycosyl transfer reactions (Bloch2020Structure).

Mutations in ALG6, such as the C3T transition at nucleotide position 998, result in amino acid substitutions that affect the protein's function, leading to congenital disorders of glycosylation (Imbach1999A). These mutations often affect amino acids within the transmembrane domains, compromising the protein's structural integrity and function (Dercksen2012ALG6CDG).

## Function
The ALG6 gene encodes the enzyme dolichyl pyrophosphate Man9GlcNAc2 α1,3-glucosyltransferase, which is crucial in the N-glycosylation pathway in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is responsible for transferring the first of three glucose moieties onto the pre-assembled GlcNAc2Man9 glycan, a process that occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Bloch2020Structure). The addition of glucose residues is essential for the proper recognition and transfer of glycans to nascent glycoproteins by the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, ensuring efficient glycosylation, which is vital for the function and stability of glycoproteins (Imbach1999A).

ALG6 is an inverting glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of an α-1-3-glycosidic bond through an S N 2 mechanism. This involves the activation of the C3 hydroxyl group of the terminal A-branch mannose of Dol-PP-GlcNAc2Man9 for nucleophilic attack on the anomeric C1 of the glucose moiety (Bloch2020Structure). The enzyme's activity is facilitated by a catalytic aspartate residue, Asp69, which acts as a general base, abstracting a proton from the 3-hydroxyl group of the acceptor substrate (Bloch2020Structure). This process is critical for maintaining proper glycosylation in healthy cells, impacting cellular and organismal homeostasis (Bloch2020Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALG6 gene, which encodes the enzyme alpha-1,3-glucosyltransferase, are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ic (CDG-Ic). These mutations lead to inefficient N-glycosylation, resulting in a range of clinical symptoms including developmental delays, neurological issues such as seizures and hypotonia, and other systemic abnormalities (Westphal2000Analysis; Gr�newald2000Clinical). 

CDG-Ic is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme α-1,3 glucosyltransferase, which is crucial for the N-glycan synthesis pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. This deficiency results in the accumulation of incomplete glycan structures, leading to hypoglycosylation of glycoproteins (Gr�newald2000Clinical). Patients with CDG-Ic often present with symptoms similar to those of CDG-Ia, such as feeding problems and internal strabismus, but without the dysmorphic features like inverted nipples seen in CDG-Ia (Gr�newald2000Clinical).

Specific mutations identified in the ALG6 gene include the c.998C>T (p.A333V) mutation, which is common among CDG-Ic patients and results in a nonfunctional enzyme (Imbach1999A). Other mutations, such as c.482A>G (p.Y161C), have been linked to additional symptoms like dilated cardiomyopathy (AlOwain2010A). These genetic alterations underscore the critical role of ALG6 in proper glycosylation and the wide-ranging impact of its dysfunction.
