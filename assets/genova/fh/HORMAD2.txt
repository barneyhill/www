# HORMAD2

## Overview
HORMAD2 is a gene that encodes the protein HORMA domain containing 2, which plays a pivotal role in meiotic chromosome dynamics. The protein is characterized by the presence of a HORMA domain, a conserved module involved in protein-protein interactions essential for chromosomal behavior during meiosis (Rosenberg2015The). HORMAD2 is primarily involved in the surveillance of asynapsis, a critical process during meiosis, by facilitating the recruitment of the ATR kinase to unsynapsed chromosomal regions, thereby contributing to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation and the elimination of defective oocytes (Wojtasz2012Meiotic). The protein's interactions with other meiotic proteins, such as HORMAD1, underscore its importance in ensuring proper meiotic progression and chromosomal integrity (Prince2022Functions). HORMAD2's function is conserved across species, highlighting its fundamental role in reproductive biology (Barroso2024Two).

## Structure
HORMAD2 is a protein characterized by the presence of a HORMA domain, which is a conserved protein-protein interaction module involved in chromosomal dynamics during meiosis. The HORMA domain typically consists of a core structure with three α-helices packed against a three-stranded β-sheet, stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds involving conserved residues (Rosenberg2015The). The C-terminal region of the HORMA domain, known as the "safety belt," can adopt open or closed conformations, influencing the binding of partner proteins (Rosenberg2015The). This conformational flexibility is crucial for the protein's function in meiosis, as it allows HORMAD2 to interact with closure motifs in partner proteins, forming topologically-closed complexes (West2017Conformational).

The structural dynamics of HORMAD2 are similar to those observed in other HORMA domain proteins, such as Mad2, which can switch between open and closed states (West2017Conformational). Although specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of HORMAD2 are not provided, the protein's conformational changes and interactions with other proteins are essential for its role in meiotic chromosome organization and recombination (Rosenberg2015The). The protein's structure and function are conserved across various species, indicating its fundamental role in meiosis (Barroso2024Two).

## Function
HORMAD2 is a protein involved in meiotic processes, particularly in the surveillance of asynapsis during meiosis. It plays a crucial role in the recruitment of the ATR kinase to unsynapsed axial elements of chromosomes, which is essential for meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) in spermatocytes and the elimination of oocytes with synaptic errors (Wojtasz2012Meiotic). HORMAD2 functions as a sensor component of a prophase surveillance mechanism that monitors asynapsis, distinct from mechanisms that monitor DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Wojtasz2012Meiotic).

HORMAD2 is not required for the formation or repair of DSBs, synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, or the accumulation of ATR activity on chromatin loops near unrepaired DSBs. However, it is crucial for the accumulation of ATR, BRCA1, and TOPBP1 along unsynapsed sex chromosome AEs (Wojtasz2012Meiotic). The protein's function is particularly important in ensuring the proper formation and function of sex bodies during meiosis, which are structures that help in the silencing of unsynapsed chromosomes (Wojtasz2012Meiotic). HORMAD2's interaction with HORMAD1 is important for its function, as HORMAD1 recruits HORMAD2 to unsynapsed AEs, facilitating the recruitment of ATR and ATR activators (Wojtasz2012Meiotic).

## Clinical Significance
HORMAD2 is implicated in several reproductive disorders due to its critical role in meiotic processes. In males, mutations or deficiencies in HORMAD2 can lead to infertility, as observed in Hormad2-deficient mice, where male infertility is linked to defects in sex chromosome silencing and meiotic progression (Wojtasz2012Meiotic). Although female mice with Hormad2 mutations remain fertile, there is an increased frequency of oocytes with synaptic errors, suggesting a role in maintaining oocyte quality (Wojtasz2012Meiotic).

In humans, the HORMAD2 gene has been studied in the context of non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a severe form of male infertility. While no direct association between HORMAD2 and NOA susceptibility was found, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs718772, in HORMAD2 showed a significant association with testis volume in NOA patients, indicating a potential link to testis development (Song2014Genetic).

The role of HORMAD2 in preventing meiotic errors suggests its potential relevance to human aneuploidies, as errors in meiotic recombination are a major cause of aneuploid embryos (Wojtasz2012Meiotic). However, direct links between HORMAD2 mutations and specific human diseases remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
HORMAD2, a meiotic chromosomal protein, interacts with several other proteins during meiosis. It is known to interact with cohesin and other meiosis-specific proteins, localizing to the chromosomal axis in a cohesin-dependent manner (Prince2022Functions). The HORMA domain of HORMAD2 interacts with closure motifs (CM) on its own C-terminus and with a CM present in SYCP2, suggesting a conserved mode of interaction necessary for axis localization and synaptonemal complex assembly (Rosenberg2015The). HORMAD2 recruitment to axial elements is largely dependent on HORMAD1, indicating that HORMAD2 may also bind the CM on HORMAD1's C-terminus (Prince2022Functions).

HORMAD2 is involved in recruiting the ATR kinase to unsynapsed regions on sex chromosomes during male meiosis, a process essential for transcriptional silencing and meiotic progression beyond pachytene (Prince2022Functions). The removal of HORMAD2 from chromosomes is mediated by TRIP13, which may involve disassembly mechanisms similar to those used for Mad2-containing complexes (Rosenberg2015The). These interactions highlight the role of HORMAD2 in ensuring proper chromosome dynamics and recombination during meiosis.
