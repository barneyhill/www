# C1orf56

## Overview
C1orf56 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 56. This protein is primarily recognized for its role in human reproductive biology, particularly in sperm function and fertilization. It is involved in the process of sperm capacitation, where it translocates to the sperm surface and facilitates binding to the zona pellucida of the oocyte, a crucial step for successful fertilization (Wang2021Identification). The protein contains a thrombospondin type-1 (TSP1) repeat, which is implicated in binding matrix glycoproteins and proteoglycans, suggesting its mechanism of action in sperm-egg recognition (Wang2021Identification). Beyond its reproductive role, C1orf56 is also associated with various cancers, where it is often overexpressed, indicating its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Kilpinen2008Systematic). Additionally, it is considered a risk gene in multiple myeloma, linked to poor prognosis due to its proto-oncogenic properties (Zhao2024A).

## Function
C1orf56 encodes a protein that plays a significant role in human sperm function, particularly in the process of fertilization. The protein is involved in sperm capacitation, a maturation process that sperm undergo to gain the ability to fertilize an egg. During capacitation, C1orf56 translocates to the sperm surface, especially in the acrosomal region, and is crucial for the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida (ZP) of the oocyte, a critical step in fertilization (Wang2021Identification). The protein facilitates this binding by interacting with sialyl-Lewis(x) (SLeX) structures, which are important for sperm-egg recognition (Wang2021Identification).

C1orf56 is approximately 39 kDa in size and is localized primarily to the sperm head, particularly in the equatorial and acrosomal regions (Wang2021Identification). It contains a thrombospondin type-1 (TSP1) repeat profile, which is known to be involved in binding multiple matrix glycoproteins and proteoglycans, suggesting a mechanism for its role in sperm-ZP binding (Wang2021Identification). The protein's activity is essential for successful fertilization, as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of anti-C1orf56 antibodies on sperm binding to the ZP and the ZP-induced acrosome reaction (Wang2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
C1orf56, also known as AF1Q or MLLT11, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In cancer, C1orf56 is notably overexpressed in several malignancies, including T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia, Ewing sarcoma, lung small cell cancer, nephroblastoma, and especially neuroblastoma, where it shows extreme overexpression. This suggests that C1orf56 may be activated in cancer through mechanisms such as fusion with the MLL gene or activating mutations, contributing to tumorigenesis (Kilpinen2008Systematic).

In the context of multiple myeloma (MM), C1orf56 is identified as a risk gene associated with poor prognosis. It is described as a proto-oncogene repressed by DNMT3B methylation, indicating its role in tumorigenesis. The gene is part of a 13-gene signature that differentiates MM patients into low- and high-risk groups, with its expression correlating with adverse prognostic factors such as increased infiltration of type 2 T helper cells and decreased NK cell infiltration (Zhao2024A).

C1orf56 also plays a role in sperm function, where it is involved in sperm binding to the zona pellucida (ZP), a critical step in fertilization. Its inhibition can affect sperm-ZP binding and the acrosome reaction, potentially impacting fertility (Wang2021Identification).

## Interactions
C1orf56 is a protein identified as a sialyl-Lewis(x) (SLeX)-binding protein on human spermatozoa, playing a role in spermatozoa-zona pellucida (ZP) binding. It is primarily located in the equatorial region of uncapacitated sperm and translocates to the acrosomal region upon capacitation, which is crucial for ZP binding (Wang2021Identification). The protein's involvement in sperm-ZP and sperm-SLeX interactions is supported by the observation that an anti-C1orf56 antibody inhibits sperm binding to the ZP and the ZP-induced acrosome reaction (Wang2021Identification).

C1orf56 is suggested to be part of a multimolecular structure of sperm ZP receptors assembled during capacitation, indicating potential interactions with other proteins in this complex. However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed (Wang2021Identification). The protein contains a thrombospondin type-1 (TSP1) repeat profile, which is known to be involved in binding multiple matrix glycoproteins and proteoglycans, suggesting a potential mechanism for its role in ZP binding (Wang2021Identification). Despite these findings, further research is needed to elucidate the precise interactions and functional partnerships of C1orf56.
