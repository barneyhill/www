# THAP11

## Overview
THAP11 is a gene that encodes the THAP domain-containing protein 11, a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes, including gene transcription, cell proliferation, and development. The protein is characterized by a THAP domain, an atypical zinc finger motif that facilitates DNA binding, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain crucial for dimerization and function (Cukier2016The; Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). THAP11 plays a significant role in maintaining pluripotency in stem cells and is involved in the early development of the retina, heart, and brain (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). It interacts with the transcriptional co-regulator HCF-1, forming a complex essential for transcriptional regulation and cell proliferation (Parker2012A). Mutations in THAP11, such as the F80L mutation, have been linked to disorders in cobalamin metabolism, while its overexpression is associated with cancer progression, particularly in colon cancer (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L; Parker2012A).

## Structure
THAP11 is a transcriptional regulator characterized by a THAP domain, an atypical zinc finger motif involved in DNA binding, located at its N-terminus (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). The C-terminal region of THAP11 forms a parallel coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for protein dimerization and function (Cukier2016The). This coiled-coil structure is a left-handed parallel homo-dimeric motif, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges, such as those between residues K299 and D300 (Cukier2016The). The coiled-coil domain is highly conserved across species, indicating its importance in THAP11's biological role (Cukier2016The).

The secondary structure of THAP11 includes a high α-helix content, particularly in the coiled-coil region, which spans residues 254-310 (Cukier2016The; Sanghavi2019Classification). This region is involved in protein oligomerization, forming stable dimers in solution (Cukier2016The). THAP11 does not have an activation domain but recruits effector proteins via its C-terminal domain, such as HCF-1, to regulate gene expression (Cukier2016The).

THAP11 is also involved in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in regulating cell proliferation and gene expression (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L).

## Function
THAP11, also known as Ronin in mice, is a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes, including gene transcription, cell proliferation, and development. It contains a THAP domain, a zinc finger-like motif that facilitates DNA binding, allowing it to regulate transcription by binding to specific promoter regions in DNA (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L; Parker2012A). THAP11 is crucial for maintaining pluripotency in stem cells and plays significant roles in hematopoiesis and early development of the retina, heart, and brain (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L).

In healthy human cells, THAP11 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and cellular differentiation. It regulates genes related to cell growth, metabolism, and the cell cycle, and is involved in nuclear mitochondrial-related gene regulation, including components of the electron transport chain (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). THAP11 also interacts with the transcriptional co-regulator HCF-1, forming a complex that is essential for transcriptional regulation and cell proliferation (Parker2012A). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of THAP11 target genes, highlighting its role in chromatin-dependent processes (Parker2012A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the THAP11 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. The THAP11 F80L mutation is associated with a cobalamin disorder, a condition related to vitamin B12 metabolism. This mutation affects the protein's stability and DNA-binding ability, leading to decreased cell proliferation and altered gene expression, particularly impacting the MMACHC gene, which is crucial for cobalamin metabolism (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). The mutation results in reduced MMACHC mRNA levels, contributing to the disorder's phenotype (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L).

In the context of cancer, THAP11 is significantly overexpressed in colon cancer, with higher expression levels observed in primary tumors and metastases compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and survival, suggesting a role in cancer progression. THAP11 acts as a transcriptional regulator, and its interaction with the transcriptional co-regulator HCF-1 is necessary for its function in gene regulation and chromatin association (Parker2012A). Knockdown of THAP11 in colon cancer cells leads to decreased cell proliferation, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (Parker2012A).

## Interactions
THAP11, also known as Ronin in mice, is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. THAP11 forms a complex with the transcriptional co-regulator HCF-1, which is crucial for stable chromatin association and target gene regulation. This interaction is essential for the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and metabolism, such as the MMACHC gene, a key enzyme in the cobalamin metabolic pathway (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L; Parker2012A).

THAP11 also interacts with ZNF143, a transcription factor that recognizes overlapping DNA sequences. The THAP11/ZNF143/HCFC1 complex is recruited to chromatin, with the ACTACA submotif playing a critical role in directing THAP11 and HCFC1 to ZNF143-occupied loci. This recruitment is cooperative, enhancing ZNF143 chromatin occupancy in vivo (Vinckevicius2015Genomic).

In colon cancer cells, THAP11's interaction with HCF-1 is vital for transcriptional regulation, influencing both activation and repression of gene expression. The THAP11-HCF-1 complex is necessary for chromatin binding, and its disruption leads to altered gene expression and decreased cell proliferation (Parker2012A).
