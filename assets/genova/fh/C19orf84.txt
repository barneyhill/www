# C19orf84

## Overview
C19orf84 is a gene located on chromosome 19 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 19 open reading frame 84. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, meaning its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes are not yet fully understood. Despite the limited information on its function, studies have suggested potential involvement in various cellular pathways, although further research is necessary to elucidate its precise mechanisms and interactions. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their potential implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
