# TSG101

## Overview
The TSG101 gene encodes the tumor susceptibility 101 protein, a pivotal component of the cellular machinery involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking. This protein is a part of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) pathway, which is essential for the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the regulation of protein degradation via lysosomes. Structurally, the TSG101 protein is characterized by its ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain and a coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its interactions with ubiquitinated proteins and other components of the ESCRT-I complex (Pornillos2002Structure; White2017Structural). Although initially identified as a potential tumor suppressor, TSG101 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels correlate with tumor progression and prognosis (Liu2018TSG101; Gheytanchi2021High). The protein's involvement in critical cellular processes, such as receptor downregulation and viral budding, underscores its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (VerPlank2001Tsg101; Ferraiuolo2020The).

## Structure
The TSG101 protein is characterized by its ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain and a coiled-coil domain. The UEV domain, spanning residues 1-145, is crucial for binding ubiquitin and the PTAP motif found in viral proteins, such as the HIV-1 Gag protein. Structurally, the UEV domain resembles canonical E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes but includes an additional N-terminal helix and an extended beta-hairpin, while lacking the two C-terminal helices typical of E2 enzymes (Pornillos2002Structure). The UEV domain's structure consists of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and four alpha-helices, forming a UBC-like structure (Palencia2006Structure).

The coiled-coil domain of TSG101 exists primarily as a homotetramer, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, and can transition to a monomeric state. This domain is highly α-helical at low temperatures, with stability influenced by specific residues such as Glu262, Gly268, and His269 (White2017Structural). The coiled-coil domain's stability is sensitive to pH and concentration changes, which may affect the availability of TSG101 monomers for interaction with other proteins (White2017Structural).

## Function
The TSG101 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in endosomal sorting and trafficking, particularly within the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) pathway. This protein is essential for the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are crucial for the transport of proteins from endosomes to lysosomes for degradation. TSG101 is involved in the down-regulation and degradation of cell surface receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), by facilitating their sorting into MVBs. This process is vital for regulating cell signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Babst2000Mammalian).

In healthy cells, TSG101 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in endosomes, where it helps regulate the trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins. It is part of the ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in sorting ubiquitinated cargo proteins into multivesicular endosomes, a function crucial for the downregulation of receptors like EGFR (Ferraiuolo2020The). The protein's role in these processes suggests it may act as a tumor suppressor, although complete deficiency in TSG101 does not necessarily lead to cancer (Ferraiuolo2020The). TSG101's involvement in these cellular processes is essential for maintaining normal cell cycle progression and survival (Ferraiuolo2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TSG101 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high levels of TSG101 are associated with poor prognosis. Down-regulation of TSG101 in HCC cells reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, while its overexpression enhances these processes, indicating its role in cancer progression (Liu2018TSG101). In ovarian cancer, TSG101 is upregulated and linked to poor prognosis, particularly in serous carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinomas. Suppression of TSG101 in ovarian cancer cells leads to growth inhibition and apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Young2007Upregulation).

In colorectal cancer, TSG101 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, including poor differentiation and metastasis. This suggests its potential as a biomarker for colorectal cancer (Gheytanchi2021High). In gallbladder adenocarcinoma, TSG101 overexpression correlates with tumor differentiation and poor survival, highlighting its role as a prognostic marker (Liu2011Identification). Despite its proposed tumor-suppressive role, TSG101's overexpression in several cancers suggests it may function as a tumor-enhancing gene, crucial for tumor cell growth and survival (Zhu2004Reduction).

## Interactions
TSG101 is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in cellular processes. It is a component of the ESCRT-I complex, interacting with various E2 and E3 enzymes, including ring-type E3 ligases and HECT family Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as Nedd4-2. This interaction is essential for the ubiquitination of ESCRT-I subunits, including TSG101 itself, which is crucial for virus budding, particularly in the context of HIV-1 (Strickland2021Novel).

TSG101 binds to the L domain of the HIV-1 Pr55 Gag protein, a key interaction in the viral budding process. This binding is mediated by the PTAP motif in the p6 region of Gag, which is critical for the release of mature virus particles (VerPlank2001Tsg101). The N-terminal UEV domain of TSG101, despite lacking catalytic activity, binds ubiquitin and PTAP motifs, facilitating the recruitment of additional MVB machinery to virus budding sites (Pornillos2002Structure).

TSG101 also interacts with the MDM2 oncoprotein and the p53 tumor suppressor protein. It modulates MDM2 levels by inhibiting its ubiquitination and decay, which in turn affects p53 levels. This interaction forms part of a regulatory loop that influences protein stability and degradation (Li2001A).
