# TMEFF2

## Overview
TMEFF2 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein with EGF-like and two follistatin-like domains 2, a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the brain and prostate. This protein is characterized by its extracellular region, which includes epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and follistatin-like domains, contributing to its role in cell signaling and regulation. TMEFF2 is primarily expressed in brain tissues, where it plays a significant role in central nervous system development and function, and in the prostate, where it is regulated by androgen signaling. The protein is implicated in maintaining normal cellular functions and regulating cell growth, acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and maintaining genomic stability. Alterations in TMEFF2 expression and promoter methylation have been associated with various cancers, including gliomas, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and endometrial carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential prognostic marker (Alabiad2021Prognostic; Xie2021TMEFF2; Gao2020TMEFF2).

## Structure
TMEFF2 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its extracellular region containing EGF-like and two follistatin-like domains. The primary structure of TMEFF2 consists of 374 amino acids encoded by the TMEFF2 gene, located on chromosome 2q32.3 (Gao2020TMEFF2). The protein includes a signal peptide, two follistatin-like domains, an EGF-like domain, a shedding domain, and a transmembrane domain (Huang2017Tmeff2). 

The extracellular domain of TMEFF2 is involved in binding and regulating growth factors such as the TGFβ family, PDGFs, and VEGF, which are crucial for processes like angiogenesis and cancer metastasis (Gao2020TMEFF2). The EGF-like domain promotes phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in ERB-4, indicating functional similarity to other EGF superfamily members (Gao2020TMEFF2).

TMEFF2 also has splice variant isoforms, including a secreted form known as TMEFF2-S, which may play a role in prostate cancer (quayle2006identification). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and localization. The intracellular domain contains a potential G-protein activation motif involved in intracellular signal transduction (Gao2020TMEFF2).

## Function
TMEFF2 encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a role in various cellular processes, particularly in the brain and prostate. It contains an extracellular domain with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like and follistatin-like domains, which are involved in cell signaling and regulation. In healthy human cells, TMEFF2 is implicated in maintaining normal cellular functions and regulating cell growth. It is highly expressed in brain tissues, where it contributes to central nervous system development and function (Xie2021TMEFF2; Gao2020TMEFF2).

In the prostate, TMEFF2 is regulated by androgen signaling, which influences its expression and function. This regulation involves the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2a, linking TMEFF2 to sarcosine metabolism, a process associated with prostate cancer progression (Overcash2013Androgen). TMEFF2's interaction with sarcosine dehydrogenase suggests a role in modulating sarcosine levels, which may be part of normal metabolic regulation in healthy cells (Overcash2013Androgen).

TMEFF2 also acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and maintaining genomic stability, as evidenced by its downregulation in various cancers and its role in suppressing cell growth in glioblastoma multiforme (Xie2021TMEFF2).

## Clinical Significance
TMEFF2 has been implicated in various cancers, including gliomas, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and endometrial carcinoma, primarily through alterations in its expression levels and promoter methylation. In gliomas, TMEFF2 is often hypermethylated, leading to reduced expression, which is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. This hypermethylation negatively correlates with TMEFF2 expression and is linked to increased glioblastoma cell proliferation (Xie2021TMEFF2).

In gastric cancer, TMEFF2 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its decreased expression associated with poor pathological stages and larger tumor sizes. Its interaction with SHP-1, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, is crucial for its tumor-suppressive effects. Lower TMEFF2 expression correlates with increased cell proliferation and decreased apoptosis, contributing to gastric carcinogenesis and poor survival outcomes (Sun2014TMEFF2).

In prostate cancer, low TMEFF2 expression is linked to reduced disease-free survival and is part of a gene signature associated with recurrence risk (Georgescu2019A). In endometrial carcinoma, high TMEFF2 expression correlates with poor prognosis, including lymph node metastases and reduced survival rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Alabiad2021Prognostic).

## Interactions
TMEFF2 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. In gastric cancer, TMEFF2 interacts with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. This interaction is crucial for TMEFF2's function as a tumor suppressor, as it regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and genomic stability. The interaction is mediated through the SH2 domains of SHP-1, and disruption of this interaction impairs TMEFF2's tumor-suppressive functions (Sun2014TMEFF2).

In prostate cancer, TMEFF2 interacts with sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH), which is involved in sarcosine metabolism. This interaction suggests a role for TMEFF2 in modulating sarcosine levels, which are linked to prostate cancer progression. The regulation of TMEFF2 by androgen signaling, through the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2a, further highlights its involvement in prostate cancer (Overcash2013Androgen).

In oligodendrocyte differentiation, TMEFF2 is identified as a weak binding partner of PDGFA, a growth factor involved in cell signaling. However, TMEFF2 does not function as a competitive inhibitor of PDGFRA in PDGFA signaling, indicating a limited role in this context (Huang2017Tmeff2).
