# H2BC12L

## Overview
The H2BC12L gene encodes the H2B clustered histone 12 like protein, which is a member of the histone protein family. Histones are essential components of chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cell nuclei, which packages DNA into structural units called nucleosomes. The H2B clustered histone 12 like protein plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by influencing chromatin structure and dynamics. As a histone, it is involved in the processes of DNA replication, repair, and transcription, contributing to the maintenance of genomic stability. The specific functions and interactions of the H2BC12L gene product are still under investigation, but its role in chromatin organization suggests it may have implications in various cellular processes and potentially in disease states.
