# FKBP3

## Overview
FKBP3 is a gene that encodes the protein FKBP prolyl isomerase 3, also known as FKBP25, which is a member of the FK506-binding protein family. This protein functions as a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) and is primarily located in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including DNA packaging, chromatin remodeling, mRNA splicing, and ribosomal assembly (Blair2015The). FKBP3 is involved in complex protein networks, interacting with proteins such as histone deacetylases and nucleolin, which are essential for regulating chromatin structure and function (Blair2015The). Additionally, FKBP3 has been implicated in neuronal signaling and cancer biology, particularly in the context of lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels are associated with patient prognosis (Wang2022Penetrating). The protein's interactions and regulatory roles in cellular pathways underscore its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states.

## Function
FKBP3, also known as FKBP25, is a nuclear resident peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is involved in DNA packaging, chromatin remodeling, mRNA splicing, and ribosomal assembly, which are crucial for maintaining proper cellular function and gene expression regulation (Blair2015The). FKBP3 interacts with a diverse set of proteins, including histone deacetylases, nucleolin, and protein kinase casein kinase II, indicating its involvement in complex protein networks that regulate chromatin structure and function (Blair2015The).

The protein is also implicated in neuronal signaling, suggesting a role in the nervous system's cellular processes. FKBP3 is known to interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, where it can both inhibit and activate p53 activity. This interaction is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease, as p53 activity is linked to the suppression of presenilin 1 (PS1) levels, a protein associated with amyloid-beta pathology (Blair2015The). The expression of FKBP3 increases with age in the mouse hippocampus, highlighting its potential role in age-related changes in the brain (Blair2015The).

## Clinical Significance
FKBP3 is significantly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues compared to normal tissues, with various datasets indicating higher expression levels (Wang2022Penetrating). This overexpression is associated with poor overall survival in LUAD patients, as indicated by a hazard ratio of 1.55, suggesting that FKBP3 may serve as a prognostic marker in this cancer type (Wang2022Penetrating). Conversely, lower transcriptional levels of FKBP3 correlate with longer relapse-free survival in LUAD patients, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression and recurrence (Wang2022Penetrating).

Genetic alterations in FKBP3, including mutations, structural variants, amplifications, and deletions, occur in approximately 11% of LUAD patients (Wang2022Penetrating). These alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of LUAD by affecting the gene's normal function and interactions. FKBP3's transcriptional levels are negatively associated with several types of immune cells, such as B cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages, suggesting that FKBP3 may influence the tumor microenvironment and immune response in LUAD (Wang2022Penetrating). These findings underscore the clinical significance of FKBP3 in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
FKBP3, also known as FKBP25, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its function in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the FRB domain in the presence of rapamycin, forming a rapamycin-induced heterodimer. This interaction was identified through proximity labeling experiments, which showed that FKBP3 is a rapamycin-binding protein, suggesting its potential association with mTOR or rapamycin-related pathways (Lee2016ProximityDirected).

In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), FKBP3 interacts with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), playing a role in mediating oxaliplatin resistance. FKBP3 regulates the expression of HDAC2, which affects the expression of apoptosis-related genes and the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway. This interaction influences drug resistance mechanisms in CRC cells, as downregulation of FKBP3 leads to decreased HDAC2 expression and increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin (Tong2019FKBP3).

These interactions highlight FKBP3's role in transcription regulation and signal transduction pathways, contributing to its involvement in cellular processes such as drug resistance and protein complex formation. However, specific details on direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented in the provided context.
