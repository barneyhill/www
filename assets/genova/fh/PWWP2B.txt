# PWWP2B

## Overview
PWWP2B is a gene that encodes the PWWP domain-containing protein 2B, which is a member of the Royal superfamily of proteins. This protein is characterized by the presence of a PWWP domain, which is involved in chromatin-associated processes such as transcriptional regulation and DNA repair. The PWWP2B protein plays a crucial role in regulating adipose thermogenesis, particularly in brown and beige adipocytes, by acting as a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex. It interacts with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, stabilizing them at thermogenic gene promoters to modulate gene expression and maintain energy homeostasis. PWWP2B is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue and is responsive to cold exposure and sympathetic stimulation, indicating its involvement in thermogenic regulation. Additionally, alterations in PWWP2B expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Yan2021PWWP2B; Sohn2020RNF43).

## Structure
The PWWP2B protein is composed of 600 amino acids and features a PWWP domain located at the C-terminal region, spanning amino acids 498 to 583 (Yan2021PWWP2B). This domain is characterized by five anti-parallel β-strands, with the Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro motif situated in the β2-strand, which is crucial for protein folding and stability (Yan2021PWWP2B; Qin2014Structure). The PWWP domain is part of the Royal superfamily and is involved in chromatin-associated processes, such as transcriptional regulation and DNA repair, by binding to DNA and recognizing methylated histones like H3K36me3 and H4K20 (Yan2021PWWP2B; Qin2014Structure).

PWWP2B interacts with transcriptional factors, such as ZFP516, and stabilizes HDAC1 and HDAC2 within a NuRD subcomplex, acting as a scaffold for the assembly of the complex into the ZFP516 transcription apparatus (Yan2021PWWP2B). The protein is enriched in brown adipose tissue and is induced by cold exposure and β3-adrenergic receptor activation, suggesting a role in adipose thermogenesis (Yan2021PWWP2B). The presence of splice variant isoforms of PWWP2B, resulting from alternative splicing and polyadenylation, may alter its structural and functional properties (Zhang2018A).

## Function
The PWWP2B gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating adipose thermogenesis, particularly in brown and beige adipocytes. It is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex, where it interacts with and stabilizes histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 at thermogenic gene promoters, thereby suppressing their expression (Yan2021PWWP2B). This action fine-tunes the thermogenic program, acting as a molecular brake to prevent hyperactive thermogenesis and maintain energy homeostasis (Yan2021PWWP2B).

PWWP2B is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue and is induced by cold and sympathetic stimulation. It stabilizes HDAC1 by increasing its protein level and decreasing its ubiquitination, which contributes to its role in dampening thermogenic activation (Yan2021PWWP2B). The protein is localized in the nuclei of brown adipocytes and binds to the promoter regions of thermogenic genes such as Ucp1, Pgc1α, and Cox8b, influencing gene transcription and chromatin architecture (Yan2021PWWP2B).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, PWWP2B is part of a variant NuRD complex that excludes MBD2/3, suggesting a distinct regulatory role in modulating histone acetylation dynamics and RNA Polymerase II dynamics at active genes (Zhang2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PWWP2B gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and metabolic disorders. In gastric cancer, PWWP2B is identified as a novel gene that is downregulated, and its decreased expression is significantly associated with cancer recurrence. This suggests that PWWP2B may serve as a biomarker for predicting gastric cancer recurrence and response to treatment (Sohn2020RNF43). The study also highlights the potential of using drugs like pelitinib as therapeutic agents for cancers with reduced PWWP2B expression (Sohn2020RNF43).

In the context of metabolic health, PWWP2B acts as a negative regulator of thermogenesis in adipose tissue. Its expression is enriched in brown adipose tissue and is involved in stabilizing histone deacetylases, which suppress thermogenic gene expression. Knockout models of PWWP2B show increased thermogenic activity and improved metabolic profiles, suggesting that alterations in PWWP2B expression could impact conditions like obesity and metabolic syndrome (Yan2021PWWP2B). These findings indicate that PWWP2B could be a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing energy expenditure and improving metabolic health (Yan2021PWWP2B).

## Interactions
PWWP2B is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex (NuRD) and interacts with histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing HDAC1/2 at thermogenic gene promoters, thereby suppressing their expression and acting as a molecular brake on thermogenesis in adipocytes (Yan2021PWWP2B). PWWP2B forms a stable complex with NuRD subunits MTA1/2/3, HDAC1/2, and RBBP4/7, but not with MBD2/3, indicating that it defines a variant NuRD complex (Zhang2018A). 

In brown adipocytes, PWWP2B binds to the promoter regions of thermogenic genes such as Ucp1, Pgc1α, and Cox8b, and its interaction with HDAC1 is particularly significant for stabilizing HDAC1 by reducing its ubiquitination (Yan2021PWWP2B). PWWP2B also interacts with the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3, which further supports the stabilization of HDAC1 (Yan2021PWWP2B). 

PWWP2B competes with LSD1 to interact with ZFP516, a transcription factor that activates the Ucp1 promoter, and PRDM16 facilitates the interaction between PWWP2B and ZFP516, although it does not directly interact with PWWP2B (Yan2021PWWP2B). These interactions highlight PWWP2B's role in modulating transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling.
