# UMODL1

## Overview
UMODL1, or uromodulin-like 1, is a gene located on human chromosome 21q22.3 that encodes a large, multidomain protein known as olfactorin. This protein is primarily expressed in olfactory and vomeronasal neurons, suggesting a specialized role in the sensory olfactory system. As an extracellular membrane-bound protein, olfactorin is involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions, potentially acting as a coreceptor or adhesive molecule. The protein contains several functional domains, including WAP, EGF_CA, FN3, SEA, and ZP domains, which are associated with protein-protein interactions, calcium binding, and structural integrity. These features suggest that UMODL1 plays a significant role in maintaining tissue structure and facilitating cell signaling. Additionally, UMODL1 is expressed at low levels in various human tissues, such as the kidney, testis, and fetal thymus, although its specific functions in these tissues remain to be fully elucidated (Di2005UMODL1Olfactorin; Shibuya2004Initial).

## Structure
The UMODL1 gene encodes two major protein isoforms, UMODL1L and UMODL1S, through alternative splicing. These isoforms consist of 1374 and 1246 amino acids, respectively (Shibuya2004Initial). The UMODL1L protein contains several predicted domains, including a WAP domain, three EGF_CA domains, two FN3 domains, a SEA domain, a ZP domain, and three TRANS domains (Shibuya2004Initial). The WAP domain is involved in disulfide bond formation, although it does not conform to the typical consensus sequence, suggesting a unique tertiary structure (Shibuya2004Initial). The EGF_CA domains are associated with calcium-binding and protein-protein interactions, while the FN3 domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and act as spacers for functional site positioning (Shibuya2004Initial).

The SEA domain is linked to O-glycosylation, which may assist in carbohydrate binding, and the ZP domain is likely involved in disulfide bonds (Shibuya2004Initial). The protein also contains four PEST sequences, which are typically associated with rapid degradation, and 16 tandem repeats of a five-amino-acid sequence in its central region (Shibuya2004Initial). The UMODL1 protein is not predicted to be glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored due to the absence of necessary sequences for GPI-anchoring (Shibuya2004Initial).

## Function
UMODL1, also known as Olfactorin, is a gene located on human chromosome 21q22.3 that encodes a large multidomain protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is primarily expressed in olfactory and vomeronasal neurons, suggesting a specialized role in the sensory olfactory system. It is an extracellular membrane-bound molecule, potentially acting as a coreceptor or adhesive molecule for neurophilic interactions, and is involved in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions (Di2005UMODL1Olfactorin).

UMODL1 contains several domains, including EMI, WAP, FNIII, SEA, and ZP domains, which are associated with multimerization, protein-protein interactions, and O-glycosylation. These domains suggest roles in structural integrity and cellular adhesion (Di2005UMODL1Olfactorin). The protein is predicted to be secreted but remains anchored to the cell membrane, indicating its involvement in maintaining tissue structure and facilitating cell signaling (Di2005UMODL1Olfactorin).

In addition to its role in the olfactory system, UMODL1 is expressed in various human tissues, including the kidney, testis, and fetal thymus, although at low levels. Its specific functions in these tissues remain unclear, but its structural features imply potential roles in protein interactions and cellular processes (Shibuya2004Initial).

## Clinical Significance
The UMODL1 gene, also known as olfactorin, has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels or interactions. In the context of reproductive health, overexpression of UMODL1 in transgenic mice leads to accelerated follicle depletion and ovarian degeneration, resulting in premature ovarian failure. This is characterized by increased apoptosis in oocytes and granulosa cells, as well as abnormal adipogenesis in the ovaries (Wang2012Overexpression). 

In cancer, UMODL1 is highly expressed in Her-2 positive breast cancer and is associated with increased tumor proliferation and resistance to trastuzumab, a common treatment for this cancer type. High UMODL1 expression correlates with poor survival outcomes and increased recurrence risk in breast cancer patients (Yu2024The). 

UMODL1 is also linked to Down syndrome, as it is located on chromosome 21q22.3, a region associated with this condition. Some Down syndrome patients exhibit olfactory dysfunction and reduced fertility, which may be related to UMODL1 expression (Wang2012Overexpression). 

While UMODL1 polymorphisms were investigated for their role in high myopia, significant associations were not confirmed in a Han Chinese population (Zhu2012Investigating).

## Interactions
UMODL1, also known as olfactorin, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In Her-2 positive breast cancer, UMODL1 interacts with Her-2 heterodimers, promoting tumor growth by upregulating Her-2 expression and activating downstream signaling pathways. This interaction contributes to trastuzumab resistance, a common therapeutic challenge in this cancer subtype (Yu2024The).

UMODL1 also shares structural similarities with anosmin-1, particularly in the WAP and FNIII domains, which mediate interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) complexes. These interactions are crucial for the chemotropic effects on GN11 cells and the migration of GnRH neurons, primarily mediated by FGFR1 (Di2022Anosmin1Like).

In zebrafish, UMODL1 interacts with the FGFR1-FGF2 complex, similar to anosmin-1, with the WAP domain forming ionic contacts with FGFR1 and FGF2. This interaction is essential for the proper development and migration of GnRH neurons and olfactory axons (Di2022Anosmin1Like). These interactions highlight UMODL1's role in both cancer progression and neuronal development.
