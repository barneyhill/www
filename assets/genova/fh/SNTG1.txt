# SNTG1

## Overview
The SNTG1 gene encodes the syntrophin gamma 1 protein, a member of the syntrophin family, which plays a crucial role in cellular signal transduction. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a PDZ domain, a split pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain, which facilitate its function as an adaptor protein in the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) (Bhat2012Syntrophin). Syntrophin gamma 1 is primarily expressed in the brain, where it is involved in synaptic function and intracellular signaling by interacting with proteins such as diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGK-ζ) (Bhat2012Syntrophin). Its interactions are essential for maintaining neuronal structural integrity and function, linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, and regulating signal transduction pathways (Hogan2001Interaction; Eng2011Bioinformatic).

## Structure
The SNTG1 gene encodes the gamma-1 syntrophin protein, which is part of the syntrophin family involved in cell signal transduction. Gamma-1 syntrophin is a 517 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 58 kDa (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The protein structure includes several key domains: a PDZ domain, a split pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a syntrophin unique (SU) domain (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The PH domain is split into two halves with a PDZ domain inserted between them, forming a unique PH N-PDZ-PH C structure, which is involved in binding to membrane lipids and is implicated in lipid signaling mechanisms (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

Gamma-1 syntrophin interacts with dystrophin and other related proteins, playing a role in cellular synaptic function by regulating the subcellular localization of diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGK-ζ) (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The protein is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum, and cortical neurons (Bhat2012Syntrophin). The structural arrangement of these domains is conserved across syntrophin isoforms and is functionally significant for their role as adaptors in targeting binding partners to specific cell membrane locations (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

## Function
Syntrophin gamma 1 (SNTG1) is a protein encoded by the SNTG1 gene, playing a significant role in the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). This protein is primarily expressed in the brain, specifically in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum, and cortical neurons, where it is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (Bhat2012Syntrophin; Piluso2000γ1-). SNTG1 is involved in synaptic function and the regulation of signaling pathways, as it binds to and regulates the subcellular localization of diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGK-ζ), a key player in cellular synaptic function (Bhat2012Syntrophin).

The protein contains several domains, including PDZ and PH domains, which facilitate its role in recruiting signal transduction molecules to the membrane and regulating intracellular signaling (Bhat2012Syntrophin). SNTG1 is also implicated in cytoskeletal organization, as it is part of the DAPC, contributing to actin stabilization at the membrane and inhibiting actin-activated myosin ATPase activity (Bhat2012Syntrophin). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal cells and ensuring proper cellular communication and function (Piluso2000γ1-).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SNTG1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of breast cancer, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [rs318885] in the SNTG1 gene is associated with suboptimal tumor response to paclitaxel treatment. This SNP may impair breast epithelial cell adhesion, facilitating malignant transformation, or decrease the stability of mitotic microtubules, reducing paclitaxel binding and effectiveness (PerezOrtiz2017Pharmacogenetics). The SNTG1 gene is also downregulated in malignant breast tissue, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for chemotherapy response (PerezOrtiz2017Pharmacogenetics).

In Alzheimer's disease, the SNTG1 gene variant rs16914781 is associated with a delay in the age of onset in individuals carrying the PSEN1 E280A mutation. This variant, particularly in combination with the APOE*E2 allele, can delay the onset by several years, indicating a possible protective role against early onset of the disease (Vélez2018Targeting).

In lung adenocarcinoma, SNTG1 is identified as a high-priority region for further study due to its presence in newly described minimal common regions of genomic aberrations (Job2010Genomic). Additionally, mutations in SNTG1 have been observed in primary pulmonary salivary gland-type tumors, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis (Wang2021Mutational).

## Interactions
SNTG1 (syntrophin gamma 1) is known to interact with diacylglycerol kinase-ζ (DGK-ζ) through its PDZ domain. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal region of DGK-ζ, which contains a PDZ-binding motif. The interaction is both necessary and sufficient for the binding of DGK-ζ to the PDZ domain of SNTG1, forming a stable complex in mammalian cells. Alterations in the C-terminal sequence of DGK-ζ disrupt this interaction, highlighting its sequence specificity (Hogan2001Interaction).

In the brain, SNTG1 is colocalized with DGK-ζ in neurons, suggesting a physiological relevance for their interaction. This colocalization is observed in various brain regions, including the forebrain, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. The interaction is specific, as demonstrated by pull-down experiments where the PDZ domain of SNTG1 specifically captures DGK-ζ from mouse brain extracts (Hogan2001Interaction).

SNTG1 also associates with dystrophin and other dystrophin family proteins, forming part of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DAGC). This complex links the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, playing a role in cellular structure and signal transduction (Hogan2001Interaction; Eng2011Bioinformatic).
