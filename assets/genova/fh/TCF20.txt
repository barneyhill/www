# TCF20

## Overview
TCF20 is a gene that encodes the transcription factor 20, a protein that functions as a transcriptional co-activator involved in various cellular processes. This protein plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation by interacting with multiple transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, thereby influencing gene expression. TCF20 is particularly significant in neurodevelopment, as it is highly expressed in the developing brain, including regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum. The gene is evolutionarily conserved, highlighting its essential role in maintaining cellular functions and contributing to organismal growth and neurological development. Mutations in TCF20 are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder, underscoring its clinical significance (Huang2023A; Vetrini2019De).

## Structure


## Function
TCF20 is a transcriptional co-activator that plays a significant role in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. It enhances the activity of several transcription factors involved in DNA damage repair, epigenetic regulation, protein modification, signal transduction, cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and neuronal differentiation (Huang2023A). TCF20 is widely expressed in human tissues, with increased expression in the developing brain, particularly in the hippocampus and cerebellum, indicating its critical role in neurodevelopmental processes (Vetrini2019De).

In the nucleus, TCF20 interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes and transcription factors such as SP1, PAX6, ETS1, SNURF/RNF4, and AR, influencing gene expression (Vetrini2019De). It regulates the expression of DNA demethylation factors, affecting the methylation levels in the promoter regions of genes associated with neural differentiation (Huang2023A). TCF20 is also involved in the regulation of immune responses by modulating the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells (Huang2023A).

The gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in maintaining various cellular functions and contributing to organismal outcomes such as growth and neurological function (Huang2023A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TCF20 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Schäfgen2016De; Vetrini2019De). Individuals with pathogenic variants in TCF20 often present with a core phenotype that includes motor delay, language delay, and dysmorphic facial features (Vetrini2019De). These mutations can be de novo or inherited and are linked to additional features such as hypotonia, seizures, and neurobehavioral abnormalities (Vetrini2019De).

TCF20 mutations can also result in phenotypic features similar to Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS), including craniofacial abnormalities and sleep disturbances (Vetrini2019De). Growth-related features such as macrocephaly, overgrowth, and tall stature have been observed in some patients, particularly those older than 9.5 years (Schäfgen2016De; Vetrini2019De). The gene's dysfunction is linked to defects in cortical neurogenesis, contributing to autistic-like behaviors (Feng2020TCF).

TCF20-related diseases are often autosomal dominant, with a 50% probability of being present in offspring (Huang2023A). Currently, there is no effective therapy for TCF20-related diseases, emphasizing the importance of prevention (Huang2023A).

## Interactions
TCF20, also known as transcription factor 20, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. TCF20 acts as a transcriptional co-activator, enhancing the activity of multiple transcription factors such as JUN, SP1, and PAX6, which are involved in DNA damage repair, gene expression regulation, and immune response (Huang2023A). It is known to form complexes with the PHF14-HMG20A core complex, facilitating the formation of liquid-like phase-separated compartments at DNA damage sites (Käsper2021The).

TCF20 is paralogous to RAI1, a gene associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome, and the two proteins share several domain organizations, suggesting they evolved from a common ancestor. TCF20 and RAI1 can interact via the zinc-finger domain, indicating potential functional interactions (Babbs2014De; Darvekar2013A). TCF20 also interacts with the estrogen receptor α (ERα), acting as a phosphoserine-specific repressor, which is significant in the context of ERα-dependent breast cancer cell lines (Gburcik2005SPBP).

These interactions highlight TCF20's role in modulating gene expression and its involvement in various cellular processes, including neurodevelopment and immune response.
