# ANAPC11

## Overview
ANAPC11 is a gene that encodes the anaphase-promoting complex subunit 11, a crucial component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by a RING-H2 finger motif, which is essential for its role in mediating interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This process is vital for the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly the transition from mitosis to the G1 phase (Leverson2000The; Chan2001Molecular). ANAPC11 is highly conserved across species and is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with elevated expression levels observed in certain cancer types, suggesting its involvement in carcinogenesis (Chan2001Molecular). The protein's integrity, especially the RING-H2 domain, is critical for its ubiquitination activity, and mutations in this domain can impair its function (Leverson2000The; Gmachl2000The).

## Structure
The ANAPC11 protein is characterized by a RING-H2 finger motif, a type of zinc finger motif crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Chan2001Molecular). This motif is defined by a consensus sequence involving cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate zinc ions, forming a 'cross-brace' structure essential for protein-protein interactions within multi-protein complexes (Leverson2000The; Chan2001Molecular). The RING-H2 domain is located at the C-terminus of the protein and is involved in mediating interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Chan2001Molecular).

ANAPC11 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), contributing to its quaternary structure and catalytic activity (Melloy2019The). The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating a critical role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Chan2001Molecular). ANAPC11 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher expression in certain cancer types, suggesting a potential role in carcinogenesis (Chan2001Molecular). The protein's integrity, particularly the RING-H2 domain, is vital for its ubiquitination activity, as mutations in this domain can disrupt its function (Leverson2000The; Gmachl2000The).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ANAPC11, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the degradation of key regulatory proteins. In urothelial bladder cancer (UBC), ANAPC11 is overexpressed, leading to the degradation of the tumor suppressor protein FOXO3. This degradation promotes cell proliferation and lymph node metastasis, correlating with poor prognosis, higher tumor grade, and worse overall survival in UBC patients (Yan2023The). Knockout studies have shown that reducing ANAPC11 expression increases FOXO3 levels, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in UBC (Yan2023The).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), high levels of APC11 protein expression are associated with poor clinical outcomes and survival rates. APC11 expression is considered an independent predictive marker for CRC, regardless of other known biomarkers and consensus molecular subtypes (Drouet2018Integrated).

In liver cancer, ANAPC11 expression is upregulated by the long non-coding RNA BCAR4, which interacts with miR-1261. This upregulation is linked to increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting ANAPC11's role in liver cancer progression (Zhang2020LncRNA).

## Interactions
ANAPC11, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. ANAPC11 contains a RING-H2 finger domain, which is essential for mediating interactions with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) such as Ubc4 and Ubc5. These interactions facilitate the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, a process vital for cell cycle regulation (Leverson2000The).

In the context of urothelial bladder cancer, ANAPC11 has been shown to interact with the transcription factor FOXO3. This interaction leads to the degradation of FOXO3 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. The interaction between ANAPC11 and FOXO3 has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and GST pulldown assays (Yan2023The).

ANAPC11 is also thought to interact with other subunits of the APC/C, such as ANAPC2, to recruit E2 enzymes and facilitate the ubiquitination process. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of the cell cycle, including the transition from mitosis to the G1 phase (Chan2001Molecular).
