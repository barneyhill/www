# NAALADL1

## Overview
NAALADL1 is a gene that encodes the protein N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase-like 1, a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase. This protein is categorized as a type II transmembrane protein and is primarily expressed in the small intestine, where it plays a significant role in the digestion and absorption of proteins and peptides. Structurally, it shares similarities with glutamate carboxypeptidase II but has distinct substrate specificity, which underscores its unique function in peptide metabolism (Tykvart2015Structural). The protein's activity is characterized by a di-zinc active site, typical of the MH clan of metallopeptidases, and it is subject to extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple splice variants that may influence its function across different tissues (Tykvart2015Structural). NAALADL1 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer, where its expression levels serve as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets (Kim2023A; Chen2024The).

## Structure
The NAALADL1 gene encodes a protein that is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase, sharing structural similarities with glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) but exhibiting distinct substrate specificity (Tykvart2015Structural). The protein, referred to as Avi-NaalL, is composed of 740 amino acids and forms a type II transmembrane protein (Tykvart2015Structural). Its structure includes three distinct domains: a protease-like domain, an apical domain, and a C-terminal domain, which together form a dimer with a significant buried surface area (Tykvart2015Structural). This dimerization is similar to that of the human transferrin receptor and GCPII (Tykvart2015Structural).

Avi-NaalL contains a di-zinc active site center, with zinc ions coordinated by specific residues, and a catalytic acid/base residue, Glu-416, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Tykvart2015Structural). The protein also features an intramolecular disulfide bridge and several potential N-glycosylation sites (Tykvart2015Structural). The presence of a cis peptide bond between Asp-378 and Pro-379 is noted, a characteristic of bimetallic peptidases (Tykvart2015Structural). The NAALADL1 gene is subject to extensive alternative splicing, resulting in more than 15 different splice variants (Tykvart2015Structural).

## Function
The NAALADL1 gene encodes a protein known as N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase-like protein (NAALADase L), which functions as a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase. This protein is primarily expressed in the small intestine, where it plays a crucial role in the final stages of protein and peptide digestion and absorption. NAALADase L exhibits aminopeptidase activity, processing peptide substrates from the N terminus, which is essential for the breakdown of dietary proteins into absorbable amino acids (Tykvart2015Structural).

Structurally, NAALADase L is a type II transmembrane protein consisting of 740 amino acids and belongs to the M28B metallopeptidase subfamily. It shares structural similarities with glutamate carboxypeptidase II but has distinct substrate specificity, indicating a unique role in peptide metabolism (Tykvart2015Structural). The protein's activity is characterized by a di-zinc active site, which is typical of the MH clan of metallopeptidases (Tykvart2015Structural).

The expression of NAALADL1 is subject to extensive alternative splicing, which may regulate its function and expression in different tissues, although its primary activity is observed in the small intestine (Tykvart2015Structural).

## Clinical Significance
NAALADL1 has been identified as a gene with significant clinical implications in various cancers. In uterine leiomyosarcoma, NAALADL1 exhibits high variability in expression compared to normal uterine tissue and leiomyoma samples, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for distinguishing between these conditions (Kim2023A). The gene's expression is also upregulated in neuroendocrine prostate cancer, indicating its role in cancer progression (Kim2023A).

In dedifferentiated liposarcoma, NAALADL1 is part of a five-gene signature used to predict patient risk and prognosis. This signature has been validated as an independent prognostic factor, highlighting the gene's involvement in influencing the tumor immune microenvironment and patient outcomes (Chen2024The).

Additionally, NAALADL1 is associated with cancer stem cell features in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is linked to the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This association suggests that NAALADL1 may play a role in regulating cancer stem cells and could be a target for therapeutic intervention (Chen2022Clinicopathological).

Overall, alterations in NAALADL1 expression are linked to various cancer types, underscoring its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NAALADL1, a gene encoding a protein with significant structural similarity to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), is involved in various protein interactions. The protein product of NAALADL1 shares a di-zinc active site center with conserved zinc-coordinating amino acids, similar to other metallopeptidases in the MH clan (family M28) (Tykvart2015Structural). This structural feature suggests potential interactions with substrates or inhibitors that target metallopeptidase active sites.

Computational modeling has shown that imaging agents such as F-GUL and Ga-GUL bind strongly to NAALADL1, forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with specific residues like Arg198 and Arg539 (Bakht2020Identifying). These interactions indicate that NAALADL1 can participate in binding with small molecules, which may be relevant for imaging or therapeutic applications.

NAALADL1 is also implicated in signaling pathways related to immune responses. It induces acetylation affecting the MYC gene, which in turn activates downstream proteins such as VCAM1 and AVEN, playing a role in cellular responses to pathogens like Candida albicans (Yeh2019Investigating). These interactions highlight NAALADL1's involvement in complex regulatory networks and its potential impact on cellular processes.
