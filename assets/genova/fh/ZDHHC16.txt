# ZDHHC16

## Overview
ZDHHC16 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 16, which is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases. This protein is primarily involved in the post-translational modification process known as palmitoylation, where it adds palmitate moieties to cysteine residues on target proteins, influencing their localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC16 is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a regulatory role in various cellular processes, including the DNA damage response and apoptosis. The protein interacts with other key proteins, such as ZDHHC6 and c-Abl, to modulate pathways critical for cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. ZDHHC16 is expressed in multiple human tissues and is essential for normal embryonic development and organogenesis in model organisms. Its dysregulation has been associated with several clinical conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Liu2024Inhibition; Abrami2017Identification; Cao2016A).

## Function
ZDHHC16, also known as zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 16, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the palmitoylation process, a post-translational modification that adds a palmitate moiety to cysteine residues on target proteins. This modification affects protein localization, stability, and function. ZDHHC16 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus, where it regulates the palmitoylation of ZDHHC6, another member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases (Abrami2017Identification).

ZDHHC16 is involved in various cellular processes, including the DNA damage response, where it interacts with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl. This interaction is important for the activation of the Atm-p53 pathway, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis following DNA damage (Cao2016A). Additionally, ZDHHC16 is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and transcription factor modulation through its interaction with Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (JAB1) (Korycka2012Human).

The protein is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, placenta, and lung, and is essential for embryonic and postnatal survival, as well as eye and heart development in mice (Abrami2017Identification; Korycka2012Human).

## Clinical Significance
ZDHHC16 has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to its role in protein palmitoylation. Alterations in ZDHHC16 expression or function have been associated with neurological disorders, cancer, and other conditions. In the context of glioblastoma, ZDHHC16-mediated palmitoylation of SETD2 is crucial for protecting the protein from degradation, which aids in the DNA damage response and cancer suppression (Liu2024Inhibition). Inhibition of ZDHHC16 has been shown to promote osteogenic differentiation and reduce ferroptosis in dental pulp stem cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for bone regeneration and periodontitis treatment (Liu2024Inhibition).

In zebrafish, ZDHHC16 is essential for the development of the central nervous system, particularly the telencephalon. Knockdown of ZDHHC16 results in malformations and reduced neural proliferation, indicating its critical role in early neural development (Shi2016ZDHHC16). Additionally, ZDHHC16 is involved in the DNA damage response, where its deficiency impairs the activation of the Atm-p53 pathway, affecting cell survival and DNA damage-induced cell death (Cao2016A). These findings highlight the gene's significance in various pathological conditions, although specific diseases directly linked to ZDHHC16 mutations are not detailed in the available context.

## Interactions
ZDHHC16, also known as zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 16, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. One significant interaction is with ZDHHC6, another palmitoyltransferase. ZDHHC16 is responsible for the palmitoylation of ZDHHC6, which regulates its activity and stability. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating a physical interaction between the two proteins (Abrami2017Identification). Overexpression of ZDHHC16 enhances the palmitoylation and activity of ZDHHC6, indicating a regulatory role in the palmitoylation cascade (Abrami2017Identification).

ZDHHC16 also interacts with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl at the endoplasmic reticulum surface. This interaction is notable as c-Abl is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR), and ZDHHC16 plays a critical role in the early stages of DDR, particularly in the activation of Atm and p53 (Cao2016A). The interaction with c-Abl suggests that ZDHHC16 may influence signaling pathways related to DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Cao2016A).

These interactions highlight the role of ZDHHC16 in cellular processes through its involvement in protein palmitoylation and its regulatory effects on other proteins.
