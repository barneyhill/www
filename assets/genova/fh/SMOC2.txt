# SMOC2

## Overview
SMOC2 is a gene that encodes the SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 2, a member of the BM-40/SPARC family of matricellular proteins. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind calcium ions through its extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain, which includes EF-hand motifs, and is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Peeters2018SMOC2; VANNAHME2003Characterization). SMOC2 plays a significant role in bone and cartilage development by modulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, acting as a BMP antagonist (Long2021A). It interacts with several ECM components, such as collagen type IX and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and signaling pathways (Long2021A). Alterations in SMOC2 expression or mutations can lead to various pathological conditions, including skeletal abnormalities and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Long2020A; Lu2019Targeting).

## Structure
The SMOC2 protein is a modular extracellular calcium-binding protein that belongs to the BM-40/SPARC family. It consists of several distinct domains, including a follistatin-like (FS) domain, an extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain with two EF-hand motifs, two thyroglobulin-like (TY) domains, and a unique SMOC-specific domain (Peeters2018SMOC2; VANNAHME2003Characterization). The EF-hand motifs in the EC domain are capable of binding calcium ions, which induce conformational changes in the protein structure (VANNAHME2003Characterization).

The primary structure of SMOC2 includes 446 amino acids, with a signal peptide at the N-terminus, indicating it is secreted from cells. The mature protein consists of 425 amino acids (VANNAHME2003Characterization). The secondary structure is characterized by low α-helix content and predominant β-sheet content, as revealed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (VANNAHME2003Characterization).

SMOC2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which contribute to a mass discrepancy observed during purification (VANNAHME2003Characterization). The gene structure allows for alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms in humans (VANNAHME2003Characterization). The protein's domain organization and calcium-binding properties are crucial for its role in cell-matrix interactions and signaling pathways.

## Function
The SMOC2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein family, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, SMOC2 is involved in the regulation of bone and cartilage development, particularly in the growth plates of endochondral bones. It plays a crucial role in chondrogenesis, the process by which cartilage is formed, and is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes (Long2021A). SMOC2 functions as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist by competitively binding to the BMP type I receptor BMPR1B, thereby inhibiting BMP signaling, which is a critical regulator of bone and cartilage development (Long2021A).

SMOC2 also influences extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions by binding to collagen type IX α-1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are important for its function in the ECM (Long2021A). It is involved in cell-matrix interactions, influencing signaling pathways by interacting with cell surface receptors, and is active in the extracellular matrix, affecting cell adhesion and migration (Long2021A). These activities are crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions and structural integrity in tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SMOC2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In endometrial cancer, SMOC2 is overexpressed in cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is associated with chemoresistance. It enhances the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway by interacting with WNT pathway co-receptors Fzd6 and LRP6, contributing to poor prognosis factors such as pathological grade and depth of myometrial invasion (Lu2019Targeting).

In multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), a missense mutation in SMOC2, specifically c.1076T>G (p. Leu359Arg), inhibits BMP signaling by competitively binding to BMPR1B. This mutation leads to skeletal abnormalities, including short stature and joint issues, by disrupting normal extracellular matrix interactions and affecting growth plate development (Long2020A).

SMOC2 deficiency is linked to impaired bone healing and age-dependent bone loss. In mouse models, SMOC2 deficiency results in dental anomalies and increased bone resorption, which can be mitigated by anti-inflammatory treatments like ibuprofen. This suggests a role for SMOC2 in regulating inflammatory responses during bone repair (Morkmued2020Deficiency).

## Interactions
SMOC2, a matricellular protein, engages in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. It interacts with extracellular matrix proteins such as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), matrillin-3 (MATN3), and collagen type IX α-1 (COL9A1). The wild-type SMOC2 extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain binds effectively to COL9A1, while a mutant version shows significantly weaker binding, indicating that mutations can affect these interactions (Long2021A).

SMOC2 also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), which are involved in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. The mutant SMOC2 EC domain exhibits reduced binding to HSPG, suggesting alterations in its role in BMP signaling pathways (Long2021A). SMOC2 can competitively bind to the BMP type I receptor BMPR1B, inhibiting BMP signaling. This interaction is crucial for its function as a BMP antagonist, as both wild-type and mutant SMOC2 can inhibit BMP signaling by binding to BMPR1B (Long2021A).

In the context of renal cell carcinoma, SMOC2 interacts with integrin β3, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and affecting cell morphology and expression profiles (Feng2022SMOC2). In rheumatoid arthritis, SMOC2 regulates the expression of the motor protein MYO1C through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, involving interactions with transcription factors and mRNA modifications (Liu2022SMOC2).
