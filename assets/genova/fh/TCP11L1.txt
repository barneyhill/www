# TCP11L1

## Overview
TCP11L1 (t-complex 11 like 1) is a gene that encodes the t-complex 11 like 1 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of cell signaling pathways. This protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is implicated in maintaining cellular structure and function, with a notable role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. The protein's influence on the cytoskeleton suggests its involvement in cell shape, division, and intracellular transport. TCP11L1 has been associated with reproductive health issues, such as cryptorchidism, and neurological disorders, including stress-related conditions and brain disorders like schizophrenia and autism. Additionally, its expression has been studied in the context of cancer, although its specific role in oncogenesis remains to be fully elucidated (Quinn2009Reprogramming; Karagianni2022A; Chai2021Rapid).

## Function
TCP11L1 (t-complex 11 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of cell signaling pathways. This protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular structure and function. One of the key biological processes associated with TCP11L1 is spermatogenesis, the development of sperm cells, suggesting its importance in reproductive outcomes. The protein's activity in the cytoplasm indicates its potential influence on the organization and dynamics of the cytoskeleton, which is crucial for cell shape, division, and intracellular transport. By modulating these cellular processes, TCP11L1 may impact the overall cellular environment and contribute to the proper functioning of reproductive cells. The precise molecular mechanisms through which TCP11L1 exerts its effects on cell signaling and structure remain an area of active research, highlighting its potential significance in understanding fertility and reproductive health.

## Clinical Significance
The TCP11L1 gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, particularly related to reproductive health and neurological disorders. In the context of cryptorchidism, a condition characterized by undescended testes, TCP11L1 is associated with impaired spermatogenesis. A study identified a cryptorchidism patient with azoospermia who had a microdeletion at 11p13 in TCP11L1, suggesting a potential link between deletions in this gene and reproductive issues (Chai2021Rapid).

In neurological contexts, TCP11L1 has been identified as a differentially expressed target in mouse models of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), particularly in the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala. This suggests a role in stress-related neurological conditions (Karagianni2022A). Additionally, RNA editing alterations in TCP11L1 have been observed in various brain disorders, including schizophrenia and autism, indicating its involvement in synaptic transmission and signaling processes crucial to central nervous system disorders (Karagianni2022A).

In cancer research, TCP11L1 expression was analyzed in ovarian cancer cell lines, where it showed low expression levels in both microarray and RT-PCR analyses, particularly in non-tumorigenic contexts (Quinn2009Reprogramming). However, its specific role in cancer remains less clear.
