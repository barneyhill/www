# FEM1C

## Overview
FEM1C is a gene that encodes the fem-1 homolog C protein, which functions as a substrate recognition subunit within the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complex, specifically the CRL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for maintaining protein homeostasis by targeting proteins for degradation. The fem-1 homolog C protein is characterized by its structural domains, including nine ankyrin repeats and two tetratricopeptide repeats, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins and its recognition of specific degron sequences, particularly Arg/C-degrons. These interactions are essential for the selective degradation of proteins, thereby regulating various cellular processes. FEM1C's involvement in protein degradation pathways underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Yan2021Molecular; Dubey2022A).

## Structure
The FEM1C protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several domains known for mediating protein-protein interactions. It contains nine ankyrin (ANK) repeats and two tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, which are crucial for its function as a substrate recognition subunit of the CRL2 E3 ligases (Yan2021Molecular). These repeats are followed by C-terminal BC and Cul2 boxes, which facilitate binding to elongin BC and cullin 2, respectively (Yan2021Molecular). The ANK repeats form a U-shaped structure, with a unique β-hairpin fold in the loop linking ANK2 and ANK3, and a TPR-like motif between TPR1 and TPR2 (Yan2021Molecular).

The FEM1C protein specifically recognizes and binds to Arg/C-degrons, with the C-terminal arginine residue playing a key role in binding. This interaction is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and cation-π interactions within an acidic binding pocket formed by ANK3 and ANK4 (Yan2021Molecular). Key residues such as Phe 76, Asp 77, Ser 117, Arg 121, Phe 125, and Asp 126 are critical for this binding process (Yan2021Molecular). The protein's structure allows it to selectively bind to specific degron sequences, highlighting its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Yan2021Molecular).

## Function
The FEM1C gene encodes a substrate receptor that is part of the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complex, which plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) for protein homeostasis. This system mediates the degradation of proteins through ubiquitination, where ubiquitin is attached to target proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome. FEM1C, along with FEM1A and FEM1B, is an evolutionarily conserved substrate recognition subunit of cullin 2-RING E3 ligases. It selectively binds target proteins via specific sequence motifs known as degrons, particularly Arg/C-degrons, directing them to proteasomal degradation (Yan2021Molecular; Dubey2022A).

In healthy human cells, FEM1C is involved in recognizing Arg/C-degrons, which are specific sequences at the C-terminus of proteins that signal for degradation. The N-terminal fragment of FEM1C, including the first seven ankyrin repeats, is essential for this recognition. The C-terminal arginine of FEM1C fits into a negatively charged binding pocket, facilitating high-affinity binding to Arg/C-degrons (Yan2021Molecular). This process is critical for maintaining proper protein degradation processes, which are essential for cellular homeostasis (Dubey2022A). FEM1C is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with other proteins to mediate its functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FEM1C gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by severe developmental delay, absent speech, pyramidal signs, and limb ataxia. A specific de novo missense variant, p.(Asp126His), alters a conserved amino acid in the degron-binding pocket of FEM1C, impairing its ability to bind substrates and potentially leading to synaptic abnormalities (Dubey2022A). This mutation has been studied in C. elegans models, where it affects neuronal function, suggesting a dominant negative hypomorphic allele mechanism (Dubey2022A).

The FEM1C gene is also implicated in various cancers through somatic mutations that affect substrate binding, highlighting its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and protein degradation pathways (Dubey2022A). While the specific diseases associated with FEM1C mutations are still being explored, its involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders and potential links to cancer underscore its clinical significance. Proteomic studies are suggested to identify proteins stabilized by FEM1C mutations, which may contribute to disease pathogenesis (Dubey2022A).

## Interactions
FEM1C is a substrate recognition subunit of the CRL2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by recognizing C-terminal arginine degrons (Arg/C-degrons) in proteins targeted for degradation (Yan2021Molecular). The protein contains nine ankyrin (ANK) repeats and two tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeats, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins (Yan2021Molecular). FEM1C specifically interacts with the C-terminal arginine of its substrates, forming a binding pocket with key residues such as Phe 76, Asp 77, Ser 117, Arg 121, Phe 125, and Asp 126, which are essential for high-affinity binding (Yan2021Molecular).

The interaction of FEM1C with Arg/C-degrons is highly selective, with the protein showing a preference for substrates with specific C-terminal motifs. This selectivity is due to the structural features of FEM1C, including a U-shaped structure formed by a β-hairpin fold, which is crucial for binding the Arg/C-degron (Yan2021Molecular). FEM1C's interactions are not limited to degradation pathways; it also interacts with the Stem-Loop Binding Protein (SLBP), mediating its degradation through distinct degrons in SLBP's N-terminus (Dankert2017FEM1). These interactions highlight FEM1C's role in regulating protein stability and function within the cell.
