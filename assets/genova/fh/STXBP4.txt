# STXBP4

## Overview
STXBP4, or syntaxin binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of membrane trafficking and signal transduction. The protein syntaxin binding protein 4 is categorized as a regulatory protein that interacts with components of the SNARE complex, influencing membrane fusion and cellular communication. It plays a pivotal role in the Hippo signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator of the transcriptional co-activator YAP, thereby impacting cell growth and apoptosis. Additionally, STXBP4 is involved in glucose transport regulation in adipocytes and the maintenance of epithelial integrity by modulating the degradation of key proteins such as ΔNp63α. Its interactions and regulatory functions have significant implications in cancer biology, where alterations in its expression are linked to tumorigenesis and patient prognosis in various cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (Vargas2019Elucidation; Rokudai2018STXBP4; Bilguun2020Distinctive).

## Function
STXBP4 (syntaxin binding protein 4) is involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in the Hippo signaling pathway, where it acts as a negative regulator of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator. STXBP4 forms a protein complex with Hippo pathway components, including a-catenin, AMOT, and LATS, to inhibit YAP activity, particularly under conditions of low actin cytoskeleton tension. This regulation is crucial for maintaining normal cellular functions, such as cell growth and apoptosis, by modulating YAP activity (Vargas2019Elucidation).

STXBP4 also participates in the regulation of glucose transport in adipocytes. It is an insulin-regulated protein that influences GLUT4-mediated glucose transport and functions as an inhibitory protein for SNARE complex-dependent membrane fusion, impacting cellular communication and transport processes (Vargas2019Elucidation).

In the context of epithelial cells, STXBP4 is involved in maintaining the regenerative potential and epithelial integrity by regulating the degradation of ΔNp63α, a protein crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation. It inhibits the APC/C-mediated degradation of ΔNp63α, thereby stabilizing it and contributing to the maintenance of epithelial cells in a healthy state (Rokudai2018STXBP4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the STXBP4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), STXBP4 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting YAP, a key regulator in the Hippo signaling pathway. Downregulation of STXBP4 in ccRCC correlates with YAP activation and is associated with poorer overall survival, suggesting its potential role as a therapeutic target (Vargas2019Elucidation).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), STXBP4 is identified as an upstream regulator of ΔNp63, a protein involved in tumorigenesis. High STXBP4 expression is linked to worse overall and disease-free survival, although it is not an independent prognostic factor. Its expression correlates with ΔNp63 and VEGFR2, indicating its involvement in pathways affecting patient outcomes (Bilguun2020Distinctive).

STXBP4 also plays a role in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) by regulating the turnover of ΔNp63α, contributing to tumor growth and progression. Higher levels of STXBP4 are associated with increased ΔNp63α accumulation, correlating with disease stage and prognosis in SCC patients (Rokudai2018STXBP4).

## Interactions
STXBP4 (syntaxin binding protein 4) is involved in various protein-protein interactions, playing significant roles in different cellular pathways. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), STXBP4 acts as an upstream regulator of TP63 (ΔNp63) and KDR (VEGFR2), forming a distinct cluster independent of other target genes like TP53 and CD274 (PD-L1) (Bilguun2020Distinctive). It interacts with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) to regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of ΔNp63α, thereby maintaining its levels and contributing to oncogenic activity in squamous cell carcinoma (Rokudai2018STXBP4).

STXBP4 also participates in the Hippo signaling pathway, where it acts as a scaffold protein. It forms complexes with AMOT family proteins, a-catenin, and other Hippo pathway components like LATS1, LATS2, and TAZ. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of YAP, a key transcriptional co-activator in the Hippo pathway. STXBP4 inhibits YAP by facilitating its phosphorylation through LATS activation, which is modulated by actin cytoskeleton tension (Vargas2019Elucidation). The WW domain of STXBP4 is essential for these interactions, particularly with PY motif-containing proteins, highlighting its role as a negative regulator of YAP and a potential tumor suppressor in kidney cancer (Vargas2019Elucidation).
