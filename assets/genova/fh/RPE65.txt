# RPE65

## Overview
RPE65 is a gene that encodes the retinoid isomerohydrolase RPE65, a crucial enzyme in the visual cycle, specifically within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the eye. This enzyme is a non-heme iron metalloenzyme that plays a pivotal role in the conversion of all-trans-retinyl esters to 11-cis-retinol, a key step in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of rhodopsin, essential for vision. The RPE65 protein is characterized by a seven-bladed beta-propeller fold and is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation. Mutations in the RPE65 gene are linked to inherited retinal diseases, including Leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa, which can lead to severe vision impairment or blindness. Advances in gene therapy, such as the development of voretigene neparvovec, offer promising treatment options for patients with RPE65-associated retinal dystrophies (Aoun2021Inherited; Sodi2021RPE65associated; Miraldi2018Gene).

## Structure
The RPE65 protein is a retinal pigment epithelium-specific microsomal protein with a complete nucleotide sequence of 3,115 base pairs, encoding a protein of 533 amino acids and a molecular weight of approximately 60,940 Da (Hamel1993Molecular). The primary structure includes potential N-linked glycosylation sites but lacks a signal peptide, indicating it is not a membrane-spanning protein (Hamel1993Molecular). The secondary structure analysis reveals the presence of amphipathic alpha-helices, particularly in the amino-terminal region, which are crucial for its function (Hamel1993Molecular). 

A specific region of the protein, amino acids 107-125, is intrinsically disordered in aqueous solution but forms an amphipathic alpha-helix in the presence of membrane mimetics, suggesting a role in membrane binding (Uppal2022An). This region is highly conserved and contains a palmitoylation site at cysteine 112, which stabilizes the alpha-helical structure and enhances membrane association (Uppal2022An). 

The tertiary structure of RPE65 includes a seven-bladed beta-propeller fold, typical for its enzymatic function in the visual cycle. Post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation are crucial for its membrane association and activity (Guo2007Computational).

## Function
The RPE65 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the visual cycle, specifically in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the eye. This protein functions as a key isomerase, converting all-trans-retinyl esters to 11-cis-retinol, a crucial step in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of rhodopsin. This conversion is essential for chromophore regeneration following a photoisomerization event, which is vital for normal visual function (Miraldi2018Gene).

RPE65 is a non-heme iron metalloenzyme associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where its catalytic activity is facilitated by post-translational modifications such as S-palmitoylation. This modification is necessary for its membrane association and function in the visual cycle (Uppal2019The). The protein is dynamically regulated, with palmitoylation at specific cysteine residues, such as C112 and C146, being crucial for its membrane anchoring and isomerase activity (Uppal2019The).

In healthy human cells, the RPE65 enzyme facilitates the conversion of all-trans-retinol to all-trans-retinyl esters, which are then converted to 11-cis-retinol. This 11-cis-retinol is subsequently oxidized to 11-cis-retinal, which diffuses back to the outer segments of photoreceptors, restoring the visual cycle (Miraldi2018Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPE65 gene are associated with several inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), most notably Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). These conditions are characterized by severe vision impairment or blindness due to the disruption of the visual cycle, specifically the conversion of all-trans-retinyl esters to 11-cis-retinol, which is crucial for photoreceptor function (Stepanova2023A; Cideciyan2010Leber).

Leber congenital amaurosis, a severe form of retinal dystrophy, often results in blindness within the first year of life. It is caused by mutations in several genes, including RPE65, which account for approximately 6% of LCA cases (Cideciyan2010Leber). Retinitis pigmentosa, another condition linked to RPE65 mutations, is characterized by progressive rod photoreceptor degeneration, leading to night blindness and loss of peripheral vision (Sallum2022Epidemiology).

Gene therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for RPE65-associated retinal dystrophies. Voretigene neparvovec, a gene augmentation therapy, has been approved for patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations, demonstrating improvements in visual function (Sodi2021RPE65associated; Miraldi2018Gene). Identifying patients with these mutations is crucial for determining eligibility for such therapies (Aoun2021Inherited).

## Interactions
RPE65 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its function in the visual cycle. One significant interaction is with lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), which regulates the palmitoylation turnover on RPE65. This interaction affects RPE65's membrane association and isomerization activity, which are essential for its role in the visual cycle (Uppal2019The). 

RPE65 also interacts with the Usher 1B protein, MYO7A. This interaction is necessary for the normal localization and function of RPE65 within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). MYO7A facilitates the light-dependent translocation of RPE65, which is crucial for its isomerase activity. In the absence of MYO7A, RPE65 is mislocalized and degraded more rapidly, leading to impaired visual cycle function (Lopes2011The).

These interactions highlight the importance of RPE65's associations with other proteins in maintaining its functional role in the visual cycle, particularly in the processes of membrane binding and retinoid isomerization. The dynamic regulation of these interactions is essential for the proper functioning of the visual cycle.
