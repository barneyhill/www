# NECAB1

## Overview
The NECAB1 gene encodes the N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 1, a neuronal calcium-binding protein primarily involved in intracellular calcium signaling. This protein is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which facilitate calcium binding, a critical function in various cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system. NECAB1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, with significant roles in sensory processing and cognitive functions, such as visual memory and behavioral planning. It is notably active in CB1/CCK-positive GABAergic interneurons, where it may regulate calcium signaling dynamics and influence neurotransmitter release. Beyond its neurological functions, NECAB1 has been implicated in metabolic processes, acting as a negative regulator of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, with potential implications for diabetes, especially in the context of obesity-related insulin dysregulation (Miczán2020NECAB1; Udagawa2023Glucocorticoid).

## Structure
The NECAB1 protein, encoded by the NECAB1 gene, is a 351 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 40.6 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 4.83 (Wu2007EFCBP1NECAB1). Its primary structure includes two EF-hand motifs and an antibiotic biosynthesis monooxygenase (ABM) domain. The EF-hand motifs, located near the N-terminus at residues 30-58 and 64-92, are helix-loop-helix structures that play a critical role in calcium binding. The first EF-hand motif is canonical, with conserved residues essential for calcium binding, while the second motif has variations that may influence its calcium-binding affinity (Wu2007EFCBP1NECAB1).

The ABM domain is situated at the C-terminus, spanning residues 260-322, and its function in NECAB1 is not fully understood, though it may be involved in multimer formation (Wu2007EFCBP1NECAB1). NECAB1 is an acidic protein, and its structure suggests roles in calcium buffering and signal decoding. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could affect its function and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context (Wu2007EFCBP1NECAB1).

## Function
NECAB1 (N-terminal EF-hand calcium binding protein 1) is a calcium-binding protein involved in intracellular calcium signaling, primarily active in the nervous system. It contains two EF-hand motifs, which are crucial for calcium binding, a key function in various cellular processes such as neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity (Wu2007EFCBP1NECAB1). NECAB1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, with the highest abundance in the temporal lobe, suggesting a role in sensory processing and cognitive functions, including visual memory and behavioral planning (Wu2007EFCBP1NECAB1).

In neuronal cells, NECAB1 is involved in calcium signaling dynamics, particularly in CB1/CCK-positive GABAergic interneurons. It is found throughout these interneurons, primarily in somata and dendrites, and is suggested to play a role in regulating calcium signaling dynamics, potentially acting as a mobile buffer or being associated with specific nanodomains (Miczán2020NECAB1). NECAB1's expression correlates with genes involved in vesicular exocytosis, indicating a potential presynaptic function related to Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release (Miczán2020NECAB1). This protein's activity is crucial for neuronal communication and may impact learning and memory processes.

## Clinical Significance
NECAB1 has been identified as a negative regulator of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells, with potential implications for diabetes, particularly obesity-related diabetes mellitus. Alterations in NECAB1 expression, mediated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation, can impair insulin secretion. This is significant in the context of obesity, where increased glucocorticoid signaling can lead to elevated NECAB1 expression, contributing to insulin dysregulation and the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Udagawa2023Glucocorticoid). In diabetic-obese model mice, NECAB1 expression is increased, correlating with reduced insulin expression, suggesting a role in the dysregulation of insulin secretion in obesity and diabetes (Udagawa2023Glucocorticoid).

The interaction between NECAB1 and PFKFB2, a protein involved in insulin secretion, suggests that NECAB1 may inhibit PFKFB2 function, further reducing insulin secretion (Udagawa2023Glucocorticoid). This interaction highlights the potential of NECAB1 as a therapeutic target for conditions related to insulin dysregulation. While the specific diseases directly caused by mutations in the NECAB1 gene are not detailed, its altered expression and interactions are linked to significant metabolic disorders, particularly those associated with obesity and insulin resistance (Udagawa2023Glucocorticoid).

## Interactions
NECAB1, a neuronal calcium-binding protein, is known to interact with several other proteins, primarily through its EF-hand domain. One significant interaction is with Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt 1), where NECAB1 binds to the C2A-domain of Syt 1 in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction occurs even at low micromolar calcium concentrations, suggesting a unique binding affinity compared to other proteins that interact with the C2A-domain, such as syntaxin 1 and VCP (Sugita2002NECABs:). However, NECAB1 does not bind to Syt 1 when the experiment is reversed, indicating a specific interaction mechanism (Sugita2002NECABs:).

NECAB1 was also identified to interact with N-copine, a protein found through an unbiased search, highlighting its potential role in various protein-protein interactions (Sugita2002NECABs:). Despite initial investigations, NECAB1 does not strongly interact with Mint 2, another protein considered as a potential interactor (Sugita2002NECABs:).

In CB1/CCK-positive GABAergic interneurons, NECAB1 is involved in calcium signaling, although its specific physiological functions in these interneurons remain unclear. It is suggested that NECAB1 may play a role in presynaptic calcium dynamics and neurotransmitter release (Miczán2020NECAB1).
