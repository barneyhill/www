# KATNB1

## Overview
KATNB1 is a gene that encodes the katanin regulatory subunit B1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of microtubule severing. This protein is a part of the katanin complex, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell division and the formation of structures such as cilia and flagella. The katanin regulatory subunit B1 is characterized by the presence of WD40 repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions within the microtubule-severing complex. It is particularly significant in the context of spermatogenesis, where it is involved in spindle dynamics and the shaping of sperm heads. Mutations in the KATNB1 gene have been linked to several developmental disorders, including congenital microcephaly and lissencephaly, and its expression levels have implications in cancer and psychiatric disorders (Nakatani2006Genomewide; Liu2023HaplotypeGGGT; Pleuger2016Expression; Yigit2015A; O’Donnell2014KATNB1).

## Structure
The KATNB1 protein is an accessory subunit of the katanin microtubule-severing enzyme complex, which plays a crucial role in modulating the location and activity of microtubule severing (O’Donnell2014KATNB1). The protein contains WD40 repeats, which are known to facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly within the microtubule-severing complex (Yigit2015A). These repeats are located within the N-terminus of the protein and are essential for its function.

The KATNB1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including spindle dynamics and flagella assembly, which are critical for spermatogenesis and sperm head shaping (O’Donnell2014KATNB1). It is highly expressed in meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells, with significant localization in the manchette, a structure required for sperm head shaping (O’Donnell2014KATNB1).

Although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of KATNB1 are not provided, the presence of WD40 repeats suggests a role in structural stability and interaction with other proteins. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the available context. Splice variant isoforms of KATNB1 may exist, potentially altering its function or localization, but specific isoforms are not described in the context.

## Function
The KATNB1 gene encodes the regulatory B-subunit (p80) of the katanin complex, which plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics during human spermatogenesis. KATNB1 is expressed in germ cells of the testis, particularly in spermatocytes and spermatids, and is involved in the formation of intercellular bridges in spermatogonia, which are essential for sharing cytoplasmic molecules and ensuring synchronous cell division (Pleuger2016Expression). The katanin complex, consisting of the enzymatic A-subunit (p60) and the regulatory B-subunit (p80), is essential for microtubule severing, a process critical for cell division and the formation of structures like cilia and flagella (Pleuger2016Expression).

KATNB1 is involved in spindle formation during meiosis, being detected in type B spermatogonia and pachytene spermatocytes, and is associated with the cleaving centriole before the first meiotic division (Pleuger2016Expression). In haploid germ cells, KATNB1 is involved in the formation of the manchette and sperm head shape, as well as the correct formation of the flagellum (Pleuger2016Expression). The protein is localized in the Golgi apparatus and associated with the dividing centriole, indicating its role in targeting the enzymatic p60 subunit to the microtubule organizing center for spindle apparatus formation during meiosis (Pleuger2016Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KATNB1 gene are associated with a syndrome characterized by congenital microcephaly, lissencephaly, short stature, polysyndactyly, and dental anomalies. A specific homozygous acceptor splice-site mutation in KATNB1 leads to a complete loss of the natural acceptor splice-site, resulting in either a frame-shift and premature protein truncation or complete skipping of exon 7. Both outcomes likely result in a complete loss of KATNB1 function, contributing to the observed clinical features (Yigit2015A).

In the context of cancer, alterations in KATNB1 expression have been linked to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Up-regulation of katanin P80, encoded by KATNB1 mRNA, correlates with larger tumor size and lymph node metastasis in NSCLC patients. The MALAT1/miR-328/KATNB1 signaling pathway plays a role in this process, where miR-328 suppresses the expression of MALAT1 and KATNB1, affecting tumor and lymph node size. Patients with the GGGT genotype of MALAT1 exhibit decreased KATNB1 expression, which is associated with reduced tumor and lymph node size in brain metastatic lung cancer (Liu2023HaplotypeGGGT).

KATNB1 is also upregulated in bipolar I disorder, suggesting a potential role in neuronal network perturbation associated with the disorder (Nakatani2006Genomewide).

## Interactions
KATNB1, the regulatory subunit of the katanin complex, plays a crucial role in microtubule severing and dynamics. It interacts with the enzymatic p60 subunit, encoded by KATNA1, to form the katanin complex, which is essential for microtubule severing during cell division processes such as mitosis and meiosis (Pleuger2016Expression). KATNB1 targets the p60 subunit to the centrosome, modulating its severing activity, which is critical for spindle apparatus formation and the assembly of microtubule-based structures (Pleuger2016Expression).

In the mouse testis, KATNB1 interacts with components of the dynactin complex, a cofactor for cytoplasmic dynein involved in microtubule-based cargo transport (Dunleavy2022Male). This interaction suggests a role in regulating microtubule dynamics and transport processes. KATNB1 also shares 48 candidate interacting proteins with KATNA1 and KATNAL1, indicating similar functions among these proteins (Dunleavy2022Male).

KATNB1 is involved in the formation of the manchette and sperm head shape, as well as the correct formation of the flagellum, through its interactions with microtubule-based structures in developing male germ cells (Pleuger2016Expression; O’Donnell2014KATNB1).
