# NPS

## Overview
The NPS gene encodes the neuropeptide S (NPS), a small peptide that functions as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. NPS is primarily involved in modulating arousal, anxiety, and wakefulness through its interaction with the neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), a G protein-coupled receptor (Reinscheid2005Pharmacological). The NPS peptide is characterized by a conserved sequence that is crucial for its binding and activation of NPSR, influencing intracellular signaling pathways such as calcium mobilization and cyclic AMP formation (Pape2010Neuropeptide; Guerrini2010Neurobiology). The gene and its receptor are implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including anxiety modulation, memory extinction, and respiratory and neuropsychiatric disorders (Acevedo2017Neuropeptide; Reinscheid2021Neandertal).

## Structure
The Neuropeptide S (NPS) in humans is a peptide with the primary sequence SFRNGVGTGMKKTSFQRAKS. This sequence is highly conserved, particularly at the N-terminus, which is crucial for receptor binding and activation (Guerrini2010Neurobiology; Reinscheid2007Phylogenetic). The NPS precursor protein includes a hydrophobic signal peptide and basic residues that facilitate proteolytic cleavage to produce the mature peptide (Reinscheid2005Neuropeptide).

The secondary structure of NPS is not explicitly detailed, but it is suggested that the peptide may adopt a disordered conformation in water and potentially form a stable alpha helix upon binding to its receptor, NPSR (Guerrini2010Neurobiology). The presence of flexible glycine residues at positions 5, 7, and 9 is thought to contribute to this conformational flexibility (Guerrini2010Neurobiology).

There is no detailed information on the tertiary or quaternary structures of NPS, nor are specific domains or prominent folds described in the available literature. The peptide's activity is influenced by specific amino acid residues, with modifications at certain positions affecting its potency and efficacy (Guerrini2010Neurobiology). The NPS receptor, NPSR, is a G protein-coupled receptor with several splice variants, but specific isoforms of the NPS peptide itself are not mentioned (Guerrini2010Neurobiology).

## Function
Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a peptide that functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain, primarily influencing arousal, anxiety, and wakefulness. NPS exerts its effects by binding to the NPS receptor (NPSR), a G protein-coupled receptor, which is widely expressed in the brain and certain endocrine tissues (Reinscheid2005Pharmacological). This interaction leads to the mobilization of intracellular calcium and the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which are critical signaling pathways that affect neuronal activity and behavior (Pape2010Neuropeptide; Guerrini2010Neurobiology).

In the brain, NPS is involved in modulating synaptic activity and neurotransmitter release, particularly in the amygdala, where it affects glutamatergic transmission. This modulation plays a role in anxiety and memory extinction (Guerrini2010Neurobiology). NPS also produces anxiolytic-like effects, stimulates locomotor activity, and promotes arousal, suggesting its role as an activating anxiolytic in the brain (Guerrini2010Neurobiology).

NPS is expressed in specific brain regions, such as the locus coeruleus, and is associated with excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate (Guerrini2010Neurobiology). The NPSR is predominantly located in areas involved in fear processing and sleep-wake modulation, indicating its involvement in regulating emotional and physiological homeostasis (Pape2010Neuropeptide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPS gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. The NPS system, which includes the NPS gene and its receptor NPSR1, plays a role in modulating anxiety, stress, and immune responses. Genetic variations in the NPS gene, such as the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4751440, have been linked to asthma. This particular SNP results in a Val(6)Leu substitution, which is associated with reduced bioactivity and a decreased risk of childhood asthma (Acevedo2017Neuropeptide). The presence of certain alleles in NPS and NPSR1 can modify asthma risk, suggesting a complex interaction between these genetic variants (Acevedo2017Neuropeptide).

The NPS system is also implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions. The SNP rs324981 in NPSR1, which results in an Asn(107)Ile substitution, is associated with panic disorder, anxiety, and other stress-related phenotypes. The ancestral T-allele of this SNP is often linked to disease phenotypes, while the derived A-allele is considered protective, except in schizophrenia (Reinscheid2021Neandertal). These genetic associations highlight the clinical significance of the NPS system in both respiratory and mental health disorders.
