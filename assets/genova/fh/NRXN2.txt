# NRXN2

## Overview
NRXN2 is a gene that encodes the protein neurexin 2, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule integral to synaptic function and plasticity. Neurexin 2 is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is involved in the formation and maintenance of synaptic connections by interacting with various postsynaptic partners, such as neuroligins and GABA A receptors. The gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its diverse functional roles in the nervous system. These isoforms are differentially expressed and regulated, playing critical roles in synapse assembly, neurotransmitter release, and the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain (Reissner2013Neurexins; Südhof2017Synaptic). Mutations and alterations in NRXN2 have been associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Rochtus2019Mutations; Tromp2020Neurexins).

## Structure
Neurexin 2 (NRXN2) is a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes multiple domains and extensive alternative splicing. The primary structure of NRXN2 consists of a long polypeptide chain that can be alternatively spliced to produce numerous isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Reissner2013Neurexins; Khoja2023Advances). 

The secondary structure of NRXN2 includes beta-sheets and alpha-helices, forming specific domains such as the Laminin-Neurexin-Sex hormone-binding globulin (LNS) domains. These LNS domains are interspersed with epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains, which are crucial for the protein's structural integrity and function (Reissner2013Neurexins; Südhof2017Synaptic). 

In terms of tertiary structure, NRXN2 features a β-sandwich fold within its LNS domains, which are involved in calcium and ligand binding. This structure is essential for the protein's interaction with other synaptic proteins, such as neuroligins (Gomez2021Neurexins:; Reissner2013Neurexins). 

The quaternary structure of NRXN2 involves its ability to form complexes with neuroligins, which are critical for synaptic function and plasticity (Reissner2013Neurexins). Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, further modulate NRXN2's interactions and stability (Reissner2013Neurexins).

## Function
NRXN2 encodes a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in synapse assembly, transmission, and plasticity. It is involved in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission, which is essential for normal brain function (Khoja2023Advances). Neurexins, including NRXN2, regulate synapse properties through differential binding to various postsynaptic ligands, such as neuroligins, cerebellin/GluD complexes, and latrophilins, shaping the input/output relations of neural circuits (Südhof2017Synaptic).

NRXN2 undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in numerous isoforms that are differentially expressed in the brain. This splicing is regulated by neuronal activity and involves RNA-binding proteins and histone modifications, suggesting a role in synaptic specification and neural circuit logic (Südhof2017Synaptic). NRXN2α, a specific isoform, is involved in GABAergic synapse assembly and interacts with neuroligin 2, indicating its role in synapse formation and neurotransmitter release (Harkin2016Neurexins).

In the developing human cerebral cortex, NRXN2 is highly expressed and associated with axon growth and presynaptic terminals, suggesting a role in early cortical synaptogenesis (Harkin2016Neurexins). It is also implicated in regulating synaptic connectivity by restricting excitatory synaptic connections in hippocampal circuits (Khoja2023Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NRXN2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), mutations in NRXN2, such as a novel truncating mutation in exon 12, have been identified in patients, leading to non-functional proteins that fail to anchor at the plasma membrane and induce synapse formation (Tromp2020Neurexins). Deletions spanning the NRXN2 gene have also been associated with autistic traits and neurodevelopmental delays (Tromp2020Neurexins).

In addition to autism, NRXN2 mutations have been linked to early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) and severe respiratory dysfunction. A case study highlighted a potential digenic inheritance pattern involving NRXN1 and NRXN2, suggesting that mutations in both genes may contribute to severe phenotypes, including respiratory depression and arcuate nucleus hypoplasia (Rochtus2019Mutations).

The role of NRXN2 in schizophrenia is less clear, but the gene's involvement in synaptic connectivity suggests potential implications in this disorder as well (Tromp2020Neurexins). Overall, NRXN2 mutations and expression alterations are significant in understanding the genetic basis of various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
NRXN2 (neurexin 2) is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence synaptic function. It physically interacts with GABA A receptors, particularly the GABA A a1 subunit, forming a tight, specific, and saturable interaction with micromolar affinity. This interaction inhibits postsynaptic GABA A receptors, affecting GABAergic synaptic transmission without altering the kinetics or dose-response curve (Zhang2010Neurexins). Neurexin-2b can bind simultaneously to GABA A a1 receptors and neuroligin-1, indicating a tripartite interaction (Zhang2010Neurexins).

NRXN2 also interacts with neuroligins, although its effects on inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) are independent of neuroligin binding. This suggests that neurexins do not impair inhibitory synaptic transmission by sequestering neuroligins (Zhang2010Neurexins). Additionally, NRXN2 interacts with proteins such as CASK and synaptotagmin (SYT1), which are involved in synaptic function and neurotransmitter regulation. These interactions are crucial for understanding the genetic network contributing to conditions like migraine (AlvesFerreira2021A).

The interactions of NRXN2 with these proteins highlight its role as a master regulator of synapse maturation and function, with implications for cognitive disorders such as autism and schizophrenia (Zhang2010Neurexins).
