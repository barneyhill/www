# SYN1

## Overview
The SYN1 gene encodes the protein synapsin I, a neuron-specific phosphoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of synaptic vesicle dynamics and neurotransmitter release. Synapsin I is primarily localized in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it modulates synaptic function by tethering synaptic vesicles to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby influencing vesicle docking, fusion, and recycling. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes several domains that facilitate interactions with synaptic vesicle membranes and cytoskeletal elements. Synapsin I is subject to various post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions. The SYN1 gene is located on the X chromosome, and mutations in this gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Parenti2022The; Longhena2021An; Cesca2010The).

## Structure
Synapsin I (SYN1) is a neuronal phosphoprotein encoded by the SYN1 gene, characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The N-terminal region comprises domains A, B, and C, which are highly conserved across different isoforms. Domain A contains a consensus phosphorylation site crucial for synaptic vesicle (SV) association. Domain B includes an Amphipathic Lipid Packing Sensor (ALPS) motif, which senses membrane curvature and is essential for membrane interaction (Krabben2011Synapsin; Longhena2021An). Domain C, the largest in the N-terminal region, has a compact structure similar to ATP-utilizing enzymes and is involved in ATP binding, regulated by calcium ions. This domain also facilitates dimer formation and interacts with actin filaments and SV lipid bilayers (Longhena2021An).

The C-terminal region is more variable, with domain D containing multiple phosphorylation sites and binding proteins with Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. Domain E is conserved across 'a' isoforms and is important for presynaptic targeting and SV clustering (Monaldi2010The; Longhena2021An). Synapsin I undergoes various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation, which modulate its interactions and functions (Longhena2021An). The protein's intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) contribute to its ability to form biomolecular condensates, playing a role in synapse organization (Longhena2021An; Hoffmann2023Synapsin).

## Function
Synapsin I (SYN1) is a neuronal phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in synaptic function and plasticity. It is primarily active in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, where it modulates neurotransmitter release by tethering synaptic vesicles (SVs) to the actin cytoskeleton. This tethering is essential for synaptic vesicle docking, fusion, and recycling, processes that are regulated by the phosphorylation state of synapsin I (Cesca2010The). Synapsin I interacts with various cytoskeletal components, including actin filaments, spectrin, microtubules, and neurofilaments, and its ability to bundle actin filaments is influenced by its phosphorylation state (Cesca2010The).

Synapsin I also plays a role in synaptic vesicle clustering, which is crucial for maintaining a functional pool of SVs and preventing random diffusion and fusion events (Cesca2010The). It binds to lipid bilayers containing acidic phospholipids, stabilizing the synaptic vesicle membrane and influencing synaptic function (Cesca2010The). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as Grb2 and SH3 domain-containing proteins, further modulate its role in synaptic vesicle recycling and trafficking (Cesca2010The).

In addition to its role in synaptic vesicle dynamics, synapsin I is involved in synaptogenesis, contributing to the formation, maintenance, and rearrangement of synaptic contacts (Cesca2010The). Its expression patterns correlate with synaptogenesis, and synapsin I-deficient neurons exhibit structural defects and delayed synapse formation (Cesca2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SYN1 gene, which encodes the synaptic vesicle protein synapsin I, are linked to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, and learning disabilities. The gene is located on the X chromosome, and its pathogenic variants primarily affect males, leading to X-linked neurodevelopmental disorders (Ren2024SYN1; Parenti2022The).

Epilepsy is a significant clinical manifestation associated with SYN1 mutations, with seizures often triggered by specific stimuli such as contact with water. These seizures can be tonic-clonic or focal-onset with impaired awareness (Parenti2022The). Specific mutations, such as the c.1067G.A nonsense mutation, result in a premature termination codon, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and reduced synapsin I expression. This disruption contributes to cortical hyperexcitability and epileptic phenotypes (Giannandrea2013NonsenseMediated).

SYN1 mutations also contribute to ASD and intellectual disabilities. For instance, the c.236 C > G/p.S79W missense mutation is linked to non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability, affecting synaptic vesicle life cycle and clustering (Guarnieri2017A). The Q555X mutation is associated with both epilepsy and ASD, causing an imbalance in synaptic transmission and network hyperexcitability (Lignani2013Epileptogenic).

## Interactions
Synapsin I (SYN1) is a neuron-specific phosphoprotein that plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle regulation and neurotransmitter release. It interacts with various components of the synaptic vesicle and the cytoskeleton. Synapsin I binds to synaptic vesicle phospholipids and proteins through distinct domains. The NH2-terminal head domain interacts with the phospholipid bilayer via hydrophobic interactions, while the COOH-terminal tail domain binds to integral membrane proteins, with this interaction being modulated by phosphorylation and ionic strength (Benfenati1989Interactions).

Synapsin I also interacts with F-actin, facilitating the linkage of synaptic vesicles to the cytoskeleton. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent, with phosphorylation at specific sites reducing the ability of synapsin I to bundle F-actin (Bähler1989Characterization). The phosphorylation of synapsin I by various kinases, such as CaMKII and PKA, affects its binding to both synaptic vesicles and F-actin, influencing synaptic vesicle mobilization and neurotransmitter release (Yan2022Crosstalk; Cesca2010The).

Synapsin I's interactions with synaptic vesicles and actin are essential for maintaining synaptic vesicle pools and ensuring efficient synaptic transmission (Longhena2021An).
