# TMEM269

## Overview
TMEM269 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 269, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and maintaining cellular structure. The specific functions and interactions of transmembrane protein 269 are still under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in important cellular pathways and may have implications in certain clinical conditions. Understanding the role of TMEM269 and its encoded protein could provide insights into its potential impact on human health and disease.
