# TTC19

## Overview
TTC19 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 19, which is integral to the function and assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III (MRC cIII), also known as ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. This protein is categorized as an assembly factor and is embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in the incorporation and stabilization of the UQCRFS1 subunit within complex III. The proper functioning of this complex is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process for cellular energy metabolism (Morino2014Exome; Bottani2017TTC19). Mutations in the TTC19 gene can lead to mitochondrial complex III deficiency, resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including neurological impairments and mitochondrial dysfunction (Ghezzi2011Mutations; Bottani2017TTC19). The protein's role in maintaining the integrity of complex III underscores its importance in supporting efficient mitochondrial function and energy metabolism in cells (Bottani2017TTC19).

## Function
The TTC19 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and maintenance of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III (MRC cIII), also known as ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase. This complex is a central component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Morino2014Exome; Bottani2017TTC19). TTC19 is involved in the turnover of the UQCRFS1 subunit, a component of complex III, by facilitating its incorporation and stability within the complex (Bottani2017TTC19).

In healthy human cells, TTC19 functions as an assembly factor for MRC cIII, ensuring the proper assembly and function of this complex (Morino2014Exome). The protein is embedded within the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it interacts with the mature form of complex III after the incorporation of UQCRFS1, indicating its role in the later stages of complex assembly (Bottani2017TTC19). The absence of TTC19 leads to defects in complex III, resulting in neurological impairments and mitochondrial dysfunction (Bottani2017TTC19). Thus, TTC19 is essential for maintaining the integrity and function of complex III, supporting efficient mitochondrial function and energy metabolism in cells (Bottani2017TTC19).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTC19 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex III deficiency, a condition that disrupts the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to impaired ATP production and various clinical manifestations. These mutations can result in a range of neurological and systemic symptoms, including early-onset encephalomyopathy, rapidly progressive neurological failure, spinocerebellar ataxia, and Leigh syndrome (Habibzadeh2019A; Bottani2017TTC19; Koch2015Mutations). Patients with TTC19 mutations often exhibit symptoms such as muscular hypotonia, developmental delay, ataxia, and cognitive decline. Neuroimaging may reveal cerebellar atrophy and lesions in the putamen and caudate nuclei, resembling Leigh or Leigh-like syndrome (Koch2015Mutations).

Psychiatric manifestations, including progressive psychosis and severe psychiatric illness, have also been reported, highlighting the gene's impact on neurological health (Mordaunt2015Phenotypic; Nogueira2013Novel). Gastrointestinal symptoms have been noted in some cases, suggesting a broader spectrum of clinical features associated with TTC19 mutations (Habibzadeh2019A). The variability in symptom onset and progression may be influenced by other genetic or environmental factors (Mordaunt2015Phenotypic).

## Interactions
TTC19 is involved in mitochondrial complex III, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the activity of this complex. Mutations in the TTC19 gene lead to mitochondrial complex III deficiency, which is associated with neurological impairments in humans. Patients with such mutations exhibit symptoms like ataxia, cognitive regression, and muscle weakness, with biochemical assays showing a marked reduction in complex III activity. This indicates that TTC19 is essential for the proper functioning of mitochondrial complex III, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context (Ghezzi2011Mutations).

In a mouse model, the deletion of TTC19 resulted in decreased complex III activity, suggesting that TTC19 is important for the stability and function of this complex. However, this deletion did not significantly affect the stability of complexes I and IV, indicating a specific role for TTC19 in complex III (CabreraOrefice2022Complexome). Despite its critical role in complex III, the context does not provide detailed information about the specific protein interactions or multiprotein complexes involving TTC19. Therefore, while TTC19 is known to be crucial for complex III activity, the precise nature of its interactions remains to be fully elucidated.
