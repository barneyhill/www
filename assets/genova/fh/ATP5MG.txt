# ATP5MG

## Overview
ATP5MG is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase membrane subunit g, a crucial component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex. This protein is part of the F_O sector of the ATP synthase, which plays a vital role in ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. The ATP synthase membrane subunit g is a transmembrane protein that contributes to the structural integrity and functional regulation of the ATP synthase complex, influencing mitochondrial architecture and respiratory function (Gerle2020Mitochondrial). It is involved in the assembly and stability of the ATP synthase dimer, which is essential for the formation of mitochondrial cristae and efficient energy production (Guo2019Arg8). Additionally, the g subunit is implicated in the regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity (Carrer2021Defining).

## Structure


## Function
The ATP5MG gene encodes the g subunit of the F-ATP synthase complex, which is integral to ATP production in mitochondria. This subunit is part of the F_O sector of the ATP synthase, contributing to the formation of a lateral domain crucial for dimer stability and cristae formation (Guo2019Arg8). The g subunit plays a significant role in the structural integrity and functional regulation of the ATP synthase complex, influencing mitochondrial architecture and respiratory function (Gerle2020Mitochondrial).

In healthy human cells, the g subunit is involved in the assembly and function of the ATP synthase complex, which is essential for ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation. It is part of the peripheral stalk, which links the catalytic domain to the membrane domain, facilitating proton translocation across the mitochondrial membrane (Spikes2020Structure). The g subunit, along with other subunits, forms a wedge at the monomer-monomer interface, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the ATP synthase complex (Spikes2020Structure).

The g subunit is also implicated in the regulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), a channel involved in mitochondrial permeability transition. Its absence can lead to a lack of PTP formation, indicating its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity (Carrer2021Defining).

## Clinical Significance
The ATP5MG gene, encoding a subunit of the ATP synthase complex, is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in mitochondrial energy metabolism. Alterations in ATP5MG expression or function are associated with metabolic syndrome-associated cardiovascular diseases (MetS-CVD), which are characterized by metabolic abnormalities leading to oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to cardiovascular dysfunction (Liu2022Potential). The gene is also linked to conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and lung pathogenesis related to PM2.5 exposure (Liu2022Potential).

Research suggests that ATP5MG is involved in immune-mediated pathways and may interact with other genes like COX5A, NDUFB8, SOD1, and MDH2, which are significant in metabolism and immune cell expression (Liu2022Potential). The gene's deregulation is associated with energy metabolism impairment and reduced cerebrospinal fluid production (Liu2022Potential). Additionally, ATP5MG is implicated in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, aging, cancer, and viral infections, highlighting its broad impact on health (Liu2022Potential). The potential of ATP5MG as a therapeutic target for MetS-CVD and related conditions is under investigation, with several chemicals identified that could modulate its network (Liu2022Potential).

## Interactions
ATP5MG, a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, is involved in several interactions within the mitochondria. It physically interacts with the outer mitochondrial membrane-located TOM complex and the inner mitochondrial membrane-located ATP synthase. This interaction is significant as ATP synthase complexes are typically located in crista membranes, which are assembled into rows of dimers along the curved crista lamellae edges (Krakowczyk2023OMA1). 

In the context of a fusion protein, ATP5MG-tFT, it was found to interact with the TOM translocase, a component of the mitochondrial import machinery, but not with the TIMM23 protein of the inner membrane translocase. Instead, ATP5A, a protein of the ATP synthase complex, was found among the proteins co-purified with the ATP5MG-tFT fusion, suggesting that the N-terminal part of the fusion protein reached its destination and integrated into the ATP synthase complex (Krakowczyk2023OMA1).

Additionally, ATP5MG is implicated in RNA-RNA interactions, forming a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network with COX5A through hsa-miR-142-5p and interacting with NDUFB8, SOD1, and MDH2 under immune pathways, suggesting a role in mitochondrial energy metabolism and potential involvement in metabolic syndrome-associated cardiovascular disease (Liu2022Potential).
