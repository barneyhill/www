# EMID1

## Overview
EMID1, or EMI domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the extracellular matrix. The protein, also referred to as EMID1, is characterized by its EMI domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions crucial for its function as a matricellular protein. It is primarily expressed in specific tissues, such as the gastric fundic glands and pancreatic islets, where it plays a role in modulating cell adhesion and tissue architecture. EMID1's involvement in intracellular signaling pathways promotes cell growth and suppresses cell motility, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis. Additionally, alterations in EMID1 expression have been linked to various cancers and other diseases, underscoring its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Li2020Upregulation; Kawata2021EMID1:).

## Structure
The EMID1 protein, also known as EMI domain containing 1, is characterized by the presence of a secreted signal peptide and collagen repeats, which suggest its interaction with the extracellular matrix (Kawata2021EMID1:). It is a glycoprotein, indicating that it undergoes glycosylation, a common post-translational modification that can affect protein stability and function (Kawata2021EMID1:). The protein is a member of the Emu gene family, which includes other proteins like EMID2 and EMILIN1/2/3, all characterized by the presence of an EMI domain. This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its role in the extracellular matrix (Kawata2021EMID1:).

In terms of its quaternary structure, EMID1 can exist as a monomer, dimer, or trimer. Western blot analysis has shown that the overexpressed EMID1 protein is present as a monomer in the cytoplasm and on the dish surface, while it appears as a dimer and trimer in the culture supernatant fraction (Kawata2021EMID1:). The protein's ability to form these structures suggests a potential for complex formation, which may be important for its function in the extracellular matrix. However, specific details about its primary, secondary, and tertiary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
EMID1 (EMI domain containing 1) is a glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning as a matricellular protein. In healthy human tissues, EMID1 is exclusively expressed in the chief cells of the gastric fundic glands and the β cells of the pancreatic islets, indicating its role in specific cellular environments (Kawata2021EMID1:). The protein is involved in intracellular signaling that promotes cell growth by advancing cell cycle progression and suppresses cell motility (Kawata2021EMID1:). 

EMID1 also plays a role in the extracellular matrix, where it inhibits cell-matrix adhesion, suggesting its involvement in modulating cell adhesion and tissue architecture (Kawata2021EMID1:). It is secreted and deposited on the extracellular matrix, where it interacts with matrix components to suppress cell-matrix adhesion, thus influencing cell morphology and motility (Kawata2021EMID1:). 

The protein's expression and function in normal tissues suggest a role in maintaining tissue structure and function, particularly in the stomach and pancreas, where it is persistently expressed (Kawata2021EMID1:). EMID1's unique expression pattern and multifunctionality highlight its importance in cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EMID1 gene have been associated with various cancers, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and breast cancer. In LUAD, decreased expression of EMID1 is significantly linked to advanced stages, metastasis, and poor prognosis. This suggests that EMID1 could serve as a prognostic marker, with its expression levels correlating with patient outcomes (Li2020Upregulation). The gene's involvement in the Notch signaling pathway and its correlation with immune cell infiltration, particularly B cells, further highlight its potential role in the tumor microenvironment and cancer progression (Li2020Upregulation).

In breast cancer, EMID1 is identified as a prognostic marker, with higher expression levels associated with a favorable prognosis. This suggests a protective role against cancer progression (Chen2024Identification). 

EMID1 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), where its knockout in human trabecular meshwork cells resulted in significant transcriptomic and morphological variations, indicating its potential involvement in intraocular pressure regulation (Greatbatch2023High).

Additionally, an EWSR1-EMID1 gene fusion has been identified in urothelial carcinoma, although the biological significance of this fusion remains unclear (Lee2018Molecular).

## Interactions
EMID1 is involved in interactions with the extracellular matrix, influencing cell adhesion and morphology. It is secreted and deposited on the extracellular matrix, where it suppresses cell-matrix adhesion, leading to cell detachment and the formation of multicellular spheroids (Kawata2021EMID1:). This anti-adhesive effect is attributed to EMID1's interaction with components of the extracellular matrix, particularly the basement membrane (Kawata2021EMID1:). EMID1 is suggested to function as a matricellular protein, interacting with cell surface receptors or growth factors to modulate intracellular signaling and with extracellular matrix components to inhibit adhesion (Kawata2021EMID1:).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, EMID1 expression is associated with the Notch signaling pathway, which may play a crucial role in its function (Li2020Upregulation). The study on multiple myeloma also indicates that EMID1 expression is influenced by NOTCH signaling, suggesting a regulatory role in the expression of matrisome-associated genes (Maichl2023Identification). These interactions highlight EMID1's potential involvement in complex signaling networks and its impact on cell behavior through extracellular matrix interactions.
