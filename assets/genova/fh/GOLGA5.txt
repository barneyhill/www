# GOLGA5

## Overview
GOLGA5 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A5, a member of the golgin family of coiled-coil proteins. Golgin A5 is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the organelle's structure and function. As a tethering factor, golgin A5 is involved in vesicle trafficking, particularly in retrograde transport, which is vital for recycling Golgi resident proteins and preserving Golgi polarity (Gillingham2016Finding; McGee2017Golga5). Although golgin A5 is integral to Golgi organization, studies suggest that it is not essential for certain developmental processes in mice, indicating possible redundancy with other golgin proteins (McGee2017Golga5). Additionally, golgin A5 has been implicated in cellular stress responses, underscoring its role in maintaining Golgi homeostasis under stress conditions (Serebrenik2018Targeted).

## Function
GOLGA5, also known as golgin A5, is a coiled-coil protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, a central organelle in the secretory pathway of cells. It is involved in vesicle tethering and trafficking, which are crucial for the proper sorting and transport of proteins and lipids within cells (Gillingham2016Finding). GOLGA5 is located on the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi apparatus and acts as a tethering factor for retrograde vesicle transport, which is essential for recycling Golgi resident proteins and maintaining Golgi polarity (McGee2017Golga5).

Despite its role in Golgi organization, studies have shown that GOLGA5 is not essential for mouse embryonic development, postnatal survival, or fertility, suggesting that its function may not be critical in these processes in vivo (McGee2017Golga5). This indicates potential functional redundancy with other golgin proteins, such as Golgb1, as mice lacking both Golga5 and Golgb1 exhibit phenotypes similar to Golgb1 single mutants (McGee2017Golga5). GOLGA5's involvement in maintaining Golgi homeostasis during stress conditions has also been noted, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses (Serebrenik2018Targeted).
