# MED25

## Overview
MED25 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 25, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in transcriptional regulation by RNA polymerase II. The MED25 protein functions primarily as a coactivator, facilitating interactions between transcription factors and the transcriptional machinery, thereby playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. Structurally, MED25 contains a VP16-binding domain (VBD) and an activator-interacting domain (ACID), which are essential for its interactions with various transcriptional activators, including viral proteins and cellular factors such as p53 and HNF4a (Youn2016Regulation; Milbradt2011Structure; Eletsky2011Solution). MED25's involvement in metabolic pathways, particularly those related to glucose metabolism and lipid homeostasis, underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis. Mutations in the MED25 gene have been linked to several neurological and developmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Leal2009Identification; Figueiredo2014Homozygous).

## Structure
The MED25 protein is a subunit of the human Mediator complex, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Its structure includes the VP16-binding domain (VBD), which is characterized by a seven-stranded β-barrel flanked by three α-helices. This domain features a hydrophobic groove that serves as the binding site for the N-terminal portion of the VP16 transactivation domain (TADn) (Milbradt2011Structure). The interior of the β-barrel is tightly packed with aromatic and aliphatic side chains, and the structure includes a deep furrow lined with positively charged residues and a hydrophobic pocket, suggesting a potential peptide interaction site (Milbradt2011Structure).

The MED25 VBD is distinct from other proteins with superficial structural homology due to differences in folding topology and the presence of a long C-terminal helix (Milbradt2011Structure). The activator-interacting domain (ACID) of MED25, spanning residues 391-543, is crucial for interacting with acidic transactivation domains of viral proteins like VP16 and IE62 (Eletsky2011Solution). This domain is characterized by a high content of basic amino residues, facilitating electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (Eletsky2011Solution). The MED25 ACID domain also interacts with the histone transacetylase CBP, highlighting its importance in transcriptional activation (Eletsky2011Solution).

## Function
MED25 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. In healthy human cells, MED25 primarily functions as a coactivator, facilitating the interaction between transcription factors and the transcriptional machinery. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in processes related to glucose metabolism and lipid homeostasis. MED25 interacts with the transcription factor HNF4a, which is essential for the regulation of genes involved in these metabolic pathways. This interaction recruits the Mediator complex and RNA polymerase II to target genes, promoting their transcriptional activation and contributing to the maintenance of normal insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells (Youn2016Regulation).

MED25 is also known to control VP16-mediated transcription, highlighting its role in specific transcriptional pathways (Youn2016Regulation). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it participates in the assembly and function of the transcriptional machinery. Through these interactions and regulatory activities, MED25 contributes to the broader metabolic regulation and cellular homeostasis, impacting organismal outcomes such as energy balance and metabolic health (Youn2016Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MED25 gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. A homozygous missense mutation (c.418C>T, p.Arg140Trp) in MED25 has been associated with syndromic intellectual disability in a consanguineous family from Northeastern Brazil. This mutation is predicted to be deleterious and segregates with the condition, highlighting its potential pathogenicity (Figueiredo2014Homozygous).

Another study identified a homozygous frameshift variant (c.1778_1779delAG) in MED25, leading to severe developmental delays, distinctive facial dysmorphisms, and neurological abnormalities, including myoclonic epilepsy and polymicrogyria (Maini2020Improving). Additionally, a homozygous mutation (Y39C) in the MED25 gene has been linked to a syndrome characterized by severe intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and congenital eye abnormalities, with a high carrier rate in a specific village due to a founder effect (BaselVanagaite2015Homozygous).

MED25 mutations have also been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B2 (CMT2B2), a peripheral neuropathy. The p.A335V mutation in MED25 is suggested to cause CMT2B2 through a 'loss-of-specific-function' mechanism, affecting nerve function and leading to neuropathy (Leal2009Identification). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MED25 mutations in various genetic disorders.

## Interactions
MED25, a subunit of the Mediator complex, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for transcriptional regulation. It interacts with several transcriptional activators through its activator interacting domain (ACID), also known as the PTOV or ABD domain. This domain has been structurally characterized to interact with transactivation domains (TADs) from proteins such as VP16, p53, and ATF6α, primarily through hydrophobic interfaces (Lee2018Structural; Monté2024Assessment).

The interaction between MED25 and the p53 transactivation domain involves an amphipathic α-helix of p53TAD2 binding to a hydrophobic cleft on MED25 ACID, with key hydrophobic residues playing a significant role in this binding (Lee2018Structural). MED25 also interacts with the ERM transactivation domain, where aromatic residues in ERM are crucial for binding, and this interaction shares a common interface with VP16 on MED25 (Landrieu2015Characterization).

In Arabidopsis thaliana, MED25 interacts with the Dreb2a transcription factor, and these interactions are similar to those with VP16, suggesting overlapping binding sites (Aguilar2014Interaction). These interactions highlight MED25's role in modulating gene expression by bridging transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.
