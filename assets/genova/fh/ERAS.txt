# ERAS

## Overview
ERAS is a gene that encodes the protein ES cell expressed Ras, a member of the Ras family of small GTPases. This protein is primarily expressed in embryonic stem cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal by modulating key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-PDK1-AKT and mTORC2-AKT pathways (Nakhaei-Rad2016The). ERAS is characterized by a unique N-terminal extension that facilitates specific interactions, notably with PI3Kα, influencing cellular processes like survival and proliferation (Nakhaei-Rad2016The). The protein's involvement in the HIPPO signaling pathway further underscores its role in regulating cell development and differentiation (Nakhaei-Rad2016The). Aberrant expression of ERAS has been linked to oncogenesis in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (SuárezCabrera2018The).

## Structure
The ERAS protein is a member of the Ras family of GTPases, characterized by a unique molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of 227 amino acids, with a notable N-terminal extension that distinguishes it from other Ras proteins (Nakhaei-Rad2016The; De2022ERAS). This N-terminal region is crucial for its specific interactions and functions, such as its strong binding preference for PI3Kα, a key effector in signaling pathways (Nakhaei-Rad2016The).

The secondary structure of ERAS includes typical Ras protein features like alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a compact form, enabling its role in cellular signaling. ERAS functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure, which is common among Ras family proteins.

ERAS undergoes post-translational modifications, including farnesylation and palmitoylation, which are important for its membrane localization and function (Nakhaei-Rad2016The). These modifications, however, are not essential for its association with PI3Kα, indicating that other structural features may play a role in its interactions (Nakhaei-Rad2016The). The protein's GAP-insensitivity is attributed to a serine at position 50, a critical amino acid deviation from other Ras proteins (Nakhaei-Rad2016The).

## Function
ERAS (ES cell expressed Ras) is a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining the quiescent state of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by modulating several signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, ERAS is primarily expressed in embryonic stem cells, where it contributes to pluripotency and self-renewal. The protein is involved in activating the PI3K-PDK1-AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Nakhaei-Rad2016The). ERAS interacts specifically with the PI3Kα and PI3Kδ isoforms, leading to the activation of AKT and possibly STAT3, while inactivating FOXO1, thereby maintaining HSCs in a quiescent state (Nakhaei-Rad2016The).

ERAS also plays a role in the mTORC2-AKT pathway, promoting phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO1, which is important for somatic cell reprogramming and may ensure HSC survival by interfering with programmed cell death (Nakhaei-Rad2016The). Additionally, ERAS is involved in the HIPPO signaling pathway, interacting with RASSF5A to regulate the degradation of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator involved in cell development and differentiation (Nakhaei-Rad2016The). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the quiescent state of HSCs by inhibiting proliferation and apoptosis. ERAS is localized in the cytoplasm and associated with the cell membrane, where it interacts with other signaling molecules (Nakhaei-Rad2016The).

## Clinical Significance
The ERAS gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its aberrant expression and role in oncogenesis. In breast cancer, ERAS is expressed in approximately 8-10% of tumors, particularly those with a luminal phenotype and high-grade characteristics. Its expression is associated with distant metastasis and reduced metastasis-free survival, suggesting that ERAS could serve as a biomarker for poor prognosis in breast cancer (SuárezCabrera2018The). ERAS expression in breast cancer cells leads to increased tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, partly through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which may also confer chemotherapy resistance (SuárezCabrera2018The).

In gastric cancer, ERAS is aberrantly expressed and its absence correlates with poorer prognosis, indicating its potential role in tumor progression (Nakhaei-Rad2016The). The gene has also been identified in a USP9X-ERAS fusion in colorectal cancer, further highlighting its involvement in oncogenic processes (SuárezCabrera2018The). These findings suggest that ERAS plays a significant role in the development and progression of certain cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ERAS, a member of the Ras family of small GTPases, is involved in several protein interactions that influence key signaling pathways. In hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), ERAS specifically interacts with the catalytic subunits of PI3K, particularly the α and δ isoforms, leading to the activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC2 signaling axis. This interaction results in the phosphorylation of AKT at S473 and T308, which are markers of mTORC2 and PI3K-PDK1 activity, respectively (Nakhaei-Rad2016The).

ERAS also interacts with RASSF5, a member of the RAS-association domain family, which is significant for the ERAS-RASSF5-MST1/2-LATS1/2-YAP signaling axis. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation and activation of LATS1/2, leading to the degradation of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator involved in cell development and differentiation (Nakhaei-Rad2016The).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, ERAS is involved in the galectin-1-induced Akt phosphorylation pathway. This pathway includes interactions with Src, caveolin-1, and mTOR, which are essential for cell cycle progression and proliferation (Lee2009Interaction). These interactions highlight ERAS's role in modulating various signaling pathways to maintain cellular quiescence and promote proliferation.
