# ZFAND2A

## Overview
ZFAND2A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger AN1-type containing 2A protein, also known as AIRAP. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domain, which is a structural motif that facilitates binding to other proteins or nucleic acids. ZFAND2A is primarily involved in cellular stress response pathways, where it interacts with the proteasome and ubiquitin-related proteins to regulate protein degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly under stress conditions. The protein's role in modulating proteasome activity suggests its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. Alterations in ZFAND2A expression have been linked to conditions such as cocaine use disorder and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zillich2024Multiomics; Singh2024Genomic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZFAND2A has been implicated in several disorders due to its altered expression levels. In individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD), ZFAND2A is significantly upregulated, suggesting a potential role in the disorder's pathophysiology. This upregulation remains significant even after adjusting for multiple testing, indicating a robust association with CUD (Zillich2024Multiomics). The gene is also associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, where it is differentially expressed. This suggests that ZFAND2A may be involved in shared molecular mechanisms between substance use disorders and neurodegenerative conditions, possibly due to its role in brain atrophic changes (Zillich2024Multiomics).

In the context of cancer, ZFAND2A expression is notably increased in leukemia cell lines treated with EF-24, a compound that affects cell survival and proliferation. This increase in expression is linked to the activation of pathways that negatively impact cell viability, indicating a potential role in cancer progression or response to treatment (Singh2024Genomic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZFAND2A in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
ZFAND2A, also known as AIRAP, is a protein that interacts with components of the proteasome, a critical complex involved in protein degradation. This interaction suggests a role for ZFAND2A in modulating proteasome activity, particularly under conditions of cellular stress. The protein is implicated in stress response pathways, where it may influence the turnover of proteins by interacting with ubiquitin-related proteins. These interactions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress by regulating protein degradation processes. The ability of ZFAND2A to engage with the proteasome and ubiquitin-related proteins highlights its potential role in modulating the activity of these complexes, thereby impacting protein turnover and cellular stress responses.
