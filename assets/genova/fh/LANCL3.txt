# LANCL3

## Overview
LANCL3 is a gene that encodes the protein LanC like family member 3, which is part of the LanC-like protein family. This family is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, although the specific functions of LANCL3 remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by LANCL3 is believed to play a role in cellular signaling pathways, potentially influencing cellular growth and differentiation. While the precise mechanisms and interactions of LanC like family member 3 are still under investigation, its expression has been noted in several tissues, suggesting a broad functional significance. Further research is needed to clarify its role in health and disease, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target (Qiu2020aarFDC).
