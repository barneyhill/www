# CCL7

## Overview
CCL7, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 7, is a gene that encodes a small protein belonging to the chemokine family, specifically categorized as a chemokine. The protein product, also known as monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3), plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the chemotaxis of various immune cells, including monocytes, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells, to sites of inflammation or injury (Cheng2014The). CCL7 achieves its function through interactions with chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, and CCR5, facilitating immune responses and tissue repair processes (Cheng2014The). The protein's structure is characterized by a conserved tertiary configuration typical of chemokines, which includes a three-stranded β-sheet and a C-terminal α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bonds (Miller2017Chemokines). CCL7's involvement extends to various clinical contexts, including cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, where its expression and interactions can influence disease progression and immune regulation (MedinaGil2022A; Márquez2021Key; Lalli2015Wholegenome).

## Structure
CCL7, also known as C-C motif chemokine ligand 7, is a small protein involved in immune responses. The primary structure of CCL7 consists of 76 amino acids in its mature form, following the cleavage of a signal peptide from a 99-amino-acid precursor (Chang2022CCL7). The secondary structure of CCL7 includes characteristic α-helices and β-sheets, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Goncharuk2019Purification). These structural elements are typical of chemokines, which generally have a conserved tertiary structure comprising a three-stranded β-sheet and a C-terminal α-helix (Miller2017Chemokines).

CCL7 has a low propensity to form dimers, which is a feature that can influence its antimicrobial activity (Nguyen2012Structural). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its functional conformation (Miller2017Chemokines). While the context does not provide specific details on post-translational modifications for CCL7, it is noted that chemokines can undergo modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, although these are not detailed for CCL7 in the provided context. The context does not mention specific domains, prominent folds, or splice variant isoforms for CCL7.

## Function
CCL7, also known as monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3), is a chemokine involved in the regulation of immune cell migration and inflammatory responses in healthy human cells. It is primarily responsible for directing the chemotaxis of monocytes, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, immature dendritic cells, basophils, and eosinophils to sites of injury or inflammation. This recruitment is crucial for mediating local inflammatory responses and contributing to the body's defense mechanisms (Cheng2014The).

CCL7 exerts its effects by binding to chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, and CCR5, which are expressed on various immune cells. This binding facilitates the migration of these cells to areas where they are needed, such as sites of tissue injury or infection (Cheng2014The). In addition to its role in immune cell recruitment, CCL7 is involved in tissue regeneration processes. It is expressed in response to tissue injury, such as myocardial infarction, where it aids in the recruitment of multipotent stem cells and progenitor cells, potentially contributing to tissue repair and improved cardiac function (Cheng2014The).

## Clinical Significance
The CCL7 gene, encoding the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. A notable genetic variant, rs17735770, located in the 3'untranslated region of the CCL7 gene, is associated with decreased susceptibility to coronary heart disease (CHD). This variant affects the local mRNA structure, influencing the binding site for miR-23ab, which results in increased expression of CCL7. The increased expression may act as an antagonist to the CCR2 receptor at inflammatory sites, potentially impacting the progression of atherosclerosis (MedinaGil2022A).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, CCL7 is part of a haplotype on chromosome 17 associated with a delayed onset of mild cognitive impairment. This haplotype may regulate eotaxin-1 levels, suggesting a protective role in the disease's progression (Lalli2015Wholegenome).

Additionally, CCL7 is involved in inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, where it contributes to leukocyte recruitment and inflammation. Its altered expression is also linked to cancer, influencing tumor progression and metastasis, highlighting its significance in both inflammatory and oncogenic processes (Márquez2021Key).

## Interactions
CCL7, also known as MCP-3, is a chemokine that interacts with several chemokine receptors, including CCR1, CCR2, and CCR3. These interactions facilitate leukocyte migration and are crucial for immune responses. CCL7 binds to these receptors, influencing G-protein coupling and β-arrestin recruitment, which are essential for signal transduction (Allen2007Chemokine:Receptor; Goncharuk2019Purification).

The binding affinity of CCL7 to the CCR2 receptor is significantly enhanced by tyrosine sulfation of the receptor. Disulfated CCR2 peptides exhibit a 36-fold higher affinity for CCL7 compared to unmodified peptides, highlighting the importance of post-translational modifications in receptor interactions (Jen2010A).

CCL7 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on cell surfaces, which affects its localization and function in inflammatory processes. It binds to heparin octasaccharides as a monomer, unlike some other chemokines that form dimers. This interaction is crucial for its activity in vivo, as GAG binding is necessary for effective cell recruitment (Allen2007Chemokine:Receptor; Proudfoot2003Glycosaminoglycan).

Proteolytic processing by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can truncate CCL7, affecting its receptor binding and function. These truncated forms can act as antagonists, modulating inflammation (Allen2007Chemokine:Receptor).
