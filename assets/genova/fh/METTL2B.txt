# METTL2B

## Overview
The METTL2B gene encodes the protein methyltransferase 2B, tRNA N3-cytidine, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the methylation of tRNA molecules, specifically at the N3 position of cytidine, a modification crucial for the stability and proper folding of tRNA, thereby ensuring accurate protein synthesis and cellular function (He2024METTL). METTL2B is expressed predominantly in liver and skeletal muscle tissues, suggesting its significant role in these areas (He2024METTL). The protein functions within the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular homeostasis. Beyond its fundamental role in tRNA modification, METTL2B is implicated in various cellular processes and disease pathways, including its potential involvement in cancer progression, making it a subject of interest for further research in clinical contexts (Meng2024METTL2B).

## Function
The METTL2B gene encodes a methyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the methylation of tRNA molecules, specifically at the N3 position of cytidine (m3C methylation). This modification is essential for maintaining the stability and proper folding of tRNA, which is critical for accurate protein synthesis and cellular function (He2024METTL). METTL2B is expressed at higher levels in liver and skeletal muscle tissues, indicating its significant role in these tissues (He2024METTL). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular homeostasis by ensuring the proper functioning of tRNA molecules (He2024METTL).

In healthy human cells, METTL2B is involved in maintaining anticodon base repair and folding, which are vital for the translation process. The deletion of METTL2B leads to a 30-40% decrease in tRNA m3C methylation, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes (He2024METTL). The gene's function is closely related to its role in tRNA methylation, which is necessary for the accurate translation of genetic information into proteins, thereby supporting overall cellular homeostasis and function (He2024METTL).

## Clinical Significance
METTL2B has been implicated in the progression of ovarian cancer (OC), where its expression is significantly elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues. High METTL2B expression is associated with shorter progression-free survival and worse overall survival in OC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Meng2024METTL2B). The gene's overexpression in OC is often due to gene amplification, which is a common genetic alteration in these patients (Meng2024METTL2B). METTL2B is linked to critical pathways such as RNA metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which are crucial for OC progression (Meng2024METTL2B).

In addition to ovarian cancer, METTL2B shows aberrant expression in various other cancer types, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with prognosis (Wang2022Integrative). In hepatocellular carcinoma, METTL2B is highly expressed and associated with tumor grade, indicating its potential as a biomarker for tumor progression (Weijie2022Clinical). These findings highlight the clinical significance of METTL2B in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

## Interactions
METTL2B is known to form a complex with METTL2A and DALRD3, which is involved in m3C methylation at position 32 of the anticodon loop in specific tRNAs. This complex is crucial for recognizing particular arginine tRNAs, indicating a specific role in tRNA modification (Campeanu2021Bioinformatic; Campeanu2021Multiomics). The interaction with METTL2A suggests that METTL2B may not function independently but rather as part of a larger protein complex that facilitates its methyltransferase activity.

In the context of ovarian cancer, METTL2B has been implicated in a network of protein-protein interactions. Using the GeneMANIA database, a study identified several proteins that interact with METTL2B, including CENPU, MAPK3, METTL2A, and others. These interactions suggest that METTL2B may play a role in various cellular processes through its association with these proteins (Meng2024METTL2B).

While METTL2B is primarily recognized for its role in tRNA methylation, its interactions with other proteins and potential involvement in complex cellular pathways highlight its broader significance in cellular function and disease progression. However, specific details on transient or activating interactions remain less well-characterized.
