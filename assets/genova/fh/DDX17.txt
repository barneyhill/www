# DDX17

## Overview
DDX17 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 17, a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases. These proteins are characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif and are involved in various RNA-dependent processes, such as RNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and transcriptional regulation. DEAD-box helicase 17 plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism, including mRNA splicing and degradation, and interacts with long non-coding RNAs to modulate gene expression. It functions as a transcriptional coactivator and coregulator, influencing cellular processes such as differentiation, immune response, and mitochondrial homeostasis. DDX17 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, due to its involvement in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Linder2011From; Yan2024DEADbox; Zhao2022DDX17).

## Structure
DDX17, also known as DEAD-box helicase 17, is a member of the DEAD-box protein family characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. This protein is involved in various RNA-dependent processes, including RNA splicing and ribosome biogenesis. The molecular structure of DDX17 includes a helicase core composed of two RecA-like domains, which are crucial for its function as an RNA helicase. These domains contain conserved motifs essential for ATP binding, hydrolysis, and RNA binding (Zhang2021DEAD-Box; Linder2011From).

The helicase core of DDX17 is surrounded by variable auxiliary domains that contribute to its diverse functions. The RecA-like domains form a cleft that harbors the ATP-binding site, with RNA binding occurring on the opposite side. This arrangement is necessary for the protein's ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activity (Linder2011From).

DDX17 functions as a transcriptional coactivator for nuclear estrogen receptor-α (ERα), where RNA binding is important for co-activation, although its helicase activity is not required for this function (Linder2011From). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. Splice variants of DDX17 can result in isoforms with different functional properties.

## Function
DDX17, or DEAD-box helicase 17, is an RNA helicase involved in various molecular processes essential for cellular function and organismal homeostasis. It plays a significant role in RNA metabolism, including mRNA alternative splicing, miRNA and ribosome biosynthesis, and mRNA degradation. DDX17 also interacts with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and regulates transcriptional activity by binding to various transcription factors, thereby modulating the expression of downstream genes (Yan2024DEADbox).

In the context of cell biology, DDX17 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, particularly in cardiomyocytes. It acts as a transcriptional coregulator with BCL6 to repress the transcription of the Drp1 gene, which is involved in mitochondrial fission. This regulation is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, which are essential for normal cardiac function and preventing heart failure (Yan2024DEADbox).

DDX17 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences gene expression and cellular differentiation. Its activity is crucial for processes such as cell differentiation and immune response regulation, contributing to organismal development and homeostasis (Samir2022DEAD/H-Box).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DDX17 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), DDX17 is associated with metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It is overexpressed in highly metastatic CRC cell lines and promotes EMT by altering the expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. DDX17 also negatively regulates miR-149-3p, a microRNA that inhibits CRC cell migration and invasion, contributing to cancer progression through the miR-149-3p/CYBRD1 pathway (Zhao2022DDX17).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DDX17 is upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes. It enhances cell migration and invasion by interacting with the transcription factor Klf4, affecting the expression of genes like E-cadherin and MMP-2, which are involved in tumor metastasis (Xue2019DDX17).

DDX17 is also implicated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where it promotes cell adhesion, cytoskeletal changes, and autophagy regulation. It interacts with MYL9 and MAGEA6, influencing cell motility and autophagy processes, respectively (Liu2022DDX17).

In Alzheimer's disease, DDX17 expression is elevated in cellular and animal models, suggesting a potential link to amyloidogenesis (Liu2023DEADBox).

## Interactions
DDX17, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions that play significant roles in cancer progression and other cellular processes. DDX17 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, acting as a coactivator, although its co-activation ability is weaker than that of DDX5. In breast cancer cells, DDX17 activates the Mdm2 promoter and induces its transcription in both p53-dependent and p53-independent manners. It binds with the acetyltransferase p300/CBP and the related P/CAF protein to stimulate Mdm2 gene transcription (Xu2022DDX5).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DDX17 interacts with the transcription factor Klf4, modulating Klf4-dependent targets like MMP-2 and E-cadherin, which are crucial for tumor cell migration and invasion. This interaction is dependent on Klf4's zinc-finger domain, and DDX17's overexpression decreases Klf4's chromatin binding, acting as a negative regulator of Klf4 transcriptional activity (Xue2019DDX17).

In lung adenocarcinoma, DDX17 interacts with MAGEA6, a protein associated with cancer, and is involved in the degradation of AMPK, part of the AMPK-mTOR pathway. This interaction suggests a DDX17/MAGEA6/AMPK regulatory axis that inhibits autophagy and facilitates tumor growth (Liu2022DDX17).
