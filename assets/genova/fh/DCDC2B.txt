# DCDC2B

## Overview
DCDC2B is a gene that encodes the protein doublecortin domain containing 2B, which is part of the doublecortin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of doublecortin domains, which are known to play a crucial role in microtubule binding and stabilization. The DCDC2B protein is involved in various cellular processes, including neuronal migration and differentiation, due to its ability to interact with the cytoskeleton. Although the specific functions of DCDC2B are still being elucidated, it is believed to contribute to the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which is essential for proper cell division and intracellular transport. Mutations or dysregulation of DCDC2B have been implicated in certain neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
