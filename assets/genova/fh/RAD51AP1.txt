# RAD51AP1

## Overview
RAD51AP1 is a gene that encodes the RAD51 associated protein 1, a crucial component in the DNA repair machinery of human cells. This protein plays a significant role in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, a critical process for maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis. RAD51 associated protein 1 is a structure-specific DNA binding protein that interacts with RAD51, enhancing its activity in DNA strand pairing and D-loop formation, which are essential steps in HR. The protein's ability to bind branched-DNA structures and its interaction with nucleosome core particles highlight its importance in chromatin contexts and telomere maintenance. RAD51AP1's involvement in DNA repair and its overexpression in various cancers make it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Wiese2007Promotion; BarrosoGonzález2019RAD51AP1; Modesti2007RAD51AP1).

## Function
RAD51AP1 (RAD51 associated protein 1) plays a crucial role in the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability and tumor suppression in healthy human cells. It enhances the activity of the RAD51 filament, which is vital for capturing the DNA donor molecule and forming the displacement loop (D-loop) during HR. This process is critical for the accurate repair of DNA damage, particularly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle when the sister chromatid is used as a template for repair (Selemenakis2022RAD51AP1).

RAD51AP1 is a structure-specific DNA binding protein with a preference for branched-DNA structures, such as splayed-arm branched-DNA structures and four-way junctions. It binds these structures with high affinity, which is relevant to its role in stimulating D loop formation during RAD51-mediated homologous recombination (Modesti2007RAD51AP1). The protein interacts with RAD51, forming a stable complex that enhances RAD51-mediated DNA strand pairing and significantly increases D loop formation, a critical intermediate in HR (Wiese2007Promotion).

RAD51AP1 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to genomic stability by supporting the HR process. Its function is crucial for the repair of chromosome damage and tumor suppression (Wiese2007Promotion).

## Clinical Significance
RAD51AP1 (RAD51 associated protein 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in DNA repair and genomic stability. Overexpression of RAD51AP1 is observed in numerous cancer types, including ovarian, breast, lung, and hepatocellular carcinoma, often correlating with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Zhuang2020Oncogenic; Liu2022Systematic; Filipe2022Differential). In ovarian cancer, RAD51AP1 is significantly upregulated in both primary and recurrent tumors, and its expression is associated with poorer overall survival and progression-free survival (Zhao2020RAD51AP1; Filipe2022Differential). 

In breast cancer, RAD51AP1 is crucial for the self-renewal of cancer stem cells, contributing to chemotherapy resistance. Knockdown of RAD51AP1 in breast cancer cell lines reduces tumor growth and increases sensitivity to treatments like Paclitaxel (Bridges2020RAD51AP1). In hepatocellular carcinoma, high RAD51AP1 expression is linked to worse overall and disease-free survival, with increased expression in cases with intrahepatic metastasis and major portal vein invasion (Zhuang2020Oncogenic).

RAD51AP1's involvement in the immune microenvironment and tumor stemness further underscores its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Liu2022Systematic).

## Interactions
RAD51AP1 interacts with RAD51, a key protein in homologous recombination, enhancing its activity by facilitating joint molecule formation. This interaction is crucial for RAD51-mediated DNA repair processes, particularly in the context of homologous recombination (Modesti2007RAD51AP1). RAD51AP1 also binds to nucleosome core particles (NCPs) through its C-terminal domain, specifically interacting with histone H3, which suggests a role in mediating RAD51 activity in chromatin contexts (Pires2020RAD51AP1).

In the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism, RAD51AP1 interacts with proteins such as RAD52 and POLD3, facilitating telomere maintenance and elongation. These interactions are essential for the recruitment of these proteins to telomeres, particularly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (BarrosoGonzález2019RAD51AP1). RAD51AP1's interaction with RAD52 is independent of protein-DNA contacts and involves specific domains of both proteins (BarrosoGonzález2019RAD51AP1).

RAD51AP1 is also stabilized by SUMOylation, a post-translational modification mediated by MMS21, which is necessary for its function in ALT telomere elongation. This modification protects RAD51AP1 from ubiquitination and degradation, highlighting its importance in telomere dynamics (BarrosoGonzález2019RAD51AP1).
