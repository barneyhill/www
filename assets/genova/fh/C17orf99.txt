# C17orf99

## Overview
C17orf99 is a human gene that encodes the cytokine known as interleukin-40 (IL-40), a small secreted protein involved in immune regulation. IL-40 is primarily expressed by activated B cells and plays a crucial role in B cell homeostasis and immunoglobulin A (IgA) production, contributing to humoral immune responses. The protein is approximately 27 kDa in size and is expressed in immune-associated organs such as the bone marrow and fetal liver, as well as by stromal cells essential for lymphopoiesis. IL-40's involvement in maintaining gut microbiota balance and supporting IgA responses is underscored by its impact on gut-associated lymphoid tissue in mice. Despite its significant functions, IL-40 has not been widely recognized due to its limited expression and unique structural features (CatalanDibene2017Identification).

## Function
The human gene C17orf99 encodes a novel cytokine known as IL-40, which plays a significant role in immune system regulation, particularly in B cell function. IL-40 is primarily expressed by activated B cells and is involved in B cell homeostasis and immunoglobulin A (IgA) production. This cytokine is upregulated in human peripheral blood B cells upon activation with anti-CD40 antibody and interleukin-4 (IL-4), suggesting its involvement in humoral immune responses (CatalanDibene2017Identification).

IL-40 is a small secreted protein, approximately 27 kDa in size, and is expressed in immune-associated organs such as the bone marrow and fetal liver. It is also produced by stromal cells in the bone marrow, which are crucial for lymphopoiesis, indicating its role in B cell development (CatalanDibene2017Identification). In mice, the absence of IL-40 leads to reduced IgA levels in various tissues and abnormalities in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, highlighting its importance in maintaining gut microbiota balance and supporting IgA responses (CatalanDibene2017Identification). Despite its critical functions, IL-40 has not been widely recognized due to its limited expression in certain tissues and unique structural features (CatalanDibene2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
C17orf99, encoding the cytokine IL-40, has been implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS), IL-40 is significantly overexpressed in the salivary glands, correlating with the degree of inflammatory infiltrate and disease activity. This overexpression is particularly notable in lymphocytic infiltrates and ductal epithelial cells, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of pSS and its associated lymphomas, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas (Guggino2023Possible).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), IL-40 levels are elevated in the synovial fluid and serum of patients, correlating with disease activity and autoantibody levels. The cytokine's expression decreases following rituximab treatment, indicating its association with B cell activity and potential as a biomarker for RA (Navrátilová2021IL40:).

IL-40 is also upregulated in autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Graves' disease and autoimmune hepatitis, where specific genetic polymorphisms in the IL-40 promoter region are associated with these conditions. This suggests a genetic predisposition linked to IL-40 expression levels (Abed2023Serum).
