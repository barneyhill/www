# TMCO2

## Overview
TMCO2 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane and coiled-coil domains 2 protein, which is integral to cellular ion transport and homeostasis. The TMCO2 protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it plays a crucial role in regulating calcium ion balance. This regulation is vital for numerous cellular functions, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell growth. The protein's involvement in maintaining intracellular calcium levels underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on various physiological processes and pathological conditions. Disruptions in TMCO2 function can lead to calcium imbalances, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Selvaraju2020Orchestrating; Varela2021Evolutionary).

## Function
TMCO2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in ion transport and homeostasis. The TMCO2 protein is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it plays a significant role in maintaining calcium ion balance. This balance is essential for various cellular functions and signaling pathways, as calcium ions are pivotal in processes such as muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and cell growth.

In healthy human cells, the TMCO2 protein contributes to the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, ensuring that calcium ions are appropriately sequestered and released as needed. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing calcium overload, which can lead to cellular stress and damage. By modulating calcium ion concentrations, TMCO2 supports the proper functioning of numerous physiological processes, including those related to metabolism, gene expression, and apoptosis.

The activity of TMCO2 in the endoplasmic reticulum underscores its importance in cellular health and function. Disruptions in the function of TMCO2 can potentially lead to imbalances in calcium homeostasis, which may contribute to various pathological conditions. Understanding the role of TMCO2 in calcium regulation provides insights into its broader implications in human health and disease.

## Interactions
TMCO2 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It has been reported to interact with proteins such as DGCR14 and SRRM2, which are associated with spliceosome activities. These interactions suggest that TMCO2 may play a role in regulating spliceosome function, particularly in the testis, where defects can lead to conditions like non-obstructive azoospermia, affecting sperm production (Selvaraju2020Orchestrating).

Additionally, TMCO2 is co-expressed with OXCT2A, indicating a potential involvement in ketone metabolism and the energy metabolism of epididymal spermatozoa. This co-expression suggests that TMCO2 might contribute to the sperm maturational process (Selvaraju2020Orchestrating).

In a broader network context, TMCO2 is part of a subnetwork involving TMEM63C, which is linked to osmolarity regulation and innate immunity. This subnetwork also includes proteins like ARMC7, PAX4, ETS1, and SUV39H1, indicating possible interactions that could influence spermatogenesis and other cellular functions (Varela2021Evolutionary). These interactions highlight TMCO2's potential role in various cellular processes through its involvement in multiprotein complexes and regulatory interactions.
