# TTC38

## Overview
TTC38 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 38, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the TTC38 protein may function as a scaffold or adaptor in various cellular processes. The protein is implicated in the regulation of signaling pathways, particularly the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is significant in cell growth and proliferation. This involvement is especially noted in the context of malignant pleural mesothelioma, where TTC38 interacts with other proteins to potentially facilitate aberrant signaling, thereby contributing to disease progression (Karunakaran2018Mesothelioma).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TTC38, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 38, is involved in protein-protein interactions that may play a role in the aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). TTC38 interacts with proteins such as PRR5, WNT7B, and SCUBE1, forming a multi-protein complex that could be crucial for the activation of this signaling pathway. PRR5, part of the mTORC2 complex, phosphorylates and activates AKT, promoting cell growth and proliferation. The interaction of TTC38 with these proteins suggests its potential role in facilitating the formation of this complex, thereby contributing to the aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in MPM (Karunakaran2018Mesothelioma).
