# HOXD4

## Overview
The HOXD4 gene is a member of the homeobox (Hox) gene family, which encodes transcription factors critical for the regulation of embryonic development and the establishment of body patterning. The protein encoded by HOXD4, known as homeobox D4, is characterized by a conserved homeodomain that facilitates its role as a transcription factor by binding to specific DNA sequences. This binding is essential for the regulation of genes involved in the development of the axial skeleton, particularly the vertebral column, where HOXD4 plays a pivotal role in the formation of the second cervical vertebra (C2) (Zhang1997Elements). The expression of HOXD4 is modulated by retinoic acid, which interacts with retinoic acid response elements in its regulatory regions (Morrison1996In). HOXD4's interactions with other proteins, such as Cdx1, further underscore its importance in developmental processes (Lafontaine2012Cdx1). Mutations in HOXD4 have been linked to developmental disorders, including skeletal malformations and hematological malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance (van2005Mutation).

## Structure
The HOXD4 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved homeodomain, a 61-residue DNA-binding region located in the C-terminal half of the protein. This homeodomain is crucial for the protein's function, as even a single amino acid change can abolish its activity (Rambaldi1994A). The homeodomain typically forms a helix-turn-helix motif, which is common among homeobox proteins, facilitating DNA binding (Rambaldi1994A).

The N-terminal region of HOXD4 is proline-rich and serves as a strong transcriptional activation domain. This region is significant for its transcriptional activation function, as demonstrated by fusion experiments with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Rambaldi1994A). The proline-rich region C, which is 21% proline, is particularly noted for its transcriptional activation capability (Rambaldi1994A).

The protein also contains a pentapeptide motif (VYPWM) N-terminal to the homeodomain, although its deletion did not significantly affect activity in assays (Rambaldi1994A). The C-terminal region is serine-rich and plays a role in the protein's function, as deletions in this area reduced activity, which could be rescued by replacement with the HOXA-4 C-terminus (Rambaldi1994A). The study does not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, nor on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The HOXD4 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in embryonic development, particularly in the patterning of the axial skeleton. It is part of the Hox gene family, which is essential for assigning positional identity along the body axes during early development (Zhang1997Elements). HOXD4 is involved in the development of the vertebral column, with its expression being critical for the proper formation of the second cervical vertebra (C2) (Zhang1997Elements). 

The protein encoded by HOXD4 contains a homeodomain, a conserved DNA-binding motif that allows it to regulate the transcription of target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences (Moroni1993Regulation). This regulation is influenced by retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, which modulates HOXD4 expression through retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) in its regulatory regions (Morrison1996In). 

HOXD4 is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system and paraxial mesoderm, and is involved in the specification of cervical vertebrae (Folberg1999Hoxd4). Its activity is primarily nuclear, where it influences the spatial arrangement of body segments by modulating gene expression (Meazza1995Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOXD4 gene have been implicated in various developmental disorders and diseases. A novel germline mutation, p.Glu81Val, in the HOXD4 gene has been identified in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This mutation leads to a partial loss-of-function, as the mutant HOXD4 protein exhibits reduced transcriptional activity compared to the wild-type. The mutation was found in two children with ALL, one of whom also had congenital skeletal anomalies, suggesting a potential link between HOXD4 mutations and both hematological malignancies and skeletal defects (van2005Mutation).

HOXD4 mutations have also been associated with skeletal malformations. Studies have shown that mutations in HOXD4, particularly when interacting with the Rarg gene, can lead to malformations of cervical vertebrae, such as the transformation of the C2 vertebra to C1 and abnormalities in the basioccipital bone. These interactions result in increased severity and frequency of skeletal abnormalities, indicating a synergistic effect between HOXD4 and Rarg in vertebral development (Folberg1999Hoxd4).

In kidney development, mutations in the Hoxd4 gene, along with other Hoxd genes, have been linked to kidney growth defects and polycystic kidney disease, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis (DiPoï2007Distinct).

## Interactions
HOXD4 interacts physically with the Cdx1 protein, a member of the caudal-related homeobox family. This interaction is mediated by specific arginine residues within the homeodomain of HOXD4, particularly at positions 3, 24, and 29. These residues are conserved in Hox proteins that interact with Cdx1, and mutations at these positions can disrupt the interaction (Lafontaine2012Cdx1). The homeodomains of both Cdx1 and HOXD4 are necessary for their interaction, with conserved residues playing a crucial role. The interaction is modulated by sequences N-terminal to the Hox homeodomain, which can negatively influence the interaction with Cdx1 (Lafontaine2012Cdx1).

In COS7 cells, HOXD4 interacts with Cdx1, potentially facilitated by bridging proteins such as Meis1a and Pbx1 (Lafontaine2012Cdx1). The interaction between Cdx1 and HOXD4 has a biological impact, as their co-expression can activate transcription from the Hoxb8 promoter region, which contains Cdx binding sites. This suggests that the physical interaction between Cdx1 and HOXD4 can influence the transcription of common target genes (Lafontaine2012Cdx1).
