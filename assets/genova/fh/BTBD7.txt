# BTBD7

## Overview
BTBD7 is a gene that encodes the BTB domain-containing 7 protein, which plays a significant role in the regulation of branching morphogenesis, a vital developmental process in the formation of branched epithelial structures in organs such as the lungs, kidneys, and salivary glands. The BTBD7 protein functions as a regulatory molecule, linking the extracellular matrix to cleft propagation, thereby influencing epithelial cell motility and adhesion. It achieves this by modulating key molecules like Snail2 and E-cadherin, which are crucial for cell adhesion and motility (Onodera2010Btbd7). The protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its involvement in these cellular processes. BTBD7 is also implicated in various cancers, where it influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis, making it a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Fan2014Btbd7; Chen2020BTB; Tao2013BTBPOZ; Fang2017Silencing).

## Function
BTBD7 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of branching morphogenesis, a critical developmental process responsible for forming branched epithelial structures in organs such as the lungs, kidneys, and salivary glands. The BTBD7 protein acts as a dynamic regulator by linking the extracellular matrix to cleft propagation, which is essential for the local regulation of epithelial cell motility and adhesion. This regulation is achieved through the modulation of key molecules such as Snail2 (Slug) and E-cadherin, which are involved in cell adhesion and motility (Onodera2010Btbd7).

BTBD7 is expressed in cleft-forming sites and is particularly active during the branching of embryonic mammalian salivary glands and lungs. Its expression is induced by fibronectin, a matrix protein necessary for branching, and is concentrated around the bottom and lower sides of forming clefts. The protein's activity leads to the suppression of E-cadherin and the induction of Snail2, facilitating epithelial tissue remodeling and the formation of branched organs (Onodera2010Btbd7).

Inhibition experiments have demonstrated that BTBD7 is essential for the branching of these organs, highlighting its crucial role in epithelial cell dynamics and tissue development (Onodera2010Btbd7).

## Clinical Significance
BTBD7 is implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), through its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. In HCC, BTBD7 is overexpressed, promoting EMT and metastasis by enhancing the activity of RhoC GTPase and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), specifically MMP-2 and MMP-9. This overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes, such as lower overall survival and recurrence-free survival, making BTBD7 a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Tao2013BTBPOZ).

In breast cancer, BTBD7 is downregulated, and its low expression is associated with aggressive cancer features and higher recurrence rates. BTBD7 suppresses tumor progression by deactivating Notch1 signaling, which is crucial in cancer development. High BTBD7 expression is linked to lower recurrence rates and better survival outcomes, suggesting its role as a prognostic marker (Chen2020BTB).

In NSCLC, BTBD7 is overexpressed and associated with reduced E-cadherin expression, contributing to EMT and poor prognosis. Silencing BTBD7 can reverse EMT characteristics and reduce cancer cell invasiveness, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Fan2014Btbd7; Fang2017Silencing).
