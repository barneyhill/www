# SH2D4A

## Overview
SH2D4A is a gene that encodes the SH2 domain-containing protein 4A, which is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. The SH2D4A protein is characterized by the presence of an SH2 domain, a structural motif commonly found in proteins that participate in signaling pathways. This domain facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as those containing SH3 domains, and is implicated in T-cell signal transduction and actin cytoskeleton regulation (lapinski2009t). Functionally, SH2D4A plays a critical role in mitotic progression by promoting centrosome maturation and spindle microtubule formation, and it acts as a negative regulator of PP1 phosphatase, which is essential for proper mitotic spindle assembly (Yuki2023SH2D4A). Additionally, SH2D4A interacts with transcription factors like STAT3, influencing microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial function (Yuki2023SH2D4A; Ploeger2020Prohibitin). The gene is also noted for its tumor suppressor role, with alterations in its expression linked to poor prognosis in certain cancers, such as colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas (Roessler2012Integrative; Yuki2023SH2D4A).

## Structure
The SH2D4A protein contains an SH2 domain located at the carboxyl end, which is a common feature among proteins involved in signal transduction. This domain is homologous to the SH2 domains found in TSAd and ALX proteins, suggesting a role in forming signaling complexes with catalytically active molecules (lapinski2009t). The amino-terminal region of SH2D4A includes a conserved tyrosine residue within a phosphorylation consensus motif, indicating potential sites for post-translational modifications that could regulate its activity (lapinski2009t).

The protein also features a proline-rich stretch near the SH2 domain, which may facilitate interactions with SH3 domain-containing proteins such as HS1 and cortactin, hinting at a role in T-cell signal transduction and actin cytoskeleton regulation (lapinski2009t). Despite these structural features, SH2D4A-deficient mice exhibit normal T-cell development and function, suggesting that SH2D4A might be redundant or dispensable in certain signaling pathways (lapinski2009t). The potential redundancy with SH2D4B is noted, although the specific structural details of SH2D4B are not provided (lapinski2009t).

## Function
The SH2D4A gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in mitotic progression and cell proliferation. In healthy human cells, SH2D4A is crucial for promoting centrosome maturation and spindle microtubule formation, which are essential for proper mitotic progression. It facilitates the alignment of chromosomes during mitosis and supports kinetochore-microtubule attachment by promoting microtubule nucleation and the recruitment of pericentriolar material (PCM) such as Cep192, γ-tubulin, and PLK1 to centrosomes (Yuki2023SH2D4A). SH2D4A acts as a negative regulator of PP1 phosphatase, which is crucial for the recruitment of active PLK1 to centrosomes, necessary for spindle formation and mitotic progression (Yuki2023SH2D4A).

SH2D4A also interacts with the STAT3 transcription factor, inhibiting its dimerization and affecting microtubule dynamics, which may involve the modulation of Stathmin, influencing PLK1 function and microtubule polymerization (Yuki2023SH2D4A). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it interacts with other proteins such as prohibitin and STAT3, suggesting a role in mitochondrial function and integrity (Ploeger2020Prohibitin).

## Clinical Significance
The SH2D4A gene, located on chromosome 8p, is implicated in several cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. Alterations in SH2D4A expression, particularly down-regulation, are associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancers (CRCs) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). In CRCs, SH2D4A down-regulation is linked to chromosome instability, a characteristic of microsatellite stable type CRCs (Yuki2023SH2D4A). In HCCs, the loss of SH2D4A expression correlates with aggressive tumor growth and poor patient outcomes, as its re-expression has been shown to inhibit tumor growth and migration in vitro and in vivo (Roessler2012Integrative).

SH2D4A also interacts with STAT3 and prohibitin proteins in mitochondria, influencing mitochondrial function and integrity. Its deletion increases mitochondrial respiration, which can be reversed by the small molecule FL3, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for tumors with SH2D4A alterations (Ploeger2020Prohibitin). The gene's role in preventing STAT3 nuclear translocation further underscores its tumor suppressor function, as STAT3 is involved in cell proliferation and survival pathways (Ploeger2020Prohibitin). These findings highlight SH2D4A's significance in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SH2D4A, a protein containing an SH2 domain, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the transcription factor STAT3, inhibiting its dimerization and nuclear translocation, which affects microtubule dynamics and potentially modulates the interaction between STAT3 and Stathmin (Yuki2023SH2D4A). SH2D4A also interacts with mitochondrial scaffold proteins prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and prohibitin 2 (PHB2), forming complexes that influence mitochondrial function and integrity. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, showing co-localization and direct interaction within mitochondria (Ploeger2020Prohibitin).

In the context of estrogen signaling, SH2D4A binds directly to estrogen receptor α (ERα), inhibiting the recruitment of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) to ERα. This interaction suppresses estrogen-induced cell proliferation through the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway (Li2009SH2D4A). SH2D4A also interacts with SH3 domain-containing adapter proteins such as hematopoietic-specific protein-1 (HS1) and cortactin, suggesting a role in T-cell signal transduction and actin cytoskeleton regulation (lapinski2009t). These interactions highlight SH2D4A's involvement in diverse cellular pathways, potentially offering targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other diseases.
