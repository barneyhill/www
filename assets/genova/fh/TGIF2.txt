# TGIF2

## Overview
TGIF2, or TGFB induced factor homeobox 2, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional repressor protein belonging to the TALE superclass of homeobox proteins. The TGIF2 protein is characterized by its atypical homeodomain, which is crucial for its DNA-binding capabilities and transcriptional regulatory functions. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell fate determination, by modulating the transcription of target genes. TGIF2 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with notable expression in the heart, kidney, and testis. It plays a significant role in TGFβ-mediated pathways and is implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism. Additionally, TGIF2 is involved in cancer progression, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, through its interactions with signaling pathways and other proteins, such as histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and the corepressor SIN3A (Imoto2000Amplification; Du2019TGIF2; Shah2019TGIF; He2021Structural).

## Structure
The TGIF2 protein is a member of the TALE superclass of homeobox proteins and is composed of 237 amino acids with a molecular weight of 29.74 kDa (Imoto2000Amplification). It contains an atypical homeodomain that is 77% identical to the corresponding domain in the TGIF protein. This homeodomain is interrupted by a lab-class intron, a feature shared with other ancient homeobox genes (Imoto2000Amplification). The protein also includes a proline-rich region, which is a putative SH3-domain binding site, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Imoto2000Amplification).

TGIF2 is highly conserved between humans and mice, with a 94% identity over the entire protein. It contains two main regions of conservation: the homeodomain plus a 20 amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension, and a region near the carboxyl-termini (Melhuish2006The). The protein undergoes phosphorylation at two conserved MAP kinase sites within the carboxyl-terminal region, affecting its molecular weight (Melhuish2006The). Alternative splicing in mice results in a shorter isoform, mTgif2d, which retains the homeodomain and most of the conserved carboxyl-terminal region (Melhuish2006The).

## Function
TGIF2 (TGFB induced factor homeobox 2) is a transcriptional repressor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It belongs to the TALE superclass of homeobox genes and is characterized by its DNA-binding homeodomain, which is 77% identical to that of TGIF, another homeobox gene (Imoto2000Amplification). TGIF2 is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with the highest expression levels observed in the heart, kidney, and testis (Imoto2000Amplification).

TGIF2 functions primarily in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and modulates the transcription of target genes. This activity suggests its involvement in crucial cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell fate determination (Imoto2000Amplification). The protein's role as a transcriptional repressor is further supported by its potential to interact with TGFβ-responsive SMADs, indicating a role in TGFβ-mediated pathways (Shah2019TGIF). TGIF2's regulatory functions may also extend to influencing energy metabolism, as it is implicated in the repression of genes involved in acetyl CoA and pyruvate metabolism, which are essential for cellular energy balance (Shah2019TGIF).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TGIF2 gene have been implicated in the development of holoprosencephaly (HPE), a severe congenital disorder characterized by the failure of the forebrain to properly divide into two hemispheres. The loss of TGIF2 function disrupts the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for normal brain development, leading to HPE phenotypes (Taniguchi2012Loss). In mouse models, the absence of TGIF2, particularly in combination with the loss of TGIF1, results in early embryonic lethality and severe forebrain defects, underscoring the gene's role in maintaining the balance between Shh and its antagonist, Gli3 (Taniguchi2012Loss).

TGIF2 also interacts with the TGFb/Nodal signaling pathway, and its dysfunction can lead to increased Nodal signaling, further contributing to HPE by disrupting Shh signaling (Taniguchi2012Loss). Although TGIF2 mutations alone do not always result in severe phenotypes, their presence alongside TGIF1 mutations can exacerbate developmental defects, highlighting the overlapping and essential functions of these genes during embryogenesis (Taniguchi2012Loss).

## Interactions
TGIF2 (TGFB induced factor homeobox 2) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its role in cancer progression, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). TGIF2 is phosphorylated by the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling pathway, which enhances its stability and function in promoting cancer cell stemness and metastasis (Du2019TGIF2; Du2023Phosphorylation). This phosphorylation is essential for TGIF2's ability to recruit histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the E-cadherin (CDH1) promoter, leading to the repression of E-cadherin transcription and facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Du2023Phosphorylation).

TGIF2 also binds to the promoter region of the OCT4 gene, enhancing its transcription and promoting cancer stem cell-like characteristics in LUAD cells (Du2019TGIF2). This interaction is regulated by the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling pathway, as EGF-induced phosphorylation of TGIF2 increases its ability to promote OCT4 expression (Du2019TGIF2). Additionally, TGIF2 interacts with the corepressor SIN3A, which is crucial for its transcriptional repression activities (He2021Structural). These interactions highlight TGIF2's role as a key mediator in signaling pathways that drive cancer progression.
