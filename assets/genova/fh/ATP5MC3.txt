# ATP5MC3

## Overview
ATP5MC3 is a gene that encodes the ATP synthase membrane subunit c locus 3, a critical component of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, specifically within the F0 portion. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating proton translocation across the mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for ATP synthesis. The ATP synthase complex, also known as Complex V, is integral to oxidative phosphorylation, a process that generates ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell. ATP5MC3 is expressed in various human tissues, underscoring its importance in maintaining energy homeostasis. Mutations in ATP5MC3 have been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and are associated with clinical conditions such as familial spastic paraplegia and dystonia, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Jiang2022Systematic; Davoli2022Identification; Neilson2021A).

## Structure
The ATP5MC3 gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, specifically the c subunit of the F0 portion. This protein is integral to the mitochondrial membrane and plays a crucial role in ATP synthesis by facilitating proton translocation across the membrane. The primary structure of ATP5MC3 consists of amino acid sequences that form transmembrane helices, which are essential for its function in the proton channel of ATP synthase (Davoli2022Identification; Neilson2021A).

The secondary structure of ATP5MC3 includes alpha helices, which are typical of transmembrane proteins and contribute to its integration into the mitochondrial membrane. The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the membrane, allowing the protein to participate effectively in the formation of the c ring, a critical component of the ATP synthase complex (Neilson2021A).

In terms of quaternary structure, ATP5MC3 integrates into the ATP synthase complex as part of the c ring, which is essential for the enzyme's function in energy transduction. This integration is crucial for the coupled rotation necessary for ATP synthesis, as the c ring interacts with other subunits to facilitate the conversion of ADP to ATP (Tauchmannová2024Variability).

## Function
ATP5MC3 encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, specifically part of the F0 complex, which is crucial for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. This protein facilitates proton translocation across the mitochondrial membrane, a process that drives the synthesis of ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (Davoli2022Identification). ATP5MC3 is highly expressed in various human tissues, including distal and proximal tubular cells, Hofbauer cells, extravillous trophoblasts, and cytotrophoblasts, indicating its widespread role in cellular energy metabolism (Weijiao2021Immune).

The ATP synthase complex, also known as F1F0 ATP synthase or Complex V, consists of two domains: the F1 domain, responsible for ATP synthesis and hydrolysis, and the F0 domain, which contains the proton channel. ATP5MC3 is one of the genes encoding the C-subunit of this proton channel, essential for maintaining energy homeostasis in cells by facilitating proton flow back into the mitochondrial matrix (Davoli2022Identification). This function is vital for cellular processes that require energy, such as muscle contraction and various metabolic pathways, underscoring the importance of ATP5MC3 in overall organismal energy balance.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP5MC3 gene have been associated with a unique form of familial spastic paraplegia and dystonia. A specific variant, c.318C>G (p.Asn106Lys), has been identified in individuals with these conditions, characterized by impaired mitochondrial function, reduced complex V activity, and decreased ATP generation and oxygen consumption (Neilson2021A). This variant disrupts the interaction between the F1 and F0 subunits of ATP synthase, impairing oxidative phosphorylation (Neilson2021A). 

The clinical presentation of ATP5MC3 mutations can vary, with some individuals experiencing mild muscle-related symptoms, while others have more severe manifestations such as generalized dystonia and developmental delays (Tauchmannová2024Variability). The c.318C>G variant has been associated with low penetrance, suggesting that some carriers may remain asymptomatic due to expression of subunit c from other isoforms (Tauchmannová2024Variability). 

Alterations in ATP5MC3 expression have also been linked to cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma, ATP5MC3 expression correlates with tumor stage and adverse clinical outcomes, and it is considered an independent prognostic factor (Jiang2022Systematic). In endometrial cancer, ATP5MC3 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and genetic variations, such as copy number variations (Weijiao2021Immune).

## Interactions
The ATP5MC3 gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex, specifically the c subunit of the F0 portion, which is integral to the function of Complex V in oxidative phosphorylation. This subunit is involved in the interaction with the F1 subunit, facilitating the coupled rotation necessary for ATP synthesis. The interaction between the F0 and F1 subunits is crucial for the conversion of ADP to ATP, and the p.Asn106Lys variant in ATP5MC3 is located in a conserved loop that acts as the point of contact between these subunits (Neilson2021A).

The c subunit forms part of the c ring, which rotates in response to proton translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane. This rotation is coupled with the γ subunit, which fits between the α and β subunits, leading to structural changes necessary for ATP synthesis (Tauchmannová2024Variability). Pathogenic variants in ATP5MC3 can disrupt these interactions, leading to decreased hydrolytic activity and reduced assembly of ATP synthase (Tauchmannová2024Variability). Despite these insights, specific interactions of ATP5MC3 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in the ATP synthase complex are not detailed in the available literature.
