# MRPS15

## Overview
The MRPS15 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S15, a crucial component of the small 28S subunit of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to mitochondrial protein synthesis, playing a pivotal role in the translation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Unlike its prokaryotic counterparts, the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S15 is characterized by unique structural features, including N-terminal and C-terminal extensions that facilitate its interaction with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and contribute to the structural organization of the mitoribosome (Koc2010Current; Kaushal2014CryoEM). These adaptations are indicative of its specialized function within the mitochondrial translation machinery. MRPS15 is also involved in cellular stress responses, particularly under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress, where it modulates translation through interactions with internal ribosome entry sites (David2024Mitochondrial). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, including certain cancers and auditory disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; PerezMartinez2008Protein).

## Structure
The mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRPS15 is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mammalian mitoribosome. It is larger than its prokaryotic counterparts and features extensions at both the N-terminus and C-terminus, which may include signals for mitochondrial import (Koc2010Current). These extensions are involved in inter-MRP contacts and contribute to the structural organization of the mitoribosome, facilitating the recruitment of mito-specific mRNAs (Kaushal2014CryoEM).

MRPS15 is located at the junction of the small subunit body and platform, with its orientation differing from its bacterial counterpart. The N-terminal extension (NTE) and C-terminal extension (CTE) of MRPS15 are positioned on the solvent side of the conserved domain and interact with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, such as MRP S17, S26, and S28 (Kaushal2014CryoEM). The CTEs of MRPS15 and MRP S17 partially replace a small stretch of bacterial h21, which is absent in the mito-SSU (Kaushal2014CryoEM).

The protein's homologous part shared with bacterial S15 is the central part of MRPS15, although it is considerably longer, suggesting evolutionary adaptations for its role in the mitochondrial ribosome (David2024Mitochondrial). The specific molecular structure of MRPS15, including its tertiary and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MRPS15 gene have been implicated in various diseases. MRPS15 is associated with DFNA2, a form of non-syndromic sensorineural deafness, and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome, highlighting its potential role in auditory and developmental disorders (PerezMartinez2008Protein). In cancer, MRPS15 expression is upregulated in bladder, cervical, and head and neck cancers, while it is downregulated in breast and lung cancers. These aberrant expression patterns suggest a potential involvement of MRPS15 in cancer pathology, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). MRPS15 is also involved in cellular pathways such as MAPK6/MAPK4 and Hedgehog signaling, which are linked to tumorigenic processes, indicating its broader role in cancer beyond mitochondrial translation (Revathi2021Expression). The differential expression of MRPS15 in various cancers and its involvement in key signaling pathways underscore the need for further research to understand its role in disease etiology and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
MRPS15, a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, is known to interact with various proteins and participate in complex cellular processes. It is primarily associated with the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, where it plays a role in mitochondrial protein synthesis (He2012Human). In stressed cardiomyocytes, MRPS15 is found in cytosolic ribosomes and interacts with ribosomal proteins such as RPS7/eS7, RPS2/uS5, and RPL10A/uL1, indicating its involvement in ribosomal complexes during stress conditions (David2024Mitochondrial).

MRPS15 is also implicated in the regulation of translation, particularly under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. It acts as an activator of internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation, interacting with specific IRES elements to modulate translation during stress. This includes a selective effect on IRESs like FGF1 and IGF1R, but not on others such as VEGFD and EMCV (David2024Mitochondrial). The protein's role in translation regulation is further supported by its involvement in the translation of mRNAs related to the unfolded protein response (UPR), such as XBP1 and HSPA5/GRP78/Bip, during ER stress (David2024Mitochondrial). These interactions highlight MRPS15's critical role in cellular stress responses and its potential impact on specialized ribosomal functions.
