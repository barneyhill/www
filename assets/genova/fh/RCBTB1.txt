# RCBTB1

## Overview
RCBTB1 is a gene that encodes the RCC1 and BTB domain containing protein 1, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, ubiquitination, and oxidative stress response. The protein is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal RCC1 domain and a C-terminal BTB domain, facilitating its role as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for small GTP-binding proteins, which are crucial for cellular growth and morphology (Wang2014Genome-Wide; serra2016functional). RCBTB1 is implicated in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and regulating antioxidant responses, particularly in retinal pigment epithelial cells, where it interacts with proteins such as UBE2E3 and CUL3 (Huang2023Mitochondrial). Clinically, mutations in RCBTB1 are associated with inherited retinal diseases and certain cancers, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in disease pathogenesis (Mauduit2019RCBTB1; Huang2023Mitochondrial).

## Function
RCBTB1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and ubiquitination. The protein contains an N-terminal regulator of chromosome condensation (RCC1) domain and a C-terminal BTB (broad complex, tramtrack, and bric-a-brac) domain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Wang2014Genome-Wide). RCBTB1 is suggested to function as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), targeting members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, which are pivotal in controlling cellular functions such as growth, division, and morphology (serra2016functional).

In healthy human cells, RCBTB1 plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial structure and function, as well as regulating oxidative stress responses. It interacts with proteins such as UBE2E3 and CUL3, suggesting its involvement in protein complex formation crucial for its function (Huang2023Mitochondrial). RCBTB1 is also implicated in the NFE2L2-mediated antioxidant responses, protecting cells against oxidative stress (Huang2023Mitochondrial). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation, and is associated with maintaining cellular integrity and managing oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelial cells (Huang2023Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RCBTB1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of retinal diseases, mutations in RCBTB1 have been linked to inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), such as retinitis pigmentosa and cone-rod dystrophy, which can lead to vision loss. These mutations result in mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired antioxidant responses in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, contributing to the pathogenesis of RCBTB1-associated retinopathy (Huang2023Mitochondrial).

In the realm of oncology, RCBTB1 has been implicated in the progression of sarcomas. The gene is frequently deleted or downregulated in nontranslocation-related pleomorphic sarcomas, particularly leiomyosarcomas, and is associated with metastatic outcomes and resistance to chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel. This suggests that RCBTB1 may function as a tumor suppressor gene, with its deletion correlating with increased metastatic risk and poor prognosis in sarcoma patients (Mauduit2019RCBTB1).

Additionally, RCBTB1 has been identified as a genetic modifier in the context of atherosclerosis. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in RCBTB1 interacts with smoking to influence carotid intima-media thickness, a marker for atherosclerosis, highlighting the gene's role in modifying environmental risk factors (Wang2014Genome-Wide).

## Interactions
RCBTB1 is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes such as oxidative stress response, translation regulation, and tumor suppression. In retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, RCBTB1 interacts with CUL3 and UBE2E3, forming part of protein complexes that may function as ubiquitin adapter proteins, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and oxidative stress responses (Huang2023Mitochondrial). 

RCBTB1 also interacts with several proteins localized in the chromosomal region 13q14. It has been shown to interact with elongation factors eEF1A and eEF1G, indicating a potential role in translation elongation processes (serra2016functional). The protein also interacts with EED, a component of the polycomb group complex involved in transcriptional repression, and CRMP-1, which is associated with immune signaling and tumor invasion (serra2016functional). 

Additionally, RCBTB1 has been found to interact with GNB2, a signal transduction protein, suggesting involvement in cytoplasmic functions related to glucocorticoid receptor activities (serra2016functional). These interactions highlight RCBTB1's potential involvement in intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulation, linking it to processes such as apoptosis and malignancy.
