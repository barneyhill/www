# CCDC22

## Overview
The CCDC22 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 22 protein, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as endosomal trafficking and signal transduction. This protein is a key component of the Commander endosomal trafficking complex, which is involved in the recycling of endosomal proteins and is linked to several genetic disorders, including X-linked intellectual disability and Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome (Healy2023Structure; Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22). Structurally, CCDC22 features an N-terminal calponin-homology domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain, facilitating its interaction with other proteins such as CCDC93 and components of the Retriever complex (Healy2023Structure; Yong2023Commanding). Functionally, CCDC22 is integral to the regulation of NF-κB signaling, a critical pathway for immune response, through its interactions with COMMD proteins (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22). Mutations in CCDC22 can lead to significant clinical manifestations, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper immune function (Kolanczyk2014Missense; Yamashita2019Identification).

## Structure
The CCDC22 protein is a component of the Commander endosomal trafficking complex, which is involved in endosomal recycling and is linked to X-linked intellectual disability and Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome. The protein features an N-terminal calponin-homology (CH) domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain, connected by a long linker. These domains facilitate the formation of a heterodimer with CCDC93, characterized by four distinct coiled-coil regions (CC1-CC4) that create two V-shaped structures (Healy2023Structure; Yong2023Commanding).

The first V-shaped structure interacts with DENND10, while the second associates with the Retriever complex via its subunit VPS35L. The CH domain of CCDC22 is predicted to extend back to form an intramolecular interaction with the V-shaped structure of the two C-terminal coiled-coil regions (CC3-CC4) (Healy2023Structure; Yong2023Commanding). The CCDC22-CCDC93 dimer shares structural similarity with intraflagellar transport machinery subunits, which also form coiled-coil dimers with N-terminal CH domains (Healy2023Structure).

Pathogenic mutations in CCDC22, such as CCDC22(Y557C), cluster near the interface between the Retriever and CCC complexes, affecting the stability and assembly of the Commander complex (Healy2023Structure).

## Function
The CCDC22 gene encodes a protein that is integral to several cellular processes, particularly in endosomal sorting and signal transduction. In healthy human cells, CCDC22 is a component of the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex, which is crucial for the endosomal trafficking of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). This process is essential for maintaining normal plasma LDL cholesterol levels and preventing hypercholesterolemia (Fedoseienko2018The; Bartuzi2016CCC). CCDC22 is also involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling, a pathway important for immune responses and inflammation. It interacts with COMMD proteins to facilitate the ubiquitination and degradation of IκB proteins, which are inhibitors of NF-κB, thereby promoting NF-κB activation (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22).

The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and endosomes, where it interacts with the WASH complex to influence actin cytoskeleton dynamics and endosomal trafficking (Kolanczyk2014Missense; Mallam2017Systemswide). CCDC22's role in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper immune function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC22 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and Ritscher-Schinzel/3C syndrome. These conditions are characterized by developmental delays, intellectual disability, and various physical anomalies, including craniofacial, cardiac, and skeletal abnormalities (Kolanczyk2014Missense). Specific missense variants, such as p.(Tyr557Cys) and p.(Thr17Ala), have been linked to these syndromes, with the latter also causing abnormal splicing and reduced mRNA levels, leading to impaired protein interactions (Kolanczyk2014Missense; Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22).

CCDC22 mutations can disrupt normal protein interactions, particularly with COMMD proteins, affecting NF-κB signaling pathways. This disruption can lead to blunted NF-κB activation, which is crucial for inflammatory responses and may contribute to ectodermal dysplasia and other developmental disorders (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22). Additionally, a novel mutation, c.112G>A, has been associated with severe Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and aggressive natural killer cell leukemia, suggesting a broader impact of CCDC22 mutations on immune function and cancer predisposition (Yamashita2019Identification). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CCDC22 in various genetic and acquired conditions.

## Interactions
CCDC22 is known to interact with all members of the COMMD protein family, forming complexes with COMMD1, COMMD6, COMMD9, and COMMD10. These interactions have been validated through coimmunoprecipitation experiments and are crucial for the regulation of NF-κB signaling, as CCDC22 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of IκB proteins, facilitating NF-κB activation (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22). CCDC22 also interacts with components of the CRL1-βTrCP complex, a Cullin-RING ligase involved in targeting IκB proteins for degradation (Starokadomskyy2013CCDC22).

In addition to its role in NF-κB signaling, CCDC22 is part of the CCC complex, which includes COMMD1 and CCDC93, and is involved in endosomal protein trafficking. This complex is essential for the regulation of endosomal sorting and membrane protein recycling (Singla2019Endosomal; Mallam2017Systemswide). CCDC22 also interacts with the PI(3)P phosphatase MTMR2, with the interaction mediated by a specific region in CCDC22, independent of the CCC complex assembly (Singla2019Endosomal). These interactions highlight CCDC22's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and trafficking pathways.
