# SRPX2

## Overview
The SRPX2 gene encodes the sushi repeat-containing protein X-linked 2, a secreted protein characterized by the presence of sushi domains and a hyaline domain. This protein is primarily involved in synapse formation and modulation within the central nervous system, particularly influencing the density of excitatory synapses. SRPX2 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including cell motility, invasion, and proliferation, through its interaction with the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and other signaling pathways. The gene is expressed in multiple human tissues, indicating its broad physiological relevance. Clinically, mutations in SRPX2 are associated with neurological disorders such as speech-related conditions and epilepsy, while its overexpression is linked to the progression of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Sia2013The; Tanaka2008SRPX2; Roll2010Molecular).

## Structure
The SRPX2 protein contains three sushi domains and one hyaline (HYR) domain. Sushi domains, also known as complement control protein modules, are composed of approximately 60 amino acids and are involved in protein-protein and protein-carbohydrate interactions (Tanaka2008SRPX2). The first sushi domain of SRPX2 is characterized by a compact hydrophobic core and a framework of five extended segments forming β-strands. This domain includes a hypervariable loop, which is unusually long and forms a prominent protrusion. This loop contains a non-typical disulfide bridge between cysteine residues C71 and C87, which is atypical for classical sushi domain folds (Royer2007Molecular).

The R75K human-specific modification occurs within this domain, near a mutation site (Y72) associated with brain disorders. This substitution is conservative, involving a change from one positively charged residue to another, and is not expected to significantly alter the domain's structure (Royer2007Molecular). The hyaline domain is associated with the immunoglobulin fold superfamily and is believed to play a role in cellular adhesion (Tanaka2008SRPX2). The SRPX2 protein is secreted into extracellular regions and localizes in the cytoplasm (Tanaka2008SRPX2). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Liu2017Sushi).

## Function
The SRPX2 gene encodes a secreted protein that plays a crucial role in synapse formation, particularly in the central nervous system. It is involved in the modulation of synapse density, specifically increasing the density of excitatory synapses and spines in neurons without affecting inhibitory synapse formation (Sia2013The). SRPX2 is largely colocalized with excitatory synapse markers and is partially retained on synaptic membranes, suggesting its significant role in excitatory synaptogenesis (Sia2013The).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), SRPX2 acts as a downstream effector of the NFATc3 and c-JUN proteins, playing a role in the regulation of lineage and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. This indicates its involvement in development-associated signaling pathways (Chen2021Calcineurin). SRPX2 is also a ligand for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which can activate various intracellular signaling pathways affecting cell motility, invasion, proliferation, and survival (Chen2021Calcineurin).

SRPX2 is expressed in a variety of normal human tissues, including the placenta, lung, trachea, uterus, and adrenal gland, suggesting a fundamental role in cellular processes related to these tissues (Tanaka2008SRPX2). Its expression is higher in juvenile rats, aligning with periods of increased synapse formation, indicating its involvement in neural development (Sia2013The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SRPX2 gene are linked to several neurological and oncological conditions. In the context of neurological disorders, SRPX2 mutations are associated with speech-related disorders, including Rolandic epilepsy, developmental verbal dyspraxia (DVD), and bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria. These mutations can disrupt the interaction between SRPX2 and the plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), which is crucial for normal speech development (Roll2010Molecular). The gene is also regulated by the FOXP2 transcription factor, and mutations in FOXP2 can impair the regulation of SRPX2, contributing to speech disorders (Roll2010Molecular).

In cancer, SRPX2 is overexpressed in various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness. In hepatocellular carcinoma, SRPX2 promotes cell migration and invasion, potentially through the FAK/AKT pathway (Lin2017SRPX2). In non-small cell lung cancer, SRPX2 activates the FAK/SRC/ERK pathway, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer progression (Li2020SRPX2). In esophageal cancer, SRPX2 influences the Wnt signaling pathway, affecting cell proliferation and chemoresistance (He2019SRPX2). These findings suggest SRPX2 as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
SRPX2 is known to participate in several protein-protein interactions that are significant in various cellular processes. It interacts with the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), a key player in cell signaling and migration. This interaction is facilitated through a ligand/receptor mechanism, and mutations in SRPX2 can enhance its binding affinity to uPAR (Tanaka2012SRPX2; Sasahira2020Sushi). SRPX2 also binds to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), promoting endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which are crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (Tanaka2012SRPX2; Sasahira2020Sushi).

In the context of cancer, SRPX2 has been shown to modulate the FAK/AKT signaling pathway, influencing cell migration and invasion. It increases the phosphorylation levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), enhancing cellular adhesion and motility (Tanaka2008SRPX2; Lin2017SRPX2). Additionally, SRPX2 interacts with RAB31 in pancreatic cancer, suggesting a role in tumor progression and serving as a potential prognostic biomarker (Li2019SRPX2).

SRPX2's interactions extend to the regulation of gene expression, as it is a downstream target of NFATc3, which modulates its expression by binding to its regulatory region (Chen2021Calcineurin). These interactions highlight SRPX2's multifaceted role in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
