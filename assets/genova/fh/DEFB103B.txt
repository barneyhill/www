# DEFB103B

## Overview
The DEFB103B gene encodes the protein defensin beta 103B, a member of the beta-defensin family, which is integral to the human innate immune system. This protein is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide and is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, where it plays a pivotal role in the body's first line of defense against pathogens. Defensin beta 103B exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, effectively targeting bacteria, fungi, and viruses by disrupting their membranes. Beyond its antimicrobial properties, the protein is involved in modulating immune responses, influencing chemokine and cytokine production in myeloid dendritic cells. This modulation is achieved through interactions with various receptors, including G-protein coupled receptors, which help balance pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Harvey2013Defensin; Ostaff2013A).

## Structure
The DEFB103B gene encodes the human beta-defensin-3 (HβD-3), a peptide characterized by a conserved arrangement of six cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide bonds, crucial for its structural stability (Dhople2006The; Pazgier2006Human). The primary structure of HβD-3 includes a high content of cationic residues, particularly near the carboxyl-terminal region, which contributes to its antimicrobial activity (Pazgier2006Human).

The secondary structure of HβD-3 is composed of approximately 25% β-sheet conformation and less than 10% α-helical conformation in aqueous environments. This structure undergoes a conformational transition in the presence of trifluoroethanol, increasing its helicity to 25% (Dhople2006The; BONIOTTO2003A). The tertiary structure features a 'defensin-like' fold with three antiparallel β-sheets and a short helical loop at the amino-terminal region, stabilized by disulfide bridges (Dhople2006The).

HβD-3 can form a symmetrical dimer structure through the β2 strand, although this dimerization is not essential for its antibacterial activity (Dhople2006The). The peptide's ability to form dimers is facilitated by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, contributing to its high and salt-independent antibacterial activity (Pazgier2006Human).

## Function
The DEFB103B gene encodes the protein beta-defensin 103, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by exhibiting antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This protein is primarily active in epithelial cells, where it contributes to the first line of defense by disrupting microbial membranes and modulating immune responses (Harvey2013Defensin; Ostaff2013A).

Beta-defensin 103 is involved in regulating chemokine and cytokine responses in human myeloid dendritic cells. It can bidirectionally modulate these responses, either enhancing or attenuating them depending on its concentration and timing relative to exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin B (HagB) (Harvey2013Defensin). At lower concentrations, DEFB103B tends to attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, while at higher concentrations, it enhances their expression (Harvey2013Defensin).

The protein interacts with G-protein coupled receptors CCR2B and CCR6 on dendritic cells, activating pathways that modulate cytokine production. It also inhibits pro-inflammatory signals by interacting with receptors like CD14, CD40, and IFNG (Harvey2013Defensin). This dual role in immune response regulation is significant for maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to infections (Harvey2013Defensin).
