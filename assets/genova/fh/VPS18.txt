# VPS18

## Overview
VPS18 is a gene that encodes the VPS18 protein, a core subunit of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are integral to vesicle-mediated protein sorting and membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells. The VPS18 protein is categorized as a ubiquitin ligase due to its involvement in ubiquitin-mediated processes, facilitated by its RING-H2 finger domain. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of membrane fusion events, particularly in the fusion of autophagosomes and late endosomes with lysosomes, processes essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein degradation. The VPS18 protein interacts with other components of the HOPS complex, such as VPS41, VPS16, and VPS33A, to direct the complex to its membrane targets, thereby contributing to the proper functioning of endosomal and lysosomal pathways (Hunter2017VPS18; Kim2001Molecular).

## Structure
The VPS18 protein is encoded by a cDNA with an open reading frame of 2922 base pairs, resulting in a protein composed of 973 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of 110.2 kDa (Huizing2001Molecular). The protein is primarily cytosolic and features several key domains that contribute to its function. Notably, it contains a Clathrin repeat domain between amino acids 614 and 772, which is a sequence of approximately 140 amino acids found in the Clathrin protein, though its exact function remains unclear (Huizing2001Molecular). Additionally, the VPS18 protein includes a RING-H2 finger domain between amino acids 853 and 879, a specialized zinc-binding motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions and is crucial for the protein's role in ubiquitin-mediated processes (Huizing2001Molecular).

The RING domain of VPS18 is essential for its interaction with other components of the HOPS complex, particularly VPS41, forming a stable heterodimer that is vital for the recruitment of VPS41 to the complex (Hunter2017VPS18). The VPS18 protein structure also includes a β-propeller domain at the N-terminus, followed by an α-solenoid and a C-terminal zinc-finger domain, which aligns with the RING domain consensus sequence (Hunter2017VPS18). These structural features are integral to the assembly and function of the HOPS complex in membrane fusion events.

## Function
The VPS18 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting) and CORVET (class C core vacuole/endosome tethering) complexes, which are crucial for vesicle-mediated protein sorting and membrane fusion events in eukaryotic cells. VPS18 is involved in the regulation of membrane fusion, specifically facilitating the fusion of autophagosomes and late endosomes with lysosomes, processes essential for cellular homeostasis and protein degradation (Hunter2017VPS18; Kim2001Molecular).

In healthy human cells, VPS18 interacts with other proteins such as VPS41, VPS16, and VPS33A to form a stable complex that directs the HOPS complex to its membrane targets, such as Rab7-positive endosomes (Hunter2017VPS18). The protein contains a RING-H2 finger domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for its function as a ubiquitin ligase, regulating the degradation of specific proteins through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Yogosawa2005Ubiquitylation).

VPS18 is predominantly associated with late endosomes and lysosomes, where it plays a role in vesicle docking and fusion, contributing to the proper functioning of endosomal and lysosomal pathways (Kim2001Molecular). Its activity is essential for processes such as autophagy, endocytosis, and lysosomal enzyme maturation, which are vital for maintaining cellular integrity and function (Peng2012Ablation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the VPS18 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In mice, the ablation of VPS18 leads to severe neurodegeneration and impaired neuronal migration, resulting in embryonic or early postnatal lethality. This is due to disruptions in vesicle transport pathways to lysosomes, affecting autophagy, endocytosis, and lysosomal functions, which are crucial for neuronal health (Peng2012Ablation). The deficiency in VPS18 results in the accumulation of autophagosomes and ubiquitinated proteins, indicating impaired degradation processes, which are linked to neurodegenerative conditions (Peng2012Ablation).

In cancer, VPS18, along with VPS11, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is involved in the regulation of signaling pathways. High expression levels of VPS18 are associated with a higher probability of relapse-free survival in ERα-positive breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. However, in ERα-independent gastric cancer, high expression of VPS18 has an opposite clinical value, indicating that its role may vary depending on the cancer type (Segala2019Vps11). These findings highlight the importance of VPS18 in both neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, emphasizing its role in cellular transport and signaling pathways.

## Interactions
VPS18 is a core subunit of the HOPS complex, which is involved in membrane fusion events in eukaryotic cells. It plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of the HOPS complex by mediating protein-protein interactions through its RING domain. The RING domain of VPS18 interacts directly with the RING domain of VPS41, forming a stable heterodimeric complex essential for recruiting VPS41 to the HOPS complex (Hunter2017VPS18). This interaction is confirmed by GST pulldown experiments and SEC-MALS analysis, which demonstrate that the VPS18 and VPS41 RING domains form an equimolar complex (Hunter2017VPS18).

VPS18 also interacts with VPS33A, another component of the HOPS complex, through its RING domain, which is necessary for efficient interaction with endogenous HOPS components (Hunter2017VPS18). The α-solenoid region of VPS18 contributes to binding VPS41, with residues 752-973 identified as the VPS41 binding region (Hunter2017VPS18). The interaction between VPS18 and VPS11 requires the β-propeller and a large N-terminal portion of the α-solenoid, independent of the RING domain (Hunter2017VPS18). These interactions highlight the central role of VPS18 in the assembly of the mammalian HOPS complex.
