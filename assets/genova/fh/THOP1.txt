# THOP1

## Overview
Thimet oligopeptidase 1 (THOP1) is a gene that encodes a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase enzyme, also known as thimet oligopeptidase 1. This enzyme is primarily involved in the intracellular degradation of peptides, playing a significant role in the processing of bioactive peptides such as neuropeptides and peptide hormones. THOP1 is characterized by its substrate-size specificity and is predominantly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in intracellular processes. The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, which influence its catalytic function and secretion. THOP1 is implicated in various physiological functions, including antigen presentation, signal transduction, and the regulation of blood pressure and nociception. Additionally, alterations in THOP1 expression have been associated with several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ferro2020Thimet).

## Structure
Thimet oligopeptidase 1 (THOP1) is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase characterized by a well-defined molecular structure. The primary structure of THOP1 includes a HEXXH motif, which is typical of metalloproteases and is crucial for zinc ion coordination. This motif involves two histidine residues and an upstream glutamic acid residue (E501) that coordinate the zinc ion and hold a water molecule for nucleophilic attack during peptide bond hydrolysis (Ferro2020Thimet).

The secondary structure of THOP1 is primarily alpha-helical, with a bi-lobal configuration separated by a deep crevice where the active site zinc is located (Liu2021Thimet). The tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions such as hydrogen bonds, and the enzyme's thiol-sensitivity is highlighted by the presence of cysteine residues, which can form intermolecular disulfide bridges leading to inactive oligomers. These bridges are reversible in the presence of reducing agents (Ferro2020Thimet).

THOP1 can oligomerize into dimers and trimers, influenced by oxidative conditions, which constitutes its quaternary structure (Ferro2020Thimet). The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as S-glutathionylation, which regulates its enzymatic activity (Ferro2020Thimet).

## Function
THOP1, or thimet oligopeptidase 1, is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase primarily involved in the degradation of intracellular peptides. It plays a crucial role in processing bioactive peptides, including neuropeptides and peptide hormones, within the cytosol. THOP1 is characterized by its substrate-size specificity, hydrolyzing peptides ranging from 5 to 22 amino acids, with optimal activity on peptides containing 9 to 12 amino acids (Ferro2020Thimet). The enzyme is predominantly found in the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting its involvement in intracellular processes rather than extracellular neuropeptide metabolism (Ferro2020Thimet).

THOP1 is involved in the regulation of peptide levels both inside and outside of cells, affecting physiological functions such as reproductive mechanisms, nociception, and blood pressure (Ferro2020Thimet). It plays a significant role in the processing of MHC-I antigens in antigen-presenting cells, influencing CD8-mediated antigen presentation (Ferro2020Thimet). THOP1 also modulates G-protein receptor signal transduction and reactive oxygen species production, highlighting its significance in cell biology beyond antigen presentation (Ferro2020Thimet). In the nervous system, THOP1 is involved in metabolizing neuropeptides like opioids and bradykinin, functioning as a rate-limiting peptidase for certain neuropeptides (Ferro2020Thimet).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the THOP1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, THOP1 is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its role in degrading amyloid-beta peptides. Overexpression of THOP1 in neurons provides neuroprotection against amyloid-beta toxicity, while knockdown increases vulnerability, suggesting a compensatory defense mechanism in AD models (Ferro2020Thimet).

In cancer, THOP1 expression levels have been implicated in different prognoses. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), low THOP1 expression correlates with positive lymph node metastasis and decreased survival rates, whereas high expression is linked to poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (Ferro2020Thimet). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lower THOP1 expression is suggested as a biomarker for HCC risk, with higher expression associated with prolonged survival (Ferro2020Thimet).

THOP1 also plays a role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), THOP1 expression is significantly lower in patients, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis through abnormal antigen presentation (Ferro2020Thimet). In sepsis, THOP1 knockout mice show improved survival, indicating its involvement in inflammatory responses (dos2019Thimet). These findings highlight THOP1's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
Thimet oligopeptidase 1 (THOP1) participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple biological processes. THOP1 interacts with proteins such as 14-3-3 epsilon and calmodulin, which facilitate its secretion through an unconventional pathway. The interaction with 14-3-3 epsilon is regulated by phosphorylation at Ser 644, affecting THOP1's catalytic activity and secretion (dos2019Thimet). THOP1 also interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and Epsin-2 (EPN2), although the biological implications of these interactions are not fully understood (Ferro2020Thimet).

THOP1 is involved in the processing of intracellular peptides (InPeps), which can modulate protein-protein interactions and signal transduction pathways. These peptides compete with protein kinase targets, acting as natural modulators of protein interactions (Ferro2020Thimet). THOP1's role in antigen presentation involves interactions with MHC-I molecules, where it can either inhibit or generate peptides for presentation (Ferro2020Thimet).

In the context of SARS-CoV-2, THOP1 has been identified as having structural similarities with ACE2, potentially acting as an alternative receptor for the virus. THOP1 shows stronger calculated interaction energies with the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain compared to ACE2, suggesting its involvement in viral entry (Tragni2021A).
