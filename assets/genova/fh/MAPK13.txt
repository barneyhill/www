# MAPK13

## Overview
MAPK13, also known as p38δ, is a gene that encodes the mitogen-activated protein kinase 13, a member of the p38 MAP kinase family. This protein kinase is involved in the transduction of extracellular signals, playing a pivotal role in cellular responses to stress and inflammatory cytokines. As a serine/threonine kinase, MAPK13 is integral to various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation, and differentiation across multiple cell types. The protein is activated through phosphorylation by upstream kinases such as MKK3 and MKK6, which are part of broader signaling pathways that respond to environmental stimuli. MAPK13's activity is crucial in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences the phosphorylation of other kinases and the activation of transcription factors, respectively. Its involvement in regulating mucus production in airway epithelial cells, particularly in response to IL-13, underscores its significance in inflammatory airway diseases. Additionally, MAPK13 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including melanoma and psoriasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Segalés2016Regulation; Osaki2013MAPKs; Alevy2012IL-13–induced).

## Structure
MAPK13, also known as p38 delta, is a member of the p38 MAP kinase family involved in mediating extracellular signaling. The protein undergoes significant structural changes upon activation. In its inactive form, the activation loop of MAPK13 is disordered, but it becomes well-ordered in the phosphorylated, active form. This reconfiguration is crucial for stabilizing the negative charges introduced by phosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182, leading to a more compact catalytic site that facilitates substrate binding and catalysis (Yurtsever2015The).

The kinase domain of MAPK13 is characterized by the presence of hydrophobic spines, which link the N- and C-lobes in the activated form. These spines are discontiguous in the inactive state but become contiguous upon activation, a common feature in kinase activation (Yurtsever2015The). The DFG motif, particularly the rotation of the Asp168 side chain, plays a critical role in this structural transition, locking the Phe169 side chain into a hydrophobic pocket (Yurtsever2015The).

MAPK13 is subject to post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which regulates its activity. The protein is monomeric in both its active and inactive forms, as observed in gel-filtration chromatography experiments (Yurtsever2015The).

## Function
MAPK13, also known as p38δ, is a member of the p38 MAPK family involved in cellular responses to environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines. It plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and differentiation of multiple cell types such as neurons, adipocytes, and myoblasts (Segalés2016Regulation). In the context of airway epithelial cells, MAPK13 is crucial for regulating mucus production, particularly in response to IL-13, which induces the expression of the MUC5AC mucin gene (Alevy2012IL-13–induced). This regulation is part of a signaling pathway that involves the activation of MAPK13, leading to increased mucus production, a process that can be attenuated by specific MAPK13 inhibitors (Alevy2012IL-13–induced).

MAPK13 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various molecular processes. In the cytoplasm, it can phosphorylate other kinases, while in the nucleus, it activates transcription factors that regulate gene expression (Osaki2013MAPKs). The pathway's involvement in cellular stress responses and tissue homeostasis highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
MAPK13, also known as p38δ, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression and function. In primary cutaneous melanoma, MAPK13 is frequently silenced through promoter CpG island methylation, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene. This epigenetic silencing is associated with increased melanoma cell proliferation, indicating that MAPK13 loss may contribute to melanoma progression (Gao2013Genome‐wide). The methylation of MAPK13 is observed in both primary and metastatic melanoma samples, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for melanoma diagnosis and progression (Gao2013Genome‐wide).

In psoriasis, MAPK13 expression is commonly upregulated, and increased p38δ MAPK activity is observed in psoriatic lesions, linking it to the pathogenesis of this chronic inflammatory skin condition (O’Callaghan2014p38δMAPK:). MAPK13 is also involved in the regulation of insulin secretion and has been linked to diabetes mellitus pathogenesis. In vivo studies show that p38δ MAPK knockout mice exhibit reduced pancreatic β cell death and protection against insulin resistance, suggesting its role in diabetes (O’Callaghan2014p38δMAPK:). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MAPK13 in various diseases, with potential implications for diagnosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
MAPK13, also known as p38 delta, is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family involved in various cellular processes, including stress and inflammatory responses. It is activated by upstream kinases such as MKK3 and MKK6, which are part of the signal transduction pathways that regulate cellular responses to external stimuli (Yurtsever2015The). 

MAPK13 interacts with several proteins, including MAPKAPK2 and MAPKAPK3, which are downstream targets in the MAPK signaling cascade. These interactions are crucial for mediating the cellular effects of MAPK13 activation, such as the regulation of gene expression and cellular stress responses (Yurtsever2015The). 

In the context of airway diseases, MAPK13 is involved in the signaling pathway that leads to mucus production in response to IL-13. This pathway includes the chloride channel calcium-activated 1 (CLCA1), which acts upstream of MAPK13, and the MUC5AC mucin gene, which is downstream. The interaction between CLCA1 and MAPK13 is significant in the regulation of mucus production, highlighting MAPK13's role in inflammatory airway diseases like COPD and asthma (Alevy2012IL-13–induced).
