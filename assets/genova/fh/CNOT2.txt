# CNOT2

## Overview
CNOT2 is a gene that encodes the CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 2, a crucial component of the CCR4-NOT complex, which is a multi-subunit protein complex involved in the regulation of gene expression at various levels, including transcriptional repression and mRNA decay. The protein encoded by CNOT2 is categorized as a transcriptional corepressor and is integral to the structural and functional integrity of the CCR4-NOT complex. It interacts with other subunits such as CNOT1 and CNOT3, forming a heterodimer that is essential for the complex's role in transcriptional repression and mRNA metabolism. CNOT2 is involved in key cellular processes, including mRNA deadenylation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis regulation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease states when dysregulated (Chalabi2020The; Jayne2006Involvement; Shirai2014Multifunctional).

## Structure
The human CNOT2 protein is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, specifically within the NOT module, which also includes CNOT1 and CNOT3. CNOT2 contains a NOT-box motif that facilitates its interaction with CNOT3, forming a symmetric heterodimer. The NOT-box structure is composed of three N-terminal α-helices and a C-terminal β-sheet formed by five β-strands, with significant bending of strands β4 and β5. This structure is similar to Sm domains but lacks the signature Sm sequence motifs and an additional β-strand necessary for Sm-Sm dimerization (Xu2014Insights).

The CNOT2/Not2 and CNOT3/Not5 heterodimer is anchored to CNOT1/Not1 through unstructured, extended peptide regions, creating an asymmetric lobe. The C-terminal region of CNOT1, which forms the NOT module, consists of 10 HEAT repeats characterized by a helix A-turn-helix B motif. The CNOT2 anchor region zigzags across the surface of CNOT1, interacting with specific HEAT motifs (Xu2014Insights).

CNOT2's quaternary structure involves domain swapping via the N-terminal helices, which is distinct from the CNOT3 homodimer and the CNOT2/CNOT3 heterodimer. The NOT-box domains of CNOT2 and CNOT3 mediate dimerization through their N-terminal helices, resulting in a highly symmetrical heterodimer (Xu2014Insights).

## Function
CNOT2 is a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, which plays a significant role in regulating gene expression at multiple levels in healthy human cells. It is involved in transcriptional repression by interacting with the SMRT/NCoR-HDAC3 complex, which removes acetyl groups from histone proteins, leading to decreased chromatin accessibility and transcriptional repression (Jayne2006Involvement). CNOT2 also acts as a corepressor, particularly in the repression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) gene transcription, independent of the master regulator CIITA (RodríguezGil2017The).

CNOT2 is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the CCR4-NOT complex, as its depletion affects the expression of other subunits like CNOT3 (Shirai2014Multifunctional). It modulates mRNA decay, linking transcriptional repression and mRNA degradation functions, and is involved in cell cycle progression by regulating mRNA turnover (Chalabi2020The). CNOT2's role in mRNA metabolism is further highlighted by its involvement in mRNA deadenylation, a critical step in mRNA degradation (Denis2003The). These functions underscore CNOT2's importance in maintaining proper gene expression regulation and cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
CNOT2, a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, plays a significant role in various cellular processes, and its dysregulation is implicated in several diseases. Alterations in CNOT2 expression can lead to impaired autophagic flux, as evidenced by the induction of the autophagy adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1 and LC3B-II conversion upon CNOT2 depletion in H1299 cells. This suggests a potential link between CNOT2 dysregulation and conditions involving autophagy dysregulation, such as cancer (Chalabi2020The).

CNOT2 is also involved in apoptosis regulation. Its depletion increases CHOP mRNA levels, indicating that ER stress can lead to intrinsic apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner. This suggests that changes in CNOT2 expression may contribute to diseases where apoptosis is dysregulated (Chalabi2020The).

The interaction of CNOT2 with homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (HIPKs) suggests a role in regulating cell death in response to stress signals, such as DNA damage and hypoxia. This interaction may influence the cellular response to stress and contribute to conditions characterized by increased chromosomal instability (Chalabi2020The). While specific diseases directly associated with CNOT2 mutations are not explicitly mentioned, its role in these pathways suggests its potential involvement in tumorigenesis and other stress-related conditions.

## Interactions
CNOT2, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcriptional repression and mRNA metabolism. CNOT2 interacts with several subunits of the SMRT/NCoR-HDAC3 complex, which is essential for transcriptional repression mediated by histone deacetylation. This interaction is particularly strong with SMRT, and the presence of HDAC3 enhances CNOT2-mediated repression (Jayne2006Involvement). The Not-Box at the C-terminus of CNOT2 is a key domain for these interactions, facilitating the recruitment of the SMRT/NCoR-HDAC3 complex to promoter regions, leading to local deacetylation and transcriptional repression (Jayne2006Involvement).

CNOT2 also plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the CCR4-NOT complex. It directly interacts with CNOT3, as demonstrated by GST pull-down assays, and is necessary for the incorporation of CNOT3 into the complex. The depletion of CNOT2 disrupts the complex, leading to a loss of deadenylase activity and apoptotic cell death (Ito2011CNOT2). Additionally, CNOT2 interacts with p62/SQSTM1, promoting its degradation through an ATG5-dependent autophagic pathway (Jeong2017CNOT2).
