# CHCHD5

## Overview
CHCHD5 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial protein coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 5, which is involved in the oxidative folding process within the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This protein is characterized by its structural motif, the CHCH domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and is commonly found in mitochondrial proteins. The CHCHD5 protein contains two such domains, stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are essential for maintaining its alpha-helical conformation and functional integrity (Banci2012Structural). As a substrate of the oxidoreductase Mia40, CHCHD5 plays a significant role in maintaining redox balance in mitochondria, which is vital for normal cellular physiology and energy production (Wu2017A). Although the precise functions of CHCHD5 in human cells are not fully elucidated, its structural and functional characteristics suggest a critical role in mitochondrial respiration and cellular survival.

## Structure
The CHCHD5 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix (CHCH) domain, which is a structural motif involved in protein-protein interactions, commonly found in mitochondrial proteins. The protein contains two CHCH domains, each with four conserved cysteine residues, forming disulfide bonds that stabilize its structure (Banci2012Structural). These domains are connected by a linker region that includes an α-helical segment involving residues 52-57 (Banci2012Structural).

The secondary structure of CHCHD5 is predominantly alpha-helical, as indicated by circular dichroism (CD) spectra, which show typical negative minima around 208 and 222 nm (Banci2012Structural). The tertiary structure is maintained by disulfide-bridged α-helices within the CHCH domains, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Banci2012Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, CHCHD5 is primarily monomeric in solution, as confirmed by NMR measurements, although it can form dimers through unspecific intermolecular disulfide bonds (Banci2012Structural). The protein's structure is solvent accessible, with no strong interdomain interactions, allowing for limited conformational sampling (Banci2012Structural). Upon reduction of disulfide bonds, CHCHD5 becomes largely unstructured, leading to aggregation (Banci2012Structural).

## Function
CHCHD5 encodes a mitochondrial protein involved in the oxidative folding process within the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This protein is a substrate of the oxidoreductase Mia40, which facilitates an oxidative folding process crucial for maintaining redox balance in mitochondria, essential for normal cell physiology (Wu2017A). CHCHD5 contains a coiled coil-helix-coiled coil-helix (CHCH) fold stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are important for its structural integrity. The presence of disulfide bonds is crucial for maintaining its alpha-helical conformation, as reduction of these bonds leads to a largely unstructured state and aggregation (Banci2012Structural).

The protein is homologous to yeast Mic14, which affects mitochondrial oxygen consumption, suggesting a role in mitochondrial respiration (Wu2017A; Banci2012Structural). CHCHD5 lacks a predictable N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, but it contains mitochondrial IMS-targeting signals (ITS) that facilitate its interaction with Mia40, promoting disulfide bond formation (Banci2012Structural). While the specific function of CHCHD5 in healthy human cells is not fully described, its involvement in oxidative folding and mitochondrial function suggests a role in cellular energy production and survival.
