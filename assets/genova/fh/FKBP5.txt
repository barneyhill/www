# FKBP5

## Overview
The FKBP5 gene encodes the FKBP prolyl isomerase 5 protein, commonly referred to as FKBP51, which is a member of the immunophilin protein family. This protein functions primarily as a co-chaperone, playing a critical role in the regulation of steroid hormone receptors, particularly the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). FKBP51 is characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity and its involvement in protein-protein interactions through its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. It is implicated in various physiological processes, including stress response, metabolic regulation, and immune function. FKBP51's interaction with the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) complex and its modulation of signaling pathways such as Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) and NF-κB highlight its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Genetic variations and expression alterations in FKBP5 are associated with psychiatric disorders, metabolic diseases, and cancer, underscoring its clinical relevance (Sidibeh2018FKBP5; Agam2024The; Zannas2015Gene–Stress–Epigenetic).

## Structure
The FKBP5 gene encodes the FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), which is a member of the immunophilin protein family. FKBP51 has a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct domains. It contains an N-terminal FK1 domain with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity, a PPIase-like FK2 domain, and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain (Kolos2018FKBP). The FK1 domain is capable of binding immunosuppressive drugs such as Rapamycin and FK506, although with lower affinity compared to FKBP12. The FK2 domain, despite its structural similarity to other FKBP domains, does not exhibit measurable isomerase activity and does not bind FK506 or Rapamycin (Kolos2018FKBP).

The TPR domain of FKBP51 serves as a docking site for the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), facilitating protein-protein interactions (Kolos2018FKBP). FKBP51 can form dimeric structures linked by disulfide bonds, which may function in the endoplasmic reticulum or nuclear space (Galat2019Compression). The protein also includes a calmodulin-binding domain (CBD) at the C-terminus, which is formed by a long α-helix (Galat2019Compression). FKBP51 is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, and it has several splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The FKBP5 gene encodes the FKBP51 protein, which functions as a co-chaperone involved in the regulation of steroid hormone receptors, particularly the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). FKBP51 modulates GR signaling by forming a complex with GR and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), influencing the receptor's sensitivity to glucocorticoids. This interaction affects the translocation of the GR complex into the nucleus, where it can regulate gene transcription (Sidibeh2018FKBP5; Zannas2015Gene–Stress–Epigenetic). FKBP51 is involved in an ultra-short negative feedback loop that regulates its own expression and GR activity, impacting stress responses and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (Zannas2015Gene–Stress–Epigenetic).

In addition to its role in stress response, FKBP51 is implicated in metabolic regulation, including adipogenesis and insulin resistance. It interacts with protein kinase A-cα (PKA-cα) and fragmented lamin B during adipocyte differentiation, influencing nuclear lamina reorganization through phosphorylation events (Zgajnar2019Biological). FKBP51 also modulates the Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) signaling pathway, linking it to insulin resistance and metabolic processes (Sidibeh2018FKBP5; Fries2017The). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Fries2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FKBP5 gene are linked to a variety of psychiatric and stress-related disorders. Genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FKBP5, have been associated with increased risks of conditions like bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, ADHD, PTSD, and schizophrenia (Malekpour2023Role). For instance, the C allele of rs4713902 is linked to higher cortisol levels and increased risk of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder (Malekpour2023Role). FKBP5 polymorphisms, particularly the SNP rs1360780, are associated with treatment outcomes and depressive behavior (Agam2024The).

Alterations in FKBP5 expression levels are also implicated in various diseases. Elevated FKBP5 levels are associated with shorter telomere length and stress-related conditions, including depression and cognitive decline in aging (Fries2017The). FKBP5 overexpression has been observed in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, contributing to pathological phenotypes (Zannas2015Gene–Stress–Epigenetic). In cancer, FKBP5 can function as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor, depending on the tissue type and pathways involved (Agam2024The). FKBP5 is also linked to metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, where its DNA methylation correlates with insulin resistance and systemic inflammation (Agam2024The).

## Interactions
FKBP5, also known as FKBP51, is a protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. It acts as a co-chaperone in the Hsp90 complex, interacting with several steroid receptors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ER), and androgen receptor (AR). FKBP5 inhibits the activity of MR and PR while promoting the activity of ER and AR, which may have implications in prostate cancer pathogenesis (Li2010The; Zannas2015Gene–Stress–Epigenetic).

FKBP5 also interacts with pathways involved in immune regulation and oncogenesis. It inhibits calcineurin and promotes NF-κB signaling through interaction with the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (IKK-α), a mechanism implicated in melanoma pathogenesis (Zannas2015Gene–Stress–Epigenetic). Additionally, FKBP5 acts as a scaffolding protein that enhances the dephosphorylation and inactivation of Akt by promoting the interaction between AKT and PHLPP, leading to the blockade of AKT signaling and resulting in cell apoptosis (Li2010The).

In the context of stress responses, FKBP5 modulates GR signaling by reducing the interaction of the GR complex with dynein, delaying nuclear translocation, and decreasing GR-dependent transcriptional activity (Zannas2015Gene–Stress–Epigenetic). These interactions highlight FKBP5's role in various signaling pathways, including steroid receptor signaling, NF-κB, and AKT-PHLPP pathways, which are crucial for tumorigenesis and response to chemotherapy (Li2010The).
