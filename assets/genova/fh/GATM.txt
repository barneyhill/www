# GATM

## Overview
The GATM gene encodes the enzyme glycine amidinotransferase, a key mitochondrial enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of creatine. Glycine amidinotransferase catalyzes the transfer of an amidino group from arginine to glycine, forming guanidinoacetate and ornithine, which is the initial and rate-limiting step in creatine synthesis (Edvardson2010larginine:glycine; Alessandrì2020Increased). This enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver, pancreas, and kidneys, where it plays a critical role in maintaining energy homeostasis by facilitating the production of creatine, an essential molecule for energy storage and supply in muscle and brain tissues (Choe2016Homoarginine). Mutations in the GATM gene can lead to various clinical conditions, including renal Fanconi's syndrome and creatine deficiency syndromes, underscoring its importance in both renal and muscular health (Forst2021Distinct; Nouioua2013Creatine).

## Function
The human gene GATM encodes the enzyme glycine amidinotransferase, which plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of creatine. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the creatine synthesis pathway by transferring an amidino group from arginine to glycine, resulting in the formation of guanidinoacetate (GAA) and ornithine (Edvardson2010larginine:glycine; Alessandrì2020Increased). This reaction is the rate-limiting step in the pathway and primarily occurs in the liver, pancreas, and kidneys (Edvardson2010larginine:glycine).

Creatine, synthesized from GAA, is essential for energy storage and supply, particularly in muscle and brain tissues. It acts as a rapidly available energy buffer, facilitating the regeneration of ATP from ADP through its phosphorylated form, phosphocreatine (Alessandrì2020Increased; Choe2016Homoarginine). This process is vital for maintaining energy homeostasis in cells with high and fluctuating energy demands, such as skeletal muscle, heart, and brain (Choe2016Homoarginine).

In healthy human cells, the activity of GATM ensures adequate creatine levels, supporting cellular energy metabolism and muscle function. Disruptions in this pathway can lead to creatine deficiency syndromes, which are associated with neurological and muscular symptoms (Nouioua2013Creatine; Ndika2012Developmental).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GATM gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting renal and muscular systems. In humans, heterozygous missense mutations in GATM can lead to renal Fanconi's syndrome, characterized by glucosuria, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria, low molecular weight proteinuria, and metabolic acidosis during childhood. As patients age, these mutations can result in renal fibrosis and loss of renal function, eventually necessitating dialysis. The pathogenic mechanism involves the formation of mutant protein aggregates within mitochondria, leading to cell damage, inflammation, and fibrosis (Forst2021Distinct).

GATM mutations are also linked to creatine deficiency syndromes, such as AGAT deficiency, which can cause developmental delays, language impairment, and myopathy. Treatment with creatine supplementation has shown improvements in muscle strength and cognitive functions in affected individuals (Nouioua2013Creatine).

Alterations in GATM expression levels have been implicated in statin-induced myopathy. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs9806699, is associated with a reduced risk of this condition, suggesting a protective effect against muscle toxicity induced by statins (Mangravite2013A; Liu2020The). These findings highlight the gene's role in both renal and muscular pathologies.
