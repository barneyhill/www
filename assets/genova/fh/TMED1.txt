# TMED1

## Overview
TMED1, or transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 1, is a gene that encodes a member of the p24 family of transmembrane proteins, specifically known as transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 1. This protein is integral to the early secretory pathway, facilitating the transport of protein cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. TMED1 is characterized by its structural domains, including a single transmembrane domain and a luminal Golgi Dynamics (GOLD) domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Mota2022Structural). The protein plays a significant role in immune signaling, particularly in the interleukin-33 (IL-33) pathway, by mediating the transport of the ST2 receptor to the cell membrane, thereby influencing the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Connolly2013The). TMED1's involvement in various cellular processes and its potential implications in diseases such as sepsis, asthma, and cancer underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and as a potential therapeutic target (Mota2022Structural; Aber2019Transmembrane).

## Structure
The TMED1 protein, part of the transmembrane emp24 domain-containing proteins (TMED) family, is characterized by a specific domain organization. It includes a small cytosolic portion at the C-terminus, a single transmembrane domain, a coiled-coil domain, a flanking region, and a long luminal region comprising the Golgi Dynamics (GOLD) domain (Mota2022Structural). The GOLD domain is a prominent feature, characterized by a β-sandwich fold composed of two four-strand antiparallel β-sheets connected by a conserved disulfide bond (Mota2022Structural). This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, such as with the ST2 receptor in the IL-33 signaling pathway (Mota2022Structural).

The TMED1 GOLD domain can form dimers, a process influenced by ionic strength, with dimerization occurring at low salt concentrations (Mota2022Structural). This dimerization is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, with specific residues like Phe39, Thr40, and Arg47 contributing significantly to the free energy of binding (Mota2022Structural). The dimeric form is considered stable and likely represents its in vivo organization (Mota2022Structural). The TMED1 protein does not have reported post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context (Mota2022Structural).

## Function
TMED1, a member of the transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein family, plays a critical role in the early secretory pathway, particularly in the transport of protein cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. This protein is involved in the secretion of biomolecules and influences the composition, structure, and function of the ER and Golgi, which are essential for cellular homeostasis and efficient protein trafficking (Mota2022Structural; Aber2019Transmembrane).

TMED1 is specifically implicated in interleukin-33 (IL-33) signaling by mediating the transport of the ST2 receptor to the cell membrane. This interaction is crucial for optimal IL-33-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-6, highlighting TMED1's importance in immune responses (Connolly2013The). The GOLD domain of TMED1 is involved in the interaction with the ST2 receptor, suggesting its role in immune system signaling and cell differentiation (Mota2022Structural).

Structurally, TMED1 forms oligomers, which are important for its function in cellular trafficking. The dimerization of the TMED1 GOLD domain is stabilized by specific interactions, contributing to its structural stability and function in protein trafficking (Mota2022Structural).

## Clinical Significance
TMED1, a member of the transmembrane emp24 domain-containing proteins, is implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein transport and signaling pathways. Alterations in TMED1 expression or function can impact immune responses and are associated with conditions such as sepsis, asthma, allergic responses, and cardiovascular diseases. TMED1 is involved in interleukin-33 (IL-33) signaling by mediating the transport of the ST2 receptor to the cell membrane, which is crucial for immune responses (Mota2022Structural). Disruption of this pathway can impair the production of interleukins like IL-6 and IL-8, indicating reduced IL-33 signaling, which is significant in inflammatory conditions (Aber2019Transmembrane).

TMED1 has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease and carcinomas, suggesting its potential role in neurodegenerative and cancerous processes (Mota2022Structural). Although specific diseases directly caused by TMED1 mutations are not detailed, its involvement in critical signaling pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in preventing heart failure through the IL-33/ST2 interaction (Mota2022Structural). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical implications of TMED1 alterations.

## Interactions
TMED1, or transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. TMED1 interacts with the ST2L receptor, a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family, which is involved in interleukin-33 (IL-33) signaling. This interaction is mediated by the GOLD domain of TMED1 and the TIR domain of ST2L, and is essential for the optimal production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-6 in response to IL-33 (Connolly2013The; Aber2019Transmembrane).

TMED1 also forms oligomers, such as dimers, which are stabilized by interactions involving specific residues in its GOLD domain. These interactions are crucial for the structural stability and function of TMED1 in vesicular trafficking (Mota2022Structural).

In the context of colorectal cancer, TMED1 is part of a protein-protein interaction network that includes other TMED family members and various genes involved in immune regulation and cytokine signaling pathways. This network suggests a role for TMED1 in modulating immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (Guo2024Integrative).
