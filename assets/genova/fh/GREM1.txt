# GREM1

## Overview
GREM1 is a gene that encodes the protein gremlin 1, a member of the DAN family of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists. Gremlin 1 is a secreted protein that plays a critical role in modulating BMP signaling pathways, which are essential for various developmental processes and tissue homeostasis. Structurally, gremlin 1 is characterized by a conserved dimeric form with a cystine knot motif, typical of growth factors, and functions primarily in the extracellular space to inhibit BMP activity (Walsh2010Extracellular; Kišonaitė2016Structure). The protein's ability to bind BMPs, such as BMP4 and BMP7, allows it to regulate processes like limb development, kidney morphogenesis, and ovarian follicle formation (Walsh2010Extracellular; Bayne2016BMP). Beyond its developmental roles, GREM1 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it can influence tumor progression and metastasis by interacting with other proteins and modulating cellular pathways (Namkoong2006The; Neckmann2019GREM1). As such, GREM1 and its encoded protein, gremlin 1, are of significant interest in both developmental biology and clinical research.

## Structure
Gremlin-1 (GREM1) is a member of the DAN family of secreted BMP antagonists, characterized by a conserved dimeric structure. The primary structure of GREM1 includes a signal peptide and a cysteine-rich domain, which is typical of the DAN family proteins (Kišonaitė2016Structure). The secondary structure of Gremlin-1 is primarily composed of intertwined antiparallel β-strands, forming a cystine knot core with six cysteine residues. This structure also includes two fingers and a wrist, with an additional disulfide bond in the finger region (Kišonaitė2016Structure).

The tertiary structure of Gremlin-1 is arch-shaped, similar to Gremlin-2, due to high sequence similarity. It features a cystine knot motif, a common structural element in growth factors (Kišonaitė2016Structure). Gremlin-1 forms a stable non-covalent dimer in solution, which is its quaternary structure. This dimerization is stabilized by backbone hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, burying a surface area of approximately 1900 Å² per protomer (Kišonaitė2016Structure).

Gremlin-1 can bind to heparin with a 20 nM affinity, and the heparin-binding site is located in three clusters of positively charged residues (Kišonaitė2016Structure). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and disulfide bond formation. Splice variants of GREM1 can result in different isoforms with potentially distinct functions.

## Function
GREM1, or gremlin 1, is a member of the DAN family of BMP antagonists, which play a crucial role in regulating bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, GREM1 is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it binds to BMPs, such as BMP4, preventing them from interacting with their receptors. This modulation of BMP signaling is essential for various developmental processes, including limb-bud development, kidney formation, and lung development (Walsh2010Extracellular).

In limb development, GREM1 is involved in maintaining the FGF-Shh signaling pathway by inhibiting BMP4, which is necessary for proper limb outgrowth and digit formation. The absence of GREM1 leads to unregulated BMP4 activity, resulting in developmental defects (Walsh2010Extracellular). In the kidney, GREM1 regulates BMP4 activity to ensure proper GDNF signaling, which is crucial for ureteric bud growth and branching morphogenesis (Walsh2010Extracellular).

GREM1 also plays a role in human fetal ovarian development by modulating BMP signaling, which is important for the formation of primordial follicles and the regulation of germ cell proliferation (Bayne2016BMP). The precise regulation of BMP signaling by GREM1 is vital for normal tissue development and organogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GREM1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), GREM1 plays a significant role in tumorigenesis. A polymorphic enhancer near GREM1, specifically SNP rs16969681, influences CRC risk by affecting transcription factor binding, leading to increased GREM1 expression and higher intestinal tumor burden (Lewis2014A). GREM1 is also implicated in hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome (HMPS), where a 40 kb duplication upstream of the gene results in its ectopic expression, disrupting bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and promoting tumorigenesis (Lieberman2017Features; Davis2014Aberrant).

In breast cancer, GREM1 is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis, particularly in estrogen receptor-negative patients. Its expression correlates with genes involved in extracellular matrix organization, suggesting a role in facilitating tumor cell migration (Neckmann2019GREM1). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), elevated GREM1 expression is linked to poor prognosis and high relapse probability, indicating its involvement in tumor progression and the tumor microenvironment (Yang2022GREM1).

Overall, GREM1's role in cancer biology highlights its potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target across various cancer types.

## Interactions
GREM1, or gremlin 1, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. One notable interaction is with the YWHAH protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family. This interaction involves specific binding sites, with GREM1 binding to YWHAH between residues 61-80, and YWHAH binding to GREM1 between residues 1-67. This interaction suggests that GREM1 may function as an oncoprotein, contributing to the development of human cancers (Namkoong2006The).

GREM1 also interacts with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), particularly BMP7, acting as an antagonist. This interaction is crucial in regulating processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colon cancer cells. GREM1 disrupts cell-to-cell adhesion and promotes a mesenchymal phenotype, while BMP7 maintains the epithelial phenotype. The BMP7/GREM1 axis is involved in regulating EMT, with GREM1 promoting mesenchymal characteristics and BMP7 maintaining epithelial traits (Karagiannis2015Bone).

These interactions highlight GREM1's role in modulating BMP signaling pathways, influencing cancer progression and potentially serving as a target for therapeutic strategies.
