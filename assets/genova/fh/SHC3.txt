# SHC3

## Overview
The SHC3 gene encodes the SHC adaptor protein 3, a member of the Shc family of adaptor proteins, which are integral to intracellular signaling pathways. This protein is primarily expressed in neuronal cells and plays a pivotal role in signal transduction by linking activated receptors to downstream signaling molecules. SHC adaptor protein 3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival, and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and cell membrane (Azzalin2020A). The protein is characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, central collagen homology 1 (CH1) domain, and Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, with the p64Shc3 isoform containing an additional N-terminal CH2 domain (Liu2021Shc3). These structural features facilitate its interactions with other proteins, underscoring its role in modulating key signaling pathways, such as the ERK and β-catenin/TCF pathways, which are implicated in cancer progression and drug resistance (Liu2021Shc3; Liu2018DemethylationInduced).

## Structure
The SHC3 gene encodes for two isoforms, p52Shc3 and p64Shc3, which are part of the Shc family of adaptor proteins. These isoforms share a conserved domain structure that includes a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, a central collagen homology 1 (CH1) domain, and a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. The p64Shc3 isoform contains an additional N-terminal CH2 domain (Liu2021Shc3). These domains facilitate interactions with other proteins and are crucial for signal transduction processes. The CH1 domain is particularly important for binding with proteins such as MVP, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2, which are involved in the activation of the ERK pathway (Liu2018DemethylationInduced).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating the activity of SHC3. These modifications are essential for its function in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the context of cancer progression and drug resistance (Liu2021Shc3). The interaction of SHC3 with other proteins, such as β-catenin, further highlights its role in modulating key signaling pathways, including the β-catenin/TCF pathway, which is implicated in cancer stemness and drug resistance (Liu2021Shc3).

## Function
SHC3 (SHC adaptor protein 3) is a member of the Shc family of adaptor proteins, which are involved in intracellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, SHC3 is primarily expressed in neuronal cells and plays a crucial role in signal transduction by linking activated receptors to downstream signaling molecules. This protein is involved in processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and survival, and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and cell membrane (Azzalin2020A).

SHC3 is known to interact with various proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and endocytosis, such as adaptor protein complexes 1 and 2 (Ap1/Ap2), MAP1A, BMP2K, and vimentin. These interactions suggest that SHC3 plays a role in modulating vesicle trafficking, which is essential for the proper localization and function of glucose transporters of the GLUT/SLC2A superfamily. This modulation is particularly significant under conditions of glucose deprivation, where SHC3 enhances vesicle trafficking and affects the activity of glucose transporters (Azzalin2020A).

SHC3 also interacts with PARP1, a protein involved in DNA repair, indicating a potential role in cellular stress responses. The PTB domain of SHC3 is necessary for this interaction, suggesting that SHC3 may have broader implications in regulating cellular stress responses beyond its role in vesicle trafficking (Azzalin2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SHC3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative and cancerous conditions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), SHC3 plays a protective role against oxidative stress in nigral dopamine neurons. Silencing SHC3 exacerbates oxidative stress injury, leading to motor retardation and a reduction in dopamine neurons. This is associated with the repression of the PI3K-AKT-FoxO signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Gong2018Lentiviral).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SHC3 is significantly upregulated and is associated with tumor invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis. The overexpression of SHC3 correlates with microvascular invasion and cancer staging. It interacts with major vault protein to activate the MEK/ERK pathway, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell proliferation. This overexpression is linked to sorafenib resistance, a common issue in HCC treatment (Liu2018DemethylationInduced; Liu2021Shc3).

SHC3 also enhances drug resistance in HCC by interacting with β-catenin, inhibiting its degradation, and activating the β-catenin/TCF pathway. This interaction increases MDR1 expression, contributing to multidrug resistance and cancer stemness, making SHC3 a potential therapeutic target in HCC (Liu2021Shc3).

## Interactions
SHC3 (SHC adaptor protein 3) is involved in several protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SHC3 interacts with β-catenin, a key molecule in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction inhibits the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of β-catenin, leading to its stabilization and increased nuclear translocation. The stabilized β-catenin activates the β-catenin/TCF signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining cancer stem cells and mediating drug resistance in HCC (Liu2021Shc3).

SHC3 also interacts with major vault protein (MVP), which serves as a bridge for SHC3 to interact with MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, key components of the ERK signaling pathway. This interaction is independent of c-Raf and is crucial for the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC (Liu2018DemethylationInduced). The central collagen-homology 1 (CH1) domain of SHC3 is essential for binding with MVP, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 (Liu2018DemethylationInduced). These interactions highlight SHC3's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
