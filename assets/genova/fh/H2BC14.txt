# H2BC14

## Overview
H2BC14 is a gene that encodes the protein H2B clustered histone 14, which is a member of the histone H2B family. Histones are essential components of chromatin, the complex of DNA and protein found in eukaryotic cell nuclei, and play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating or hindering the access of transcriptional machinery to DNA. The H2B clustered histone 14 protein is involved in the structural organization of chromatin and is implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, replication, and transcriptional regulation. Alterations in the expression of H2BC14 have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cellular responses to environmental and genetic changes (Subhi2020Genetic; Mannens2024Chromatin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the H2BC14 gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In thyroid conditions, H2BC14 is overexpressed in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with coexisting HT. This overexpression is linked to immune and inflammatory functions, oxidative stress, DNA damage and repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis, suggesting a role in the progression of these thyroid diseases (Subhi2020Genetic).

In pineoblastoma, a type of brain tumor, deletion events affecting H2BC14 have been observed, indicating a potential link to cancer initiation or DNA damage response (Idriss2023A). The gene is also implicated in psychiatric disorders, with associations found between H2BC14 and major depressive disorder (MDD) during early neurodevelopment, particularly in midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons (Mannens2024Chromatin).

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer, H2BC14 is repressed by the NUPR1 network following treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, highlighting its involvement in transcriptional regulatory networks that influence tumor suppressor pathways and cell death (Elango2021Transcriptional). These findings underscore the clinical significance of H2BC14 in various diseases through its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation.
