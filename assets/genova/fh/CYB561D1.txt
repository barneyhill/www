# CYB561D1

## Overview
CYB561D1 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome b561 family member D1, which is part of the cytochrome b561 family of transmembrane oxidoreductases. This protein is characterized by its six transmembrane domains and two heme-b redox centers, which facilitate electron transport across cellular membranes (Bérczi2023Spectral). The CYB561D1 protein plays a significant role in cellular redox reactions, including iron reduction and ascorbate regeneration, and is primarily active in the secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine and endocrine cells (Holst2023Comparison). It is expressed at higher levels in early embryonic cells, suggesting a role in development, and is involved in cell cycle progression, as evidenced by its impact on mitosis when knocked down in certain cell lines (Kiessling2010Genomewide). Despite its involvement in these critical cellular processes, the precise functions of CYB561D1 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
The CYB561D1 protein is an integral membrane protein characterized by its six transmembrane domains and two heme-b redox centers, each coordinated by four highly conserved histidine residues located in the central transmembrane helices (Bérczi2023Spectral). The primary structure of CYB561D1 consists of 229 amino acids, with a high degree of sequence identity and similarity between human and mouse versions of the protein (Bérczi2023Spectral). 

The secondary structure is dominated by transmembrane alpha-helices, which create a hydrophobic environment suitable for its function in electron transport (Bérczi2023Spectral). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices around the heme groups, facilitating electron transfer across the membrane (Bérczi2023Spectral). 

While specific details on the quaternary structure of CYB561D1 are not provided, proteins in the cytochrome b561 family often form dimers or higher-order oligomers. The protein's function is supported by its ascorbate-reducible nature, with binding sites for ascorbate and monodehydroascorbate conserved across the family (Zhang2006An). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its function or localization (Zhang2006An).

## Function
CYB561D1 is a member of the cytochrome b561 family, which are transmembrane oxidoreductases involved in electron transport across membranes. These proteins are implicated in processes such as iron reduction and ascorbate regeneration, playing a crucial role in cellular redox reactions (Holst2023Comparison). CYB561D1, specifically, is expressed at higher levels in 8-cell and human embryonic stem (hES) cells compared to fibroblasts or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, suggesting a potential role in early embryonic development and specific cell types (Kiessling2010Genomewide).

The exact function of CYB561D1 in healthy human cells remains unclear, but it is known to block mitosis when knocked down in U20S and HeLa cells, indicating its involvement in cell cycle progression (Kiessling2010Genomewide). Despite its role in mitosis, CYB561D1 does not map to the cell cycle according to DAVID analysis, highlighting the complexity of its function (Kiessling2010Genomewide). The protein is primarily active in the secretory vesicles of neuroendocrine and endocrine cells, contributing to processes like hormone biosynthesis and neurotransmitter regulation, which are essential for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.
