# TOMM20L

## Overview
TOMM20L is a gene that encodes the protein translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20 like, which is involved in the import of proteins into mitochondria. This protein is a part of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex, which plays a crucial role in the recognition and translocation of preproteins across the mitochondrial outer membrane. As a transmembrane protein, TOMM20L is integral to maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy metabolism. The proper functioning of TOMM20L is essential for mitochondrial biogenesis and homeostasis, and its dysregulation may be implicated in various mitochondrial disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
