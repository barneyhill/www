# NUDT3

## Overview
NUDT3 is a gene that encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 3, which is a member of the nudix hydrolase family. This protein functions primarily as an mRNA decapping enzyme, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of mRNA stability and turnover within human cells. By removing the 5′-m7G cap from specific mRNAs, nudix hydrolase 3 facilitates their degradation, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular processes such as migration (Sahu2020InsP7is; GrudzienNogalska2016Nudt3). The activity of nudix hydrolase 3 is modulated by the small molecule 5-InsP7, which inhibits its decapping function and stabilizes certain mRNAs (Sahu2020InsP7is). NUDT3 has been implicated in various health conditions, including obesity and uterine leiomyoma, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Dundr2023Uterine; Williams2015The).

## Function
NUDT3, or nudix hydrolase 3, functions as an mRNA decapping enzyme in human cells, playing a crucial role in regulating mRNA stability and turnover. This enzyme specifically targets a subset of mRNAs, including those involved in cell motility, such as ITGB6 and LCN2, by removing the 5′-m7G cap, which commits the mRNA to degradation (Sahu2020InsP7is; GrudzienNogalska2016Nudt3). NUDT3's activity is modulated by the small molecule 5-InsP7, which inhibits its decapping function, thereby stabilizing certain mRNAs and promoting their accumulation in processing bodies (P bodies) (Sahu2020InsP7is).

In the context of cell biology, NUDT3 is involved in modulating cell migration. Its down-regulation in MCF-7 cells leads to increased cell motility, attributed to elevated levels of ITGB6 and fibronectin (FN) mRNAs, which are crucial for cell movement (GrudzienNogalska2016Nudt3). NUDT3 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to mRNA decay and stability, influencing gene expression and cellular processes such as migration (Song2013Multiple). This enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining proper cellular function and genomic stability by regulating nucleotide pools and preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful oxidized nucleotides (Song2013Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
The NUDT3 gene has been implicated in several health conditions due to its role in metabolic processes and mRNA decapping. Alterations in NUDT3 expression have been linked to obesity, as genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NUDT3 that are significantly associated with body mass index (BMI) (Williams2015The). These SNPs are located in regulatory regions that interact with transcription factors and histone modification proteins, suggesting a complex regulatory network influencing obesity (Williams2015The).

NUDT3 is also involved in mRNA decapping, a process regulated by the inositol pyrophosphate 5-InsP7. Elevated levels of 5-InsP7 inhibit NUDT3-mediated decapping, leading to increased stability of certain mRNA transcripts. This regulation affects cellular processes and responses to stress, potentially impacting conditions like neurodegenerative diseases and aging (Sahu2020InsP7is).

In uterine leiomyoma, a specific gene fusion involving RAD51B and NUDT3 has been identified, although the clinical significance of this fusion remains unclear (Dundr2023Uterine). Despite these associations, the exact clinical implications of NUDT3 mutations or expression changes in humans require further investigation.
