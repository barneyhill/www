# DPP9

## Overview
DPP9 is a gene that encodes the protein dipeptidyl peptidase 9, a serine protease involved in various cellular processes. The DPP9 protein is characterized by its enzymatic activity, which involves cleaving N-terminal dipeptides from substrates with a proline residue at the second position. This protease is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a significant role in immune regulation, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. DPP9 is known to interact with several proteins, including the NLRP1 inflammasome and the tyrosine kinase Syk, influencing immune responses and signaling pathways. The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various diseases, such as cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2013Advances; Cui2022New; Pilla2012A).

## Structure
Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) is a serine protease composed of 863 amino acids. It shares significant structural homology with DPP8, with 61% identity and 79% similarity at the amino acid level (Zhang2013Advances). The protein is a dimer, with each monomer likely containing an α/β-hydrolase domain and an 8-blade β-propeller domain. The active site of DPP9 is located at the interface of these two domains and includes a catalytic triad composed of Ser 730, Asp 808, and His 840 (Zhang2013Advances; Cui2022New).

DPP9 lacks transmembrane regions and secretory signals, primarily localizing in the cytoplasm, but it can also be found on the surface of immune cells and in mouse serum (Cui2022New). Post-translational modifications of DPP9 may include acetylation at Lysine 51 and Lysine 314, although this has not been confirmed in vivo (Zhang2013Advances). The enzyme's activity is influenced by the redox state of its cysteines and is regulated by interaction with SUMO1, which enhances its enzymatic activity (Zhang2013Advances; Cui2022New). DPP9 has two homologous translation products, with the long-form containing a nuclear localization signal and being preferentially located in the nucleus (Cui2022New).

## Function
Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) is a serine protease involved in cleaving N-terminal dipeptides from substrates with a proline residue at the second position. It is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, influencing various cellular processes. DPP9 plays a critical role in the degradation of cytosolic proline-containing peptides, which is essential for the survival and proliferation of certain cell lines, such as human hepatoma and embryonic kidney cells (Pilla2012A). 

DPP9 is involved in immune regulation, particularly in antigen presentation. Its down-regulation increases the presentation of certain antigens on MHC class I alleles, suggesting a role in modulating immune responses (Pilla2012A; Zhang2015Identification). DPP9 also interacts with the NLRP1 inflammasome, acting as an endogenous inhibitor to maintain its inactive state, which is crucial for regulating inflammation and immune responses (Suski2020Decrease).

The enzymatic activity of DPP9 is regulated by SUMO1, a small ubiquitin-like modifier. SUMO1 binding enhances DPP9's activity, indicating that SUMO1 acts as a positive regulator (Pilla2012A). This interaction is specific to SUMO1, as SUMO2 does not have the same effect (Pilla2012A). DPP9 is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cell proliferation, influencing pathways such as the EGF-mediated PI3K/Akt pathway (Zhang2013Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the DPP9 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In cancer, DPP9 is involved in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. It is upregulated in several tumor types, including brain tumors, liver cancer, and hematological malignancies, where it affects tumor progression and patient prognosis (Cui2022New). In non-small cell lung cancer, DPP9 is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a key process in cancer metastasis (Cui2022New). Conversely, in oral squamous cell carcinoma, DPP9 overexpression inhibits tumor progression (Cui2022New).

DPP9 is also linked to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), where genetic variants such as rs12610495 are associated with increased disease risk. Altered DPP9 expression may impair epithelial barrier function, contributing to IPF pathogenesis (Singh2023Genetic). In COVID-19, elevated DPP9 levels in critically ill patients suggest its potential role in pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation regulation (Cui2022New).

In chronic kidney disease, increased DPP9 expression affects the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, promoting inflammation and fibrosis (Cui2022New). DPP9's involvement in inflammatory responses is also noted in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, where its expression influences immune regulation and inflammasome activation (Cui2022New).

## Interactions
Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. DPP9 interacts with the tyrosine kinase Syk, a central kinase in B-cell signaling. This interaction is facilitated by Filamin A (FLNA), which acts as a scaffold, recruiting DPP9 to Syk. DPP9 cleaves Syk, producing a neo N-terminus that is recognized by the E3 ligase Cbl, leading to Syk's ubiquitination and degradation. This process highlights DPP9's role as a negative regulator of Syk signaling, affecting B-cell responses (JustaSchuch2016DPP9).

DPP9 also forms a complex with NLRP1, a protein involved in inflammasome activation. The interaction involves the sequestration of the NLRP1 C-terminus by DPP9, preventing inflammasome activation. This complex formation is mediated by specific interfaces between the proteins, and the presence of inhibitors like VbP can disrupt this interaction, highlighting DPP9's regulatory role (Hollingsworth2020DPP9).

Additionally, DPP9 interacts with CARD8, forming a ternary complex that represses CARD8 inflammasome activity. The binding of DPP9 to CARD8 is crucial for preventing inflammasome formation, and inhibitors can disrupt this interaction, leading to increased inflammasome activity and cell death (Sharif2021Structural).
