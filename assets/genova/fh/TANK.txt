# TANK

## Overview
TANK, or TRAF family member associated NFKB activator, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional adaptor protein involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, a critical mediator of immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. The TANK protein is characterized by its ability to interact with TRAF family proteins, particularly TRAF2, through a specific 21-amino-acid motif known as TIMtk, facilitating the activation of NF-κB (Cheng1996TANK). As an adaptor protein, TANK plays a pivotal role in modulating signal transduction pathways by forming complexes with other signaling molecules, such as TBK1 and IKKi, which are essential for antiviral responses (Goncalves2011Functional). The protein's activity is further regulated by post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which influences its function in immune signaling (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2). Through these interactions and modifications, TANK contributes to the regulation of cytokine production and apoptosis, underscoring its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to inflammatory stimuli.

## Structure
The TANK protein, also known as TRAF family member associated NFKB activator, is involved in the regulation of NF-KB activation. Its primary structure consists of 413 amino acids, with a specific 21-amino-acid motif known as TIMtk, which is crucial for its interaction with TRAF family proteins, particularly TRAF2 (Cheng1996TANK). The secondary structure includes coiled-coil domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, essential for its role in signal transduction pathways (Cheng1996TANK).

TANK's tertiary structure is characterized by distinct functional regions, including an amino-terminal portion (TANK-N) that enhances NF-KB activity and a carboxy-terminal portion (TANK-C) that exerts a negative regulatory effect (Cheng1996TANK). The quaternary structure involves interactions with other proteins, such as TRAF2, through the TIMtk motif, which is necessary for the synergistic activation of NF-KB (Cheng1996TANK).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate TANK's activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. TANK may also have splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Cheng1996TANK). The protein's interaction with other molecules, such as NEMO and TFG, further highlights its role in complex signaling pathways (Miranda2006The).

## Function
TANK (TRAF family member associated NFKB activator) is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is essential for immune responses, inflammation, and cell survival. TANK functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating interactions between TRAF proteins and other signaling molecules. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences processes such as cytokine production and apoptosis.

In human keratinocytes, TANK is part of a complex with CARMA2sh, which is involved in controlling inflammatory pathways. This complex is significant for regulating antiviral and inflammatory immune responses. TANK promotes the activation of the IRF3/IRF7 pathway and the induction of NF-κB, both of which are crucial for immune responses (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2). The ubiquitination of TANK, particularly K63-linked ubiquitination, is important for its function in these pathways. UBAC1, a protein that interacts with CARMA2sh, promotes this ubiquitination, thereby modulating TANK's activity and influencing NF-κB signaling (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2).

TANK's role in maintaining skin homeostasis and responding to inflammatory stimuli is underscored by its involvement in the regulation of NF-κB activity, which, when dysregulated, can lead to inflammatory skin disorders (Mazzone2020UBAC1KPC2).

## Interactions
TANK (TRAF family member associated NFKB activator) is known for its interactions with various proteins involved in immune signaling pathways. It interacts with TRAF family proteins, particularly TRAF2, through a 21-amino-acid motif known as TIMtk. This interaction is crucial for the synergistic activation of NF-KB, as TANK alone only weakly activates NF-KB. The interaction between TANK and TRAF2 is necessary for overcoming TANK's autoinhibition, allowing the activation of NF-KB (Cheng1996TANK).

TANK also interacts with TBK1 and IKKi, kinases involved in antiviral responses. It binds to these kinases through a conserved TBK1/IKKi-binding domain (TBD), which is essential for the induction of IRF-dependent transcription upon viral infection. This binding is mutually exclusive with other adaptors like Sintbad and NAP1, indicating competitive interactions at the coiled-coil 2 region of TBK1 (Ryzhakov2007SINTBAD; Goncalves2011Functional).

The interactions of TANK with these proteins highlight its role in modulating both NF-KB and IRF signaling pathways, which are critical for immune and inflammatory responses (Ryzhakov2007SINTBAD; Cheng1996TANK).
