# TM7SF3

## Overview
TM7SF3 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane 7 superfamily member 3, which is categorized as a seven transmembrane orphan receptor. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis by modulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), thereby contributing to the regulation of apoptosis and cellular stress responses. TM7SF3 is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis and cell survival, particularly in pancreatic β-cells, where it acts as an anti-apoptotic factor. The protein's functions extend to the blood-brain barrier, where it participates in proton-coupled organic cation transport, influencing drug efficacy in the central nervous system. TM7SF3's expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, indicating its potential involvement in cancer pathways. Its role in cellular stress responses and protein homeostasis underscores its significance in various physiological and pathological contexts, including diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased; Isaac2016TM7SF3; Beck2011An).

## Function
TM7SF3, a gene encoding a seven transmembrane orphan receptor, plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). It is a p53-regulated homeostatic factor that helps attenuate cellular stress, thereby inhibiting apoptosis in various cell types, including pancreatic β-cells (Isaac2016TM7SF3). TM7SF3 functions as an anti-apoptotic gene by reducing caspase activity and inhibiting the expression of CHOP, a key inducer of apoptosis during sustained ER stress (Isaac2016TM7SF3).

In healthy human cells, TM7SF3 is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis and promoting cell survival by regulating the phosphorylation state of eIF2α, a key factor in global protein translation, keeping it in a dephosphorylated active state under non-stress conditions (Isaac2016TM7SF3). TM7SF3 also plays a role in the blood-brain barrier, where it is involved in proton-coupled organic cation (H+/OC) antiport, contributing to the transport of organic cations across cell membranes (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased). This function is crucial for protecting the brain's physiological function and influencing drug efficacy in the central nervous system (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TM7SF3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving cellular stress and apoptosis. TM7SF3 is known to play a protective role against endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis, which are critical factors in the pathogenesis of diabetes. In pancreatic β-cells, TM7SF3 inhibits cytokine-induced apoptosis, thereby preserving cell viability and insulin secretion. Silencing TM7SF3 leads to increased apoptosis and reduced insulin secretion, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for diabetes treatment (Beck2011An).

TM7SF3 is also involved in the regulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and cellular homeostasis. Its expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, and it forms part of a feedback loop that modulates p53 activity. This interaction suggests that TM7SF3 may have implications in cancer, where p53 pathways are often disrupted (Isaac2016TM7SF3). The gene's role in reducing ER stress and promoting cell survival suggests it could be significant in conditions characterized by protein misfolding and stress responses, such as neurodegenerative diseases (Isaac2016TM7SF3).

TM7SF3's involvement in the blood-brain barrier and its potential role in drug transport and efficacy in the central nervous system further indicate its clinical significance (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased).

## Interactions
TM7SF3, a transmembrane protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with secreted phospholipase A2 (CssPLA2) from Clonorchis sinensis, which is implicated in liver fibrosis. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, indicating that TM7SF3 may be crucial in the signaling pathways leading to liver fibrosis (Wu2021The).

TM7SF3 is also involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and cellular stress regulation. It modulates the expression of ATF4 and ATF3, key components of the UPR pathway, suggesting that TM7SF3 normally inhibits their expression. This regulation is linked to p53, as TM7SF3 expression is increased by p53 activation, indicating a regulatory loop between TM7SF3 and p53 (Isaac2016TM7SF3).

In the context of cytokine-induced apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells, TM7SF3 acts as an inhibitor, suggesting its protective role against cell death. This interaction highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like diabetes (Beck2011An). Additionally, TM7SF3 is implicated in proton-coupled organic cation antiport at the blood-brain barrier, potentially working in conjunction with LHFPL6 (Kurosawa2022ProteomicsBased).
