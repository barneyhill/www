# PLK3

## Overview
PLK3 (Polo-like kinase 3) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which is a member of the polo-like kinase family. The protein product, polo-like kinase 3, is involved in critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and stress signaling. It is characterized by a kinase domain and two C-terminal polo-box domains, which are essential for its catalytic activity and substrate binding, respectively (Helmke2015The; Ou2019Pololike). PLK3 is activated in response to genotoxic stress and plays a pivotal role in the ATM-mediated checkpoint pathway, influencing the activity of key proteins such as p53 and Chk2 (Xie2001Plk3; Bahassi2011Pololike). The protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates cellular responses to oxidative stress and hypoxic conditions (Helmke2015The). PLK3's involvement in various cancers, where it can act as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Qian2021Comprehensive; Helmke2015The).

## Structure
PLK3 (Polo-like kinase 3) is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by a primary structure that includes a kinase domain and two C-terminal polo-box domains (PBDs) (Helmke2015The; Ou2019Pololike). The kinase domain is responsible for its catalytic activity, while the PBDs are crucial for substrate binding and localization, recognizing phosphorylated serine or threonine residues (Helmke2015The). The PBDs of PLK3 share similar architectures with other members of the polo-like kinase family, selecting distinct but overlapping phosphopeptide motifs (Helmke2015The).

The secondary structure of PLK3 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of serine/threonine kinases, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, facilitating its functional interactions within the cell. PLK3 may also form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure, although this is not explicitly detailed in the context.

PLK3 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are essential for its activation and function in response to DNA damage and mitotic stress (Helmke2015The). Splice variants of PLK3 can result in different isoforms, potentially leading to distinct functional roles within the cell (Helmke2015The).

## Function
PLK3 (polo like kinase 3) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and stress signaling in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of mitotic entry and cytokinesis, as well as apoptosis. PLK3 is activated in response to DNA damage, where it participates in the ATM-mediated checkpoint pathway by phosphorylating Chk2, which in turn activates p53, a key protein in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Xie2001Plk3; Bahassi2011Pololike).

PLK3 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular processes such as proliferation and response to oxidative stress (Helmke2015The). It phosphorylates several substrates, including Cdc25C, which is involved in cell cycle arrest, and p53, enhancing its activity in response to genotoxic stress (Xie2001Plk3; Wang2002Cell). PLK3 also interacts with and phosphorylates other proteins like c-Jun, contributing to stress-mediated apoptosis (Helmke2015The).

In addition to its role in DNA damage response, PLK3 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis under oxidative stress and regulating responses to hypoxic conditions by interacting with HIF-1α (Helmke2015The). These functions highlight PLK3's importance in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cell cycle progression in response to various stressors.

## Clinical Significance
PLK3 has been implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and genetic alterations playing significant roles in disease progression and prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PLK3 expression is often reduced due to promoter hypermethylation, correlating with poor survival outcomes, suggesting a tumor-suppressor role in this context (Helmke2015The). Conversely, PLK3 is overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis, indicating a potential oncogenic role in these cancers (Helmke2015The).

In gliomas, high PLK3 expression is linked to shorter survival and more aggressive tumor characteristics, such as higher WHO grades and IDH wild-type status. This expression is associated with mutations in genes like TTN, EGFR, and PTEN, and specific somatic copy number alterations, suggesting that PLK3 could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Qian2021Comprehensive).

PLK3 also plays a role in the phosphorylation of mutant p53, enhancing its transactivation ability and promoting tumorigenicity in lung cancer cells. This interaction suggests that PLK3 could be a potential target for inhibiting tumor growth in cancers driven by mutant p53 (Vaughan2021The). These findings highlight the complex role of PLK3 in cancer biology, where its function as a tumor suppressor or oncogene may vary depending on the cancer type and genetic context.

## Interactions
PLK3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular stress responses and DNA damage pathways. It physically associates with the tumor suppressor protein p53, phosphorylating it on serine-20, which is crucial for p53's role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Xie2001Plk3; Xie2002Genotoxic). This interaction is enhanced by DNA damage, such as that induced by adriamycin (Xie2001Plk3). PLK3 also interacts with Chk2, a kinase involved in the DNA damage response. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and is enhanced upon DNA damage, suggesting that Chk2 may mediate the activation of PLK3 during genotoxic stress (Bahassi2002Mammalian; Xie2002Genotoxic).

PLK3 is involved in the phosphorylation of Chk2, potentially regulating its activity in response to stress (Bahassi2002Mammalian). It also forms complexes with mutant p53, enhancing the oncogenicity of tumor-derived mutant p53 by facilitating its interaction with transcriptional machinery components like Med17 (Vaughan2021The). These interactions highlight PLK3's role in modulating protein functions through phosphorylation and complex formation, contributing to its involvement in stress response pathways.
