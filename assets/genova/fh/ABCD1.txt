# ABCD1

## Overview
The ABCD1 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ALDP), a protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein is integral to the peroxisomal membrane and plays a pivotal role in the transport of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into peroxisomes, where they undergo β-oxidation. ALDP is a transmembrane protein that functions as a half-sized ABC transporter, requiring dimerization to become active. It can form homodimers or heterodimers with other peroxisomal ABC transporters. The proper function of ALDP is crucial for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis, and its dysfunction is associated with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a disorder characterized by the accumulation of VLCFAs, leading to severe neurological and adrenal symptoms (Morita2012Peroxisomal; Richter2020Characterization; Pujol2011The).

## Structure
The ABCD1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically involved in peroxisomal fatty acid import. The protein is composed of 745 amino acids and includes 10 exons (Kawaguchi2016ABC; Pan2005ABCD1). Structurally, ABCD1 features a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), which is crucial for ATP binding (Kumar2010Novel). The NBD contains motifs such as Walker A, Walker B, and H-loop, which are essential for its function (Kawaguchi2016ABC).

The protein functions as a half-sized ABC transporter and requires dimerization to be active, forming either homodimers or heterodimers (Richter2020Characterization). The COOH-terminal region, particularly between amino acids 672 and 693, is critical for dimerization, while the region from amino acids 694 to 745 is essential for correct folding (Kawaguchi2016ABC). Missense mutations in the COOH-terminal nucleotide-binding domains often lead to protein instability and degradation, affecting dimerization (Kawaguchi2016ABC).

No specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are discussed in the provided context (Kawaguchi2016ABC). The protein's dysfunction is linked to X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, a disorder characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (Richter2020Characterization).

## Function
The ABCD1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically subfamily D. This protein, known as the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP), is located in the peroxisomal membrane and plays a crucial role in the transport of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into peroxisomes for β-oxidation (Morita2012Peroxisomal; Pujol2011The). In healthy human cells, this process is essential for maintaining normal levels of VLCFAs in plasma and tissues, preventing their accumulation, which is associated with the development of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) (Mallack2022Structure).

The ABCD1 protein functions as a homodimer and is involved in the transport of various VLCFA-CoA forms, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated types, across peroxisomal membranes (Morita2012Peroxisomal; Imanaka2019Biogenesis). This transport is critical for the subsequent β-oxidation of VLCFAs, a process important for cellular lipid homeostasis (Imanaka2019Biogenesis). The protein's activity is influenced by cholesterol levels, suggesting a potential link between ABCD1 function and cholesterol metabolism, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Morita2012Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCD1 gene lead to X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in tissues, particularly affecting the nervous system and adrenal glands. X-ALD presents with a wide range of clinical phenotypes, including childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD), adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), and Addison's disease. CCALD is the most severe form, typically manifesting in boys aged 3 to 10 years, leading to progressive cerebral demyelination and often resulting in a vegetative state or death within a few years (Kemp2011Mammalian; Kumar2011Genomic).

AMN usually presents in adulthood with progressive myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy, and about 35% of AMN patients develop cerebral involvement later in life (Morita2012A; Kumar2011Genomic). The disorder is recessive and primarily affects males, though heterozygous females may develop symptoms due to skewed X-inactivation (Berger2015The). There is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation, meaning identical mutations can result in different clinical outcomes (Kemp2011Mammalian; Kumar2011Genomic). The ABCD1 Variant Database catalogs pathogenic and benign variants, aiding in the analysis and reporting of novel variants (Mallack2022Structure).

## Interactions
The ABCD1 gene encodes the ALDP protein, which is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for fatty acid metabolism. ALDP forms homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with other peroxisomal ABC transporters, such as PMP70 and ALDR, at the peroxisomal membrane (Hillebrand2012Identification). It interacts with proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, including ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), fatty-acid synthase (FASN), and FATP4 (Hillebrand2012Identification). These interactions are essential for the transport and metabolism of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) into the peroxisome for β-oxidation (Hillebrand2012Identification).

Mutations in the ABCD1 gene can alter these interactions. For instance, the G116R mutation enhances the interaction between ALDP and ACLY, while S514N and G607D mutations increase the interaction between ALDP and FASN. However, none of the studied mutations affect the interaction between ALDP and FATP4 (Hillebrand2012Identification). ALDP also interacts with PEX19, a protein involved in peroxisomal membrane protein targeting, and forms complexes with other peroxisomal proteins such as ALDH3A2, FAR1, and PEX5, indicating its broader role in peroxisomal organization and lipid metabolism (LotzHavla2021iBRET).
