# CDKL3

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 3 (CDKL3) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is part of the cyclin-dependent kinase-like (CDKL) family. The protein product, also named CDKL3, is characterized by a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a unique C-terminal aJ helix, which is essential for its kinase activity and distinguishes it from other family members (Canning2018CDKL). CDKL3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and brain development, and is expressed in multiple tissues, with the highest levels observed in the spleen and brain (Dubos2008Inactivation). The protein interacts with several key molecules, such as cyclins and the retinoblastoma protein, playing a significant role in cell cycle progression and cancer development (Zhang2024CDKL3). Alterations in CDKL3 expression have been linked to mental retardation and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Dubos2008Inactivation; He2020CDKL3).

## Structure
CDKL3 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase-like (CDKL) family, characterized by a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a variable C-terminal region. The kinase domain of CDKL3 exhibits a classic bilobal architecture, typical of many kinases, and includes a unique C-terminal aJ helix. This aJ helix is crucial for the kinase activity of CDKL3, as it occupies a site equivalent to the MAPK common docking groove, partially occluding the recruitment site for MAPK substrates (Canning2018CDKL). The presence of this helix distinguishes CDKL3 from other family members like CDKL1 and CDKL5, which lack this region (Canning2018CDKL).

CDKL3's structure allows for the binding of broad-spectrum ATP-competitive inhibitors at the kinase hinge region, with specific interactions such as hydrogen bonds involving catalytic lysines (Canning2018CDKL). Despite its structural similarities to cyclin-dependent kinases, CDKL3 likely does not bind cyclins due to bulky substitutions in its structure (Canning2018CDKL). The protein is also involved in phosphorylation activities, such as the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation (Zhang2024CDKL3). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
CDKL3 (cyclin-dependent kinase-like 3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a role in various cellular processes, particularly in development and brain function. It is a member of the cdc2-related kinase family, sharing similarities with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) (Dubos2008Inactivation). CDKL3 contains a potential MAPK activation motif (TDY) and sites for cdk regulation, and its kinase activity is induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), requiring phosphorylation of the TDY motif for activation (Dubos2008Inactivation).

The protein is localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in general cellular functions, with a significant role in brain development and function. It is expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest levels in the spleen and brain (Dubos2008Inactivation). In mouse models, CDKL3 is expressed in all brain subregions and is regulated during early embryogenesis, indicating its importance in brain development (Dubos2008Inactivation).

Structurally, CDKL3 features a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a unique C-terminal aJ helix, which is crucial for its kinase activity. This aJ helix occupies a site equivalent to the MAPK common docking groove, suggesting that CDKL3 may mediate alternative protein interactions compared to other kinases (Canning2018CDKL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CDKL3 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A balanced translocation involving the CDKL3 gene has been associated with mild nonspecific mental retardation. This translocation disrupts the CDKL3 gene, leading to a significant decrease in its mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of CDKL3 contributes to the mental retardation phenotype (Dubos2008Inactivation).

In cancer, CDKL3 is implicated in the progression of various types. In osteosarcoma, CDKL3 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and is associated with enhanced Akt phosphorylation, which promotes cancer cell growth and survival (He2020CDKL3). In prostate cancer, CDKL3 is significantly upregulated and promotes tumor growth by regulating STAT1, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jiang2023Inhibition). CDKL3 also plays a role in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by targeting ATG5, promoting tumor growth and invasion, and is associated with poor prognosis (Zhou2020CDKL3). These findings highlight CDKL3's involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CDKL3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and cancer progression. It binds with cyclins A2, B1, D1, and E1, with a consistent interaction with cyclin A2 across different cell cycle phases. This interaction is crucial for CDKL3's function in promoting cell cycle progression (Zhang2024CDKL3). CDKL3 also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), phosphorylating it in the presence of cyclins A2 and E1, which is essential for cell cycle entry (Zhang2024CDKL3).

CDKL3 phosphorylates CDK4 at T172, preventing its ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation and stabilizing it, which is critical for cell cycle progression. This phosphorylation is facilitated by cyclin A2, highlighting the importance of CDKL3's interaction with cyclin A2 and CDK4 in regulating the G1/S phase transition (Zhang2024CDKL3).

In prostate cancer, CDKL3 influences STAT1 expression by affecting its ubiquitination and degradation through interaction with the E3 ligase CBL, suggesting a regulatory role in cancer progression (Jiang2023Inhibition). CDKL3 also interacts with Akt, enhancing its phosphorylation and activation, which is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation (He2020CDKL3).
