# IL34

## Overview
IL34 is a gene that encodes the cytokine interleukin 34 (IL-34), which is a significant player in immune regulation and cellular communication. IL-34 is categorized as a cytokine and functions primarily as a ligand for the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), influencing the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of monocytes and macrophages (Ge2020Biological). The protein is characterized by a unique structure, forming a noncovalently linked homodimer that interacts with CSF-1R through hydrophobic interactions, resulting in potent transmembrane signaling (Baghdadi2018Interleukin34). IL-34 is predominantly expressed in the brain and skin, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining microglial homeostasis and the development of tissue macrophages such as Langerhans cells (Lelios2020Emerging). Beyond its physiological roles, IL-34 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chhetri2021Emerging; Lelios2020Emerging).

## Structure
Interleukin 34 (IL-34) is a cytokine characterized by a unique molecular structure. The primary structure of human IL-34 consists of 242 amino acids, with notable N-glycosylation sites at Asn76 and Asn100, which are crucial for its stability and proper folding (Udomsinprasert2019Interleukin34; Baghdadi2018Interleukin34). The secondary structure of IL-34 includes an antiparallel four-helical bundle core, with two additional helices and two short β-strands connecting the helices (Liu2012The; Baghdadi2018Interleukin34). 

The tertiary structure of IL-34 is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bridges, specifically between Cys35-Cys180 and Cys177-Cys191 (Baghdadi2018Interleukin34). IL-34 forms a noncovalently linked homodimer, which is its quaternary structure, by packing two protomers head-to-head (Baghdadi2018Interleukin34). 

IL-34 can also form a heterodimeric cytokine with CSF-1, although this interaction is of low affinity (Baghdadi2018Interleukin34). The protein's structure allows it to bind to the CSF-1R receptor, with the interaction characterized by hydrophobic interactions that result in longer and stronger transmembrane signals compared to the CSF-1:CSF-1R complex (Baghdadi2018Interleukin34). IL-34 also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms that can affect its biological activity (Baghdadi2018Interleukin34).

## Function
Interleukin 34 (IL-34) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of certain tissue macrophages, particularly Langerhans cells (LCs) and microglia. It is primarily expressed in the brain and skin, where it is produced by neurons and keratinocytes, respectively (Lelios2020Emerging). IL-34 functions as a ligand for the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), promoting the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of monocytes and macrophages (Ge2020Biological). 

In the brain, IL-34 is essential for maintaining microglial homeostasis, especially in regions with high IL-34 expression, such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Freuchet2021IL34). It is also involved in the differentiation of a novel type of monocytic cell, termed follicular dendritic cell-induced monocytic cells (FDMCs), through CSF-1R signaling (Ogawa2019Interleukin). 

IL-34's role extends to the immune system, where it influences macrophage activity and cytokine production. It promotes the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10 and CCL17, while CSF-1, another ligand for CSF-1R, leads to higher levels of MCP-1 (Lelios2020Emerging). This cytokine is also implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its importance in immune regulation (Ge2020Biological).

## Clinical Significance
IL34 (interleukin 34) is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), IL34 is overexpressed in synovial tissue, contributing to inflammation and bone erosion. Blocking IL34 can reduce inflammation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Chhetri2021Emerging; Masteller2014Targeting). Elevated IL34 levels are also observed in Sjogren's syndrome, where it correlates with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating its role in disease pathogenesis (Baghdadi2017Interleukin).

In heart failure, IL34 is associated with inflammation and poor outcomes, correlating with kidney dysfunction (Baghdadi2017Interleukin). It is also linked to insulin resistance in obesity and elevated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where it enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Chhetri2021Emerging; Baghdadi2017Interleukin). In cancer, IL34 is associated with poor prognosis in osteosarcoma, lung, and breast cancer, promoting tumor progression through tumor-associated macrophages (Lelios2020Emerging).

IL34's role in neurodegenerative diseases includes enhancing microglial neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a potential therapeutic role (Chhetri2021Emerging). Despite its association with disease severity, the exact mechanisms of IL34 in these conditions remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
Interleukin 34 (IL-34) is a cytokine that interacts with several receptors and proteins, playing a significant role in immune regulation. IL-34 primarily binds to the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), where it exhibits a higher binding affinity than CSF-1, leading to stronger tyrosine phosphorylation of CSF-1R and its downstream signaling molecules (Liu2012The; Baghdadi2018Interleukin34). This interaction is characterized by hydrophobic interactions rather than salt bridge networks (Baghdadi2018Interleukin34).

IL-34 also interacts with other receptors such as PTPζ and CD138. PTPζ is primarily expressed in the brain and is involved in cell migration and differentiation, while CD138 is a proteoglycan expressed on epithelial cells and monocytes/macrophages. IL-34's binding to these receptors influences signaling pathways and cellular behaviors, such as migration (Freuchet2021IL34).

Additionally, IL-34 interacts with the molecular chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) on the cell surface, which is crucial for the differentiation of monocytic cells. This interaction regulates IL-34's cell-surface localization and its biological function in monocytic cell differentiation (Ogawa2019Interleukin). These interactions highlight IL-34's complex role in immune cell regulation and its potential implications in disease contexts.
