# MYH7B

## Overview
The MYH7B gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 7B protein, a member of the myosin superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in muscle contraction and cellular movement. This protein is categorized as a motor protein due to its involvement in converting chemical energy into mechanical force, essential for muscle function. MYH7B is expressed in various tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscles, where it contributes to the contractile properties of slow-twitch muscle fibers, thereby enhancing muscle endurance and efficiency (Warkman2012Developmental; Lee2020Functional). The gene is also involved in the regulation of the intronic microRNA miR-499, which is crucial for muscle development and function (Yeung2012Myh7bmiR499). Mutations in MYH7B have been linked to several disorders, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and congenital myopathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2020MYH7B; Esposito2013Digenic). The gene's expression and function are regulated by complex transcriptional networks, underscoring its evolutionary conservation and importance across species (Warkman2012Developmental).

## Structure
The MYH7B gene encodes a myosin heavy chain protein that is a crucial component of muscle contraction. The primary structure of MYH7B consists of nearly 2000 amino acid residues, with a molecular weight of approximately 220 kDa (Warkman2012Developmental). The protein includes a C-terminal linear helical domain that forms a rigid coiled structure by intertwining with another MYH protein, and an N-terminal globular head containing the ATP catalytic site and the actin-binding domain (Warkman2012Developmental).

The secondary structure of MYH7B is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets. A specific mutation, R890C, induces a conformational change in the protein, altering these secondary structures (Esposito2013Digenic). This mutation affects the beta strands and alpha helix structures, as shown by bioinformatics simulation models (Esposito2013Digenic).

MYH7B is expressed in the myocardium and other muscle tissues, and its expression is regulated by transcription factors such as MEF2, GATA, and E-box elements (Warkman2012Developmental). The gene is evolutionarily conserved across species, indicating its functional importance (Warkman2012Developmental). In mammals, alternative splicing events can prevent the expression of the full-length protein, suggesting the presence of other functional molecules, such as a long noncoding RNA (lncMYH7b) (Broadwell2021Myosin).

## Function
The MYH7B gene encodes a myosin heavy chain protein that is involved in muscle contraction and cellular movement. In humans, MYH7B is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain, although its expression levels vary across these tissues (Warkman2012Developmental). In the heart, MYH7B is associated with the regulation of sarcomere organization and function, playing a crucial role in maintaining proper cardiac muscle cell health (Broadwell2021Myosin).

MYH7B is part of the sarcomeric myosin gene family and is involved in the contractile function of cardiac and skeletal muscles. It is expressed in slow-twitch muscle fibers, contributing to muscle endurance and efficiency (Lee2020Functional). The gene's expression is regulated by complex transcriptional networks, including muscle regulatory factors and the transcription factor Eos, which influence its activity in muscle cells (Yeung2012Myh7bmiR499).

In addition to its role in muscle tissues, MYH7B is involved in the expression of the intronic microRNA miR-499, which is important for muscle function and development (Yeung2012Myh7bmiR499). The gene's regulation through nonproductive splicing allows for the independent modulation of miR-499 and MYH7B protein levels, which may be a strategy for uncoupling host gene-microRNA expression (Bell2010Uncoupling).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYH7B gene have been implicated in several cardiac and muscular disorders. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one such condition associated with MYH7B variants. Studies have identified MYH7B variants in patients with HCM, suggesting that these mutations may contribute to the disease by activating the CaMK-signaling pathway, which plays a role in cardiac hypertrophy (Chen2020MYH7B). In animal models, Myh7b knockout rats exhibited spontaneous HCM phenotypes, including cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, further supporting the gene's involvement in this condition (Chen2020MYH7B).

MYH7B mutations are also linked to congenital myopathy with left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC). The R890C mutation in MYH7B has been associated with LVNC, characterized by a trabecular meshwork and deep myocardial recesses in the left ventricle. This mutation is thought to induce conformational changes in the MYH7B protein, affecting its function (Esposito2013Digenic).

Additionally, MYH7B mutations have been associated with sensorineural hereditary hearing loss. Compound heterozygous missense mutations in MYH7B were identified in families with severe hearing loss, suggesting a role for the gene in auditory function (Haraksingh2014Exome).

## Interactions
The MYH7B gene encodes a protein that is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in muscle function and regulation. One notable interaction involves the transcriptional regulation of the Myh7b gene, where the protein interacts with transcription factors such as MyoD and Eos. Eos, a member of the Ikaros family, interacts with MyoD through its activation domain and basic helix-loop-helix domain, suggesting a physical interaction on chromatin to activate transcription. This interaction was confirmed through GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Yeung2012Myh7bmiR499).

MYH7B is also implicated in the regulation of myosin gene expression through the miR-499/Sox6 pathway. Eos knockdown leads to decreased miR-499 levels, resulting in increased Sox6 expression, which represses myosin genes like Myh1 and Myh7 (Yeung2012Myh7bmiR499). Additionally, MYH7B variants have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy through the activation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) signaling pathway. This involves interactions with proteins such as CaMK2D and myocyte enhancer factors like MEF2D, which are up-regulated in Myh7b knockout models (Chen2020MYH7B). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory roles of MYH7B in muscle and cardiac tissues.
