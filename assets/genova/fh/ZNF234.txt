# ZNF234

## Overview
ZNF234 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 234, which is categorized as a transcription factor. This protein is involved in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and promoter-promoter interactions. It is particularly noted for its weak binding to transcription factors such as HCFC1 and ZNF143, and its lack of interaction with other promoters, making it a useful negative control in studies of chromatin looping (Liu2022HiTrAC). ZNF234 is also implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle, specifically the G2/M transition, and is responsive to cellular stress, such as treatment with frankincense oil, where it is up-regulated to potentially mediate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Frank2009Frankincense; Ou2005ZNF328). Additionally, ZNF234 has been identified as hypermethylated in certain pathological conditions, suggesting its involvement in disease processes (Virakul2021Integrative).

## Function
ZNF234 is a zinc finger protein that plays a role in transcriptional regulation, challenging the previous belief that spermatozoa are transcriptionally inert. It suggests that spermatozoa may deliver transcription factors to the oocyte, potentially influencing early embryonic development (de2007Marked). ZNF234 is involved in chromatin structure organization and gene expression regulation, particularly in promoter-promoter interactions. It serves as a negative control in studies of chromatin looping, as it has weak binding of transcription factors HCFC1 and ZNF143 and does not interact with other promoters (Liu2022HiTrAC). 

ZNF234 is also implicated in the regulation of the G2/M transition in the cell cycle, suggesting a role in cell cycle control (Ou2005ZNF328). In the context of cellular stress, such as treatment with frankincense oil, ZNF234 is up-regulated, indicating its involvement in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Frank2009Frankincense). Additionally, ZNF234 has been identified as hypermethylated in certain pathological conditions, although its specific role in healthy cells remains less clear (Virakul2021Integrative). These findings suggest that ZNF234 may have diverse roles in cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control.
