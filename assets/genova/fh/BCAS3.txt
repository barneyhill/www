# BCAS3

## Overview
BCAS3 (Breast Carcinoma Amplified Sequence 3) is a gene that encodes the BCAS3 microtubule-associated cell migration factor, a cytoskeletal protein involved in critical cellular processes such as cell migration and angiogenesis. The BCAS3 protein is characterized by an N-terminal WD40 repeat domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, DNA, and lipids, playing a pivotal role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular motility (Kojima2021Mammalian; Jain2012RudhiraBCAS3). This protein is essential for the organization of microtubules and intermediate filaments, contributing to cell shape maintenance and movement, particularly in endothelial cells during blood vessel formation (Jain2012RudhiraBCAS3). BCAS3's involvement in angiogenesis and its interactions with various proteins underscore its significance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (Hengel2021Biallelic; Zhou2021BCAS3).

## Structure
The BCAS3 protein contains a predicted N-terminal WD40 repeat domain, characterized by tandem repeats of 40-60 amino acids terminating in a Trp-Asp (WD) dipeptide. This domain forms a 7-bladed β-propeller structure, which acts as a scaffold for protein-protein, protein-DNA, and protein-lipid interactions (Kojima2021Mammalian). The WD40 repeat domain includes phosphoinositide-binding pockets, with specific sites identified for binding sulfate ions, which are chemically similar to phosphate ions. These sites are crucial for BCAS3's recruitment to the phagophore assembly site during autophagy (Kojima2021Mammalian).

The secondary structure of BCAS3 includes helices, strands, and disordered regions, as predicted by PSIPRED and DISOPRED3 (Kojima2021Mammalian). The tertiary structure is depicted as a 3D model, highlighting the phospholipid-binding pockets within the WD40 repeat domain (Kojima2021Mammalian). The quaternary structure involves the BCAS3-C16orf70 complex, which binds to PtdIns3P-containing liposomes, indicating a functional interaction with membranes (Kojima2021Mammalian).

BCAS3 is also involved in post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function. Splice variant isoforms of BCAS3 can result in different protein structures and functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
The BCAS3 gene encodes a cytoskeletal protein that plays a significant role in cell migration and angiogenesis. In healthy human cells, BCAS3 is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in the organization of microtubules and intermediate filaments, which are crucial for maintaining cell shape and facilitating motility (Jain2012RudhiraBCAS3). BCAS3 is active in the cytoplasm and is essential for processes like angiogenesis, where it promotes the activation and recruitment of Cdc42, a small GTPase that regulates cell polarity and directional migration (Jain2012RudhiraBCAS3).

BCAS3's role in angiogenesis is highlighted by its involvement in endothelial cell migration and tube formation, critical steps in blood vessel development (Jain2012RudhiraBCAS3). The protein's interaction with cytoskeletal components suggests it facilitates crosstalk between microtubules and intermediate filaments, which is vital for cell motility and polarity (Jain2012RudhiraBCAS3). BCAS3 is transiently expressed during normal adult angiogenesis, indicating its role in regulated blood vessel formation and its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes related to vascular development (Jain2012RudhiraBCAS3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BCAS3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants in BCAS3 have been linked to a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, and motor dysfunction, including hyperreflexia and spasticity of the lower limbs. Some affected individuals also experience seizures and pharmaco-resistant epilepsy (Hengel2021Biallelic).

In the context of cancer, BCAS3 is implicated in breast cancer, where it is often amplified and overexpressed. This overexpression is associated with increased tumor growth, reduced apoptosis, and chemoresistance. BCAS3 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor suppressor gene p53, contributing to tumor initiation and progression. High BCAS3 expression correlates with a more malignant phenotype and shorter overall survival in breast cancer patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhou2021BCAS3).

BCAS3 is also expressed in various brain tumors and inflammatory brain abscesses, indicating a role in tumor angiogenesis. Its expression is associated with the vascular components of neoplasms, particularly in high-grade tumors like glioblastoma, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression and neo-angiogenesis (Siva2007Human).

## Interactions
BCAS3 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In the context of breast cancer, BCAS3 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 and DDB1, a component of the CRL4A complex. This interaction is mediated through the WD40 domain of BCAS3, which binds to the BPA domain of DDB1, promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of p53, thereby influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Zhou2021BCAS3).

BCAS3 also forms a heterodimer with C16orf70, and this complex is involved in autophagy. The interaction between BCAS3 and C16orf70 is crucial for their recruitment to damaged mitochondria during PRKN-mediated mitophagy. This interaction is dependent on specific residues of BCAS3 and is essential for the localization of both proteins around damaged mitochondria (Kojima2021Mammalian).

In addition, BCAS3 interacts with KnkA in Dictyostelium discoideum, where both proteins are involved in autophagy. BCAS3's phospholipid-binding domain is crucial for its interaction with KnkA, and this interaction is necessary for the regulation of autophagy (Yamada2020The).
