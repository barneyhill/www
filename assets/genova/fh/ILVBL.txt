# ILVBL

## Overview
The ILVBL gene encodes the ilvB acetolactate synthase-like protein, which is involved in critical metabolic pathways, including the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids and fatty acid alpha-oxidation. This protein is categorized as an enzyme due to its role in catalyzing reactions within these pathways. ILVBL is expressed in various tissues, underscoring its significance in cellular metabolism and energy production. The protein's activity is particularly notable in the mitochondria, where it contributes to energy metabolism and is implicated in the regulation of energy pathways in the placenta, potentially affecting fetal development. Additionally, ILVBL is homologous to yeast acetolactate synthase and is involved in the formation of dimethylglyoxal, a reactive metabolite, especially under conditions such as hypoxia where the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is inhibited (Rhein2024The; Tesfaye2023Prenatal).

## Structure


## Function
The ILVBL gene encodes a protein involved in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids, specifically isoleucine and valine, and plays a role in fatty acid alpha-oxidation within the endoplasmic reticulum. This gene is widely expressed across various tissues, indicating its importance in cellular metabolism and energy production (Tesfaye2023Prenatal). In mammals, ILVBL is homologous to yeast acetolactate synthase and is implicated in the formation of dimethylglyoxal, a reactive metabolite derived from pyruvate. This process is particularly relevant under conditions where the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is inhibited, such as during hypoxia (Rhein2024The).

ILVBL's activity in the mitochondria contributes to cellular energy metabolism, and its expression is linked to the regulation of energy pathways in the placenta, potentially influencing fetal development (Tesfaye2023Prenatal). The gene's involvement in these metabolic pathways suggests it may have broader implications for organismal energy homeostasis and metabolic health. Additionally, ILVBL has been associated with the production of dimethylglyoxal in brain endothelial cells, which may have implications for neurological health, particularly under stress conditions like hyperglycemia (Rhein2024The).

## Clinical Significance
The ILVBL gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily through its association with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In a study involving asthma patients, polymorphisms in the ILVBL gene were significantly associated with an increased risk of AERD. Specifically, seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were linked to AERD risk, with the SNP rs1468198 notably associated with the percent decline in forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) following an aspirin challenge (Chang2017Association).

In the context of lung cancer, ILVBL is up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis. The gene's expression is potentially regulated by transcription factors such as ETV1, ETV4, and ETV6, which may contribute to the proliferation of LUAD (Hang2022Identification).

While ILVBL has been identified within a chromosomal region associated with syndromic obesity, there is no direct evidence linking mutations in ILVBL to obesity-related conditions (D’Angelo2018Chromosomal). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical significance of ILVBL in these and other conditions.
