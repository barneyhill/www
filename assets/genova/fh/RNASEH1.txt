# RNASEH1

## Overview
RNASEH1 is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease H1 protein, a critical enzyme involved in the processing of RNA/DNA hybrids. This enzyme is categorized as a ribonuclease and plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by degrading the RNA component of these hybrids. Ribonuclease H1 is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, where it is essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and maintenance, as well as for resolving R-loops that can interfere with DNA replication and transcription (Reyes2020RNase; Reyes2015RNASEH1). The enzyme's structure includes a catalytic domain and a hybrid-binding domain, which are crucial for its function (González2020A; Hyjek2019RNases). Mutations in the RNASEH1 gene are linked to mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular health and function (Reyes2020RNase; Reyes2015RNASEH1).

## Structure
The human RNASEH1 gene encodes the ribonuclease H1 enzyme, which is involved in processing RNA/DNA hybrids. The enzyme's structure includes a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal hybrid-binding domain (HBD), connected by an extended linker. The catalytic domain contains a conserved DEDD motif essential for its enzymatic activity (González2020A; Hyjek2019RNases). The overall fold of the catalytic domain is similar to the canonical RNase H fold, characterized by three α-helices on one side of a central β-sheet (Hyjek2019RNases).

The enzyme's tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape, with the catalytic domain adopting a structure that facilitates interaction with RNA/DNA hybrids. The HBD is crucial for high-affinity binding to these hybrids, and its presence is necessary for the enzyme's function (González2020A). The RNase H1 protein also features a basic protrusion, which forms a DNA recognition surface, although this feature is absent in some RNase H1 proteins from other species (Hyjek2019RNases).

The RNASEH1 enzyme may exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can influence its activity and localization, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The enzyme's quaternary structure is less defined, but it is suggested to function as a monomer.

## Function
RNASEH1 encodes ribonuclease H1, an enzyme crucial for maintaining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity and function in healthy human cells. It is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, where it degrades the RNA component of RNA-DNA hybrids, a process essential for proper mtDNA replication and maintenance (Reyes2020RNase; Reyes2015RNASEH1). In mitochondria, RNase H1 is involved in the removal of RNA primers during mtDNA replication, preventing the accumulation of pathological R-loops that can block transcription and lead to genomic instability (Posse2019RNase; Reyes2020RNase).

RNase H1 also plays a role in regulating mitochondrial transcription and translation by degrading 7S RNA, which is necessary for proper transcription initiation of mtDNA (Reyes2020RNase). The enzyme's activity ensures the stability and proper functioning of mitochondrial transcripts, including those for complexes I and IV, and maintains the balance of mitochondrial rRNAs, which are essential for mitochondrial ribosome function (Reyes2020RNase).

In the nucleus, RNase H1 helps maintain genome integrity by resolving R-loops, which can interfere with DNA replication and transcription if not properly managed (Suzuki2010An). The regulation of RNase H1 levels is crucial, as excessive amounts in mitochondria can lead to growth defects, while high levels in the nucleus do not have deleterious effects (Suzuki2010An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNASEH1 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, primarily affecting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and maintenance. These mutations can lead to conditions such as adult-onset mitochondrial encephalomyopathy and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). Specific mutations, including c.424G>A (p.Val142Ile), c.469C>T (p.Arg157*), and c.554C>T (p.Ala185Val), have been identified as impairing the RNase H1 catalytic domain, resulting in decreased enzyme activity and mitochondrial dysfunction (Reyes2020RNase; Reyes2015RNASEH1).

Patients with RNASEH1 mutations often present with symptoms such as muscle weakness, ptosis, dysphagia, cerebellar ataxia, and respiratory impairment. These clinical manifestations are linked to mtDNA depletion and multiple mtDNA deletions, which disrupt mitochondrial transcription and translation (Manini2022Case; CarreñoGago2019Identification). The mutations can lead to decreased protein levels due to nonsense-mediated decay, affecting mitochondrial transcription and translation, particularly reducing transcripts for complexes I and IV (Reyes2020RNase).

RNASEH1 mutations also result in increased levels of non-coding 7S RNA, which may interfere with mitochondrial transcription, and reduced mitochondrial rRNA levels, contributing to mitochondrial translation defects (Reyes2020RNase). These alterations in mitochondrial function are evidenced by changes in mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential, and slower cell growth in affected individuals (Reyes2015RNASEH1).

## Interactions
RNASEH1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to RNA/DNA hybrids, a function confirmed by its identification in studies using pull-down assays with human B-cell extracts, where it was shown to interact with over 800 proteins, including DDX5, NONO, and SUPT5H (Wang2018Human). RNASEH1's interaction with RNA/DNA hybrids is crucial for its role in degrading the RNA strand of these hybrids, a process essential for maintaining genomic stability.

RNASEH1 also forms complexes with phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (PS-ASOs) and proteins such as P54nrb and PSF. These interactions are particularly noted with toxic PS-ASOs, which lead to the mislocalization of P54nrb and PSF to nucleoli, causing nucleolar stress and cellular toxicity (Vickers2019Kinetic). The binding of PS-ASOs to RNASEH1 involves interactions with both the hybrid binding domain and the catalytic domain, with the hybrid binding domain contributing more to the overall affinity (Vickers2019Kinetic).

Additionally, RNASEH1 interacts with Replication Protein A (RPA), which enhances its activity on R loops. This interaction is crucial for RNASEH1's ability to suppress R loops and prevent genomic instability (Nguyen2017Functions).
