# NCR3

## Overview
NCR3 is a gene that encodes the natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3, commonly referred to as NKp30, which is a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the function of natural killer (NK) cells, where it is involved in the recognition and elimination of tumor cells and virally infected cells. NKp30 is characterized by its single immunoglobulin V-like domain, which is essential for ligand recognition and binding, and is connected to the transmembrane region by a short stalk domain. The receptor is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, each with distinct roles in immune responses. NKp30's interactions with ligands such as B7-H6 and BAG-6 are crucial for its function in immune surveillance and modulation. Alterations in the NCR3 gene and its encoded receptor have been associated with various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Pazina2017Regulation; Herrmann2014Homooligomerization; Barrow2019The; Biassoni2009Human).

## Structure
The NCR3 gene encodes the NKp30 receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein structure includes a single immunoglobulin V-like domain, which is crucial for ligand recognition and binding (Biassoni2009Human). This domain is connected to the transmembrane region via a short stalk domain, which plays a significant role in the oligomerization of NKp30, enhancing ligand binding affinity through avidity effects (Herrmann2014Homooligomerization). The transmembrane region contains an aminoterminal arginine residue, which is important for stabilizing interactions with adaptor molecules (Biassoni2009Human).

NKp30 undergoes N-linked glycosylation, a post-translational modification essential for its ligand binding capabilities (Herrmann2014Homooligomerization). The receptor is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, resulting in variations in the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. These isoforms include NKp30a, NKp30b, and NKp30c, each with distinct functional roles in immune responses (Pazina2017Regulation). The oligomerization of NKp30 occurs at two distinct sites: within the Ig domain and the membrane-proximal stalk domain, which is proposed to enhance ligand binding and signaling, particularly in tumor immunosurveillance (Herrmann2014Homooligomerization).

## Function
The NCR3 gene encodes the NKp30 receptor, a crucial component of the immune system expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. NKp30 is involved in the recognition and destruction of tumor cells and virally infected cells, playing a significant role in immune surveillance. It interacts with ligands such as B7-H6, which is upregulated on tumor cells, leading to NK cell activation and target cell cytolysis (Kinlein2021Analysis; Barrow2019The). 

In healthy human cells, NKp30 is primarily active at the cell surface, where it mediates cytotoxicity and cytokine production. It is involved in the regulation of interactions between NK cells and dendritic cells, promoting the secretion of T helper 1 (TH1) cytokines like interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma (IFNγ) (Rusakiewicz2013NCR3NKp30). The receptor's activity is determined by the balance of its activating and inhibitory isoforms, which can influence immune responses and outcomes in various diseases (Barrow2019The).

NKp30 also plays a role in the immune response to pathogens, including viruses and fungi, by binding to specific ligands on these pathogens and facilitating their destruction by NK cells (Barrow2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the NCR3 gene, which encodes the NKp30 receptor, have been implicated in various diseases. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the expression of NKp30 is altered, with a lower percentage of NKp30+ NK cells in peripheral blood but enrichment in tumor tissue. This suggests impaired cytotoxic function due to different NKp30 isoforms and the tumor's cytokine environment, contributing to immune escape mechanisms (WANG2023Altered).

In autoimmune diseases, such as primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), genetic polymorphisms in the NCR3 gene are associated with disease pathogenesis. A specific variant in the promoter region is linked to reduced NKp30 expression, providing protection against pSS. NKp30's interaction with its ligand B7-H6 on salivary gland epithelial cells is implicated in disease progression (Rusakiewicz2013NCR3NKp30).

In infectious diseases, NCR3 variants influence susceptibility to malaria. The rs2736191-C allele is associated with a higher risk of mild malaria, while the rs11575837 variant is linked to increased risk of pediatric malaria and severe malarial anemia (Onyango2023Human; Baaklini2017Beyond).

In cancer, the expression of different NKp30 isoforms affects clinical outcomes. The immunosuppressive NKp30c isoform is associated with poor prognosis in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and neuroblastoma, while the immunostimulatory NKp30a/b isoforms are linked to better outcomes (Pazina2017Regulation).

## Interactions
NCR3, also known as NKp30, is a natural cytotoxicity receptor that plays a significant role in immune responses by interacting with various ligands. One of its primary interactions is with the tumor cell ligand B7-H6, a member of the B7 family. This interaction is crucial for NK cell activation, leading to cytotoxicity and cytokine production. B7-H6 is typically expressed on tumor cells and certain immune cells under specific conditions, but not on healthy cells (Pazina2017Regulation; Brandt2009The; Li2011Structure).

The NKp30-B7-H6 interaction involves a small interface characterized by high shape complementarity, primarily through hydrophobic interactions. The complex has a solvent-accessible surface area of 1,130 Å², with the FG loop of B7-H6 playing a significant role in the interaction (Li2011Structure). This interaction can be inhibited by the shedding of B7-H6 through metalloproteases ADAM-10 and ADAM-17, allowing tumors to evade NK cell recognition (Pazina2017Regulation).

NCR3 also interacts with other ligands, such as BAG-6, which can inhibit NKp30-dependent cytotoxicity. The BAG-6 686-936 fragment reduces NK cell activation and IFN-γ production, highlighting its role in modulating NKp30 interactions (Binici2013A). Additionally, NKp30's oligomerization, influenced by glycosylation, affects its binding affinity and interaction with B7-H6 (Skořepa2020Natural).
