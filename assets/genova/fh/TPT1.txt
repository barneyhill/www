# TPT1

## Overview
The TPT1 gene encodes the translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), a highly conserved protein across species that plays a multifaceted role in cellular processes. TCTP is a globular protein with structural similarities to mRNA helicases and methionine sulfoxide reductases, and it functions primarily as a monomer (Amson2013TPT1; SAWAYA2004Structure–function). It is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, apoptosis, and cellular stress responses, acting as an anti-apoptotic factor by interacting with proteins such as Mcl1 and Bcl-xL (Thébault2016TCTP; Amson2013TPT1). TCTP's interactions with various cellular components, including ribosomes and translation elongation factors, underscore its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Bommer2020Dysregulation). The dysregulation of TPT1 expression has been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Amson2013TPT1; Hosseinzadeh2020Evaluate).

## Structure
The TPT1 gene encodes the translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), which is highly conserved across species. The primary structure of TCTP consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a protein with a molecular mass of 21-23 kDa in humans (Fiucci2003Genomic). The secondary structure includes a core of nine beta-strands and an alpha-helical hairpin formed by two H2-H3 helices, along with a short H1 helix and a mobile loop (Amson2013TPT1). The tertiary structure is characterized by a compact, globular form, with structural similarities to mRNA helicases and methionine sulfoxide reductases (Amson2013TPT1). TCTP lacks a quaternary structure as it typically functions as a monomer (SAWAYA2004Structure–function).

TCTP contains a conserved TCTP domain and is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at serine residues by polo-like kinase, which regulates its interaction with microtubules (Fiucci2003Genomic). The protein also has a 45-amino-acid basic region at its C terminus that binds to tubulin (Fiucci2003Genomic). These structural features contribute to its role in various cellular processes, including apoptosis regulation and translation control.

## Function
The TPT1 gene, also known as translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. TCTP is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis by potentially activating protein kinase R (PKR), which phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2a), thereby halting protein translation (Amson2013TPT1). It acts as an anti-apoptotic protein by interacting with proteins such as Mcl1 and Bcl-xL, inhibiting apoptosis and regulating mitochondrial membrane permeability and cytochrome C release (Thébault2016TCTP; Amson2013TPT1). TCTP is also involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) by binding to phosphorylated IRE1α, preventing apoptosis (Bommer2020Dysregulation).

Structurally, TCTP shares similarities with methionine sulfoxide reductases, indicating a potential role in protecting cells against oxidative stress (Amson2013TPT1). It is also associated with ribosomes and interacts with translation elongation factors, playing a significant role in protein synthesis and cell growth (Bommer2020Dysregulation). TCTP is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Amson2013TPT1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TPT1 gene, also known as translationally-controlled tumor protein (TCTP), have been implicated in various cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. In breast cancer, TPT1 is overexpressed and correlates with aggressive disease characteristics such as poor differentiation, high tumor grade, and negative estrogen receptor expression. This overexpression is often associated with mutated p53 status, suggesting that TPT1 overexpression contributes to carcinogenesis when p53 is dysfunctional (Amson2013TPT1). Despite its increased expression in breast cancer tissues, TPT1 is not considered a common breast cancer susceptibility gene, although it may play a minor role in maintaining genomic integrity (Neuhäuser2019Assessment).

In prostate cancer, TPT1 expression is significantly increased compared to normal tissues, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker. TPT1 is known for its anti-apoptotic properties and is preferentially expressed in cancer cells (Hosseinzadeh2020Evaluate). The protein's anti-apoptotic function is crucial for cell survival, as it interacts with mitochondrial membranes to inhibit Bax dimerization, a process essential for apoptosis (Susini2008TCTP). These findings suggest that TPT1's dysregulation may contribute to cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
TPT1, also known as translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP), is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, TPT1 interacts with nucleophosmin (Npm1), particularly during mitosis. This interaction is crucial for cell proliferation, as demonstrated by the significant reduction in proliferative cells upon dual knockdown of TPT1 and Npm1 (Johansson2010Translationally). The TPT1-Npm1 complex is independent of Plk1 phosphorylation, although both proteins are phosphorylated by Plk1 during mitosis (Johansson2010Translationally).

TPT1 also interacts with proteins involved in DNA repair processes, particularly homologous recombination (HR). It forms complexes with Rad51, a key player in HR, and its inactivation can enhance apoptosis and sensitize cells to DNA-damaging agents (Li2017Identification). In the context of telomere biology, TPT1 in Tetrahymena thermophila interacts with Pot1a and Pat1, forming a complex essential for telomere protection and length regulation (Linger2011The).

TPT1's interactions extend to anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, where it is proposed to prevent calcium-induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, highlighting its role in apoptosis regulation (Assrir2017Structural).
