# PTPRK

## Overview
PTPRK, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type K, is a gene that encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. This transmembrane protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular domain with MAM, immunoglobulin-like, and fibronectin type III domains, facilitating cell-cell adhesion through homophilic interactions (hay2021structure; Fearnley2019The). The intracellular region contains two phosphatase domains: a catalytically active D1 domain and an inactive D2 pseudophosphatase domain, which is crucial for substrate recruitment and modulation of phosphatase activity (Hay2022Molecular; Fearnley2019The). PTPRK plays a significant role in maintaining cell junction integrity by dephosphorylating key junctional regulators, thereby contributing to cellular adhesion and polarity (Fearnley2019The). Its function as a tumor suppressor is highlighted by its involvement in suppressing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with cancer progression (Fearnley2019The).

## Structure
PTPRK (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type K) is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase characterized by a complex molecular structure. The extracellular domain (ECD) of PTPRK includes a MAM (Meprin-A5-mu) domain, an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain, and four fibronectin type III (FN) domains. These domains facilitate homophilic interactions at cell-cell contact points, forming trans homodimers essential for cell adhesion (hay2021structure; Fearnley2019The). The FN4 domain contains a Furin protease cleavage site, which, after cleavage, allows the receptor subunits to remain associated at the plasma membrane (hay2021structure).

The intracellular region of PTPRK comprises two phosphatase domains: the catalytically active D1 domain and the inactive D2 pseudophosphatase domain. The D2 domain, despite lacking catalytic activity, plays a crucial role in substrate recruitment and modulation of the D1 domain's activity (Hay2022Molecular; Fearnley2019The). PTPRK is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity (Besco2004Genomic). The protein also exhibits alternative splicing, leading to different isoforms with potentially distinct functional properties (Besco2004Genomic).

## Function
PTPRK (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type K) is a transmembrane receptor that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion by selectively dephosphorylating junctional regulators. It is involved in the dephosphorylation of proteins such as p120 catenin (p120 Cat) and Afadin, which are essential for cell junction integrity and adhesion (Fearnley2019The). PTPRK's activity is characterized by its substrate specificity, which is partly determined by its D2 pseudophosphatase domain. This domain aids in recruiting substrates for dephosphorylation, allowing PTPRK to function as an intracellular scaffold that facilitates protein dephosphorylation and maintains cellular phosphotyrosine levels (Hay2022Molecular; Fearnley2019The).

PTPRK is primarily active at cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells, where it stabilizes these contacts by dephosphorylating substrates like Afadin, PARD3, and d-catenin family members (Fearnley2019The). This activity is crucial for maintaining proper cell junctions and polarity, contributing to the structural integrity of epithelial cells and normal tissue organization (Fearnley2019The). PTPRK's role in cell adhesion and its potential function as a tumor suppressor are underscored by its ability to suppress epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to cancer progression (Fearnley2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PTPRK gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. PTPRK is implicated as a tumor suppressor, and its deficiency is associated with disrupted cell junction organization, spheroid overgrowth, and invasive behavior in cells. This suggests a role in suppressing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), with its downregulation linked to the upregulation of mesenchymal markers, contributing to cancer progression (Fearnley2019The). In ovarian cancer, PTPRK expression is notably downregulated in drug-resistant cell lines, particularly in ALDH1A1 positive cancer stem cell-like populations. This downregulation is associated with increased phosphorylated tyrosine levels, indicating enhanced signal transduction pathways and contributing to drug resistance (Świerczewska2019PTPRK).

PTPRK is also involved in colorectal cancer, where it forms a fusion with the oncogene RSPO3, influencing multiple signaling pathways such as WNT, EGFR, and JAK-STAT, which are crucial for cancer progression (Jeong2022Investigation). In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, PTPRK promoter methylation correlates with decreased survival, and restoring its expression increases sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents (Świerczewska2019PTPRK). These findings underscore the gene's potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
PTPRK (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type K) is involved in several interactions with proteins that are crucial for cell-cell adhesion. It interacts with cell adhesion regulators such as Afadin, RAPGEF6, and NUFIP2, which are specifically associated with PTPRK (Fearnley2019The). PTPRK also shares interactions with its paralog PTPRM, including with PARD3 and PKP4, but maintains unique interactions as well (Fearnley2019The). The D2 domain of PTPRK is essential for binding to Afadin, a key substrate, and this interaction is necessary for the dephosphorylation of Afadin (Hay2022Molecular). The interaction between PTPRK and Afadin is mediated by the pseudophosphatase D2 domain, which binds to a single helix within an extended disordered region of Afadin (Hay2022Molecular).

PTPRK is also involved in dephosphorylating junctional regulators such as p120 Catenin, PKP3, and PKP4, which are important for maintaining cell junction integrity (Fearnley2019The). The protein acts as a sensor and mediator of cell adhesion, with its D2 domain playing a crucial role in substrate recognition (Fearnley2019The). PTPRK's interactions are not limited to direct dephosphorylation; it may also participate in multiprotein complexes, potentially competing with canonical adhesion complexes (Hay2022Molecular).
