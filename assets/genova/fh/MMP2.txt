# MMP2

## Overview
The MMP2 gene encodes the protein matrix metallopeptidase 2, a zinc-dependent endopeptidase that plays a pivotal role in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This enzyme, categorized as a matrix metalloproteinase, is involved in various physiological processes, including tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and wound healing. MMP2 is characterized by a complex molecular structure, comprising a signal peptide, propeptide domain, catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, and a hemopexin-like C-terminal domain. The protein's activity is tightly regulated through interactions with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and glycosaminoglycans, as well as through post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and proteolytic activation. Mutations in the MMP2 gene are linked to rare disorders affecting bone and joint health, and altered MMP2 activity is associated with various pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases and arthritis (MURPHY2008Progress; Cook2019Pathologies; Tuysuz2008A).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of MMP2 includes a signal peptide, a propeptide domain, a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif, and a hemopexin-like C-terminal domain (Falconi2003Molecular). The secondary structure features a matrixin fold in the catalytic domain, consisting of three alpha-helices and five beta-sheets (Morgunova1999Structure; Falconi2003Molecular).

The tertiary structure of MMP2 involves the folding of these domains, with the propeptide forming a globular domain stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The catalytic domain is characterized by a five-stranded beta-sheet and three alpha-helices, while the hemopexin domain adopts a four-blade propeller fold (Morgunova1999Structure). The fibronectin type II-like domains are inserted between specific strands in the catalytic domain, forming hydrophobic pockets for substrate binding (Morgunova1999Structure).

In terms of quaternary structure, MMP2 interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), particularly TIMP-2, which binds to the hemopexin domain (Morgunova1999Structure). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation and activation by proteolytic cleavage, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Morgunova1999Structure).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) is a crucial enzyme involved in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in processes such as tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and wound healing by breaking down ECM components like collagen IV, laminin, and aggrecan (MURPHY2008Progress; Sariahmetoglu2007Regulation). MMP2 is active in the extracellular space, where it facilitates the release of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) from the ECM, promoting angiogenesis and cell migration (de2022Matrix; Mott2004Regulation).

MMP2 also modulates cellular behavior by processing chemokines and shedding membrane proteins, which can alter cellular responsiveness to growth factors and cytokines (Loffek2010Biological). It is involved in the activation of latent TGFb by cleaving the latency-associated peptide, thus influencing tissue homeostasis and cellular communication (de2022Matrix). The enzyme's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its enzymatic properties and substrate specificity, highlighting its role in maintaining normal physiological functions (Sariahmetoglu2007Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MMP2 gene are associated with several rare disorders, primarily affecting bone and joint health. One such condition is multicentric osteolysis with nodulosis and arthritis (MONA), characterized by severe osteolysis, joint contractures, and fibrocollagenous nodules. These mutations often lead to a loss of MMP-2 enzymatic activity, which is crucial for normal bone and joint development (Azzollini2014Functional; Tuysuz2008A). 

MMP2 mutations can also result in congenital heart defects, as seen in some families with MONA, suggesting that cardiac abnormalities may be part of the broader phenotype associated with MMP2 deficiency (Tuysuz2008A). The p.G410R mutation, for example, affects the catalytic domain of the MMP2 protein, leading to a complete loss of gelatinolytic activity and contributing to the clinical manifestations of MONA (Azzollini2014Functional).

In addition to genetic mutations, altered MMP2 expression or activity is implicated in various pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases and arthritis. MMP2 deficiency can exacerbate arthritis by increasing joint cartilage destruction, while its underactivity is linked to osteolytic disorders due to its role in osteoclast and osteoblast growth (Cook2019Pathologies).

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) is involved in various interactions that regulate its activity and function. MMP2 interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), particularly TIMP-2 and TIMP-3. TIMP-2 forms a complex with MMP2 and MT1-MMP (membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase), facilitating the activation of pro-MMP-2. This interaction is crucial for regulating MMP2 activity, as TIMP-2 can inhibit MMP2 by binding to it, either when released from the ternary complex or secreted independently (BERNARDO2003TIMP2). 

MMP2 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan. These GAGs influence the formation and stability of the MMP2/TIMP3 complex. For instance, sulfated hyaluronan (SH) acts as a 'molecular glue' between the PEX domain of pro-MMP2 and TIMP3, stabilizing their interaction and affecting MMP2 activity (RuizGómez2019Glycosaminoglycans).

In melanoma cells, MMP2 forms a complex with MT3-MMP and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (MCSP), which is essential for the activation of pro-MMP-2. This interaction is dependent on chondroitin sulfate, which binds to MMP2 and presents it to MT3-MMP for activation (Iida2007Cell). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving MMP2 in extracellular matrix remodeling and cell migration.
