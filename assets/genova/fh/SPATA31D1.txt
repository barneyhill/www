# SPATA31D1

## Overview
SPATA31D1 is a gene that encodes the protein SPATA31 subfamily D member 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. The SPATA31D1 gene is part of a larger family of SPATA31 genes, which are known to play roles in spermatogenesis and other reproductive functions. The protein encoded by SPATA31D1 is categorized as a member of the SPATA31 protein family, which is characterized by its involvement in DNA repair and genomic stability. Although the precise mechanisms and pathways involving SPATA31D1 are not fully elucidated, it is suggested to have a role in maintaining genomic integrity, potentially influencing cellular responses to DNA damage (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully understand the functional implications of SPATA31D1 in human health and disease.
