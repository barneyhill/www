# DMC1

## Overview
The DMC1 gene encodes the DNA meiotic recombinase 1 protein, a meiosis-specific recombinase that plays a pivotal role in homologous recombination during meiosis. This protein is essential for the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by facilitating the invasion of homologous DNA strands, a critical step in genetic recombination and chromosome segregation. DMC1 is characterized by its ATPase activity and the ability to form nucleoprotein filaments on single-stranded DNA, which are crucial for homologous pairing and strand exchange. The protein's function is highly conserved across species, as evidenced by its homology to the yeast DMC1 gene. DMC1 interacts with several proteins, including BRCA2 and RAD51, to stabilize nucleoprotein filaments and enhance recombination activity. Mutations in the DMC1 gene can lead to infertility due to defects in meiotic recombination and chromosome synapsis, underscoring its critical role in gametogenesis and genome stability (Miron2023DMC1; Yoshida1998The; Masson2001The).

## Structure
The human DMC1 protein is a meiosis-specific recombinase that plays a crucial role in homologous recombination. Its primary structure includes conserved motifs such as ATP binding sites, which are essential for its function (Hikiba2008Structural). The secondary structure of DMC1 is characterized by α-helices and β-strands, although specific details on the number and arrangement are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure of DMC1 involves an ATPase domain, which is crucial for its activity. The M200V polymorphism, a single amino acid substitution, affects the protein's stability and function by altering the hydrophobic interactions within the ATPase domain (Hikiba2008Structural). This variant forms an octameric ring structure, similar to the wild-type protein, indicating a quaternary structure that is important for its function in DNA recombination (Hikiba2008Structural).

DMC1 forms helical filaments on DNA, facilitating strand exchange, and its structure is distinct from the helical nucleoprotein filaments formed by RecA and Rad51 (Masson2001The). The protein's ATPase activity is relatively low, suggesting a potential need for cofactors to enhance its function (Masson2001The).

## Function
The DMC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in meiotic recombination, a process essential for genetic diversity and proper chromosome segregation during meiosis. DMC1 is a meiosis-specific recombinase that facilitates the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by promoting the invasion of homologous DNA, a critical step in recombination (Li2006Double-stranded; Masson2001The). In humans, DMC1 is homologous to the yeast DMC1 gene and shares significant sequence identity with the yeast protein, indicating a conserved function across species (Habu1996The).

DMC1 operates by forming nucleoprotein filaments on single-stranded DNA, which are essential for homologous pairing and strand exchange during meiosis. This activity is crucial for the formation of synaptonemal complexes and successful meiotic recombination (Yoshida1998The). The protein's function is supported by interactions with other proteins, such as RAD51, which colocalizes with DMC1 during meiotic prophase, suggesting a cooperative role in recombination-related events (Yoshida1998The).

In the absence of functional DMC1, meiotic arrest occurs, leading to infertility due to the failure of homologous chromosome synapsis and subsequent apoptosis of germ cells (Yoshida1998The). This highlights the essential role of DMC1 in ensuring genome stability and successful gametogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DMC1 gene are associated with infertility due to defects in meiotic recombination and chromosome synapsis. A specific dominant allele, Dmc1 Mei11, causes male-specific sterility by disrupting strand invasion activity, leading to meiotic arrest in pachynema and incomplete chromosome synapsis in males (Bannister2007A). In females, this mutation results in a reduced oocyte pool and increased risk of premature ovarian failure, although young heterozygous females can still produce normal litter sizes (Bannister2007A).

The DMC1-M200V polymorphism, identified in an infertile patient, suggests a potential link between this variant and infertility. This mutation reduces the stability of the DMC1 protein and impairs its recombination function during meiosis (Hikiba2008Structural). In medaka fish, disruption of the dmc1 gene leads to abnormal sperm formation and reduced insemination ability, highlighting the gene's critical role in meiosis and spermatogenesis (Chen2016Disruption).

These findings underscore the importance of DMC1 in maintaining fertility and suggest that mutations or alterations in its expression can lead to significant reproductive issues.

## Interactions
DMC1, a meiosis-specific recombinase, interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate homologous recombination. It binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), forming nucleoprotein filaments essential for recombination processes (Martinez2016BRCA2; Sarai2006Stimulation). DMC1 interacts with BRCA2 through specific motifs, such as FxxA and FxPP, which stabilize DMC1 nucleoprotein filaments. The PhePP motif in BRCA2 binds to DMC1, promoting filament formation and stability (Miron2023DMC1; Dunce2023BRCA2).

BRCA2 acts as a mediator, facilitating the displacement of RPA from ssDNA and promoting DMC1-mediated joint molecule formation and DNA strand exchange (Martinez2016BRCA2). The BRC repeats of BRCA2, particularly BRC6, have a strong affinity for DMC1, enhancing its recombination activity, while BRC4 inhibits DMC1-ssDNA complex formation (Martinez2016BRCA2).

DMC1 also interacts with RAD51, another recombinase, through separate interfaces on BRCA2, which may facilitate the formation of a nascent filament with RAD51 serving as a nucleus for DMC1 filament assembly (Miron2023DMC1; Martinez2016BRCA2). Additionally, Rad54B enhances DMC1's DNA strand exchange activity by stabilizing the DMC1-ssDNA complex (Sarai2006Stimulation).
