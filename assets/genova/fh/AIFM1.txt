# AIFM1

## Overview
The AIFM1 gene encodes the protein apoptosis inducing factor mitochondria associated 1 (AIFM1), which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. AIFM1 is a flavoprotein that functions primarily as an oxidoreductase, playing a significant role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy metabolism. It is involved in electron transport and the regulation of reactive oxygen species, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis and redox balance (Liu2018Overexpression). Structurally, AIFM1 contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain and a NADH-binding domain, which are essential for its function in apoptosis and interaction with other mitochondrial proteins (Novo2020The). The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial components, such as CHCHD4 and MIA40, underscore its importance in mitochondrial protein import and oxidative phosphorylation (Meyer2015Loss; Hangen2015Interaction). Mutations in the AIFM1 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including Cowchock syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, highlighting its critical role in human health (Peng2022Case; Rinaldi2012Cowchock).

## Structure
The AIFM1 protein, also known as Apoptosis Inducing Factor Mitochondria Associated 1, is a flavoprotein involved in mitochondrial apoptosis. Its structure includes several key domains and features. AIFM1 contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain and a NADH-binding domain, both of which are characterized by the Rossmann fold topology (Novo2020The). The protein undergoes dimerization upon reduction by NADH, forming a stable FADH-:NAD+ charge-transfer complex, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Novo2020The).

The primary structure of AIFM1 is encoded by the AIFM1 gene, and its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The tertiary structure forms a folded conformation crucial for its function, allowing it to interact with other proteins and participate in electron transport and apoptosis (Herrmann2020Apoptosis). AIFM1 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure (Hevler2021Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of AIFM1 include phosphorylation and acetylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. Splice variants of AIFM1 result in different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not extensively covered in the provided context (Herrmann2020Apoptosis).

## Function
The AIFM1 gene encodes a protein known as apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondrion-associated 1, which plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy metabolism in healthy human cells. Initially expressed as a 67 kDa precursor, AIFM1 includes an N-terminal mitochondrial localization sequence, a spacer, and a C-terminal oxidoreductase domain. This precursor is translocated to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and processed into a mature 62 kDa form. Under physiological conditions, the mature AIFM1 is anchored to the inner mitochondrial matrix, where it is involved in regulating electron transport, ferredoxin metabolism, reactive oxygen species generation, and ATP production. These functions are essential for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and redox balance (Liu2018Overexpression).

AIFM1 also interacts with CHCHD4, playing a role in oxidizing and stabilizing small molecules, including electron transport chain complex proteins, by immobilizing CHCHD4 in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This interaction is crucial for mitochondrial protein import and stabilization, which is essential for mitochondrial function (Mao2023SIRT5related). The protein's activities in these processes highlight its importance in cellular homeostasis and energy regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AIFM1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting the nervous system and mitochondrial function. Cowchock syndrome, also known as X-linked recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4 (CMTX4), is characterized by axonal neuropathy, deafness, and cognitive impairment. This condition is linked to a missense mutation in AIFM1 that alters the redox properties of the protein, leading to increased apoptosis (Rinaldi2012Cowchock). 

AIFM1 mutations can also cause severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, presenting with symptoms such as ventriculomegaly, congenital lactic acidosis, intractable seizures, and myopathy. These mutations often result in oxidative phosphorylation defects (Peng2022Case). X-linked hypomyelination with spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (H-SMD) is another condition associated with AIFM1 mutations, characterized by developmental delays, gait abnormalities, and skeletal abnormalities (Miyake2017Xlinked).

Additionally, mutations in AIFM1 have been linked to auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD), cerebellar ataxia, and sensorineural hearing loss. These conditions often involve developmental disabilities and motor dysfunction, with some mutations affecting the NADH-binding domain of the protein, impacting its oxidoreductase activity (Pandolfo2020Cerebellar; Zong2015Mutations).

## Interactions
AIFM1 (apoptosis inducing factor mitochondria associated 1) is involved in several critical protein interactions within the mitochondrial respiratory chain. AIFM1 interacts with CHCHD4, a protein involved in mitochondrial import and oxidative protein folding. This interaction is stable and enhanced by the presence of reduced pyrimidine nucleotides like NADH, which stabilizes the AIF-CHCHD4 complex, crucial for respiratory chain biogenesis (Hangen2015Interaction).

AIFM1 also interacts with MIA40, a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein essential for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) maintenance. AIFM1 stabilizes MIA40, and their interaction is vital for the correct assembly and maintenance of the electron transport chain (ETC) (Meyer2015Loss). The interaction between AIFM1 and MIA40 occurs via the N-terminal stretch of MIA40, and this interaction is crucial for the import of specific disulfide relay substrates (Rothemann2024Interaction).

Additionally, AIFM1 forms a specific complex with cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This interaction involves AIFM1 dimers associating with monomeric COX, suggesting a role in OXPHOS biogenesis (Hevler2021Molecular). AIFM1 also interacts with AK2A, stabilizing it and linking AIFM1 to cellular energy metabolism (Rothemann2024Interaction).
