# KCTD15

## Overview
KCTD15 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 15, which is a member of the KCTD family characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain. This protein is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions and plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional repression and signaling pathways. KCTD15 is known for its involvement in adipogenesis, neural crest development, and immune response regulation. The protein's structure includes a BTB domain that facilitates oligomerization, typically forming pentameric structures, although mutations can lead to alternative oligomeric states. KCTD15's interactions with other proteins, such as IKK-β and KCASH2, highlight its role in modulating pathways like NF-κB and Hedgehog signaling. Clinically, mutations in KCTD15 are associated with frontonasal dysplasia syndrome and cardiac development defects, and its expression levels have implications in cancer biology (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15; Smaldone2021KCTD15; Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted).

## Structure
The KCTD15 protein is characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which is crucial for its oligomerization and function. This domain is located in the N-terminal region and is involved in protein-protein interactions (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). The BTB domain of KCTD15 typically assembles into pentameric structures, a common feature among KCTD family proteins (Smaldone2016The). However, specific mutations in the BTB domain, such as p.(Gly88Asp) and p.(Asp104His), can disrupt this pentameric assembly, leading to alternative oligomeric states like hexamers or monomers (Miller2024BTB).

The secondary structure of KCTD15 includes a propeller-like fold in the C-terminal domain, characterized by a central cavity surrounded by five β-strands, which is consistent with the pentameric organization observed in other KCTD proteins (Esposito2022Alphafold). Structural predictions using AlphaFold suggest that KCTD15 shares significant structural similarity with KCTD1, with an 80% sequence identity across its folded domains (Miller2024BTB).

KCTD15 does not bind to Gβγ subunits, unlike other KCTD family members, and its molecular mechanisms are not fully characterized (Miller2024BTB). The presence of a proline residue in its sequence may contribute to its inability to bind Cullin 3, as this residue introduces rigidity that prevents interaction (Balasco2024A).

## Function
KCTD15 is involved in several molecular processes and plays a significant role in cell biology. It is known to repress the transcription factor AP-2α, which is crucial for various developmental processes, including adipogenesis and neural crest formation. By repressing AP-2α, KCTD15 inhibits C/EBPα, an early inducer of adipogenesis, thereby influencing fat cell development and energy homeostasis (Skoblov2013Protein). KCTD15 also interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, affecting neural crest development and potentially influencing obesity-related traits (Skoblov2013Protein).

In the context of NF-κB signaling, KCTD15 is important for proper immune cell activation and response. It regulates NF-κB signaling pathways, with its downregulation leading to impaired nuclear translocation of NF-κB components, which affects cytokine production and T-cell activation (Smaldone2021KCTD15). KCTD15 is also involved in cardiac development, particularly in the formation of structures such as the aortic valve and ventricular septum, by regulating neural crest cell functions (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15).

KCTD15 forms multimeric complexes with KCTD1, and these complexes are crucial for ectodermal and neural crest cell functions, including pigmentation and cranial development (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15). The protein is primarily active in the nuclei of keratinocytes and other cell types, where it inhibits transcription factors like AP-2α (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCTD15 gene are associated with a distinctive frontonasal dysplasia syndrome, characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, anosmia, cutis aplasia of the scalp, sparse hair, and congenital heart disease. Two specific missense mutations, c.310G>C (p.Asp104His) and c.263G>A (p.Gly88Asp), disrupt the normal pentameric assembly of the BTB domain, leading to structural changes in the protein. These mutations act through a dominant negative mechanism, causing a closed hexameric assembly or a monomeric form that is likely partially unfolded at physiological temperatures (Miller2024BTB).

KCTD15 mutations have also been implicated in cardiac development defects, such as ventricular septal defects and bicuspid aortic valves, due to its role in neural crest cells and cardiac structures (Raymundo2023KCTD1KCTD15). In cancer, KCTD15 overexpression is linked to several cancers, and its silencing has been shown to be antiproliferative in cancer cell lines (Miller2024BTB). In childhood B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL), KCTD15 is significantly upregulated, suggesting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Smaldone2019KCTD15).

## Interactions
KCTD15 is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with IKK-β, a key activator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, suggesting a role in modulating this pathway. This interaction was demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cell lines such as HeLa, indicating a physical association between KCTD15 and IKK-β (Smaldone2021KCTD15).

KCTD15 also interacts with KCASH2, a protein involved in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This interaction enhances the stability of KCASH2, leading to the inhibition of the Hh pathway, particularly in medulloblastoma cells. The interaction between KCTD15 and KCASH2 occurs through the BTB/POZ domain of KCTD15, which is crucial for forming homo-oligomeric complexes (Spiombi2019KCTD15).

In the context of adipogenesis, KCTD15 interacts with GRP78, a protein known for its role in protein folding and stress response. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, suggesting a role for KCTD15 in adipocyte differentiation (Smaldone2018The).

KCTD15 is also known to bind to transcription factors TFAP2A and TFAP2B, indicating its involvement in transcriptional repression, particularly of AP-2a, which is linked to adipogenesis and neural crest formation (Skoblov2013Protein).
