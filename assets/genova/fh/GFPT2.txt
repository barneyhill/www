# GFPT2

## Overview
The GFPT2 gene encodes the enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2, which is a pivotal component of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This enzyme is integral to the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate and L-glutamine into D-glucosamine-6-phosphate, a precursor for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), which is essential for various cellular processes, including protein glycosylation (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). Unlike its paralog GFPT1, GFPT2 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system and is less susceptible to feedback inhibition, allowing it to sustain HBP activity under conditions of elevated UDP-GlcNAc (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). This characteristic is particularly important in embryonic stem cells, where GFPT2 supports high levels of UDP-GlcNAc necessary for maintaining stemness and pluripotency (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). The enzyme's role extends to influencing cellular homeostasis, growth, and stress responses, making it a significant player in metabolic adaptations and disease pathophysiology (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2).

## Function
The human gene GFPT2 encodes the enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2, which plays a critical role in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This pathway is an essential branch of glycolysis, responsible for converting fructose-6-phosphate and L-glutamine into D-glucosamine-6-phosphate, a precursor for UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) production. UDP-GlcNAc is a vital metabolite involved in various post-translational modification reactions, including protein glycosylation, which is crucial for protein folding, cell surface structure, and signaling pathways (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2).

GFPT2 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system and is less sensitive to feedback inhibition by UDP-GlcNAc compared to its paralog GFPT1. This allows GFPT2 to maintain HBP activity even when UDP-GlcNAc levels are elevated, ensuring a steady supply of this metabolite for cellular processes (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). In embryonic stem cells, GFPT2 is the primary enzyme facilitating metabolite entry into the HBP, supporting high levels of UDP-GlcNAc necessary for O-GlcNAc modifications linked to stemness and pluripotency (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2). GFPT2's activity is crucial for cellular homeostasis and metabolic adaptations, impacting cell growth and stress responses (Kroef2022GFPT2GFAT2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GFPT2 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. Variants in GFPT2 are linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GFPT2 gene, such as SNP8 and SNP10, are associated with increased GFPT2 mRNA levels, which may impact insulin sensitivity and secretion, contributing to the pathophysiology of T2DM and its complications (Zhang2004Common). In particular, the T allele of SNP10 is overexpressed in GFPT2 mRNA, and this overexpression is linked to diabetic nephropathy, especially in African-American populations (Zhang2004Common).

The GFPT2 gene is also implicated in asthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility. A homozygous variant in GFPT2 was identified in a family with this condition, suggesting its role in impaired sperm motility and increased reactive oxygen species levels (Askari2019Identification).

Additionally, GFPT2 has been associated with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. A polymorphism in the 3' UTR of GFPT2 is linked to increased mRNA levels and hexosamine flux, potentially contributing to diabetic renal complications (Prasad2010Association).

## Interactions
GFPT2, a key enzyme in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, participates in several significant interactions with other proteins. One notable interaction is with YBX1, a protein that GFPT2 modifies through O-GlcNAcylation. This modification facilitates the nuclear translocation of YBX1, where it functions as a transcription factor to promote IL-18 transcription, a cytokine involved in immune responses. The interaction between GFPT2 and YBX1 is crucial for regulating the immune microenvironment in pancreatic cancer (Zhang2024The).

GFPT2 also interacts with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which is responsible for attaching O-GlcNAc moieties to proteins. This interaction is significant in the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where GFPT2 overexpression increases O-GlcNAcylation levels, promoting cancer progression. The OGT inhibitor OSMI-1 can reverse the O-GlcNAcylation of YBX1 caused by GFPT2 overexpression, highlighting the regulatory role of GFPT2 in this modification process (Zhang2024The).

In addition to its interactions with YBX1 and OGT, GFPT2 is involved in the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. It is transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB, specifically through the interaction of the RelA/p65 subunit, which affects its expression and activity in various cancer types (Szymura2019NFκB).
