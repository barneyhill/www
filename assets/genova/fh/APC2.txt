# APC2

## Overview
APC2 is a gene that encodes the APC regulator of WNT signaling pathway 2, a protein integral to the regulation of the WNT signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The APC2 protein is categorized as a cullin-related protein and is involved in microtubule dynamics and dendrite development. It plays a significant role in the degradation of β-catenin, thereby preventing its accumulation in the nucleus and regulating gene expression to maintain cellular homeostasis (Schneikert2013Functional). Structurally, APC2 contains domains that facilitate its interaction with the cytoskeleton, including microtubule and actin binding domains, which are essential for its function in stabilizing microtubules and promoting cellular architecture (Kahn2018APC2). The gene's proper function is critical for normal tissue homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis, with mutations in APC2 being linked to various clinical conditions, including subfertility and neurodevelopmental disorders (Mohamed2019APC2; Daly2016Functional).

## Structure
APC2 is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the WNT signaling pathway and is involved in microtubule dynamics and dendrite development. Structurally, APC2 contains several important domains that contribute to its function. The C-terminus of APC2 includes an extended S microtubule binding domain, an actin binding domain, and a +TIP binding domain, which are crucial for its interaction with the cytoskeleton and stabilization of microtubules (Kahn2018APC2). The C-terminus also features the SxLP motif, which interacts with growing microtubule tips, and an extended S domain that binds the microtubule lattice, enabling APC2 to act as a microtubule bundler (Kahn2018APC2).

APC2 is a cullin-related protein, sharing homology with cullin-RING ligases, and forms a minimal ubiquitin ligase module with APC11. This module is essential for ubiquitination processes during mitosis (Tang2001APC2). The cullin domain of APC2, specifically a C-terminal fragment spanning residues 549-822, is sufficient for binding to both APC11 and E2 enzyme UbcH10, highlighting its role in ubiquitination (Tang2001APC2). APC2 also interacts with DYNLL2, a cytoplasmic dynein light chain, which is critical for its localization and function in dendrites (Kahn2018APC2).

## Function
The APC2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the WNT signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, APC2 is involved in the degradation of β-catenin, a key component of the WNT signaling pathway. By promoting the degradation of β-catenin, APC2 prevents its accumulation in the cell nucleus, thereby regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Schneikert2013Functional).

APC2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular architecture and stability. It shares functional similarities with the APC gene, although it is less efficient in binding β-catenin due to the absence of certain repeats found in APC. Despite this, APC2 can still down-regulate β-catenin levels, possibly through interactions with truncated forms of APC that retain necessary binding domains (Schneikert2013Functional).

The proper functioning of APC2 is essential for normal tissue homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis. Its role in regulating β-catenin levels is critical for controlling cell proliferation and ensuring the correct differentiation and positioning of cells within tissues (Daly2016Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the APC2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of ovarian health, APC2 plays a critical role in regulating WNT signaling, which is essential for maintaining ovarian homeostasis. Deficiency in APC2 leads to the activation of WNT signaling, resulting in subfertility due to intra-ovarian defects such as disrupted follicular growth and reduced ovulation. This deficiency also predisposes individuals to granulosa cell tumor (GCT) formation, with APC2-deficient mice showing a molecular signature similar to human adult GCTs (Mohamed2019APC2).

In neurodevelopment, bi-allelic loss of function mutations in APC2 are associated with a rare form of lissencephaly, characterized by a smooth brain surface due to failed neuronal migration. This condition is often accompanied by subcortical heterotopia and global developmental delay. Individuals with these mutations exhibit severe developmental delays, seizures, and specific MRI findings, such as posterior agyria (Lee2019Biallelic).

A point mutation in APC2 has also been reported in a patient with a Sotos-like phenotype, characterized by overgrowth and distinctive facial features. However, the causal relationship between APC2 mutations and Sotos syndrome remains to be fully established (Gomes2023Presence).

## Interactions
APC2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in both dendrite development and the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). In dendrite development, APC2 interacts with the cytoskeleton through its C-terminal domains, which include a microtubule binding domain and a +TIP tracking domain. These domains enable APC2 to bind to microtubules and track their plus ends, stabilizing them and promoting microtubule dynamics. APC2's interaction with DYNLL2, a component of the LC8 complex, is essential for its proper localization and function in dendrites. The C-terminus of APC2 contains two potential binding sites for DYNLL2, with the second site being crucial for this interaction (Kahn2018APC2).

In the context of the anaphase-promoting complex, APC2 forms a minimal ubiquitin ligase module with APC11. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination of regulatory proteins during mitosis. APC2 interacts with UbcH10, an E2 enzyme, while APC11 binds to Ubc4. These interactions are necessary for the ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC, facilitating the degradation of proteins such as cyclin B1 and securin (Tang2001APC2). APC2's cullin domain is particularly important for binding to both APC11 and UbcH10, forming an active ubiquitin ligase complex (Tang2001APC2).
