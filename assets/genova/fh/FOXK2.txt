# FOXK2

## Overview
FOXK2 is a gene that encodes the forkhead box K2 protein, a member of the forkhead box (FOX) family of transcription factors. The FOXK2 protein is characterized by a conserved forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain, which is integral to its role in regulating gene expression. As a transcription factor, FOXK2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and metabolism. It interacts with multiple proteins and complexes, such as SIN3A and TET1, to modulate transcriptional activity. FOXK2 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability and is implicated in several signaling pathways, including the insulin and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Clinically, FOXK2 has been associated with different cancer types, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the context (Wang2022FOXK2; Nestal2019FOXK2; Ji2021The).

## Structure
FOXK2 is a transcription factor that belongs to the forkhead box (FOX) family, characterized by a conserved forkhead or winged-helix DNA-binding domain. This domain typically consists of approximately 110 amino acids and forms a helix-turn-helix motif, which is crucial for its DNA-binding capability. The structural integrity and function of FOXK2 are influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions with other proteins.

The gene encoding FOXK2 can undergo alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms. These isoforms may exhibit variations in their functional properties, potentially altering the protein's role in transcriptional regulation. The presence of splice variants suggests a level of complexity in the regulation and function of FOXK2, allowing it to participate in diverse cellular processes.

While specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of FOXK2 are not provided, the conserved nature of the forkhead domain implies a well-defined structural framework that is shared among members of the FOX family. This structural conservation is essential for the protein's role in gene regulation and its ability to interact with DNA and other molecular partners.

## Function
FOXK2 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression during cell cycle progression, differentiation, and survival. FOXK2 binds to specific genomic regions, particularly proximal promoter regions, and is associated with active chromatin, indicating its role in transcriptional activation (Ji2021The). It interacts with other transcription factors and corepressor complexes, such as SIN3A and TET1, to regulate gene expression, often marking genes for activation during differentiation (Ji2021The).

In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), FOXK2 is crucial for premarking lineage-specific genes for activation during differentiation into mesendodermal and neural precursor cells (NPCs). This involves dynamic changes in its binding patterns, which are associated with active histone marks, suggesting a role in establishing regulatory chromatin environments (Ji2021The). FOXK2 also plays a role in maintaining genomic stability by recognizing mismatched DNA and potentially interacting with DNA repair proteins (Nestal2019FOXK2).

In terms of cellular metabolism, FOXK2 is involved in insulin regulation of cellular and mitochondrial metabolism, affecting processes like mitochondrial β-oxidation and biogenesis (Sakaguchi2019FoxK1). It is a downstream target of insulin action, with its nuclear translocation being stimulated by insulin via the Akt-mTOR pathway (Sakaguchi2019FoxK1).

## Clinical Significance
The FOXK2 gene plays a significant role in various cancers, acting as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on the cancer type. In colorectal cancer, FOXK2 is overexpressed and associated with the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation and correlating with poor prognosis when co-expressed with SOX9 (Nestal2019FOXK2; Yu2022The). In hepatocellular carcinoma, FOXK2 overexpression is linked to increased cell migration and proliferation through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, with high levels indicating worse survival outcomes (Nestal2019FOXK2; Yu2022The).

In breast cancer, FOXK2 interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) to decrease its stability, suppressing ERα-driven cell proliferation. Its expression is linked to reduced disease-free survival and drug resistance, although some studies suggest that downregulation correlates with better survival (Nestal2019FOXK2; Wang2022FOXK2). In non-small cell lung cancer, FOXK2 functions as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Nestal2019FOXK2). In clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, FOXK2 overexpression induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth, migration, and invasion, though its role remains unclear with studies showing both positive and negative correlations with prognosis (Nestal2019FOXK2).

## Interactions
FOXK2 is a transcription factor that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes and cancer biology. It interacts with the breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) ring domain 1 (BARD1) through its amino-terminal region, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (Liu2015FOXK2; Kang2022Regulation). FOXK2 also associates with the Sin3A histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex, acting as a transcriptional repressor by inhibiting autophagy gene expression (Nestal2019FOXK2; Wang2022FOXK2).

The protein interacts with BAP1, a component of the PR-DUB complex, which is involved in histone deubiquitination and transcriptional regulation (Nestal2019FOXK2). FOXK2 recruits activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors to chromatin, influencing AP-1-dependent gene expression (Wang2022FOXK2). It also binds to methylated DNA and interacts with methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBD6), playing a role in DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation (Nestal2019FOXK2; Wang2022FOXK2).

FOXK2's interactions extend to the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it associates with Disheveled (DVL) proteins, promoting their nuclear translocation (Wang2022FOXK2). These interactions highlight FOXK2's involvement in complex regulatory networks, impacting processes such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and tumorigenesis.
