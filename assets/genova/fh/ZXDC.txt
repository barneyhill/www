# ZXDC

## Overview
The ZXDC gene encodes a zinc finger protein that is integral to the regulation of immune response through its role in the transcriptional activation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. The protein, known as ZXD family zinc finger C, is characterized by its 858 amino acids and the presence of 10 C2H2-type zinc fingers, which facilitate its interactions with DNA, proteins, and other molecules (AlKandari2007ZXDC). ZXDC functions primarily in the nucleus, where it forms a complex with ZXDA and the class II trans-activator (CIITA) to enhance MHC class II gene transcription, a process crucial for antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells (AlKandari2007ZXDC; AlKandari2007The). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation, which enhance its transcriptional activation capabilities (Jambunathan2007Sumoylation). Beyond its role in immune regulation, ZXDC has been implicated in various diseases, including Moyamoya disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Shoemaker2016Disease).

## Structure
The ZXDC protein is a member of the zinc finger protein family, characterized by its 858 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 90 kDa (AlKandari2007ZXDC). It contains 10 C2H2-type zinc fingers, which are typically involved in DNA-binding but can also mediate interactions with proteins, RNA, and lipids (AlKandari2007ZXDC). The zinc finger sequences are highly conserved among related proteins ZXDA and ZXDB (AlKandari2007ZXDC). ZXDC also includes a transcriptional activation domain and a CIITA-binding domain, with the latter located in the C-terminal 78 amino acids, although the most robust binding requires the final 170 amino acids (AlKandari2007ZXDC).

Post-translational modifications of ZXDC include sumoylation, which occurs at lysine-660 within a phosphorylation-dependent sumoylation motif (PDSM). This modification enhances the function of its transcriptional activation domain (Jambunathan2007Sumoylation). Sumoylation does not disrupt ZXDC's interaction with ZXDA or its self-association (Jambunathan2007Sumoylation).

The ZXDC gene expresses at least two mRNA isoforms, including a full-length mRNA and a shorter isoform named ZXDC2. ZXDC2 lacks the first three zinc fingers and the C-terminal region necessary for CIITA interaction, functioning in a dominant negative manner (Aleksandrova2009An).

## Function
The ZXDC gene encodes a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes, which are essential for antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells. ZXDC interacts with the class II trans-activator (CIITA), a master regulator of MHC class II gene transcription, enhancing the transcription of these genes (AlKandari2007ZXDC). The protein contains ten zinc fingers and a transcriptional activation domain, which are necessary for its function in gene activation (AlKandari2007ZXDC).

ZXDC is active in the nucleus, where it forms a complex with another zinc finger protein, ZXDA, to bind CIITA and regulate MHC II gene transcription (AlKandari2007The). This interaction is critical for the full activation of MHC class II genes, as silencing ZXDC expression reduces CIITA's ability to activate these genes (AlKandari2007ZXDC). Additionally, ZXDC is involved in the transcriptional activation of MHC class I genes, indicating its broader role in immune response regulation (AlKandari2007ZXDC). The protein's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as sumoylation, which enhances its transcriptional activation potential (Jambunathan2007Sumoylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZXDC gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly Moyamoya disease (MMD). A novel variant, p.P562L, in the ZXDC gene is significantly associated with MMD, especially in Caucasian populations and non-RNF213 founder mutation cases. This variant is present in 14.7% of Caucasian MMD cases compared to 4% in controls, indicating a potential role in disease susceptibility, although with lower penetrance than the RNF213 p.R4810K mutation in East Asians (Shoemaker2016Disease).

In MMD, the circZXDC-miR-125a-3p-ABCC6 axis is involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. Overexpression of circZXDC in MMD patients, particularly those with the RNF213 mutation, leads to a switch in vascular smooth muscle cells from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype, contributing to vessel intima thickening. This suggests that circZXDC could serve as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for MMD (Liu2022CircZXDC).

Alterations in ZXDC expression also affect immune responses. ZXDC interacts with CIITA to regulate MHC class II gene transcription, and its dysregulation could impact immune function, potentially contributing to autoimmune diseases (AlKandari2007ZXDC).

## Interactions
The ZXDC protein is involved in several key interactions that regulate gene transcription. It forms a complex with another zinc finger protein, ZXDA, and the class II trans-activator (CIITA), which is crucial for the transcription of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II genes. This tripartite complex is necessary for the activation of MHC II gene transcription, as ZXDC does not interact with CIITA individually but requires the presence of ZXDA (AlKandari2007The). The interaction between ZXDA and ZXDC occurs through their zinc finger domains, which are essential for the formation of the complex (AlKandari2007The).

ZXDC can also self-associate, but homodimers of ZXDC or ZXDA do not interact with CIITA, indicating the specificity of the ZXDA-ZXDC heterodimer in this regulatory process (AlKandari2007The). Sumoylation of ZXDC, enhanced by PIAS proteins and HDAC4, does not disrupt its interactions with ZXDA or CIITA, suggesting that post-translational modifications may modulate these interactions without hindering complex formation (Jambunathan2007Sumoylation).

In addition to its role in MHC II transcription, ZXDC1, a larger isoform of ZXDC, interacts with BCL6, a transcriptional repressor, to influence the expression of genes related to monocyte differentiation and function. ZXDC1 can reverse BCL6-mediated repression of the Ccl2 gene expression, suggesting a dynamic interaction that affects gene regulation (Ramsey2013The).
