# SFXN1

## Overview
SFXN1, or sideroflexin 1, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in the transport of serine and potentially other neutral amino acids. This protein is a member of the sideroflexin family, characterized by its five transmembrane domains, which is atypical for mitochondrial carriers that usually possess six. Sideroflexin 1 plays a crucial role in one-carbon metabolism, a pathway essential for the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids, by facilitating the transport of serine into mitochondria. This process supports the synthesis of glycine, a key component in mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism. Additionally, SFXN1 is implicated in maintaining the integrity of Complex III in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, influencing Coenzyme Q oxidation and potentially playing a role in its biosynthesis or turnover. The gene's expression is regulated by the Myc transcription factor and is notably high in tissues such as the liver, blood, and kidneys. Alterations in SFXN1 expression have been linked to various cancers and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in cellular metabolism and disease (Attwood2021Characterization; Kory2018SFXN1; Acoba2021The).

## Structure
Sideroflexin 1 (SFXN1) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein characterized by its five transmembrane domains (TMDs), which is atypical compared to the six TMDs commonly found in mitochondrial carriers (Kory2018SFXN1; Acoba2021The). The N-terminus of SFXN1 is located in the mitochondrial matrix, while the C-terminus is situated in the intermembrane space, a topology supported by protease protection assays and super-resolution microscopy (Tifoun2022A; Kory2018SFXN1).

SFXN1 is part of the sideroflexin family, which includes a conserved tricarboxylate/iron carrier domain (Attwood2021Characterization). This protein is involved in the transport of serine into mitochondria, playing a crucial role in one-carbon metabolism (Attwood2021Characterization; Kory2018SFXN1). Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation at the N-terminal, influence its translocation, stability, and degradation (Attwood2021Characterization).

SFXN1 is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in the liver, blood, and kidneys, and is regulated by the Myc transcription factor (Attwood2021Characterization). It may also transport other amino acids, including alanine, glycine, and cysteine, although its primary function is as a serine transporter (Attwood2021Characterization).

## Function
The SFXN1 gene encodes a mitochondrial serine transporter that plays a crucial role in one-carbon metabolism, a pathway essential for synthesizing nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids. This pathway involves both cytosolic and mitochondrial branches, with serine entering mitochondria to be converted into glycine and formate, which are vital for biosynthesis (Kory2018SFXN1). SFXN1 is a multipass mitochondrial membrane protein that facilitates the transport of serine into mitochondria, supporting the synthesis of glycine, a key component in the mitochondrial one-carbon pathway (Kory2018SFXN1). In SFXN1-null cells, there is a notable reduction in glycine levels and an increased serine/glycine ratio, indicating a defect in glycine synthesis (Kory2018SFXN1).

SFXN1 is also critical for maintaining the integrity of Complex III in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is essential for cellular metabolism. It influences the oxidation of Coenzyme Q, a lipid that transfers electrons from Complex I/II to Complex III, and its absence results in a marked reduction of CoQ isoforms, indicating a potential role in CoQ biosynthesis and/or turnover (Acoba2021The). SFXN1's role in serine transport and one-carbon metabolism is vital for mitochondrial function and cellular proliferation (Kory2018SFXN1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SFXN1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, SFXN1 is significantly upregulated, and high expression levels are associated with poor prognosis (Yuan2023Comprehensive). Similarly, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), elevated SFXN1 expression correlates with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and advanced clinical stages, leading to a poor clinical prognosis (Liu2024Comprehensive). High SFXN1 expression in LUAD is also linked to increased immune cell infiltration and heightened sensitivity to chemotherapy, although it predicts a poor response to immunotherapy (Liu2024Comprehensive).

In non-viral hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SFXN1 expression is downregulated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent liver tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer recurrence-free and overall survival, suggesting that SFXN1 could serve as a prognostic factor for non-viral HCC (Yagi2023Loss). The loss of SFXN1 expression in HCC cells is linked to reduced lipid accumulation and reactive oxygen species production, which may confer resistance to lipotoxicity (Yagi2023Loss).

Mutations in SFXN1 have also been associated with sideroblastic-like anemia in mice, characterized by iron accumulation in mitochondria, potentially due to impaired serine import affecting glycine and heme synthesis (Kory2018SFXN1).

## Interactions
SFXN1, a mitochondrial protein, is involved in various interactions with other proteins, primarily within the mitochondria. It has been identified as a transporter of serine and potentially other neutral amino acids, playing a role in one-carbon metabolism and iron homeostasis (Tifoun2022A). SFXN1 interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, including ATAD3A, 17β-HSD10, and TIM50, which are involved in mitochondrial organization, transport, and respiration (Tifoun2022A). 

ATAD3A is a mitochondrial transmembrane protein associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics, while 17β-HSD10 is a multifunctional enzyme involved in steroid biosynthesis and mitochondrial RNA maturation (Tifoun2022A). The interaction between SFXN1 and TIM50, a component of the TIM23 complex, suggests a role in mitochondrial import processes (Tifoun2022A). 

SFXN1 is also linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), with potential interactions with subunits of complexes I and IV, such as TIMMDC1 and COX11, indicating its involvement in the assembly of respiratory complexes (Tifoun2022A). These interactions highlight SFXN1's significant role in mitochondrial function and its potential impact on cellular metabolism and disease.
