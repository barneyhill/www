# RASSF6

## Overview
RASSF6 is a gene that encodes the protein Ras association domain family member 6, which is a member of the Ras-association domain family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a Ras-association (RA) domain and a SARAH domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways. RASSF6 functions primarily as a tumor suppressor and is involved in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle processes. It interacts with various proteins, including components of the Hippo signaling pathway, to mediate its effects on cell survival and proliferation. The protein also plays a role in modulating inflammatory responses by inhibiting NF-κB activity. Alterations in the expression or function of RASSF6 have been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Volodko2014RASSF; van2007The; Chen2016Decreased).

## Structure
The RASSF6 protein is characterized by the presence of a Ras-association (RA) domain and a SARAH (Sav/Rassf/Hpo) domain, which are common features of the RASSF family. The RA domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with Ras-related GTPases, although there is some controversy regarding its direct binding to Ras proteins. One study suggests that RASSF6 interacts directly with K-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner, while another study reports no binding to K-Ras, H-Ras, N-Ras, M-Ras, or TC21 (Richter2009The; van2007The).

RASSF6 is predicted to produce three isoforms: RASSF6A, RASSF6B, and RASSF6C. RASSF6B has an additional 32 amino acids in the N-terminal region compared to RASSF6A, while RASSF6C has a different N-terminus from both RASSF6A and RASSF6B (van2007The). The differences in these isoforms are primarily at the N-terminus due to alternative exon usage and splicing (van2007The).

The protein is involved in apoptosis and tumor suppression, with its overexpression inhibiting tumor cell survival and inducing apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and independent pathways (van2007The; Chen2016Decreased). RASSF6 can also modulate the inflammatory response by inhibiting NF-κB activity (van2007The).

## Function
RASSF6 is a member of the Ras-association domain family and functions as a tumor suppressor involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. It is known to interact with MST2, a component of the Hippo signaling pathway, and can induce apoptosis through mechanisms involving Bax activation and cytochrome c release. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of apoptosis, as RASSF6 and MST2 inhibit each other under basal conditions but dissociate upon stimulation, leading to apoptosis in a RASSF6-WW45-dependent manner (Volodko2014RASSF).

RASSF6 also plays a role in modulating the inflammatory response by inhibiting NF-kB activity, which is important for inflammation and viral replication. This suggests a potential role in inflammation-related processes (van2007The). Additionally, RASSF6 can bind to MDM2, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which stabilizes p53, thereby regulating apoptosis and the cell cycle (Volodko2014RASSF).

In the context of obesity, RASSF6 expression in adipocytes is down-regulated by interaction with macrophages, which is partially mediated through TNFa-signaling. This down-regulation is associated with changes in gene expression, indicating a role in regulating gene expression in response to inflammation (Sanada2013RASSF6).

## Clinical Significance
RASSF6 is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In sporadic colorectal cancer (sCRC), RASSF6 is frequently downregulated, with somatic mutations such as missense and frameshift mutations contributing to its loss of function. This downregulation is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes and advanced tumor stages, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for sCRC (Chen2016Decreased). 

In neuroblastoma, RASSF6 is often epigenetically silenced through promoter methylation, which correlates with unfavorable outcomes and genetic alterations like 1p deletion and MYCN amplification (Djos2012The). This methylation may prevent RAS-induced apoptosis, contributing to tumorigenesis (Djos2012The).

In colorectal cancer, RASSF6 expression is negatively regulated by miR-496, which promotes migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by targeting RASSF6, implicating the miR-496/RASSF6 axis in cancer progression (Wang2019MiR‐496). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma, RASSF6 is downregulated, and its overexpression has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Zhu2017Overexpression). 

These findings highlight the clinical significance of RASSF6 in cancer, where its altered expression or interaction can contribute to disease progression.

## Interactions
RASSF6, a member of the Ras association domain family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role as a tumor suppressor. It interacts with mammalian Ste20-like kinases MST1 and MST2, forming a complex that inhibits each other under normal conditions. Upon activation of the Hippo pathway, RASSF6 dissociates from MST1/2, leading to MST1/2 autophosphorylation and RASSF6-mediated apoptosis (Iwasa2015RASSF6). RASSF6 also interacts with MDM2, promoting its self-ubiquitination and degradation, which stabilizes p53 and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Iwasa2013The).

RASSF6 has been shown to bind to MOAP1, a modulator of apoptosis, enhancing its proapoptotic effects, particularly in the presence of activated KRAS (Richter2009The). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, RASSF6 interacts with TRIM16, promoting its ubiquitination-dependent degradation, which contributes to tumor progression by affecting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zheng2019RASSF6TRIM16). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of RASSF6 in apoptosis regulation and tumor suppression.
