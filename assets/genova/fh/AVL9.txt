# AVL9

## Overview
AVL9 is a gene that encodes the protein AVL9 cell migration associated, which is involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the late secretory pathway and exocytic transport from the Golgi apparatus. The protein is part of a novel superfamily that includes DENN-domain proteins, known for their roles in signaling pathways and vesicle transport (Harsay2007Avl9p). AVL9 is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotic species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular organization and function. In yeast, the protein is essential for maintaining secretory function and cellular growth, while in humans, it is implicated in intracellular trafficking and cell migration (Harsay2007Avl9p). AVL9's involvement in these processes suggests its potential impact on development, immune response, and wound healing (Harsay2007Avl9p). Additionally, AVL9 has been linked to cancer progression, particularly in colorectal carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease severity and prognosis (Wu2022AVL9; Liang2020Clinical).

## Function
The AVL9 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the late secretory pathway, particularly in exocytic transport from the Golgi apparatus. This protein is part of a novel superfamily that includes DENN-domain proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes such as signaling pathways and vesicle transport (Harsay2007Avl9p). In yeast, Avl9p is crucial for maintaining proper secretory function and cellular growth, as its depletion leads to defects in actin polarization and polarized growth, affecting the formation of secretory vesicles (Harsay2007Avl9p).

The evolutionary conservation of Avl9p across diverse eukaryotic species, including humans, suggests a fundamental role in basic cellular processes. Although the exact function of AVL9 in human cells is not fully elucidated, its involvement in intracellular trafficking and vesicle transport is likely to influence cell movement and polarity, contributing to processes such as cell migration (Harsay2007Avl9p). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain cellular organization and function, potentially impacting organismal outcomes related to development, immune response, and wound healing (Harsay2007Avl9p).

## Clinical Significance
AVL9 is implicated in several cancers due to its role in cell migration and its altered expression levels. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), AVL9 expression is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This upregulation is associated with advanced stages of CRC and poor prognosis. AVL9 promotes CRC cell migration by regulating EGFR expression, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC (Wu2022AVL9). AVL9 is also involved in the linc00662/miR-497-5p axis in CRC, where it is upregulated and associated with poor overall survival. This axis influences CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating AVL9's role in CRC progression (Wang2020Linc00662).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), AVL9 is a direct target of miR-203a-3p. The downregulation of miR-203a-3p, which correlates with poor prognosis, leads to increased AVL9 expression. Overexpression of miR-203a-3p inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by targeting AVL9, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in NSCLC (Liang2020Clinical). These findings underscore AVL9's clinical significance in cancer progression and metastasis.
