# CDK10

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 10 (CDK10) is a gene that encodes the protein cyclin-dependent kinase 10, a member of the serine/threonine kinase family. This kinase is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, transcription factor modulation, and ciliogenesis. CDK10 forms a functional complex with cyclin M (CycM), which is essential for its kinase activity and influences the stability and activity of the ETS2 oncoprotein. The protein's structure is characterized by a bilobal kinase domain, typical of the kinase family, and it interacts with several proteins to modulate cellular functions. CDK10 has been implicated in both tumor suppression and oncogenesis, with its expression levels influencing cancer progression and prognosis. Additionally, mutations in the CDK10 gene are associated with developmental disorders such as Al Kaissi syndrome, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Bazzi2021CDK10; Kasten2001Cdk10; Robert2021Functional).

## Structure
CDK10 is a serine/threonine kinase with a primary structure consisting of 360 amino acids in its full-length form. The protein includes an ATP-binding domain and a Ser/Thr kinase domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Bazzi2021CDK10). The secondary structure of CDK10 is characterized by a typical bilobal structure, with a smaller N-terminal domain predominantly composed of beta-sheet structures and a larger C-terminal domain primarily consisting of alpha-helices (Sun2005Homology). The tertiary structure of CDK10 includes 10 alpha-helices and eight beta-sheets, which are typical for the kinase family (Sun2005Homology).

In terms of quaternary structure, CDK10 forms a complex with cyclin M (CycM), which is essential for its kinase activity. This interaction involves the N-terminal domain of CDK10, including the first helix α1 and the loop β4-β5, and on the CycM side, it involves residues of helix α3 and a large half of helix α5 (Robert2021Functional). CDK10 has several alternatively spliced isoforms, with the full-length transcript encoding a functional protein and a truncated variant lacking the ATP-binding domain, rendering it enzymatically inactive (Bazzi2021CDK10).

## Function
CDK10 is a cyclin-dependent kinase involved in regulating the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. It shares homology with other kinases in the Cdc2 family and contains conserved regions typical of cyclin-dependent kinases, including a PSTAIRE-like sequence, PISSLRE, and regulatory amino acids in the ATP binding domain. The phosphorylation status of these sites is critical for its activity (Kasten2001Cdk10). CDK10 interacts with the Ets2 transcription factor, specifically binding to the N-terminus of Ets2, which contains the transactivation and Pointed domains. This interaction inhibits Ets2 transactivation in mammalian cells, suggesting a role in modulating transcription factor activity and potentially influencing gene expression (Kasten2001Cdk10).

CDK10 is also involved in corneal epithelial wound healing, where it is upregulated during active cell migration, indicating a role in cell migration and proliferation (Zehra2019Association). In the context of neurogenesis, CDK10 is critical for neural progenitor cell survival, as its knockdown leads to apoptosis through enhanced expression of the raf1a gene (Yeh2013Knockdown). CDK10's interaction with cyclin M has been identified, and it phosphorylates the ETS2 oncoprotein, controlling its stability and regulating actin network architecture and ciliogenesis (Robert2020Development).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CDK10 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In cancer, CDK10 plays dual roles as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene. It acts as a tumor suppressor in breast, hepatobiliary, gastric, glioma, and nasopharyngeal cancers, where its downregulation is linked to advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. In breast cancer, lower CDK10 expression correlates with higher tumor stages and lymph node metastasis, while higher expression is associated with better overall survival (Bazzi2021CDK10). Conversely, in colorectal cancer, CDK10 is upregulated and promotes tumorigenesis, correlating with increased cell proliferation and chemoresistance (Bazzi2021CDK10).

CDK10 mutations are also implicated in developmental disorders. Al Kaissi syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by mutations in the CDK10 gene. This syndrome is characterized by growth retardation, spinal deformities, facial dysmorphisms, and intellectual disability. Mutations often lead to frameshifts or truncations, resulting in reduced CDK10 levels and loss of function (Xue2023CDK10; Colas2020Cyclindependent). These mutations can lead to enhanced ETS2 protein levels and abnormal cilia, contributing to the syndrome's phenotype (Robert2021Functional).

## Interactions
CDK10 interacts with several proteins, influencing its function in various cellular processes. A notable interaction is with cyclin M (CycM), forming a functional kinase complex that regulates CDK10's kinase activity. This interaction is crucial for phosphorylating and controlling the stability of the ETS2 oncoprotein, impacting its transactivation activity (Bazzi2021CDK10; Robert2021Functional). CDK10 binds specifically to the N-terminus of the ETS2 transcription factor, which contains the transactivation and Pointed (PNT) domains. This interaction occurs both in vitro and in vivo and is independent of CDK10's kinase activity, suggesting a regulatory role in modulating ETS2's function (Kasten2001Cdk10).

CDK10 also interacts with proteins involved in ciliogenesis. It co-localizes with cyclin M at the base of primary cilia, suggesting a role in this process. The CDK10/cyclin M complex phosphorylates PKN2, repressing ciliogenesis in a RhoA-dependent manner (Bazzi2021CDK10). In ER-positive breast cancer cells, CDK10 interacts with Pin1, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation, highlighting its potential role in tumor suppression (Bazzi2021CDK10). These interactions underscore CDK10's involvement in diverse cellular functions and its dual role as a tumor suppressor and oncogene.
