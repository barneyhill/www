# BID

## Overview
The BID gene encodes the BH3 interacting domain death agonist, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis. This gene is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by mediating programmed cell death and is involved in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The BID protein, characterized by its BH3-only domain, is activated through proteolytic cleavage by caspase-8, resulting in a truncated form known as tBid, which is essential for the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and subsequent activation of the apoptotic cascade (Esposti2001Bid; Hikita2009BH3only). Beyond its role in apoptosis, BID is implicated in the DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation, highlighting its multifaceted functions in cellular processes (Yin2006Bid). The gene's involvement in various cellular pathways underscores its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions, such as cancer, where alterations in BID expression or function can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Sinicrope2008Proapoptotic; Green2005Expression).

## Structure
The BID protein is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, characterized by its BH3-only domain, which is crucial for its apoptotic function. The primary structure of BID consists of 190-195 amino acids, with a significant portion being hydrophobic and organized into alpha helices (Esposti2002TherolesofBid). The secondary structure is predominantly alpha-helical, with eight alpha helices forming the core of the protein (Yin2006Bid). The tertiary structure of BID reveals a similarity to other Bcl-2 family proteins, featuring a central hydrophobic core formed by helices 6 and 7, surrounded by amphipathic helices (Billen2008Bid:). The BH3 domain, located in helix 3, is essential for interactions with other Bcl-2 family proteins like Bax and Bcl-xL (Billen2008Bid:).

BID undergoes post-translational modifications, including cleavage by caspase-8, which activates its pro-apoptotic function by exposing the BH3 domain (Yin2006Bid). This cleavage results in a truncated form, tBid, which is more potent in inducing apoptosis (Yin2006Bid). BID also has splice variant isoforms, such as Bid S, Bid EL, and Bid ES, which may have distinct roles in apoptosis (Renshaw2004Three).

## Function
The BID gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Bcl-2 family, which is involved in regulating apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death. In healthy human cells, BID plays a dual role in both promoting apoptosis and supporting cell survival and proliferation. BID is activated through proteolytic cleavage by caspase-8, which converts it into its truncated form, tBid. This form is crucial for the mitochondrial cell death pathway, as it facilitates the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, leading to apoptosis (Esposti2001Bid; Hikita2009BH3only).

BID also acts as a DNA damage sensor and is involved in the DNA damage response. It is phosphorylated by ATM and ATR kinases, which are activated in response to DNA damage. This phosphorylation is necessary for S phase arrest, preventing cells from entering mitosis with damaged DNA (Yin2006Bid). Additionally, BID has a role in cell cycle regulation, particularly affecting the G0-G1 transition and altering the pre-S phase duration, which promotes cell proliferation (Yin2006Bid).

In the context of liver cells, BID is involved in the Bcl-2 network, where it regulates apoptosis even under non-stress conditions, highlighting its role in maintaining the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic signals (Hikita2009BH3only).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BID gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In gastric cancer, BID mutations are rare but can lead to impaired apoptotic function. A study identified mutations in 6% of gastric cancer samples, including a frameshift mutation that significantly reduced apoptosis and increased resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Lee2004Inactivating). This suggests that BID mutations may contribute to cancer cell survival and treatment resistance.

In colon cancer, high expression levels of BID are associated with better overall survival in patients treated with 5-FU-based therapy, indicating its role as a prognostic marker (Sinicrope2008Proapoptotic). Conversely, in cervical carcinoma, high BID expression correlates with poor radiotherapy outcomes, particularly in younger patients, suggesting that altered BID regulation may affect its apoptotic activity and contribute to aggressive tumor phenotypes (Green2005Expression).

BID's interaction with the tumor suppressor protein p53 also influences chemosensitivity. BID is upregulated in response to p53 activation, enhancing apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Loss of BID function can lead to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents like adriamycin and 5-FU (Sax2002BID).

## Interactions
BID, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, interacts with several proteins to mediate apoptosis and the DNA damage response. In apoptosis, BID interacts with Bcl2 and Bax proteins. Upon activation by caspase-8 cleavage, BID translocates to the mitochondria, where it facilitates the release of cytochrome c, a critical step in the apoptotic pathway. This interaction is crucial for the activation of downstream caspases, such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 (Luo1998Bid).

In the context of the DNA damage response, BID interacts with the N-terminal domain of RPA70, a subunit of the replication protein A (RPA) complex. This interaction is essential for the ATR-mediated DNA damage response following replicative stress. BID facilitates the association of ATRIP with RPA, enhancing the formation of the DNA damage sensor complex. Mutations in the RPA-interacting domain (RPA-ID) of BID impair this interaction, affecting ATR function and genomic stability (Liu2011BID).

BID also interacts with mitochondrial carrier homologue 2 (MTCH2), which is crucial for recruiting truncated BID (tBID) to the mitochondria, where it activates Bax to initiate apoptosis (Katz2012Molecular).
