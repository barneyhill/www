# TP53TG5

## Overview
TP53TG5 is a gene that encodes the protein TP53 target 5, which is involved in cellular processes related to the tumor suppressor protein p53. The TP53 target 5 protein is categorized as a regulatory protein, playing a role in the cellular response to stress and DNA damage. It is implicated in the modulation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, processes that are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis. The expression of TP53TG5 is regulated by the p53 pathway, highlighting its importance in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Qiu2020aarFDC).
