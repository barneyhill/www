# PCOLCE2

## Overview
PCOLCE2 is a gene that encodes the protein procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 2 (PCPE2), which is a secreted glycoprotein involved in the maturation of collagen, a critical component of the extracellular matrix. PCPE2 functions as a collagen-binding protein that enhances the activity of procollagen C-proteinases, such as bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1), facilitating the conversion of procollagen to collagen fibrils, thereby contributing to the structural integrity of connective tissues (Steiglitz2002PCOLCE2). The protein is characterized by the presence of two CUB domains and a netrin-like (NTR) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and collagen binding (Xu2000Identification). Beyond its role in collagen processing, PCPE2 is implicated in lipid metabolism through its involvement in the maturation of apolipoprotein AI (apoAI), a key component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Zhu2009Regulation). The gene's expression and function have clinical significance, particularly in cancer and cardiac conditions, where it influences processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cardiac remodeling (Baicu2012Effects; Chen2023Bleomycin).

## Structure
The PCOLCE2 protein is encoded by an open reading frame of 1.77 kb, translating into a polypeptide of 415 amino acids. It is predicted to be a secreted protein with a molecular weight of approximately 46.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.57 (Xu2000Identification). Structurally, PCOLCE2 comprises two CUB domains and a netrin-like (NTR) domain. The CUB domains, located at the amino-terminal end, are involved in protein-protein interactions and are characterized by a hydrophobicity pattern forming a sandwich of two 5-β-stranded sheets (Xu2000Identification). The NTR domain is located at the carboxyl terminus and shares features typical of this module family, including conserved cysteines and hydrophobic residues (Xu2000Identification).

PCOLCE2 is a glycoprotein, but unlike its homolog PCPE1, it lacks N-linked oligosaccharides and instead has sialylated Galβ(1-3)GalNAc O-linked cores (Steiglitz2002PCOLCE2). The protein also contains an RGD sequence, which is involved in cell and integrin binding, a feature not present in PCOLCE1 (Xu2000Identification). The hydrophobicity profiles of PCOLCE1 and PCOLCE2 are similar, with differences noted between the second CUB domain and the NTR module (Xu2000Identification).

## Function
PCOLCE2 encodes a protein known as procollagen C-proteinase enhancer 2 (PCPE2), which plays a crucial role in collagen maturation by enhancing the activity of procollagen C-proteinases such as bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1). This enhancement facilitates the cleavage of the C-terminal propeptide of procollagen, a critical step in the formation of mature collagen fibers, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues (Steiglitz2002PCOLCE2).

PCPE2 is a collagen-binding protein that interacts with type I and type II collagen fibrils, suggesting its involvement in collagen fibrillogenesis and tissue structure maintenance (Steiglitz2002PCOLCE2). The protein is active in the extracellular matrix, where it contributes to the regulation of collagen deposition and processing, particularly in tissues such as the heart, where it is highly expressed (Steiglitz2002PCOLCE2).

In addition to its role in collagen processing, PCPE2 is involved in the regulation of apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) processing, which is crucial for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis. PCPE2 enhances the cleavage and maturation of pro-apoAI by BMP-1, forming a ternary complex that stabilizes the interaction and facilitates the conversion process (Zhu2009Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PCOLCE2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and cardiac conditions. In Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC), PCOLCE2 is involved in the regulation of immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Its expression levels are associated with the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting treatment response (Chen2023Bleomycin).

In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), high expression of PCOLCE2 is linked to the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that facilitates cancer progression and metastasis. Knockdown of PCOLCE2 in COAD cells has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and EMT, indicating its role in cancer progression. PCOLCE2 is also part of a prognostic model for COAD, where its high expression correlates with poor prognosis (Zhang2023An; Yin2024Identification).

In cardiac conditions, PCOLCE2 is crucial for collagen processing in the heart under chronic pressure overload. Its absence leads to reduced collagen accumulation and myocardial stiffness, suggesting its role in cardiac remodeling and potential implications for conditions like cardiac hypertrophy or fibrosis (Baicu2012Effects).

## Interactions
PCOLCE2, encoding the protein procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 2 (PCPE2), participates in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of collagen processing and regulation. PCPE2 is known to interact with bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1), a key enzyme in collagen maturation. This interaction is characterized by PCPE2's ability to inhibit BMP-1 through an allosteric mechanism, primarily involving the non-catalytic CUB1 and CUB2 domains of BMP-1, rather than the catalytic domain (VadonLe2023Identification). 

PCPE2 also binds to procollagens, although this interaction is mutually exclusive with its binding to BMP-1, indicating that PCPE2 cannot simultaneously bind both substrates. This dual binding capacity is specific to procollagen maturation and does not extend to other substrates (VadonLe2023Identification). 

In addition to its role in collagen processing, PCPE2 forms a ternary complex with BMP-1 and pro-apolipoprotein A-I (pro-apoA-I), facilitating the cleavage of the hexapeptide extension at the N-terminus of apoA-I, which is crucial for the regulation of apoA-I synthesis and HDL metabolism (Francone2011Disruption). These interactions highlight PCPE2's multifaceted role in extracellular matrix organization and lipid metabolism.
