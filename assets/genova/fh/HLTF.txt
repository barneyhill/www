# HLTF

## Overview
The HLTF gene encodes the helicase-like transcription factor, a multifunctional protein that plays a pivotal role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling. As a member of the SWI/SNF family, HLTF is characterized by its ATP-dependent DNA translocase activity, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. The protein is equipped with several functional domains, including a HIRAN domain for DNA binding and a RING domain that confers E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Unk2008Human; Dhont2015The). This activity is essential for the error-free post-replication repair of DNA damage, particularly through replication fork reversal, a process that mitigates replication stress (Blastyák2010Role; Bai2020HLTF). HLTF's function is critical in preventing mutagenesis and carcinogenesis, and its inactivation is often associated with various cancers, underscoring its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Poole2017Functions; Dhont2015The).

## Structure
The HLTF protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several functional domains. It contains a HIRAN domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and is involved in recognizing and restarting stalled replication forks (Ikegaya2015Crystallographic; Hishiki2020Structure). The HIRAN domain adopts a modified oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB)-fold, facilitating DNA unwinding during replication fork regression (Chavez2018The). 

HLTF also features seven conserved helicase motifs typical of the SWI/SNF family, which confer ATP-dependent DNA translocase activity (Dhont2015The). The RING domain, located between helicase domains III and IV, is essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, promoting PCNA polyubiquitination (Unk2008Human; Dimitrova2011HLTF). 

The protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct functions and localizations (Dhont2015The). These isoforms may differ in their N-terminal regions, affecting DNA binding and repair activities (Unk2008Human). HLTF's structure and domain organization are highly conserved across species, underscoring its critical role in DNA repair and chromatin remodeling (Dhont2015The).

## Function
The HLTF (helicase-like transcription factor) gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability in human cells. HLTF functions primarily as a ubiquitin ligase and is involved in the polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is essential for error-free post-replication repair of DNA damage (Unk2008Human). This activity is crucial for promoting replication fork reversal, a process that helps manage replication stress by converting stalled replication forks into a structure that allows for template switching and error-free lesion bypass (Blastyák2010Role; Bai2020HLTF).

HLTF's fork reversal activity is dependent on its ATPase domain and is facilitated by its HIRAN domain, which specifically binds to 3'-OH ends of DNA, promoting fork remodeling and restraining fork progression (Poole2017Functions; Bai2020HLTF). This function is vital for preventing unrestrained DNA synthesis and maintaining replication fidelity, thereby reducing the risk of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis (Blastyák2010Role; Bai2020HLTF).

In the absence of HLTF, cells exhibit increased replication stress resistance and rely on alternative, potentially more mutagenic pathways, which can contribute to tumorigenesis (Bai2020HLTF). HLTF is often silenced in certain cancers, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Poole2017Functions).

## Clinical Significance
HLTF (helicase-like transcription factor) is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression and function. Promoter hypermethylation of HLTF is frequently observed in colorectal cancer, where it is associated with larger tumor size, higher stage and grade, and metastatic disease. This epigenetic silencing is considered a driver in carcinogenesis and is linked to poor prognosis (Dhont2015The). In gastric cancer, HLTF hypermethylation is prevalent in dysplasias and invasive carcinomas, particularly in patients with a family history of the disease (Dhont2015The).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), HLTF alterations, such as promoter hypermethylation and alternative splicing, correlate with poor prognosis and shorter survival (Dhont2018Helicaselike). HLTF expression is also altered in head and neck, cervix, and thyroid cancers, where truncated forms lacking DNA repair domains are linked to poor outcomes (Dhont2015The).

HLTF's role in DNA repair is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Its inactivation, through gene silencing or mutations, can lead to increased mutagenesis and chromosomal aberrations, contributing to cancer development (Motegi2008Polyubiquitination; Blastyák2010Role). These findings highlight HLTF's potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

## Interactions
HLTF (helicase-like transcription factor) is involved in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions crucial for DNA repair and replication processes. It interacts with PARP1, a protein involved in DNA repair, to maintain replication fork stability and prevent fork collapse into double-strand breaks. This interaction is stable and does not significantly change upon DNA damage, indicating a consistent association between HLTF and PARP1 (Shiu2020The). HLTF also interacts with BARD1, a protein involved in DNA damage response, suggesting a complex network of interactions at damaged replication forks (Shiu2020The).

The HIRAN domain of HLTF is crucial for its interaction with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), specifically recognizing 3' ssDNA overhangs, which is essential for its role in replication fork reversal (Poole2017Functions; Korzhnev2016Solution). HLTF also interacts with PCNA, a key player in DNA replication, through its ubiquitin ligase activity, promoting PCNA polyubiquitination (Poole2017Functions; MacKay2009Biochemical).

Additionally, HLTF is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by CHFR, a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which regulates HLTF's stability and function (Kim2010CHFR). These interactions highlight HLTF's multifaceted role in DNA repair and replication processes.
