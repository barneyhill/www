# PRR29

## Overview
The PRR29 gene encodes the proline-rich protein 29, which is characterized by its abundance of proline residues. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. PRR29 is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting a potentially broad role in cellular physiology. The protein's proline-rich nature implies it may participate in protein-protein interactions, possibly influencing signaling pathways or structural configurations within the cell. Current research is exploring its involvement in specific pathways and its potential implications in health and disease, although detailed mechanistic insights are still emerging (Qiu2020aarFDC).
