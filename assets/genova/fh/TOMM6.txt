# TOMM6

## Overview
TOMM6 is a gene that encodes the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 6, a helical transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex. This complex is essential for the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria, serving as the primary entry point for these proteins. TOMM6 plays a vital role in stabilizing the TOM complex by interacting with other components, such as TOMM40, through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for the assembly and function of the complex (Guan2021Structural; Palmer2021Mitochondrial). The protein's involvement in maintaining the structural integrity of the TOM complex underscores its importance in mitochondrial function, energy production, and cellular metabolism (Bogorodskiy2021Role). Additionally, TOMM6 has been implicated in various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, where its expression levels are altered, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Ma2023Identification).

## Structure


## Function
TOMM6 is a component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, which is essential for the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria. This complex serves as the primary entry gate for these proteins, facilitating their translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane. TOMM6, along with other small TOM proteins such as TOMM5 and TOMM7, plays a crucial role in stabilizing the TOM complex, ensuring its structural integrity and proper function (Bogorodskiy2021Role; Palmer2021Mitochondrial).

TOMM6 is a helical transmembrane protein that interacts with TOMM40, the central pore-forming component of the TOM complex. It is primarily involved in maintaining the stability of the TOM complex by forming hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with TOMM40, which are essential for the assembly and function of the complex (Guan2021Structural). The presence of lipids, such as PL3, can influence the dynamics of TOMM6, suggesting a role in the assembly process of the TOM complex (Guan2021Structural).

Through its role in the TOM complex, TOMM6 contributes to the efficient import of proteins necessary for mitochondrial function, energy production, and overall cellular metabolism (Bogorodskiy2021Role).

## Clinical Significance
TOMM6 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), TOMM6 is notably downregulated. This downregulation is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. The TOM complex, of which TOMM6 is a part, is crucial for mitochondrial protein transport and homeostasis. Disruption in this complex can lead to impaired mitochondrial function, contributing to the development and progression of AD (Ma2023Identification).

In contrast, TOMM6 is significantly upregulated in response to oxidative stress induced by Crotalus atrox venom in HEK-293T cells. This upregulation suggests a role for TOMM6 in the cellular response to oxidative stress and inflammation. Such responses are relevant in understanding the gene's potential clinical significance in conditions characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation (Khoshneviszadeh2022Crotalus).

While the specific clinical implications of TOMM6 mutations are not fully elucidated, its involvement in mitochondrial protein import and response to cellular stress highlights its potential significance in mitochondrial disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (Bogorodskiy2021Role).

## Interactions
TOMM6 is a component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, which is essential for the import of proteins into mitochondria. It interacts with other components of the TOM complex, such as TOMM22, to facilitate the recognition and translocation of precursor proteins across the outer mitochondrial membrane. A study utilizing genome-scale pooled bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) screening identified TOMM6 as an interacting partner of TOMM22, confirming its role within the TOM complex (Blakely2019Cell). This interaction was validated through BiFC assays, which demonstrated the localization and interaction patterns of TOMM6 with TOMM22, supporting its involvement in mitochondrial membrane processes (Blakely2019Cell). The study highlights the importance of TOMM6 in maintaining the functional integrity of the TOM complex, which is crucial for mitochondrial protein import and overall mitochondrial function.
