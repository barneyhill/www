# SLC26A1

## Overview
SLC26A1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 26 member 1, which is a transmembrane anion transporter. This protein plays a critical role in the transport of sulfate and bicarbonate ions across cell membranes, contributing to the maintenance of sulfate homeostasis in the human body. It is predominantly expressed in the kidneys, where it facilitates the reabsorption of sulfate, working in conjunction with other transporters to regulate plasma sulfate levels. The SLC26A1 protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane segments and specific domains that are essential for its function in anion exchange. Genetic variations in SLC26A1 can lead to disturbances in sulfate balance, with potential implications for musculoskeletal health and conditions such as hyposulfatemia and renal sulfate wasting (Lee2003The; Pfau2023SLC26A1).

## Structure
The SLC26A1 protein is an anion transporter characterized by a structure that includes 12 transmembrane spanning segments, as predicted by hydrophobicity analysis (Lee2003The). The protein is composed of 704 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 75.4 kDa (Lee2003The). It contains several specific domains, including a sulfate transporter signature and a sulfate transporter family domain, which are crucial for its function in anion exchange (Lee2003The). The STAS domain, shared with bacterial anti-sigma factor antagonists, is present in SLC26A1 and may play a role in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (Mount2004The).

The protein sequence also includes a phosphopantetheine attachment site and a tyrosine sulfation site, indicating potential regulatory roles (Lee2003The). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are suggested by the presence of four protein kinase C sites and three casein kinase II sites (Lee2003The). The presence of a consensus PDZ-binding domain at the C-terminus suggests potential regulation by PDZ-mediated interactions (Lee2003The). Alternative splicing of the SLC26A1 gene results in different cDNA variants, which may lead to isoforms with distinct functional properties (Lee2003The).

## Function
SLC26A1, also known as sulfate anion transporter 1 (Sat1), is a crucial component in maintaining sulfate homeostasis in humans. It functions as a pH-sensitive anion exchanger, primarily facilitating the transport of sulfate and bicarbonate ions across cell membranes. This protein also mediates oxalate transport, contributing to its role in cellular metabolism and detoxification processes (Pfau2023SLC26A1).

In healthy human cells, SLC26A1 is predominantly active in the kidneys, where it collaborates with the sodium-sulfate cotransporter SLC13A1 to reabsorb sulfate, thus regulating plasma sulfate levels. This regulation is vital for various physiological processes, including bone and cartilage health (Pfau2023SLC26A1). The protein is expressed on the basolateral membranes of renal proximal tubules, where it likely participates in oxalate secretion alongside other transporters (Mount2004The).

Genetic variations in SLC26A1 can lead to disturbances in sulfate homeostasis, as evidenced by cases of hyposulfatemia and renal sulfate wasting. These conditions highlight the gene's significant role in maintaining sulfate balance and its potential implications for musculoskeletal health (Pfau2023SLC26A1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC26A1 gene can lead to disturbances in sulfate homeostasis, resulting in conditions such as hyposulfatemia and hypersulfaturia. These conditions are characterized by low plasma sulfate levels and excessive urinary sulfate excretion, respectively. A specific mutation, p.Leu275Pro, has been identified in patients with hyposulfatemia and renal sulfate wasting, and is associated with reduced sulfate transport ability. This mutation has been linked to symptoms such as painful perichondritis and kidney stones, although the exact role of SLC26A1 in oxalate homeostasis and kidney stone formation requires further investigation (Pfau2023SLC26A1).

The study of SLC26A1 variants has shown that even heterozygous carriers of damaging variants may experience reduced sulfate transport, potentially contributing to conditions like nephrolithiasis and musculoskeletal symptoms. The Thr185Met variant, in particular, exhibits a strong dominant negative effect, significantly reducing sulfate transport (Pfau2023SLC26A1).

Research suggests that SLC26A1 mutations could be a risk factor for musculoskeletal health issues, such as osteoarthritis and chondropathies, due to their impact on sulfate levels. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these associations need further exploration (Pfau2023SLC26A1).

## Interactions
The SLC26A1 protein, a member of the solute carrier family 26, functions primarily as an anion exchanger involved in the transport of substrates such as oxalate, sulfate, and chloride. While specific protein interactions involving SLC26A1 are not extensively detailed, it is known that SLC26 proteins, in general, can form dimers, which may influence their functional properties (Li2023SLC26). However, studies have not provided evidence of heterodimerization between SLC26A1 and other SLC26 family members, such as SLC26A11, which remains localized to lysosomes and does not change its subcellular distribution when co-expressed with SLC26A1 (BungertPlümke2024Oligomerization).

The interaction between SLC26 family members and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is significant for ion transport regulation. Although specific interactions between SLC26A1 and CFTR are not detailed, the broader context of SLC26-CFTR interactions suggests potential regulatory pathways that could involve SLC26A1 (Pariano2024Unity). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise interaction partners and regulatory mechanisms involving SLC26A1.
