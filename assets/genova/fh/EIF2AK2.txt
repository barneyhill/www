# EIF2AK2

## Overview
EIF2AK2, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 2, is a gene that encodes the protein PKR, a serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase. PKR plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to stress, particularly in the context of viral infections. The protein is characterized by its N-terminal double-stranded RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, which are essential for its activation and function (Krishna2018Molecular; Blalock2012EIF2AK2). Upon activation by stress signals such as double-stranded RNA, PKR phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2α), leading to a reduction in general protein synthesis while promoting the translation of stress response proteins (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). Beyond its role in translation regulation, PKR is involved in various signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, influencing immune responses and cellular stress management (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with several diseases, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, where its expression and mutations can impact disease progression and patient prognosis (English2021A; Du2023Eukaryotic).

## Structure
The EIF2AK2 gene encodes the protein PKR, which plays a critical role in the cellular response to viral infections. The primary structure of PKR includes an N-terminal double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) and a C-terminal kinase domain (KD) (Krishna2018Molecular; Blalock2012EIF2AK2). The dsRBD contains two double-stranded RNA binding motifs separated by an unstructured linker, which are essential for recognizing viral RNA (Krishna2018Molecular). The kinase domain is crucial for the protein's catalytic functions and dimerization, which is necessary for its activation (Krishna2018Molecular).

PKR undergoes autophosphorylation, a common post-translational modification, which is essential for its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2α (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). Specific phosphorylation sites, such as T451, are required for kinase activity, while others like Y101, Y162, and T446 enhance activity (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). The protein's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is stabilized upon binding to double-stranded RNA and is necessary for its function (Krishna2018Molecular).

Alternative splicing of the EIF2AK2 gene results in variants with differences in the 3' non-coding regions, although the functional implications of these variants are not fully detailed (Perelygin2006Comparative).

## Function
EIF2AK2, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 2, encodes the protein PKR, which is a serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PKR plays a crucial role in regulating translation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is activated by stress signals such as double-stranded RNA, cytotoxic cytokines, and DNA damage, leading to the phosphorylation of eIF2α. This phosphorylation event inhibits general protein synthesis while allowing the selective translation of stress response proteins, which can be pro-survival by enabling cells to manage stress effectively (Blalock2012EIF2AK2).

PKR also interacts with several signaling pathways, including the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, influencing immune responses and stress responses through p38-MAPK and JNK activation (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). It phosphorylates various targets such as p53, STAT1, and STAT3, affecting their activity and thereby influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, DNA repair, and apoptosis (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). PKR's role in immune response regulation is highlighted by its ability to induce NF-κB activation and enhance the transcription of NF-κB dependent genes (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). Overall, EIF2AK2/PKR is essential for managing cellular stress and maintaining homeostasis in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
EIF2AK2, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase 2, is implicated in various diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In pancreatic cancer, high EIF2AK2 expression is associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and disease-specific survival. It is linked to tumor aggressiveness and may serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Du2023Eukaryotic). In leukemia, a mutation in EIF2AK2 was identified in a pediatric T-ALL patient, resulting in a protein that could not be activated by polyI:C. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a rearrangement leads to a truncated protein with dominant-negative activity (Blalock2012EIF2AK2).

EIF2AK2 mutations are also associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as LEUDEN syndrome, characterized by developmental delay and neurologic regression. These mutations are typically loss of function, whereas mutations linked to early-onset generalized dystonia are gain of function, affecting the integrated stress response (English2021A). In inflammatory diseases, EIF2AK2 is involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, although specific polymorphisms like rs2254958 have not shown significant associations with inflammatory bowel disease (VARGHESE2015Polymorphism).

## Interactions
EIF2AK2, also known as PKR, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence multiple cellular processes. It interacts with the IKK complex, which affects NF-κB activation and the synthesis of NF-κB dependent transcripts (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). PKR enhances the activity of STAT1 through MAPK-mediated phosphorylation and associates with B56α, a regulatory subunit of PP2A, leading to increased PP2A activity and decreased phosphorylation of eIF4E, impacting translation rates (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). During genotoxic stress, PKR phosphorylates Cdc2 (CDK1), resulting in its degradation and G2 arrest (Blalock2012EIF2AK2).

PKR is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and other non-self RNAs, which induces conformational changes that release its kinase domain, leading to apoptosis in virus-infected cells (Du2023Eukaryotic). It also interacts with RNA helicase and influences signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway and transcription factors like NF-κB, C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and ATF3 (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). PKR's interaction with JAK1 and TYK2 kinases has been observed, where these kinases can phosphorylate PKR on specific tyrosine residues (Blalock2012EIF2AK2). The role of PKR as a non-receptor tyrosine kinase remains debated (Blalock2012EIF2AK2).
