# RAMP3

## Overview
RAMP3 (receptor activity-modifying protein 3) is a gene that encodes a single transmembrane accessory protein involved in the modulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The protein product of RAMP3 plays a crucial role in the trafficking, signaling, and ligand specificity of GPCRs, particularly influencing the function of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and the formation of adrenomedullin and amylin receptors (Kotliar2022Elucidating; Bailey2010Functional). RAMP3 is characterized by its structured extracellular domain and a PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminus, which facilitates interactions with proteins such as the Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor (NHERF) and the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), impacting receptor internalization and recycling (Parameswaran2006RAMPs:; Bomberger2005Novel). The protein is implicated in various physiological processes, including cardiovascular homeostasis, bone development, and metabolic regulation, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular responsiveness and receptor turnover (Prakash2019Analysis; Liu2018RAMP3).

## Structure
RAMP3 (receptor activity-modifying protein 3) is a single transmembrane-spanning protein with a structured extracellular N-terminal domain and a short intracellular C-terminal tail. The extracellular domain (ECD) of RAMP3 includes a three-helix bundle, similar in structure to RAMP1 but shorter than RAMP2 (Kotliar2022Elucidating). The ECD contains four predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, which are important for protein stability and function (Hay2016Receptor; Kotliar2022Elucidating). 

The C-terminal tail of RAMP3 features a PDZ-binding motif (Asp-Thr-Leu-Leu), which interacts with proteins such as the Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor (NHERF) and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), influencing receptor internalization and recycling (Parameswaran2006RAMPs:; Bomberger2005Novel). This motif is crucial for the resensitization and recycling of the CRLR-RAMP3 receptor complex (Bomberger2005Novel).

RAMP3 forms heterodimers with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), affecting their ligand specificity and signaling pathways. The interaction with GPCRs is influenced by the structural elements of RAMP3, such as the unwinding of helix 1 and the kink in helix 3, which affect the orientation of residues important for CLR association (Qi2009Structure−Function).

## Function
RAMP3 (receptor activity-modifying protein 3) is a single transmembrane accessory protein that plays a critical role in the trafficking and function of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR). It is involved in the recycling and resensitization of receptor complexes, which is essential for maintaining receptor signaling and cellular responsiveness. RAMP3 interacts with the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) through its PDZ motif, facilitating the recycling of the CRLR-RAMP3 complex from a degradative to a recycling pathway, thus restoring the receptor to the plasma membrane in a functional state (Bomberger2005Novel).

In healthy human cells, RAMP3 is active in the cell membrane and influences processes such as vasodilation and cardiovascular homeostasis. It modulates the pharmacology, trafficking, and signaling characteristics of certain GPCRs, forming complexes with the calcitonin receptor to create amylin receptors and with CRLR to form adrenomedullin receptors (Bailey2010Functional). RAMP3 is also implicated in maintaining normal body weight in aged animals and plays a role in bone development, acting as a negative modulator of bone adaptation (Prakash2019Analysis). These functions highlight RAMP3's importance in receptor turnover regulation and its broader regulatory role in GPCR trafficking.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RAMP3 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions. RAMP3 is involved in forming receptor complexes with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are crucial for signaling pathways related to cardiovascular and metabolic health. Variants of RAMP3, such as the AK222469 variant, have shown reduced potency in adrenomedullin (AM) and amylin receptor complexes, likely due to decreased cell-surface expression. This reduction in receptor function could impact conditions related to angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and food intake (Bailey2010Functional).

In postmenopausal women, RAMP3 deficiency has been associated with increased obesity and metabolic disorders. RAMP3 knockout mice exhibited increased adipocyte hypertrophy, higher visceral white adipose tissue weights, elevated serum insulin levels, and increased inflammation markers, suggesting a role in regulating adipose tissue function and metabolic health (Liu2018RAMP3).

RAMP3 gene polymorphisms have also been linked to body composition and fracture risk in humans. In elderly women, certain RAMP3 SNPs were associated with a higher risk of fractures, independent of bone density and fat mass, indicating a potential role in bone health and metabolism (Prakash2019Analysis).

## Interactions
RAMP3 interacts with various G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), influencing their trafficking, signaling, and ligand specificity. It forms complexes with the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) to create functional receptors for adrenomedullin, a peptide involved in cardiovascular regulation (Parameswaran2006RAMPs:; Kotliar2022Elucidating). RAMP3 also interacts with the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a class C GPCR, facilitating its cell surface expression (Hay2016Receptor; Parameswaran2006RAMPs:).

RAMP3 contains a PDZ-binding motif at its C-terminus, which is crucial for its interaction with the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). This interaction is essential for the recycling and resensitization of receptor complexes, such as the CRLR-RAMP3 complex, after internalization (Bomberger2005Novel). The PDZ motif also allows RAMP3 to interact with the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF), affecting receptor internalization by tethering the receptor to the actin cytoskeleton (Parameswaran2006RAMPs:).

RAMP3's interactions extend to other GPCRs, including GPR30, an estradiol receptor, and the parathyroid hormone-2 receptor (PTH2R), highlighting its role in diverse signaling pathways (Hay2016Receptor; Parameswaran2006RAMPs:). These interactions underscore RAMP3's significant role in modulating GPCR function and signaling.
