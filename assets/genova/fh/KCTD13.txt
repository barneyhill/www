# KCTD13

## Overview
KCTD13 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 13, which is a member of the BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain-containing family. This protein is primarily involved in the formation of oligomeric complexes and functions as an adaptor protein within the cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in protein ubiquitination and degradation processes (Smaldone2016The; Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). KCTD13 is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in neurodevelopment, where it influences neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as synaptic transmission and neuronal development (Kizner2019CRISPR/Cas9-mediated; Gu2023KCTD13mediated). Alterations in KCTD13 expression or function are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Gu2023KCTD13mediated; Madison2021Regulation).

## Structure
KCTD13 is a member of the potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing family, characterized by the presence of a conserved BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain at the N-terminus. This domain is crucial for oligomerization and interaction with other proteins, such as cullin 3, and is involved in the formation of tetrameric and pentameric assemblies (Smaldone2016The; Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted). The BTB domain of KCTD13 has been structurally characterized with a PDB code of 4UIJ, showing a resolution of 2.7 Å and an RMSD of 0.3 Å over 102 residues (Esposito2021AlphaFoldPredicted).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of KCTD13, despite lacking sequence similarity with other KCTD proteins, shares structural features that contribute to its oligomerization properties. AlphaFold predictions suggest that KCTD13 can form stable dimeric states, driven by interactions in the CTD regions, with a buried interface area of approximately 1700 Å² per subunit (Esposito2022Alphafold). The dimeric association is stabilized by interactions between external β-strand regions, and the structure maintains a preserved secondary structure, although it exhibits a bending motion in the global structure (Esposito2022Alphafold). These structural features are crucial for KCTD13's role in various biological processes, including its involvement in neurological pathologies (Esposito2022Alphafold).

## Function
The KCTD13 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of neurodevelopment. It is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and DNA replication, as it interacts with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) and stimulates DNA polymerase delta activity, suggesting a role in DNA synthesis and repair pathways (Golzio2012KCTD13; Kizner2019CRISPR/Cas9-mediated). KCTD13 is also implicated in the regulation of neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation into cortical neurons. Knockout studies in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have shown that KCTD13 deficiency leads to decreased proliferation of neural progenitor cells and impaired neurite formation, which is crucial for neural network development (Kizner2019CRISPR/Cas9-mediated).

In terms of cellular localization, KCTD13 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it functions as an adaptor protein for the Cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is important for the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins, such as RhoA, which influences cytoskeletal reorganization and neurite outgrowth (Arbogast2018Kctd13deficient; Golzio2012KCTD13). These molecular activities highlight KCTD13's role in maintaining normal brain structure and function, potentially affecting synaptic connections and neuronal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KCTD13 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy. KCTD13 is located within the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, a locus linked to autism risk. Deletion of KCTD13 leads to decreased ubiquitination and increased levels of adenylosuccinate synthetase (ADSS), resulting in elevated purine metabolites, which are linked to features of ADSL deficiency, such as seizures and autistic traits (Madison2021Regulation). 

In zebrafish models, KCTD13 dosage changes result in neuroanatomical defects, with overexpression causing microcephaly and knockdown leading to macrocephaly, indicating its role in brain development (Golzio2012KCTD13). In mouse models, KCTD13 mutations replicate cognitive deficits seen in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, affecting memory but not hyperactivity (Martin2021Targeting).

KCTD13 also plays a role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) by regulating the ubiquitination and degradation of the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors. Altered KCTD13 expression affects synaptic transmission and seizure susceptibility, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for epilepsy (Gu2023KCTD13mediated). Additionally, KCTD13 copy number variations are linked to isolated hypospadias, with deletions correlating with increased risk and severity (Chen2024Novel).

## Interactions
KCTD13 is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its role as an adapter in a cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of specific protein substrates. One of its key interactions is with GluN1, a subunit of NMDA receptors. KCTD13 promotes the polyubiquitination of GluN1, leading to its degradation via the proteasome pathway. This interaction is crucial for regulating excitatory synaptic transmission and seizure susceptibility, particularly in the context of epilepsy (Gu2023KCTD13mediated).

KCTD13 also interacts with CUL3, forming a complex that is essential for the ubiquitination process. The interaction between KCTD13 and CUL3 is necessary for the degradation of GluN1, as demonstrated by the inability of an E3 ligase-deficient KCTD13 mutant to co-precipitate CUL3 or reduce GluN1 levels (Gu2023KCTD13mediated).

In addition to GluN1, KCTD13 interacts with other proteins such as ADSS, where it acts as a substrate adapter, recruiting ADSS to the CUL3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is significant for the regulation of purine metabolism and is linked to metabolic disorders with autistic features (Madison2021Regulation).
