# PRADC1

## Overview
PRADC1 is a gene that encodes the protein protease associated domain containing 1, which is involved in various biological processes. The protein is characterized by its protease-associated domain, suggesting a potential role in proteolytic activities, although its precise biological functions are not fully elucidated. Research has indicated that PRADC1 may be involved in pathways related to colorectal cancer and Hirschsprung disease, as well as influencing intrinsic cardiorespiratory fitness through its expression in heart, adipose, and skeletal muscle tissues (Gylfe2013Eleven; Ghosh2019Exploring; Bae2016A). Further studies are required to fully understand the functional implications of PRADC1 and its encoded protein in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
The PRADC1 gene has been implicated in several health conditions, although its clinical significance is still under investigation. In the context of familial colorectal cancer (CRC), PRADC1 was identified as one of the candidate susceptibility genes through exome sequencing of familial CRC cases. Truncating variants in PRADC1 were found in two out of 96 familial CRC cases, suggesting a potential role in CRC predisposition. However, further studies are needed to confirm the pathogenicity of these variants and their contribution to CRC risk (Gylfe2013Eleven).

PRADC1 has also been associated with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). A genome-wide association study identified a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) region on chromosome 2, where PRADC1 is located, showing a higher frequency in HSCR patients compared to controls. This suggests a potential link between PRADC1 and HSCR, although the specific clinical implications of PRADC1 mutations in this context remain unclear (Bae2016A).

Additionally, PRADC1 has been linked to intrinsic cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Genetic variants associated with CRF have shown strong eQTL predictions for PRADC1 in heart, adipose, and skeletal muscle tissues, indicating a possible role in CRF regulation (Ghosh2019Exploring).
