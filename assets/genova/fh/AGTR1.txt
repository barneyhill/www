# AGTR1

## Overview
The AGTR1 gene encodes the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), a critical component of the renin-angiotensin system, which is primarily involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. AT1R is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a structural feature that facilitates its role in signal transduction across cell membranes (Lusiana2022THE). Upon binding with its ligand, angiotensin II, AT1R activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including both G protein-dependent and independent mechanisms, which are essential for various physiological processes such as cardiac hypertrophy, vascular inflammation, and renal function (Hunyady2006Pleiotropic). The receptor's ability to engage in diverse signaling pathways underscores its pleiotropic nature, influencing both normal physiological functions and the pathogenesis of conditions like hypertension and atherosclerosis (Hunyady2006Pleiotropic).

## Structure
The AGTR1 protein, encoded by the AGTR1 gene, is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a primary structure consisting of 359 amino acids. It is characterized by seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of the GPCR superfamily, which span from amino acid positions 31 to 305 (Lusiana2022THE). The protein's secondary structure includes these helical transmembrane domains, which are linked by three extracellular and three intracellular loops (Lusiana2022THE).

The tertiary structure of AGTR1 features two pairs of disulfide bridges formed by four cysteine residues in the extracellular domain. One disulfide bridge connects the second and third extracellular loops, a highly conserved feature among GPCRs, while the other connects the N-terminus and the last extracellular loop (Lusiana2022THE). 

Post-translational modifications of AGTR1 include N-glycosylation at Asn4, Asn176, and Asn188, located in the NH2 terminal and the second extracellular loop, as well as phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C (PKC) in the carboxyl terminal region (Lusiana2022THE). The protein exists in two isoforms: a short isoform of 359 amino acids and a longer isoform of 391 amino acids (Balgir2018In).

## Function
The AGTR1 gene encodes the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R), a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system, primarily regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. In healthy human cells, AT1R is involved in various signaling pathways, including both G protein-dependent and independent mechanisms. Upon activation by angiotensin II (Ang II), AT1R primarily couples with Gq/11 proteins, leading to inositol phosphate/Ca2+ signaling, which is significant in tissues such as adrenal, neuronal, cardiac, renal, and smooth muscle cells (Hunyady2006Pleiotropic). This signaling is crucial for physiological processes like cardiac hypertrophy, vascular inflammation, and renal fibrosis (Hunyady2006Pleiotropic).

AT1R also engages in G protein-independent signaling, such as β-arrestin-mediated MAPK activation, which influences cellular processes like cytoskeletal reorganization and chemotaxis (Hunyady2006Pleiotropic). The receptor's activation can lead to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, promoting growth, inflammation, and fibrosis (Hunyady2006Pleiotropic). Additionally, AT1R can form homo- and heterodimers with other receptors, affecting its signaling capabilities and potentially influencing conditions like hypertension and atherosclerosis (Hunyady2006Pleiotropic). These diverse signaling pathways underscore the receptor's pleiotropic nature in mediating both physiological and potentially pathogenic actions of Ang II in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AGTR1 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. Polymorphisms in AGTR1, such as the rs5186:A4C SNP, have been linked to cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, metabolic syndrome traits, and left ventricular hypertrophy (Abdollahi2007Quantitated). The presence of the C allele in this polymorphism is associated with reduced mRNA abundance, particularly in CC homozygotes, which may influence these clinical phenotypes (Abdollahi2007Quantitated).

AGTR1 gene variations are also implicated in psychiatric disorders. Genetic variations in AGTR1 have been associated with major depressive disorder and differences in brain morphology, such as hippocampal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volumes (Taylor2012AGTR1).

In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the AGTR1 c.1166A > C polymorphism is associated with a later age at diagnosis and more advanced disease stages, suggesting a role in the disease's clinical variability (Pousada2015Molecular; Chung2009Polymorphism).

Additionally, AGTR1 polymorphisms are linked to renal tubular dysgenesis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired renal development and severe clinical outcomes (Kirch2020Anhydramnios). These findings highlight the clinical significance of AGTR1 in various pathologies.

## Interactions
The angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that influence its signaling and function. AGTR1 interacts with phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) in vascular smooth muscle cells, a process dependent on angiotensin II stimulation and tyrosine phosphorylation. This interaction is facilitated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 319 in the YIPP motif of the receptor, which is recognized by the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of PLCγ1 (Venema1998Angiotensin).

AGTR1 also interacts with the invariant chain (CD74), which acts as a negative regulator by retaining AGTR1 in the endoplasmic reticulum and promoting its proteasomal degradation. This interaction reduces AGTR1 density at the cell surface and affects its signaling (Szaszák2008Identification).

Another significant interaction involves ATRAP (AT1 receptor-associated protein), which binds specifically to the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of AGTR1. ATRAP modulates receptor signaling by inhibiting phospholipase C activation, suggesting a role in receptor desensitization (Daviet1999Cloning).

AGTR1 also forms a signaling complex with Jak2 kinase, where the YIPP motif is crucial for Jak2 binding, highlighting a unique interaction not typically associated with seven-transmembrane receptors (Ali1997Dependence).
