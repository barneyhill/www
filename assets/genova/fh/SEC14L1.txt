# SEC14L1

## Overview
SEC14L1 is a gene that encodes the SEC14-like lipid-binding protein 1, which is a member of the SEC14-like lipid-binding protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a SEC14 domain, known for its lipid-binding capabilities, and a C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions related to Golgi function or trafficking (Saito2007The). Additionally, SEC14L1 contains an N-terminal PRELI/MSF1 domain involved in membrane association and lipid transfer, playing a role in mitochondrial protein sorting and phosphatidylethanolamine metabolism (Montag2023Role). Functionally, SEC14L1 is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and lipid metabolism, impacting cellular processes and membrane dynamics (Montag2023Role; Nile2010Mammalian). It interacts with transporters on synaptic vesicles and has a regulatory role in antiviral immunity through its interaction with the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (Montag2023Role). Mutations in SEC14L1 have been linked to various diseases, including lymphoproliferative disorders and aggressive prostate cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Parker2016Molecular; Fabbri2022Identification).

## Structure
The SEC14L1 protein is characterized by the presence of a SEC14 domain and a C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain. The SEC14 domain is known for its lipid-binding capabilities, featuring a two-lobed globular structure with a large hydrophobic phosphatidylinositol-binding pocket. This pocket is formed by four antiparallel β-strands bordered by two long α-helices, resembling a fist with an opposable thumb (Saito2007The). The GOLD domain, consisting of eight β-strands organized as a jelly-roll barrel, acts as a protein-protein interaction module involved in Golgi function or trafficking (Saito2007The).

The SEC14L1 protein also contains an N-terminal PRELI/MSF1 domain, which is involved in protein association to membranes and lipid transfer. This domain is implicated in mitochondrial protein sorting and phosphatidylethanolamine metabolism (Montag2023Role). The SEC14 domain's structure allows it to bind various lipids, including phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine, and is involved in lipid transport between membranes (Saito2007The). The specific ligands for SEC14L1 remain unclear, but it has been found to associate with transporters on synaptic vesicles, potentially influencing intracellular vesicle trafficking (Saito2007The).

## Function
SEC14L1 is a member of the SEC14-like lipid-binding protein family, characterized by the presence of a SEC14 domain and a PRELI/MSF1 domain. In healthy human cells, SEC14L1 is primarily involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking. It interacts with transporters such as the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VACht) and the choline transporter 1 (CHT1) on synaptic vesicles, suggesting a role in the transport of these vesicles within the cell (Saito2007The; Montag2023Role).

The SEC14 domain of SEC14L1 is crucial for lipid-binding, facilitating the transport and exchange of phospholipids between membranes. This domain allows SEC14L1 to participate in lipid metabolism and signaling pathways, impacting membrane dynamics and cellular processes (Saito2007The; Montag2023Role). The protein's interaction with the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) indicates a regulatory function in antiviral immunity, mediated through its PRELI and SEC14 domains (Montag2023Role).

SEC14L1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function by modulating lipid signaling and metabolism, rather than merely transferring lipids between membranes (Nile2010Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SEC14L1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. A proline-to-alanine missense mutation in the SEC14L1 gene has been identified in the amino terminal of the PRELI-MSF1 domain, potentially disrupting domain folding and affecting its function. This mutation is predicted to be damaging and may contribute to lymphoproliferative disorders, although its specific role in lymphoid cells is not fully understood (Parker2016Molecular).

SEC14L1 is also associated with aggressive prostate cancers, where it acts as a putative biomarker. It has been identified as a binding partner and negative regulator of the RIG-I protein, which is involved in the immune response to viral infections (Parker2016Molecular). In the context of viral diseases, SEC14L1 has been implicated in the immune response against infections such as Pseudorabies in wild boars, suggesting a role in genetic resistance or susceptibility to viral and bacterial diseases (Fabbri2022Identification).

Additionally, SEC14L1 has been identified as a key gene associated with the prognosis of uveal melanoma, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Lyu2024Identification). Its involvement in innate immunity and potential role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma have also been noted (Thomsen2024Haplotype).

## Interactions
SEC14L1, a member of the SEC14-GOLD family, is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and interacts with several proteins. It associates with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VACht) and the choline transporter 1 (CHT1) on synaptic vesicles, indicating a role in the transport of these vesicles (Saito2007The; Montag2023Role). SEC14L1 also has a negative regulatory function on the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which is crucial for antiviral immunity. This interaction is inhibited through SEC14L1's interactions via its PRELI domain and SEC14 domain, suggesting its involvement in regulating immune responses (Montag2023Role).

The SEC14L1 protein contains a C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions related to Golgi function or trafficking. This domain is often found in combination with lipid-binding domains, suggesting roles in integrating lipid signaling with protein complexes in organelle homeostasis or traffic (Saito2007The). However, specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context (Saito2007The).
