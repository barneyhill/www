# TCTN3

## Overview
TCTN3 is a gene that encodes the protein tectonic family member 3, which is a crucial component of the tectonic complex involved in ciliogenesis and ciliary function. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is located at the transition zone of primary cilia, where it plays a significant role in regulating the composition of the ciliary membrane and the trafficking of proteins into the cilia. Tectonic family member 3 is essential for the proper functioning of signaling pathways, such as the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway, which is vital for various developmental processes. Disruptions in TCTN3 can lead to severe ciliopathies, including Mohr-Majewski syndrome, highlighting its importance in normal cellular signaling and development (Gong2018Tectonic; Thomas2012TCTN3).

## Function
The TCTN3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the tectonic family, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of ciliogenesis and ciliary function. TCTN3 is located at the transition zone of primary cilia, where it is involved in the regulation of ciliary membrane composition and the trafficking of proteins into the cilia. This function is essential for the proper localization of proteins such as adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3), Smoothened (Smo), and ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 13B (Arl13b) within the cilia, which are important for signaling pathways and cellular functions (Gong2018Tectonic).

TCTN3 is also implicated in the regulation of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes. It forms a complex with TCTN1 and TCTN2 at the ciliary transition zone, contributing to the proper transduction of the Shh signaling pathway. Disruption of TCTN3 can lead to severe ciliopathies, highlighting its critical role in ciliary function and development (Thomas2012TCTN3).

In healthy human cells, TCTN3 is necessary for the effective trafficking of proteins into the cilia, which is vital for the development and maintenance of cilia, and consequently, for normal cellular signaling and development (Gong2018Tectonic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TCTN3 gene are associated with several severe ciliopathies, including Mohr-Majewski syndrome, a form of orofaciodigital syndrome type IV (OFD IV). This condition is characterized by a combination of bone dysplasia, tibial defects, cystic kidneys, and brain anomalies. Truncating mutations in TCTN3 disrupt the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for ciliary function, leading to these severe phenotypes (Thomas2012TCTN3).

In mice, knockout of the Tctn3 gene results in significant developmental abnormalities, including neural tube defects, abnormal head development, and prenatal lethality. These defects are linked to disrupted SHH signaling and increased neuronal apoptosis, highlighting the gene's critical role in neural development (Wang2018Loss).

TCTN3 mutations have also been implicated in congenital heart disease (CHD) associated with polydactyly. In human pluripotent stem cells, TCTN3 mutations result in reduced cardiac myocyte contraction, suggesting a role in heart development (Chen2020Novel).

Additionally, TCTN3 is involved in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through its role in the hedgehog signaling pathway. Suppression of TCTN3 by Cordyceps militaris leads to apoptosis in NSCLC cells, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Jo2020Cordyceps).

## Interactions
TCTN3 is a component of the tectonic complex, which includes TCTN1 and TCTN2, and plays a crucial role in the ciliary transition zone. This complex acts as a diffusional barrier, slowing the diffusion of membrane proteins and ensuring proper sorting and composition of the ciliary membrane. The tectonic complex interacts with members of the MKS module, such as MKS1, TMEM216, TMEM67, B9D1, CC2D2A, and CEP290, which are part of the NPHP module. These interactions are essential for maintaining the distinct protein composition of the ciliary membrane and are implicated in the proper functioning of cilia (Truong2023Tectonic).

TCTN3 is also involved in the transduction of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway. Mutations in TCTN3 can disrupt this pathway, as evidenced by altered processing of the GLI3 protein in patient cells, indicating that TCTN3 is necessary for proper SHH signaling. This disruption can lead to ciliopathies, such as Mohr-Majewski syndrome, characterized by skeletal and orofacial abnormalities (Thomas2012TCTN3).
