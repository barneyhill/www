# CCNA2

## Overview
The CCNA2 gene encodes cyclin A2, a crucial regulatory protein involved in cell cycle control. Cyclin A2 is a member of the cyclin family, which is characterized by its role in regulating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that drive cell cycle transitions. Specifically, cyclin A2 is integral to the progression of the S phase and the transition to mitosis, forming complexes with CDK1 and CDK2 to facilitate these processes. Beyond its fundamental role in cell cycle regulation, cyclin A2 is implicated in DNA repair and cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing cell motility and genomic stability. The gene's expression and regulation have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where alterations in CCNA2 can affect tumor progression and patient prognosis (Guo2021Cyclin; Bayard2018Cyclin; Bendris2012Cyclin).

## Function
Cyclin A2, encoded by the CCNA2 gene, is a pivotal regulator of the cell cycle in healthy human cells. It plays a crucial role in the progression of the S phase and the transition to mitosis. Cyclin A2 forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), initially with CDK2 and later with CDK1, to facilitate the phosphorylation of various substrates necessary for cell cycle progression (Bendris2012Cyclin). During the S phase, cyclin A2-CDK2 complexes phosphorylate proteins such as pRB and components of the SWI/SNF complex, enabling the transcription of genes required for the S and G2/M phases (Bendris2012Cyclin).

Cyclin A2 is also involved in centrosome duplication and prevents reduplication through interactions with MCM5 and Orc1. In mitosis, it contributes to chromosome condensation and nuclear envelope breakdown by phosphorylating histone H3 and nuclear lamins (Bendris2012Cyclin). Cyclin A2 is essential for the proper attachment of the mitotic spindle to the cell cortex, ensuring accurate cell division (Bendris2012Cyclin).

Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, cyclin A2 is involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in the brain. It localizes to sites of DNA damage and is involved in the phosphorylation of H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, supporting its role in maintaining genomic stability (Gygli2016Cyclin). Cyclin A2 also plays a role in cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing cell motility and invasiveness by interacting with the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway (Bendris2012Cyclin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CCNA2 gene, which encodes cyclin A2, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a specific subclass known as CCN-HCC is characterized by the activation of CCNA2 through mechanisms such as viral insertions and gene fusions. These alterations lead to high proliferation and replication stress, contributing to a poor prognosis in affected patients (Bayard2018Cyclin). The study of CCN-HCC highlights the potential for targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors, to address the replication stress response pathway (Bayard2018Cyclin).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), cyclin A2 expression levels are associated with prognosis. High CCNA2 expression is linked to better recurrence-free survival and is considered a good prognostic factor in certain CRC subtypes (Guo2021Cyclin; Guo2019Loss). Conversely, cyclin A2 deficiency in murine models leads to increased DNA damage, dysplasia, and susceptibility to colon carcinogenesis, indicating its protective role in colon homeostasis (Guo2021Cyclin; Guo2019Loss). These findings underscore the tissue-specific role of cyclin A2 in tumor development and progression, with its expression patterns influencing cancer outcomes (Guo2021Cyclin).

## Interactions
Cyclin A2 (CCNA2) is a key regulatory protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to control cell cycle progression. It forms complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1 and CDK2, facilitating transitions through the G1/S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Li2021Tanshinone; Kanakkanthara2016Cyclin). Cyclin A2 also acts as an RNA-binding protein, specifically binding to Mre11 mRNA through its C-terminal RNA binding domain. This interaction is crucial for the translation of Mre11, a nuclease involved in DNA repair processes (Kanakkanthara2016Cyclin).

Cyclin A2 is involved in the regulation of the mitotic spindle by targeting the motor protein Eg5 to centrosomal microtubules, which is essential for proper centrosome movement and spindle formation (Kanakkanthara2016Cyclin). It also interacts with the RhoA-ROCK signaling pathway, influencing cell migration, particularly in the context of trophoblast migration (Li2019Downregulation).

In cancer, Cyclin A2 is part of the CCNA2-CDK2 complex, which is implicated in tumor progression and is a target for therapeutic agents like Tanshinone IIA in lung adenocarcinoma (Li2021Tanshinone). These interactions highlight Cyclin A2's multifaceted role in cell cycle regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.
