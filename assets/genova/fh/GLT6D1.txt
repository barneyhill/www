# GLT6D1

## Overview
GLT6D1 is a gene that encodes the protein glycosyltransferase 6 domain containing 1, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase 6 family. This protein is characterized as a single-pass transmembrane protein involved in glycosylation processes within the Golgi apparatus. Glycosylation is a vital cellular process that modifies proteins and lipids by adding sugar moieties, thereby influencing protein folding, stability, and cell signaling. The GLT6D1 gene is expressed in various tissues, including leukocytes, gingiva, and testis, with notable expression in gingival connective tissue. Although the precise function of the GLT6D1 protein in healthy human cells is not fully elucidated, its role in glycosylation suggests it may be involved in developmental signaling and immune responses. Genetic variations in GLT6D1, such as the SNP rs1537415, have been linked to an increased risk of periodontitis, particularly aggressive periodontitis, highlighting its potential clinical significance (RODRIGUES2022Analysis; Masumoto2018Identification; Schaefer2009A).

## Function
The GLT6D1 gene encodes a protein that is part of the glycosyltransferase 6 family, which are single-pass transmembrane proteins involved in glycosylation processes within the Golgi apparatus. Glycosylation is a critical cellular process where sugars are added to proteins or lipids, influencing protein folding, stability, and cell signaling. This modification is essential for the synthesis of histo-blood related antigens and impacts cellular communication and immune responses (RODRIGUES2022Analysis; Schaefer2009A).

GLT6D1 is expressed in various tissues, with strong expression observed in leukocytes, gingiva, and testis. Within the gingiva, its expression is notably higher in the connective tissue compared to the epithelium (RODRIGUES2022Analysis; Schaefer2009A). The gene's expression does not significantly differ between healthy and inflamed gingival tissues, suggesting a consistent role in these tissues regardless of inflammatory state (Schaefer2009A).

Although the specific function of GLT6D1 in healthy human cells remains uncharacterized, its involvement in glycosylation suggests a role in developmental signaling by regulating the activity of developmental genes and controlling their sensitivity to regulatory signals (Schaefer2009A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GLT6D1 gene have been associated with an increased susceptibility to periodontitis, particularly aggressive periodontitis (AgP). A genome-wide association study identified the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1537415 within intron 2 of the GLT6D1 gene as significantly associated with periodontitis. This SNP affects the binding affinity of the transcription factor GATA-3, which is involved in immune responses, potentially influencing the pathophysiology of periodontitis through regulatory mechanisms affecting cytokine expression (Masumoto2018Identification; Schaefer2009A).

The presence of the rs1537415 SNP has been linked to a higher risk of developing AgP, with studies showing an odds ratio of 1.59, indicating a significant genetic risk factor for the disease (Masumoto2018Identification). The association of this SNP with periodontitis was confirmed in multiple populations, including German and Dutch cohorts, highlighting its role as a genetic determinant in the disease's susceptibility (Schaefer2009A).

Despite the strong genetic association, no known disease-causing coding mutations in GLT6D1 have been identified, and the gene's expression does not significantly differ between healthy and inflamed gingival tissues, complicating the interpretation of its role in periodontitis (Vieira2014Role).
