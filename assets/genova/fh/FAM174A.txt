# FAM174A

## Overview
FAM174A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 174 member A. This protein is implicated in cholesterol regulation and is thought to play a role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis. The protein encoded by FAM174A is involved in the re-localization of proteins to alternative organelles in response to changes in cholesterol levels, suggesting its participation in lipid-regulatory pathways (Blattmann2013RNAi–Based). While the precise molecular mechanisms and pathways involving FAM174A are not fully understood, its influence on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels highlights its potential significance in cholesterol metabolism (Blattmann2013RNAi–Based). Additionally, FAM174A has been associated with metabolic conditions such as equine metabolic syndrome, indicating its broader relevance in metabolic regulation (StefaniukSzmukier2023Equine). Further research is necessary to elucidate the full spectrum of its biological functions and clinical implications.

## Function
FAM174A is implicated in cholesterol regulation within human cells. Studies using RNA interference (RNAi) have shown that the knockdown of FAM174A affects low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels, suggesting a role in cholesterol homeostasis (Blattmann2013RNAi–Based). The gene is associated with the re-localization of proteins to alternative organelles when cholesterol levels are reduced, a characteristic of key regulators of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Blattmann2013RNAi–Based). This indicates that FAM174A may participate in lipid-regulatory pathways, potentially influencing cholesterol levels through complex interactions with other cellular factors.

The exact molecular mechanisms and pathways involving FAM174A remain to be fully elucidated, but its involvement in cholesterol regulation highlights its potential significance in maintaining cellular lipid balance. The gene's activity in specific cellular compartments and its impact on LDL receptor expression underscore its role in cholesterol metabolism, which is crucial for maintaining cellular and organismal health (Blattmann2013RNAi–Based). Further research is needed to clarify the precise functions and interactions of FAM174A in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The FAM174A gene, also known as NS5ATP6 or TMEM157, has been implicated in various metabolic and disease processes. In equine studies, FAM174A has been associated with equine metabolic syndrome (EMS), particularly in relation to insulin resistance and lipid metabolism. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified specific genetic markers within the FAM174A gene region that are linked to elevated insulin levels and the risk of laminitis in horses, with markers such as BIEC2-263524 associated with increased triglycerides and cholesterol levels (StefaniukSzmukier2023Equine). However, the association between FAM174A and EMS appears to be breed-specific, with a stronger correlation observed in Arabian horses compared to Australian ponies (Cash2020Preliminary).

In humans, FAM174A has been studied for its potential role in cholesterol regulation. RNA interference studies have suggested that FAM174A may influence cholesterol homeostasis, as its knockdown was associated with altered low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor levels, indicating a possible role in lipid metabolism (Blattmann2013RNAi–Based). Despite these findings, the exact mechanisms by which FAM174A contributes to metabolic disorders or its clinical significance in humans remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify its role in disease processes and potential therapeutic implications.
