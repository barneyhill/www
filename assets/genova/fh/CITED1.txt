# CITED1

## Overview
CITED1 is a gene that encodes the protein Cbp/p300 interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp rich carboxy-terminal domain 1, which functions as a transcriptional coactivator. This protein is involved in modulating transcriptional activity by interacting with CBP/p300 and estrogen receptors (ERs) in an estrogen-dependent manner. CITED1 is characterized by its unique C-terminal domain, CR2, which is essential for its role as a transactivation domain. Unlike many nuclear receptor coactivators, CITED1 does not possess the canonical LXXLL motif, instead utilizing a distinct mechanism for binding to the ligand-binding domain of ERα. The protein is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, notably in mammary epithelial cells and during embryonic development, and plays a significant role in estrogen receptor-mediated transcription. CITED1's involvement in various signaling pathways, including Wnt signaling, underscores its importance in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions such as cancer (Yahata2001Selective; Rodriguez2004Cited1; Méniel2013Cited1).

## Structure
CITED1 is a transcriptional coactivator protein that interacts with CBP/p300 and estrogen receptors (ERs) in an estrogen-dependent manner. The protein contains a conserved C-terminal domain known as CR2, which is crucial for its function as a transactivation domain (Yahata2001Selective; Xu2018Transcription). Unlike many nuclear receptor coactivators, CITED1 lacks the canonical LXXLL motif, instead utilizing a unique mechanism involving the N-terminal sequence of its CR2 domain to bind the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ERα (Yahata2001Selective). This region is predicted to form a short α-helix, which may resemble the LXXLL helix in terms of space-filling structures (Yahata2001Selective).

CITED1 does not have a defined quaternary structure as it typically functions as a monomer. The protein's interaction with ERs is dependent on specific amino acids within the CR2 domain, and mutations in this region can disrupt its coactivating activity (Yahata2001Selective). CITED1 is also involved in the recruitment to specific gene promoters, such as TGF-α, in an estrogen-dependent manner, highlighting its role in gene-specific regulation (Yahata2001Selective). The protein is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, particularly in mammary epithelial cells and during embryonic development (Yahata2001Selective; Rodriguez2004Cited1).

## Function
CITED1 is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a significant role in estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transcription. It functions as a selective, agonist-dependent coactivator, enhancing estrogen-dependent transcription from synthetic promoters. CITED1 coactivates both ERα and ERβ with comparable efficiencies, and this activity is strictly dependent on the presence of an ER agonist, such as 17β-estradiol (Yahata2001Selective). The protein binds directly to the ligand-binding domain of ERα in an estrogen-dependent manner, suggesting it recognizes the active conformations of ERs induced by estrogen agonists (Yahata2001Selective).

CITED1 is coexpressed with ERα in the nucleus of mammary epithelial cells, where it enhances estrogen sensitivity and growth, particularly at low estrogen concentrations (Yahata2001Selective). It influences the expression of specific estrogen target genes, such as enhancing TGF-α mRNA expression while suppressing c-Myc mRNA expression, indicating a gene-specific action (Yahata2001Selective). The protein's interaction with ERs involves the CBP/p300 coactivators, as shown by the synergistic effect of p300 on ERα-LBD/AF2 coactivation by CITED1 (Yahata2001Selective). CITED1's function is modulated by its phosphorylation state, which affects its ability to enhance transcriptional activity (Shi2006The).

## Clinical Significance
CITED1 is implicated in several cancers due to its role in modulating oncogenic signaling pathways. In colorectal cancer, CITED1 is upregulated and plays a role in tumorigenesis by regulating the Wnt signaling pathway. Its deficiency in mouse models leads to increased survival and reduced tumor formation, suggesting that CITED1 may promote tumor growth by maintaining Wnt activity at levels conducive to adenoma formation (Méniel2013Cited1).

In hepatoblastoma, CITED1 is highly expressed in undifferentiated tumor elements and is associated with increased cell proliferation. It modulates Wnt signaling by upregulating inhibitors like KREMEN1 and CXXC4, which may influence the balance between differentiation and proliferation in tumor cells (Murphy2012CITED1).

CITED1 is also overexpressed in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), where it contributes to tumor progression by interacting with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Knockdown of CITED1 in PTC cell lines reduces cell proliferation and tumor growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2019&lt; p&gt; CITED1).

In Wilms tumor, CITED1 enhances tumorigenic responses when enriched in the nucleus, potentially by stabilizing β-catenin's oncogenic properties. This suggests a role in maintaining stemness and promoting tumor growth (Murphy2013CITED1).

## Interactions
CITED1 is a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in modulating transcriptional activity. It binds directly to the CBP/p300 coactivators, which are crucial for its transcriptional activating functions. This interaction is mediated through the CR2 domain of CITED1, and phosphorylation of CITED1 can inhibit its binding to p300, thereby affecting its ability to transactivate other proteins like Smad4 (Rodriguez2004Cited1; Shi2006The).

CITED1 also acts as a selective coactivator for estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated transcription. It binds directly to the ligand-binding domain of ERα in an estrogen-dependent manner, enhancing estrogen-dependent transcription. This interaction is crucial for the coactivation of ERα and ERβ, and it is dependent on the presence of an ER agonist (Yahata2001Selective).

In addition to its interactions with CBP/p300 and ERs, CITED1 interacts with the neuronal survival factor TOX3. This interaction involves the CR2 domain of CITED1 and is specific, as homologous proteins like CITED2 do not show the same interaction with TOX3 (Dittmer2011TOX3). These interactions highlight CITED1's role in various signaling pathways and its importance in transcriptional regulation.
