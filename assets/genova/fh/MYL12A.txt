# MYL12A

## Overview
MYL12A is a gene that encodes the myosin regulatory light chain 12A, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the function of non-muscle myosin II complexes. This protein is categorized as a regulatory light chain and is integral to cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and division by stabilizing myosin II and facilitating actin-myosin interactions. MYL12A is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, particularly within the cytoskeleton, where it co-localizes with actin stress fibers, contributing to cellular contractility and cytokinesis (Brito2020NonMuscle; Park2011Myosin). The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which is crucial for the assembly and dynamics of myosin II filaments, influencing cellular tension and structural stability (Watanabe2007Regulation). Additionally, MYL12A interacts with myosin heavy chains to form complexes essential for muscle contraction and cellular motility, and it has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases (Oya2021Phosphorylation; Hayashizaki2016Myosin).

## Function
MYL12A encodes the myosin regulatory light chain 12A, which is a crucial component of non-muscle myosin II complexes. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining cellular structure and function by stabilizing myosin II and facilitating actin-myosin interactions. MYL12A is involved in essential cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and division, contributing to the maintenance of cell shape and integrity (Park2011Myosin).

In healthy human cells, MYL12A is active in the cytoplasm, particularly within the cytoskeleton, where it co-localizes with actin stress fibers. This localization is crucial for its role in cellular contractility and cytokinesis (Brito2020NonMuscle; Park2011Myosin). The protein interacts with non-muscle myosin heavy chains, such as MYH9 and MYH10, to form actomyosin complexes that are vital for cellular dynamics and structural stability (Park2011Myosin).

MYL12A's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its activity and the assembly of myosin II filaments. This regulation is essential for the proper dynamics of myosin II, influencing processes like stress fiber formation and cellular tension (Watanabe2007Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the MYL12A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions. In the context of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), MYL12A functions as an oncogene. Its stability and expression are regulated by the deubiquitinating enzyme OTUD3, which enhances MYL12A's role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. Disruption of the OTUD3-MYL12A interaction, such as through the use of rupatadine, has been shown to decrease MYL12A expression and reduce tumor growth, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in DLBCL (Sui2024Rupatadineinhibited).

MYL12A is also involved in airway inflammation, where it acts as a functional ligand for CD69. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of CD69-expressing leukocytes into inflamed tissues, contributing to the pathogenesis of conditions like eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS). Blocking the MYL12A-CD69 interaction has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate lung inflammation, indicating its significance in chronic airway inflammatory disorders (Hayashizaki2016Myosin).

In cochlear hair cells, MYL12A is phosphorylated by myosin light chain kinase, which is essential for cellular shape changes and hearing function. Dysregulation of this process can lead to hearing loss, highlighting the importance of MYL12A in auditory health (Oya2021Phosphorylation).

## Interactions
MYL12A, or myosin light chain 12A, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is a regulatory protein that interacts with myosin heavy chains to form myosin II complexes, which are essential for actin-myosin interactions. This interaction is vital for muscle contraction and cellular motility (Oya2021Phosphorylation).

MYL12A is phosphorylated by smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase (smMLCK), a process that is crucial for cellular shape changes, particularly in cochlear hair cells. This phosphorylation modulates the interaction between actin and myosin II, which is necessary for cellular motility and development (Oya2021Phosphorylation). The phosphorylation of MYL12A by smMLCK is also important for the contraction of the actomyosin cable in hair cells, which is essential for cellular shape changes (Oya2021Phosphorylation).

In the context of airway inflammation, MYL12A, along with MYL9, acts as a functional ligand for CD69, a protein expressed on activated leukocytes. This interaction plays a role in regulating airway inflammation by facilitating the recruitment of CD69-expressing leukocytes into inflamed tissues (Hayashizaki2016Myosin). Blocking the interaction between MYL12A and CD69 has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases (Hayashizaki2016Myosin).
