# PPP1R12B

## Overview
The PPP1R12B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12B, also known as myosin phosphatase target subunit 2 (MYPT2). This protein is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a pivotal role in modulating myosin phosphatase activity. MYPT2 is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as the brain, where it is involved in critical physiological processes such as muscle contraction, cardiac torsion, and sarcomere organization (Grassie2011The; Pham2012Insulinstimulated). As a regulatory subunit, MYPT2 interacts with the catalytic subunit PP1cδ, enhancing its specificity and activity, which is essential for the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains and the regulation of smooth muscle contraction and cell motility (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein; Okamoto2006Characterization). Additionally, MYPT2 is involved in cellular processes such as focal adhesion dynamics and insulin signaling, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular function and signaling pathways (Fokkelman2016Cellular; Pham2012Insulinstimulated).

## Structure
The PPP1R12B gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), known as myosin phosphatase target subunit 2 (MYPT2). The protein structure includes several key domains that facilitate its function. It contains ankyrin repeats in the N-terminal region, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Casamayor2020Controlling). The C-terminal region features a leucine zipper domain, which is crucial for binding to the active form of RhoA and is a target for Rho kinase (Pham2012Insulinstimulated; Casamayor2020Controlling). 

MYPT2 is known to form a trimeric complex by binding to M20/21 and PP1Cb/d, enhancing phosphatase activity (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are significant for its regulatory functions. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation occurs at several sites, including Ser29, Ser504, and Ser645/Thr646, affecting the activity of the PPP1R12B-PP1cδ complex (Pham2012Insulinstimulated). 

The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with structural differences ranging from 1043 to 186 residues. The longest isoforms share both N-terminal and C-terminal domains, while others are truncated versions (Casamayor2020Controlling).

## Function
PPP1R12B, also known as myosin phosphatase target subunit 2 (MYPT2), is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a crucial role in modulating myosin phosphatase activity. This protein is predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle, as well as the brain, where it is involved in regulating muscle contraction, cardiac torsion, and sarcomere organization (Grassie2011The; Pham2012Insulinstimulated). PPP1R12B interacts with the catalytic subunit PP1cδ, modulating its specificity and activity, which is essential for the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, thereby influencing smooth muscle contraction and cell motility (Grassie2011The).

In cellular processes, PPP1R12B is involved in focal adhesion dynamics and cellular traction forces, which are critical for cell migration. Knockdown studies in MCF7 cells have shown that reduced expression of PPP1R12B leads to increased cellular forces and larger focal adhesions, indicating its role in maintaining a balance in actomyosin contractility and adhesion dynamics (Fokkelman2016Cellular). Additionally, PPP1R12B is implicated in insulin signaling, where insulin-stimulated phosphorylation at specific sites suggests a regulatory role in processes such as glycogen synthesis and glucose transport (Pham2012Insulinstimulated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP1R12B gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of substance use disorders (SUDs), PPP1R12B is involved in slow neurotransmission signaling, with its expression being altered in brain regions associated with motivation and reward. These changes are gender-dependent and have been linked to the etiology of SUDs, suggesting that PPP1R12B plays a role in the genetic network underlying these disorders (Liu2020Epistatic).

In cancer, PPP1R12B has been identified as a potential driver gene in invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILC). It is located on the frequently amplified 1q locus in human breast cancer. Alterations in PPP1R12B, such as increased expression due to copy-number gains, have been associated with the development of ILC. The gene is part of a novel oncogenic pathway that may contribute to the malignant transformation of mammary epithelial cells (Kas2017Insertional).

PPP1R12B has also been highlighted as a key gene in Wilms' tumor, where its high expression correlates with poor overall survival, indicating its potential role as an onco-driver in this type of cancer (He2021Identification). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PPP1R12B in various diseases.

## Interactions
PPP1R12B, also known as myosin phosphatase target subunit 2 (MYPT2), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its regulatory functions. It specifically interacts with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1cδ), forming a complex that plays a significant role in muscle contraction and cell motility (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein; Okamoto2006Characterization). This interaction enhances the phosphatase activity of PP1cδ, which is essential for dephosphorylating myosin light chains, thereby regulating smooth muscle contraction (Okamoto2006Characterization).

PPP1R12B also interacts with the active form of RhoA, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal dynamics. This interaction is significant as RhoA, when activated, can lead to the phosphorylation of PPP1R12B by Rho kinase, inhibiting the activity of the PPP1R12B-PP1cδ complex (Okamoto2006Characterization). This inhibition is a key regulatory mechanism in the modulation of myosin phosphatase activity, affecting muscle contraction and cellular signaling pathways.

Additionally, PPP1R12B is part of the MYPT family, which includes proteins that target PP1c to specific substrates, further influencing cellular processes such as glycogen metabolism and actin cytoskeleton regulation (Grassie2011The).
