# LGSN

## Overview
LGSN is a gene that encodes the protein lengsin, which is characterized by a glutamine synthetase domain. Lengsin is primarily recognized for its role in the lens of the eye, where it is involved in maintaining lens transparency and structure. However, recent studies have expanded its significance beyond ocular biology, particularly in the context of cancer. Lengsin is categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein due to its interaction with vimentin, a key player in cytoskeletal dynamics. This interaction is crucial in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the maintenance of stemness in gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs), implicating LGSN in cancer progression and treatment resistance (Li2023Targeting). The gene's expression is associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Li2023Targeting).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
LGSN (lengsin) has been implicated in the progression and treatment resistance of gastric cancer. Overexpression of LGSN in gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) is associated with poor prognosis and increased resistance to chemotherapy drugs such as 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. This resistance is partly due to LGSN's role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and maintaining cancer stem cell phenotypes, which enhance cell proliferation and migration (Li2023Targeting). High LGSN expression correlates with advanced tumor stages, poor differentiation, and metastasis, leading to decreased survival times in gastric cancer patients (Li2023Targeting).

LGSN interacts with vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein, to promote tumorigenicity and EMT in GCSCs. This interaction is crucial for maintaining stemness and facilitating tumor progression. LGSN knockdown has been shown to reduce the expression of stemness proteins and trigger pyroptotic cell death, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to restore chemotherapy sensitivity (Li2023Targeting). Importantly, targeting LGSN does not affect normal cells, indicating its safety as a therapeutic target (Li2023Targeting). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LGSN in gastric cancer, suggesting that its modulation could improve treatment outcomes by overcoming drug resistance and inducing cell death in cancer cells.

## Interactions
LGSN (lengsin) is known to interact with vimentin, a protein involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is significant in the context of gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs), where LGSN and vimentin colocalize in the cell cytoplasm. The direct binding of vimentin to LGSN has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays. Vimentin acts as a downstream molecule of LGSN in carcinogenesis, and its expression is upregulated in gastric tumor tissues alongside LGSN expression. This interaction plays a crucial role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and maintaining stemness in GCSCs. Vimentin phosphorylation at S56 is necessary for its response to LGSN, highlighting a specific regulatory mechanism (Li2023Targeting).

LGSN's interaction with vimentin also influences cell death pathways. LGSN upregulates vimentin to suppress pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, by overriding the NLRP3-dependent pyroptotic program. When LGSN is silenced, vimentin is depleted, leading to the activation of pyroptosis through the NLRP3/caspase1-P20/GSDMD-N pathway, which prevents self-renewal and tumorigenesis in GCSCs (Li2023Targeting). These interactions suggest that LGSN plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell death and survival in cancer cells.
