# OR4S2

## Overview
The OR4S2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily S member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. OR4S2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, such as cis-3-hexenol, and triggers neuronal responses. Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4S2 has been implicated in metabolic processes, with genetic variants associated with obesity, suggesting a broader influence on systemic metabolism and eating behavior (Matiashova2023The; Ieki2022Functional). Despite its potential involvement in these processes, the precise molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of OR4S2 remain areas of active research.

## Structure


## Function
OR4S2 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. In healthy human cells, OR4S2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Ieki2022Functional).

The functional expression of OR4S2 has been studied using various cell lines, including HEK293 and LNCaP cells. These studies have identified OR4S2 as responsive to the odorant cis-3-hexenol, highlighting its role in olfactory signaling (Ieki2022Functional). The receptor's activation leads to the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), a second messenger involved in the olfactory transduction cascade, which ultimately results in the perception of specific odors (Ieki2022Functional).

OR4S2 has also been linked to metabolic processes and obesity. Variants of this gene have been associated with obesity, suggesting a potential role in systemic metabolism and eating behavior (Matiashova2023The). However, the specific molecular mechanisms by which OR4S2 influences these processes in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The OR4S2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been studied in relation to various health conditions, although its specific clinical implications remain somewhat unclear. Research has indicated that deletions in the region covering OR4S2, along with other loci, have been associated with early-onset obesity. This association was highlighted in a genome-wide study that linked such deletions to obesity, suggesting a potential role for OR4S2 in metabolic processes (Phillips2021High; Shadravan2013Sex).

In the context of breast cancer, a study found that while deletions overlapping other olfactory receptor genes were associated with increased risk, deletions involving OR4S2 did not show a significant association with breast cancer risk after multiple testing. This suggests that OR4S2 may not play a major role in breast cancer susceptibility (Walker2017Increased).

The gene has also been implicated in studies exploring the genetic factors contributing to obesity, particularly in children. Variations in OR4S2 and other olfactory receptor genes may influence dietary behaviors and the body's response to food-related stimuli, potentially contributing to obesity (Phillips2021High). However, the clinical significance of OR4S2 mutations in relation to other diseases remains to be fully elucidated.
