# SCOC

## Overview
The SCOC gene encodes the short coiled-coil protein, which is integral to the regulation of autophagy, a critical cellular process for maintaining homeostasis through the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The protein is characterized by a short coiled-coil domain and a LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which facilitate its interactions with autophagy-related proteins and the kinesin adaptor protein FEZ1. These interactions are essential for the formation and regulation of autophagosomes, particularly under conditions of amino acid starvation. SCOC acts as a positive regulator of autophagy by modulating key signaling complexes, such as the ULK1 complex, and is involved in the dynamics of the trans-Golgi network and endoplasmic reticulum. The protein's function is further regulated by phosphorylation, which enhances its binding affinity and specificity. Dysregulation of SCOC has been associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Metje2024Structural; Joachim2012Coiling; Wirth2021Phosphorylation).

## Structure
The SCOC protein, encoded by the human SCOC gene, is characterized by a short coiled-coil domain that plays a significant role in its structural configuration and function. The primary structure of SCOC includes a LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif, which is crucial for its interaction with autophagy-related proteins such as GABARAP, GABARAPL1, LC3A, and LC3C (Wirth2021Phosphorylation). The secondary structure of SCOC involves coiled-coil regions, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins, such as the kinesin adaptor protein FEZ1, forming a heterotetrameric complex (Alborghetti2013Structural).

The tertiary structure of SCOC includes an unstructured region N-terminal to the coiled-coil domain, which contains the functional LIR motif (Wirth2021Phosphorylation). This motif is involved in canonical interactions with ATG8 proteins, stabilized by flanking residues and phosphorylation at specific serine/threonine sites, enhancing binding affinity and specificity (Wirth2021Phosphorylation).

SCOC exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with isoform 1 primarily localizing to the nucleus and mitotic spindle, while isoform 3 is found in both the nucleus and cytosol, partially colocalizing with the trans-Golgi network (Wirth2021Phosphorylation). Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification of SCOC, particularly at serine and threonine residues, which modulates its interaction with ATG8 proteins (Wirth2021Phosphorylation).

## Function
The SCOC (short coiled-coil protein) gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular process essential for degrading and recycling cellular components. SCOC is a Golgi-associated protein that is implicated in the formation of autophagosomes, which are critical structures in the autophagic pathway. It acts as a positive regulator of autophagy, particularly under conditions of amino acid starvation, by interacting with the protein FEZ1, which negatively regulates autophagy. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of key signaling complexes involved in autophagy, potentially allowing the activation of the ULK1 complex, a key initiator of autophagy (Joachim2012Coiling).

SCOC colocalizes with the trans-Golgi network protein TGOLN2/TGN46 and the autophagy protein ATG9A, suggesting its involvement at the site of autophagosome formation. The dynamics of SCOC's interaction with FEZ1, possibly regulated through phosphorylation by ULK1, are under investigation to better understand their role in the autophagic pathway (Joachim2012Coiling). SCOC's activity in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum highlights its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses, impacting cell survival and function.

## Clinical Significance
The SCOC gene is implicated in the regulation of autophagy, a process essential for cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of SCOC can lead to impaired autophagy, which is associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. SCOC acts as a positive regulator of autophagy, and its depletion has been shown to decrease LC3 lipidation and inhibit the degradation of SQSTM1/p62, a marker of autophagic flux. This suggests that alterations in SCOC expression or function could disrupt autophagic pathways, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Joachim2012Coiling).

SCOC interacts with FEZ1, a protein that negatively regulates autophagy. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of key signaling complexes involved in autophagy, such as the ULK1 and UVRAG-BECN1-PtdIns3K complexes. Disruption of these interactions due to mutations or altered expression of SCOC could impair autophagic processes, leading to cellular dysfunction and disease (Joachim2012Coiling).

While the specific clinical implications of SCOC mutations or altered expression levels in human diseases are not fully detailed, the gene's role in autophagy suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to the development and progression of conditions like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Joachim2012Coiling). Further research is needed to elucidate the precise clinical significance of SCOC in these diseases.

## Interactions
SCOC (short coiled-coil protein) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in the regulation of autophagy. SCOC interacts with fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1 (FEZ1) to form a complex that is conserved across species, including in Caenorhabditis elegans. This complex is involved in the induction and regulation of autophagy, particularly during starvation. SCOC binding to FEZ1 disassembles the FEZ1-ULK1 complex, releasing ULK1 to induce autophagy (Metje2024Structural; Joachim2012Coiling).

SCOC also forms a trimeric complex with FEZ1 and UVRAG, which dissociates upon starvation to activate the autophagy-promoting Vps34 kinase complex. This interaction highlights SCOC's role as a positive regulator of autophagy, as its depletion decreases LC3 lipidation, while overexpression increases it (Metje2024Structural).

The SCOC-FEZ1 complex involves the coiled coil domains of both proteins, with specific residues crucial for complex formation. The interaction is characterized by a parallel orientation of the SCOC and FEZ1 dimers (Metje2024Structural). These interactions underscore SCOC's significant role in autophagy regulation through its involvement in multiprotein complexes.
