# VN1R2

## Overview
The VN1R2 gene encodes the vomeronasal 1 receptor 2, a member of the vomeronasal type-1 receptor (VN1R) family, which is a subset of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of chemical signals, potentially including pheromones, although the exact role of VN1R2 in humans is not fully understood due to the vestigial nature of the human vomeronasal organ (Shirokova2007The). VN1R2 is expressed in various tissues such as the brain, adipocytes, and testis, and is thought to recognize specific volatile compounds, including long-chain aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols, through cAMP signaling pathways (precone2020pheromone; Shirokova2007The). Despite its molecular activity, the physiological significance of VN1R2 in humans remains a subject of ongoing research and debate (Shirokova2007The).

## Function
The VN1R2 gene encodes a protein that is part of the vomeronasal type-1 receptor (VN1R) family, which is involved in the detection of chemical signals, potentially including pheromones. In humans, VN1R2 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that may recognize linear aldehydes and alcohols as ligands, with an alcohol moiety necessary for its activity (precone2020pheromone). VN1R2 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, adipocytes, and testis (precone2020pheromone).

VN1R2 is involved in cAMP signaling pathways via Gαolf and Gαs proteins, similar to olfactory receptors (ORs) (Shirokova2007The). This signaling mechanism is crucial for the receptor's function in detecting specific volatile compounds, particularly long-chain aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols (Shirokova2007The). Despite these molecular activities, the biological significance of VN1R2 in humans remains unclear, as the human vomeronasal organ is considered vestigial, and the receptor's role in pheromone detection is debated (Shirokova2007The). The VN1R2 receptor's specific activation profiles suggest a specialized function in detecting certain volatiles, although its physiological role in humans is not well understood (Shirokova2007The).
