# GNMT

## Overview
Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is a gene that encodes the enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase, a key player in methyl group metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a methyltransferase and is primarily found in the liver, where it is the most abundant methyltransferase, but it is also present in other tissues such as the pancreas and prostate. GNMT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to glycine, producing sarcosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), thereby regulating the SAM/SAH ratio, which is crucial for cellular methylation potential (DebRoy2013A; Luka2006A). The enzyme's activity is modulated by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA methylation and gene expression (Wang2011GlycineN). GNMT also serves as a major hepatic folate-binding protein, influencing methionine metabolism and protecting cells from methionine toxicity (Wang2011GlycineN; Wang2011GNMT). Alterations in GNMT expression or function are linked to liver diseases and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing disease (Liao2010Deficiency; MartínezChantar2007Loss).

## Structure
Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is a tetrameric enzyme, with each monomer consisting of 292 amino acids. The enzyme's structure is organized into three domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1-36), the C-terminal domain (residues 37-175 and 243-292), and the S-domain (residues 176-242) (Pattanayek1998Crystal; Fu1996Crystal). The C-domain features a Rossmann fold, which is common among AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, and is involved in binding S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (Pattanayek1998Crystal). The S-domain is unique to GNMT and forms a molecular basket that encloses the active site, allowing the enzyme to bind AdoMet and other molecules like tetrahydrofolate (Fu1996Crystal).

The quaternary structure of GNMT is a tetramer, forming a flat square shape with a central channel. This tetrameric arrangement is crucial for its enzymatic function and is stabilized by hydrophilic interactions between subunits (Pattanayek1998Crystal; Fu1996Crystal). The N-terminal region of each subunit extends into the active site of an adjacent subunit, forming a U-shaped loop that plays a role in substrate binding and enzyme regulation (Fu1996Crystal). GNMT is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as disulfide bond formation, which can affect its activity (Ogawa1998Structure).

## Function
Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is a cytosolic enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating methyl group metabolism in human cells. It catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to glycine, producing sarcosine and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (DebRoy2013A; Luka2006A). This reaction is significant for maintaining the SAM/SAH ratio, which is an indicator of the cell's methylation potential (Luka2006A). GNMT is predominantly active in the liver, where it is the most abundant methyltransferase, and is also present in the exocrine pancreas and prostate (Luka2006A).

GNMT's activity is regulated by 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which inhibits its catalysis (DebRoy2013A). The enzyme is involved in controlling the availability of methyl groups, influencing DNA methylation and gene expression (Wang2011GlycineN). GNMT also acts as a major hepatic folate-binding protein, affecting folate-dependent reactions and methionine metabolism (Wang2011GNMT). Its expression enhances homocysteine transsulfuration and remethylation, particularly under conditions of high or adequate methionine, thereby protecting cells from methionine toxicity (Wang2011GlycineN). GNMT's role in these processes is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing liver damage and disease (Liao2010Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GNMT gene are associated with several liver diseases and cancer. GNMT deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, leads to hypermethioninemia and is linked to liver dysfunction and neurological complications. The R99H mutation in GNMT results in a structurally unstable and inactive protein, causing elevated plasma methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) levels, which can disturb the AdoMet/S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) ratio and lead to liver disease (Barić2016Glycine).

In GNMT knockout mice, the absence of GNMT leads to chronic hepatitis, glycogen storage disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mimicking human GNMT deficiencies. These mice exhibit elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, hypermethioninemia, and increased hepatic AdoMet levels, indicating GNMT's role in regulating one-carbon and glycogen metabolism (MartínezChantar2007Loss; Liu2007Glycine).

GNMT acts as a tumor suppressor, and its down-regulation is observed in various cancers, including HCC. Loss of GNMT leads to aberrant DNA and histone methylation, contributing to liver cancer development through altered signaling pathways such as Ras and JAK/STAT (MartínezChantar2007Loss; Wang2013A). GNMT's role in detoxification and DNA repair further underscores its significance in preventing carcinogenesis (DebRoy2013A).

## Interactions
Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. GNMT interacts with PREX2, a component of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and regulates its levels through ubiquitination. This interaction is mediated by HectH9, an E3 ligase that promotes PREX2 degradation. The GNMT-PREX2 interaction affects AKT signaling, as GNMT knockdown leads to increased PREX2 levels and AKT phosphorylation, enhancing cell growth and reducing apoptosis (Li2017Characterization).

GNMT also interacts with DEPTOR, a protein involved in the mTOR signaling pathway. This interaction does not involve direct binding to mTOR but affects the DEPTOR-mTOR interaction, influencing cell proliferation and response to rapamycin treatment (Yen2011Functional).

Additionally, GNMT interacts with Niemann-Pick type C2 (NPC2) protein, playing a role in cholesterol metabolism. This interaction occurs in the cytosol and enhances the stability of NPC2, contributing to cholesterol homeostasis (Liao2011Glycine).

GNMT's interactions with folate molecules, particularly 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, also affect its activity. The enzyme binds folate at specific sites, with native GNMT showing stronger interactions due to post-translational modifications (Luka2012Differences).
