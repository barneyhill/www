# KIAA1210

## Overview
KIAA1210 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within the male reproductive system. The KIAA1210 protein is characterized by domains such as the topoisomerase 2-associated protein PAT1 domain and a herpes simplex virus 1 large tegument protein UL36 hypothetical domain, suggesting its role in chromatin structure regulation and cell junction dynamics (Iwamori2017Identification). Predominantly expressed in the testis, epididymis, and seminal vesicle, the protein is implicated in spermatogenesis, interacting with topoisomerase TOP2B and other cell junction proteins (Vandenbrouck2020The; Iwamori2017Identification). Beyond its reproductive functions, KIAA1210 is also associated with tumor suppression, as evidenced by its downregulation in prostate cancer and hypermethylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (Lubecka2018Locispecific). Additionally, genetic variations in KIAA1210 have been linked to drug hypersensitivity, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Carr2017Genome-wide).

## Structure
KIAA1210 is a protein encoded by the KIAA1210 gene, located on the X chromosome. The protein is characterized by several domains, including a topoisomerase 2 (TOP2)-associated protein PAT1 domain and a herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) large tegument protein UL36 hypothetical domain (Iwamori2017Identification). It also contains a provisional DNA translocase FtsK domain, suggesting a role in chromatin structure regulation (Iwamori2017Identification). 

The protein has two hypothetical isoforms in mice and three in humans, with variations primarily around the N-terminus, while the C-terminus remains conserved (Iwamori2017Identification). Proteomic analysis has identified 801 proteins interacting with KIAA1210, including cell junction proteins from the dynein and myosin families, indicating its involvement in cell junctions and chromatin dynamics (Iwamori2017Identification). 

KIAA1210 is noted for its elevated expression in the testis, epididymis, and seminal vesicle, and is suggested to be an essential cell junction protein that interacts with topoisomerase TOP2B during spermiogenesis (Vandenbrouck2020The). The protein's role in chromatin structure dynamics is further supported by its co-localization with TOP2B in germ cell nuclei (Iwamori2017Identification).

## Function
KIAA1210 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the male reproductive system. The protein is predominantly expressed in the testis and localizes to the acrosome and ectoplasmic specialization (ES) in testes, which are crucial for spermatogenesis (Iwamori2017Identification). KIAA1210 interacts with topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) family members and is suggested to play a role in chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis, the final phase of sperm development (Vandenbrouck2020The). The protein is also associated with cell junctions, potentially influencing the structural integrity and function of these junctions during spermatogenesis (Iwamori2017Identification).

In addition to its role in the reproductive system, KIAA1210 is implicated in regulating dynamic changes in chromatin structures, which may be relevant to its function as a tumor suppressor. It has been found to be downregulated in prostate cancer, suggesting a role in tumor suppression (Lubecka2018Locispecific). The protein's involvement in cell growth, motility, adhesion, and regulation of gene transcription further underscores its importance in cellular processes (Lubecka2018Locispecific).

## Clinical Significance
KIAA1210 has been implicated in several clinical contexts due to alterations in its expression and methylation patterns. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KIAA1210 is hypermethylated, leading to its downregulation, which suggests a potential tumor suppressor role. This hypermethylation is observed in blood samples from HCC patients, indicating its potential as a biomarker for early detection of the disease (Lubecka2018Locispecific). The gene's altered methylation patterns are also associated with prostate cancer, where it is downregulated, further supporting its possible involvement in tumor suppression (Lubecka2018Locispecific).

In the context of drug hypersensitivity, a genome-wide association study identified a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in KIAA1210 and nevirapine hypersensitivity in an HIV-infected population, suggesting a genetic predisposition linked to this gene (Carr2017Genome-wide).

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of KIAA1210 in cancer and drug hypersensitivity, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and to explore its utility as a clinical biomarker or therapeutic target.

## Interactions
KIAA1210 is a protein encoded by a gene located on the X chromosome and is predominantly expressed in the testis. It has been identified as a component of multiprotein complexes involved in spermatogenesis. Proteomic analyses have revealed that KIAA1210 interacts with a variety of proteins, including cell junction proteins such as dynein, myosin, and tight junction proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2. These interactions suggest a role in the structural organization of the acrosome and ectoplasmic specialization (ES) in testes (Iwamori2017Identification).

KIAA1210 also interacts with topoisomerase II beta (TOP2B), a protein expressed in germ cell nuclei. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunofluorescence studies, which show co-localization of KIAA1210 and TOP2B near the acrosome and in the middle piece of the sperm tail. This suggests that KIAA1210 may play a role in chromatin structure regulation during spermiogenesis (Iwamori2017Identification; Vandenbrouck2020The).

The protein contains several domains, including a topoisomerase 2-associated protein PAT1 domain, which may facilitate its interaction with TOP2 isoforms, further implicating KIAA1210 in the formation and function of cell junctions in the testis (Iwamori2017Identification).
