# CEACAM16

## Overview
CEACAM16 is a gene that encodes the CEA cell adhesion molecule 16, a secreted glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the auditory system. This protein is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule family and is primarily expressed in the tectorial membrane of the inner ear. The protein is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains, which facilitate interactions with other tectorial membrane components, such as TECTA and TECTB, contributing to the structural integrity and mechanical properties essential for hearing (Booth2018Old; Cheatham2014Loss). Mutations in the CEACAM16 gene have been linked to various forms of hereditary hearing loss, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal auditory function (Booth2018Old; Goodyear2019Accelerated).

## Structure
The CEACAM16 protein is a secreted glycoprotein composed of 425 amino acids and is part of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule family. It is primarily expressed in the tectorial membrane (TM) of the inner ear, where it plays a crucial role in auditory function (Booth2018Old; Cheatham2014Loss). The protein structure includes two Ig-like V-type domains flanking two Ig-like C2-type domains, and it lacks a transmembrane domain or anchor (Booth2018Old). The Ig-like domains suggest a potential role in cross-linking other TM proteins, such as TECTA and TECTB, contributing to the structural integrity of the TM (Cheatham2014Loss).

CEACAM16 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may affect its stability and function (Cheatham2014Loss). The protein is secreted by nonsensory cells in the organ of Corti and is incorporated into the TM matrix (Cheatham2014Loss). Variants in the CEACAM16 gene can lead to splicing alterations, affecting the mRNA reading frame and protein structure, which are associated with hearing loss (Booth2018Old). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for maintaining the TM's long-term stability and normal cochlear function (Cheatham2014Loss).

## Function
CEACAM16 is a protein that plays a critical role in the auditory system, specifically within the tectorial membrane of the inner ear. This membrane is an essential component of the cochlea, where it covers the hair bundles of sensory receptor cells in the organ of Corti. CEACAM16 contributes to the structural integrity and mechanical properties of the tectorial membrane, which are vital for the conversion of sound waves into mechanical stimulation, a process crucial for hearing (Wang2015Exome).

The protein encoded by the CEACAM16 gene is a secreted glycoprotein, characterized by an immunoglobulin (Ig) variable-like N domain at its NH2-terminus, followed by Ig constant-like domains, and another Ig variable-like N domain at its COOH-terminal. It lacks a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor or transmembrane domain, distinguishing it from other CEACAM family members (Wang2015Exome). CEACAM16 is highly expressed at the tips of cochlear outer hair cells, indicating its significant role in maintaining normal auditory function (Wang2015Exome).

Mutations in CEACAM16 have been associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, highlighting its importance in auditory health (Booth2018Old). The protein's interaction with other components of the tectorial membrane, such as TECTA and TECTB, suggests its involvement in stabilizing and organizing the protein network within this structure (Booth2018Old).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEACAM16 gene are associated with various forms of hereditary deafness. Both dominant and recessive mutations in CEACAM16 can lead to postlingual and progressive forms of hearing loss. Dominant missense mutations, classified as DFNA4B, and recessive loss-of-function mutations, classified as DFNB113, have been identified as causes of deafness in humans (Goodyear2019Accelerated). These mutations typically result in post-lingual hearing impairment that begins around the age of 10 and progresses over time (Goodyear2019Accelerated).

In particular, two homozygous splice-altering variants, c.37G>T and c.662-1G>C, have been linked to recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment in Iranian families. These variants lead to exon skipping and cryptic splice site activation, respectively, resulting in a loss of function of the CEACAM16 protein (Booth page 16 of 27). The absence of CEACAM16 accelerates the degradation of the tectorial membrane in the cochlea, which is crucial for normal hearing, leading to hearing loss (Goodyear2019Accelerated).

A novel de novo mutation, c.1094T>G, has also been associated with postlingual hearing impairment, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining auditory function (Hofrichter2015A). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CEACAM16 in auditory health.

## Interactions
CEACAM16 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of the tectorial membrane (TM) in the inner ear. It interacts primarily with two other proteins, TECTA and TECTB, which are essential for the formation of the striated-sheet matrix and Hensen's stripe within the TM. These interactions are significant for maintaining the TM's structure, which is vital for normal hearing function (Hofrichter2015A; Booth2018Old).

The CEACAM16 protein is involved in homophilic interactions and dimer formation, supporting cell adhesion. These interactions occur in both cis and trans configurations, forming disulfide bridges by aligning in parallel. Such interactions are crucial for the crosslinking of TECTB and TECTA with CEACAM16, which is necessary for the proper organization of the TM (Hofrichter2015A).

Mutations in CEACAM16, such as the c.1094T>G mutation, can disrupt these interactions, leading to an immature striated-sheet matrix and progressive hearing loss. This highlights the importance of CEACAM16's interactions with TECTA and TECTB in maintaining auditory function (Hofrichter2015A).
