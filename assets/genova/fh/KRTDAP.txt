# KRTDAP

## Overview
KRTDAP, or keratinocyte differentiation-associated protein, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a crucial role in the differentiation and maturation of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. The protein is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, particularly in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis, and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the skin barrier (Tsuchida2004Characterization). KRTDAP is secreted by keratinocytes and is found in lamellar granules and the intercellular space of the stratum corneum, suggesting its involvement in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (Tsuchida2004Characterization). It shares functional similarities with epidermal proteinase inhibitors and plays a role in regulating epidermal renewal and protecting against tissue damage (Tsuchida2004Characterization). Additionally, KRTDAP has been identified as a significant biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, particularly in HPV-negative cases, where its expression is notably decreased (Su2021PSMC2).

## Function
KRTDAP, or keratinocyte differentiation-associated protein, plays a significant role in the differentiation of keratinocytes, which are the primary cell type in the epidermis. This protein is involved in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and is expressed predominantly in epithelial tissues, particularly in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis (Tsuchida2004Characterization). KRTDAP is secreted by keratinocytes and is found in lamellar granules and the intercellular space of the stratum corneum, suggesting its involvement in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the epidermis (Tsuchida2004Characterization).

KRTDAP undergoes post-translational modifications, which may involve polymerization or cross-linking to structural proteins, indicating its role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (Tsuchida2004Characterization). It shares similarities with epidermal proteinase inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit the activity of cysteine proteinases, although its inhibitory activity is lower compared to other epidermal inhibitors (Tsuchida2004Characterization). This suggests that KRTDAP may contribute to regulating epidermal renewal and protecting against tissue damage. The protein is also implicated in the structural and functional maturation of keratinocytes, playing a role in skin barrier formation and maintenance (Finnegan2019Single-Cell).

## Clinical Significance
KRTDAP (keratinocyte differentiation associated protein) has been identified as a significant biomarker in the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly in HPV-negative cases. In HPV-negative HNSCC, KRTDAP expression is significantly decreased compared to both adjacent tissues and HPV-positive HNSCC tissues, suggesting its potential role in the aggressiveness of the disease (Su2021PSMC2). This downregulation, along with the upregulation of other genes like PSMC2 and ORC5, may contribute to the distinct clinical characteristics of HPV-negative HNSCC, which is known to be more aggressive and resistant to treatment compared to HPV-positive cases (Su2021PSMC2).

The study by Su et al. utilized gene expression profiles and identified KRTDAP as a hub gene within a specific co-expression module that is negatively correlated with tumor stage and grade in HPV-negative HNSCC (Su2021PSMC2). Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the decreased expression of KRTDAP in HPV-negative HNSCC tissues, reinforcing its diagnostic value in distinguishing between HPV-negative and HPV-positive cases (Su2021PSMC2). While the study highlights the importance of KRTDAP in HNSCC, it does not provide information on other diseases or conditions associated with KRTDAP gene mutations or expression alterations beyond its role in HNSCC (Su2021PSMC2).
