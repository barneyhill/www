# NAV2

## Overview
The NAV2 gene encodes the neuron navigator 2 protein, a cytoskeletal-associated protein that plays a pivotal role in neuronal development and axonal guidance. This protein is characterized by its large size, consisting of 2429 amino acids, and includes several functional domains such as a calponin-homology domain and an ATP/GTP nucleotide-binding site, which facilitate its interactions with microtubules and neurofilament proteins (Muley2008The; Maes2002Neuron). Neuron navigator 2 is primarily involved in neurite outgrowth and axonal elongation, processes essential for the proper development of the central nervous system (Muley2008The). The protein's activity is regulated by all-trans retinoic acid and is implicated in various signaling pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, highlighting its broader role in cellular signaling and inflammation (Wang2021NAV2; Powers2023The). Mutations in the NAV2 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Accogli2022Loss; Tan2015Neuron).

## Structure
The NAV2 protein, encoded by the NAV2 gene, is a large protein with a molecular weight of approximately 261 kDa and consists of 2429 amino acids (Muley2008The). Its primary structure includes several functional domains: a calponin-homology (CH) domain at the N-terminus, multiple coiled-coil regions, and an ATP/GTP nucleotide-binding site (AAA domain) at the C-terminus (Muley2008The; Accogli2022Loss; Maes2002Neuron). The AAA domain is part of the McrB family, suggesting a role in cellular morphogenesis (Powers2023The).

NAV2 is characterized by its interaction with the cytoskeleton, particularly microtubules and neurofilament proteins, and is involved in neurite outgrowth and axonal elongation (Muley2008The). The protein's structure allows it to facilitate interactions between microtubules and other proteins, crucial for the formation and stability of growing neurites (Accogli2022Loss). NAV2 also contains SxIP motifs, which mediate localization to microtubule plus-end binding proteins (Powers2023The).

NAV2 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may alter regions outside the major conserved domains, affecting low complexity sequences and intrinsically disordered regions (Powers2023The).

## Function
The NAV2 gene encodes the Neuron Navigator 2 protein, which plays a critical role in neuronal development and axonal guidance. In healthy human cells, NAV2 is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in neurite outgrowth and axon elongation. It interacts with cytoskeletal components such as microtubules and neurofilaments, facilitating the reorganization necessary for neurite extension (Muley2008The; Marzinke20131433ε). NAV2 is expressed in the central nervous system and is crucial for processes like neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth, which are essential for proper brain and cerebellar development (Accogli2022Loss).

NAV2's function is regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), which induces its expression in neuroblastoma cells, promoting neurite outgrowth (Muley2008The; Powers2023The). The protein contains several functional domains, including a calponin-homology domain and an ATP/GTP nucleotide-binding site, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and cellular activities (Marzinke20131433ε). NAV2's activity is primarily cytoplasmic, where it supports the integrity of neuronal circuits and contributes to the development of brain structures, including cranial nerves and the cerebellum (Accogli2022Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NAV2 gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. Biallelic variants in NAV2 are associated with significant neurodevelopmental issues, including developmental delay, cerebellar hypoplasia, and dysplasia. Affected individuals may exhibit microcephaly, motor and language delays, and complex brain malformations, such as hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis (Accogli2022Loss). These mutations lead to reduced NAV2 protein and mRNA levels, impairing cell migration and cytoskeleton organization, which are crucial for proper brain and cerebellar development (Accogli2022Loss).

In addition to its role in neurodevelopmental disorders, NAV2 overexpression has been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC). High levels of NAV2 expression correlate with poor prognosis, increased tumor invasion, and metastasis. NAV2 influences cancer cell migration and invasion through the SSH1L/cofilin-1 pathway, making it a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in CRC (Tan2015Neuron). Furthermore, NAV2 expression is elevated in rheumatoid arthritis, where it contributes to inflammation and disease progression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in inflammatory conditions (Wang2022STAT3NAV2).

## Interactions
NAV2, also known as neuron navigator 2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neuronal development and axonal guidance. NAV2 interacts with microtubules and neurofilament proteins, which are essential for its function in neurite outgrowth and axonal elongation. This interaction is facilitated by a specific region within NAV2 known as the cytoskeletal interacting domain (CSID) (Muley2008The).

NAV2 also interacts with 14-3-3ε, a protein involved in neuronal migration and brain development. This interaction occurs primarily through the N-terminal region of NAV2, specifically amino acids 761-960, and is significant for promoting neurite outgrowth and axon elongation. The interaction has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Marzinke20131433ε).

In addition to its interactions with cytoskeletal proteins, NAV2 is implicated in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where it modulates inflammatory responses in fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis. This suggests a broader role for NAV2 in cellular signaling beyond its structural interactions (Wang2021NAV2). These interactions highlight NAV2's multifaceted role in cellular processes related to neuronal development and inflammation.
