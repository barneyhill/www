# KIAA0408

## Overview
KIAA0408 is a human gene that encodes the KIAA0408 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific biological functions remain largely uncharacterized. The protein is implicated in several protein-protein interactions, including those with TU3A, USP2, and NR3C1, suggesting a role in complex cellular networks (Li2009Local). KIAA0408 has been associated with significant pathways such as the MAPK signaling pathway and GPCR signaling, which are crucial in cellular communication and cancer progression (Wang2020Predicting). Clinically, KIAA0408 is noted for its potential as a prognostic marker in lung squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression is downregulated, indicating a possible role in tumor biology (Wang2020Predicting). Additionally, KIAA0408 has been identified in genetic studies related to intellectual disability and metabolic traits, although its direct involvement in these conditions is not fully established (Mackenroth20156q22.33; Wang2022Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
KIAA0408 has been identified as a potential prognostic marker for lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). The gene is part of a network involving MYBPH, UBC, TLE1, and EN1, which suggests its involvement in protein-protein interaction networks related to LUSC. The expression of KIAA0408 is downregulated in LUSC tissues, and it is one of the seven genes that can distinguish between high-risk and low-risk patients in LUSC (Wang2020Predicting). The study by Wang et al. highlights the association of KIAA0408 with pathways such as GPCR signaling, which is implicated in cancer growth and progression (Wang2020Predicting).

In a separate study, KIAA0408 was included in a 6q22.33 microdeletion observed in a family with intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly, and behavioral abnormalities. However, the study did not specifically associate KIAA0408 with these phenotypes, and no specific function or disease association was provided for this gene in the context of the microdeletion (Mackenroth20156q22.33).

Additionally, KIAA0408 was identified in a meta-analysis of gene-environment interactions related to waist-hip ratio, but the gene-environment interaction test did not reach significance, possibly due to limited sample size (Wang2022Genomic).

## Interactions
KIAA0408 is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are significant for functional inference in human protein interaction networks. Notably, KIAA0408 interacts with TU3A and USP2, as identified in a study that uses local network topology to predict functional associations. These interactions are part of a dataset aimed at understanding the functional relationships between proteins, which can help infer the roles of less well-characterized proteins like KIAA0408 (Li2009Local).

Additionally, KIAA0408 is associated with the NR3C1 protein, as mentioned in a list of significant protein pairs involved in various pathways, including the MAPK signaling pathway. However, specific details about the nature of the interaction between KIAA0408 and NR3C1 are not elaborated in the available data (Li2009Local).

In the context of disease, KIAA0408 has been identified as one of the differentially expressed genes in prostate cancer, where it is downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This suggests a potential role in cancer biology, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Wu2020Identification).
