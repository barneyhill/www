# ZNF627

## Overview
ZNF627 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 627, which is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in regulating gene expression. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are structural domains that facilitate binding to DNA. ZNF627 is involved in various cellular processes, including maintaining the undifferentiated state of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) and interacting with epigenetic modifiers such as TRIM28. The gene is located on chromosome 19 and has been associated with several clinical conditions, including myocardial infarction and ovarian carcinomas, through its genetic variations and expression patterns (Smebye2014Chromosome; Neff2012Global).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF627 has been implicated in several diseases, primarily through its association with myocardial infarction (MI) and ovarian carcinomas. Studies have identified a significant association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3' UTR of the ZNF627 gene and an increased risk of MI. Carriers of one or two risk alleles of this SNP are at a higher risk of developing MI, with consistent odds ratios across multiple studies (Yamada2007Genetic; Shiffman2005Identification). In a Japanese population, the G allele of ZNF627 was specifically associated with MI, highlighting its potential clinical significance in genetic predisposition to this condition (Yamada2007Genetic).

In ovarian carcinomas, ZNF627 is part of a cluster of zinc finger genes on chromosome 19 that show DNA copy number gains and increased gene expression. This suggests a role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer, as these genetic alterations may lead to the upregulation of oncogenes or the loss of tumor suppressor genes (Smebye2014Chromosome). The overrepresentation of zinc finger genes, including ZNF627, in regions of DNA gain indicates their potential involvement in cancer development (Smebye2014Chromosome).

## Interactions
ZNF627, a zinc finger protein, is involved in various interactions that influence its function as a transcription factor. In induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), ZNF627 mRNA is notably stable, which suggests a role in maintaining the undifferentiated state of these cells. This stability is partly due to the reduced abundance of microRNAs such as miR-199 and miR-23, which typically destabilize ZNF mRNAs, including ZNF627 (Neff2012Global).

ZNF627 is also associated with the TRIM28 protein, a key epigenetic modifier. In leukemic K562 cells, TRIM28 interacts with various KRAB-ZNF proteins, including ZNF627. However, specific details about the interaction between TRIM28 and ZNF627 are not extensively detailed in the available studies. The TRIM28-K304Q mutation, which mimics acetylation, alters TRIM28's interaction with KRAB-ZNFs, affecting gene expression, but the specific impact on ZNF627 is not explicitly described (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

ZNF627 mRNA exhibits unique polyadenylation and nuclear retention characteristics, which may influence its interactions at the RNA level. These mRNAs can persist with short or no poly(A) tails, leading to nuclear retention, which is unusual and suggests a regulatory mechanism that may involve interactions with nuclear retention factors (Russo2018Sequences).
