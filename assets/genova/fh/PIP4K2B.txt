# PIP4K2B

## Overview
PIP4K2B is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 beta, a member of the kinase family involved in phosphoinositide metabolism. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI5P) to produce phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which is crucial for various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics (Raghu2021Emerging). PIP4K2B is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences growth, survival, and stress responses. In the nucleus, it regulates nuclear PI5P levels, affecting stress signaling pathways and chromatin structure (Jones2006Nuclear). The enzyme's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins, such as PIP4Kα and UHRF1, which impact its function and cellular localization (Bultsma2010PIP4Kβ; Poli2022PIP4K2B). Alterations in PIP4K2B expression and function have been linked to diseases such as cancer and systemic sclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Poli2023PIP4K2B; GeroldingerSimić2023Autoantibodies).

## Structure
The PIP4K2B gene encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 beta, which is involved in phosphoinositide metabolism. The primary structure of PIP4K2B consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional properties. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function (Poli2023PIP4K2B). The tertiary structure of PIP4K2B results in a compact, functional enzyme capable of interacting with its substrates and other cellular components (Clarke2013Evolutionarily).

PIP4K2B is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions within the cell (Poli2023PIP4K2B). The enzyme may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can lead to variations in its functional properties and cellular localization (Clarke2013Evolutionarily). These structural features and modifications are crucial for the enzyme's role in cellular processes, including its involvement in mechanotransduction and chromatin remodeling (Poli2023PIP4K2B). The quaternary structure of PIP4K2B, while less defined, may involve interactions with other proteins or isoforms, potentially forming dimers or higher-order complexes (Clarke2013Evolutionarily).

## Function
PIP4K2B encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide metabolism by phosphorylating phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PI5P) to generate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). This enzymatic activity is significant for cellular signaling, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal dynamics. PIP4K2B is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes such as growth, survival, and stress responses (Raghu2021Emerging).

In the nucleus, PIP4K2B regulates nuclear PI5P levels, which are important for stress signaling pathways. It is involved in the modulation of nuclear PtdIns5P levels, affecting the localization and function of proteins like ING2, which is linked to p53 acetylation and chromatin structure regulation (Jones2006Nuclear). PIP4K2B's activity is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Ser326 via the p38 pathway, which is crucial for cellular stress responses (Jones2006Nuclear).

PIP4K2B also plays a role in insulin signaling. It suppresses insulin signaling through a non-catalytic mechanism by inhibiting PIP5Ks, which are responsible for PI(4,5)P2 production. This function is significant for maintaining insulin sensitivity and metabolic regulation (Wang2018PIP4Ks).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the PIP4K2B gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In cancer, PIP4K2B is associated with poor prognosis, as its expression is linked to changes in nuclear mechanics and chromatin organization, which affect cell motility and spreading. Targeting PIP4K2B could be a potential therapeutic approach for YAP-addicted cancer types, as its depletion leads to UHRF1 degradation and impacts YAP signaling, which is crucial for cancer cell growth and motility (Poli2023PIP4K2B).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), PIP4K2B is regulated by NSD1 and plays a role in promoting cell growth through the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Its depletion results in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in HNSCC (Topchu2024PIP4K2B).

In systemic sclerosis, autoantibodies against PIP4K2B have been identified as potential markers for skin and lung fibrosis. These autoantibodies are significantly more prevalent in SSc patients, indicating their potential role in the diagnosis and subclassification of the disease (GeroldingerSimić2023Autoantibodies).

## Interactions
PIP4K2B, also known as phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2 beta, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and cellular localization. It interacts with PIP4Kα to form heterodimers or trimeric complexes, which modulate the activity and nuclear localization of PIP4Kα. Despite PIP4K2B having significantly lower activity than PIP4Kα, it can influence PIP4Kα's function through these interactions (Bultsma2010PIP4Kβ).

PIP4K2B also interacts with the chromatin remodeler UHRF1, playing a role in nuclear mechanics and chromatin organization. This interaction affects YAP signaling and cell motility, with PIP4K2B depletion leading to UHRF1 degradation and subsequent changes in chromatin remodeling and YAP localization (Poli2022PIP4K2B).

Additionally, PIP4K2B is identified as a polyphosphate-binding protein, suggesting its involvement in the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway. This interaction was noted in a human proteome microarray screen, although further confirmation was limited by technical challenges (Krenzlin2021Proteome). These interactions highlight PIP4K2B's role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and chromatin dynamics.
