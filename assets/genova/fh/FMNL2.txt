# FMNL2

## Overview
FMNL2 is a gene that encodes the protein formin-like 2, which is a member of the diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a crucial role in actin nucleation and polymerization. Formin-like 2 is characterized by its structural domains, including the GTPase-binding domain, Diaphanous inhibitory domain, and formin homology domains, which facilitate its interaction with actin and other cellular components. The protein is widely expressed in various human tissues and is essential for cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, motility, and division. It interacts with Rho-GTPases, particularly Cdc42, to regulate actin dynamics and is involved in the formation of cellular protrusions like filopodia and lamellipodia. FMNL2's activity is modulated by upstream signals, and it plays a significant role in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, including cancer metastasis and neurodegenerative diseases (Block2012FMNL2; Gardberg2010Characterization; Trefzer2021Characterization).

## Structure
FMNL2, a member of the formin family, is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function in actin polymerization. The protein contains a GTPase-binding domain (GBD), a Diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID), a dimerization domain (DD), and formin homology 1 and 2 domains (FH1 and FH2) (Block2012FMNL2; Gardberg2010Characterization). The FH1 domain is proline-rich and interacts with profilin-actin complexes, while the FH2 domain forms an anti-parallel, torus-shaped dimer that associates with the barbed end of actin filaments, facilitating elongation (Kühn2015The).

The secondary structure of FMNL2 includes a coiled coil domain that follows the armadillo repeats of the FH3 domain, forming a symmetrical homodimer. This coiled coil region is interrupted by stammer and stutter elements, providing flexibility (Kühn2015The). The FH3 domain is composed of 14 canonical helices forming five armadillo repeats, creating a concave surface (Kühn2015The).

FMNL2 undergoes cotranslational modification by myristoylation, which is crucial for its membrane association and function (Block2012FMNL2; Kühn2015The). The protein exists in at least two splice isoforms, FMNL2A and FMNL2B, which differ at their C-terminal ends (Block2012FMNL2). These structural features and modifications are essential for FMNL2's role in actin-based cellular processes.

## Function
FMNL2 (formin-like 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as cell shape, motility, and division. It is a member of the diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) and acts as an actin nucleation and assembly factor, facilitating the polymerization of actin filaments. This activity is essential for the formation of cellular protrusions like filopodia and lamellipodia, which are involved in cell movement and signaling (Gardberg2010Characterization; Trefzer2021Characterization).

FMNL2 is widely expressed in human tissues, with notable expression in the central and peripheral nervous systems, gastrointestinal tract, and lymphatic system. It is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and associated with the plasma membrane, where it interacts with Rho-GTPases to regulate actin dynamics (Gardberg2010Characterization; Trefzer2021Characterization). The protein's activity is regulated by upstream signals, including interactions with Rho family GTPases, which activate FMNL2 by relieving its autoinhibited state (Gardberg2010Characterization; Trefzer2021Characterization).

In healthy cells, FMNL2 is involved in the formation of actin-rich structures such as filopodia and podosomes, contributing to processes like cell spreading, migration, and the maintenance of cell shape (Trefzer2021Characterization). Its role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling is critical for various cellular functions, including the initiation of epithelial cell-cell contacts and the turnover of β-Integrins, which are important for invasive cell migration (Trefzer2021Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FMNL2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In colorectal cancer (CRC), FMNL2 acts as a positive regulator of metastasis. Its expression is correlated with increased tumor growth and invasion, primarily through its interaction with cortactin, which is crucial for invadopodia formation and tumor cell invasion (Ren2018Cortactin). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), FMNL2 is associated with cerebrovascular pathology and interacts with cardiovascular risk factors to modify AD risk. Elevated FMNL2 levels are observed in response to amyloid pathology, particularly around blood vessels, and are linked to reactive astroglia (Lee2022FMNL2).

In Crohn's disease, a specific mutation in FMNL2 (p.Leu136Pro) affects the interaction between its domains, leading to increased activity and changes in actin dynamics, which may contribute to the disease (Trefzer2021Characterization). FMNL2 is also implicated in ischemic stroke, with variants identified in a genome-wide association study related to early-onset stroke (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). These findings suggest that FMNL2 plays a significant role in various pathological conditions through its influence on cellular processes and interactions.

## Interactions
FMNL2 interacts specifically with the Rho-GTPase Cdc42, binding to it when Cdc42 is associated with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GppNHp, but not when GDP-loaded. This interaction is specific to Cdc42, as FMNL2 does not bind with other related GTPases such as Rac1 or RhoA (Block2012FMNL2). FMNL2 is a downstream effector of Cdc42, targeting the tips of lamellipodia, a process not influenced by Rac1 or RhoA (Block2012FMNL2). The interaction with Cdc42 is crucial for FMNL2's function in actin dynamics (Block2012FMNL2).

FMNL2 also interacts with α-catenin during Rac1-induced adherens junction assembly, cortactin to enhance invadopodia formation, and RhoC to regulate amoeboid invasive cell motility (Fox2024Identification). It binds with the I-BAR protein BAIAP2L1 (IRTKS), necessary for filopodia assembly in melanoma cells (Fox2024Identification). FMNL2 is involved in cell-cell junction assembly, interacting with proteins such as MLLT4, CTNNB1, and PVRL2 (Fox2024Identification). It also plays a role in vesicle trafficking and membrane fusion, interacting with SNAP23, SNAP29, and synaptobrevins (VAMP2, VAMP3, YKT6) (Fox2024Identification). FMNL2 is associated with exosome release and is enriched in melanoma cell exosomes (Fox2024Identification).
