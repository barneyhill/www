# PLPP7

## Overview
PLPP7 is a gene that encodes the protein phospholipid phosphatase 7 (inactive), which is a muscle-specific nuclear envelope transmembrane protein. Despite its designation as a phosphatase, the protein lacks detectable enzymatic activity. Instead, it plays a significant role in gene regulation and muscle differentiation by relocating genes to the nuclear periphery, thereby silencing them. This function is crucial for the differentiation of myocytes, as it downregulates genes that inhibit myotube formation. PLPP7 is also involved in the regulation of the mTOR pathway, influencing the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) during myoblast differentiation, which is essential for muscle cell growth and regeneration. Alterations in the expression or mutations of the PLPP7 gene have been linked to several muscular dystrophies, including Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy type 1, and Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle-related diseases (Vogel2021Histopathology; RamirezMartinez2021The; Schätzl2024Metaanalysis).

## Function
PLPP7, also known as phospholipid phosphatase 7, is a muscle-specific nuclear envelope transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in gene regulation and muscle differentiation. Although it lacks detectable enzymatic activity, PLPP7 is involved in relocating genes to the nuclear periphery, effectively silencing them. This gene repositioning is essential for myocyte differentiation, as it downregulates genes that inhibit myotube formation, a process vital for the specialization of multinucleated myocytes (Vogel2021Histopathology). In the absence of PLPP7, there is a de-repression of these genes, leading to the production of proteins that obstruct myotube fusion, which can result in developmental defects in muscle cells (Vogel2021Histopathology).

PLPP7 is also implicated in the regulation of the mTOR pathway, influencing insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) expression during myoblast differentiation. This regulatory function is crucial for muscle cell growth and differentiation (RamirezMartinez2021The). In the context of muscle regeneration, PLPP7 is part of the ENPP2-LPAR-PLPP pathway, which is active in muscle cells and influences muscle stem cell function and regeneration (Contreras2023Singlecell).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PLPP7 gene have been implicated in several muscular dystrophies. In Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD), mutations such as p.R252P and p.M92K in PLPP7 disrupt its function in gene positioning, leading to misregulation of myogenic gene expression. This misregulation is proposed as a primary cause of EDMD pathology, suggesting that gene misregulation, rather than mechanical instability, is a more likely mechanism for the disease (Meinke2020A; Meinke2019A). PLPP7 is also downregulated in EDMD, contributing to the disease phenotype (Vogel2021Histopathology).

In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), PLPP7 expression is altered, with its main isoform being downregulated in muscle tissues. This downregulation correlates with muscle weakness, specifically dorsiflexion strength, and overlaps with genes differentially expressed in DM1 patient biopsies, indicating its functional relevance in the disease (Todorow2023Nuclear).

PLPP7 is also associated with Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), where its expression is inversely correlated with disease severity. The downregulation of PLPP7 in FSHD may contribute to muscle weakness and wasting, affecting muscle regeneration and gene expression regulation (Schätzl2024Metaanalysis).
