# IPO13

## Overview
Importin 13 (IPO13) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the importin-β family, which functions as a bidirectional transport receptor. The protein, also known as importin 13, is characterized by its ability to mediate the nuclear import and export of various proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as signal transduction, development, and stress response. Structurally, importin 13 is distinguished by its 20 HEAT repeats, which form a solenoid-like tertiary structure, allowing it to interact with both import and export cargos. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its subcellular localization and transport dynamics. Importin 13 is involved in the nuclear import of key transcription factors and other proteins, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in clinical conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders (Tao2006Importin; Baumhardt2018Structures; Liu2018PKAsite).

## Structure
Importin 13 (IPO13) is a bidirectional transport receptor that is part of the importin-β family. Its structure is characterized by 20 HEAT repeats, which are helical motifs that contribute to its solenoid-like tertiary structure. Notably, IPO13 has long loop insertions at HEAT 9 and between HEATs 17-18, which are critical for its function as a transporter (Baumhardt2018Structures).

IPO13 is unique among transporters because it binds to folded domains within its cargos rather than extended linear motifs. The structure of IPO13 bound to import cargo, such as the SUMO E2 ligase Ubc9, and export cargo, like eIF1A, has been elucidated. When bound to RanGTP, IPO13 adopts a superhelical conformation, which is similar to its conformation when bound to Ubc9, indicating a steric mechanism for cargo release upon RanGTP binding (Baumhardt2018Structures).

Post-translational modifications of IPO13 include phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at serine 193. This modification affects IPO13's nuclear import and export functions by altering its subcellular localization, shifting it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Liu2018PKAsite).

## Function
Importin 13 (IPO13) is a member of the importin-β family, functioning as both an import and export receptor for various proteins in human cells. It plays a critical role in the nuclear import of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in airway epithelial cells, facilitating GR's entry into the nucleus, which is essential for glucocorticoid signaling and the anti-inflammatory response (Tao2006Importin). IPO13 is also involved in the nuclear import of paired-type homeodomain transcription factors, such as Pax6, Pax3, and Crx, which are crucial for development and differentiation (Ploski2004PairedType).

In addition to its import functions, IPO13 regulates the nuclear import of Ubc9, a key regulator of sumoylation, by binding to it in the cytoplasm and releasing it in the nucleus upon interaction with RanGTP (Grünwald2010Structure). IPO13's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly at serine 193, which affects its subcellular localization and transport dynamics, influencing its role in cellular processes (Liu2018PKAsite). This dual role in import and export highlights IPO13's importance in maintaining cellular function and regulation through nucleocytoplasmic transport (Grünwald2010Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IPO13 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A study identified a novel mutation in the IPO13 gene, specifically a homozygous mutation (p.R111C), which is associated with autosomal-recessive ocular conditions such as coloboma, microphthalmia, and cataract. This mutation affects a highly conserved functional domain of the protein, leading to structural changes that impact its function. The mutation was shown to be fully segregated in a studied family and was absent in several genetic databases, indicating its rarity (Huang2018Mutation).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), IPO13 is overexpressed, particularly in tumors with EGFR mutations. This overexpression is associated with the nuclear translocation of RFPL3 and upregulation of hTERT expression, processes linked to tumor progression. Knockdown of IPO13 in NSCLC cells results in reduced cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Zohud2020Importin).

IPO13 also plays a role in neuronal differentiation and neurogenesis. Its absence in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to impaired expression and localization of neuronal markers, affecting neuron and astrocyte differentiation. This suggests that disruptions in IPO13 function could impact neurogenesis and potentially contribute to neurological disorders (Gajewska2022Nuclear).

## Interactions
Importin 13 (IPO13) is involved in various protein interactions, facilitating the nuclear import and export of several key proteins. IPO13 interacts with the paired homeodomain transcription factor Pax6, mediating its RanGTP-dependent nuclear import. The interaction is specific to the amino acid residues 208 to 288 of Pax6, which function as a nuclear localization signal (Ploski2004PairedType). IPO13 also binds to the NF-YB/NF-YC dimer, part of the NF-Y transcription factor complex, and this interaction is sensitive to the presence of NF-YA, suggesting competitive binding (Kahle2005Subunits).

In the context of stress responses, IPO13 interacts with clusterin (nCLU) and KU70, regulating their nuclear localization. Under oxidative stress, IPO13 facilitates the nuclear import of nCLU and the export of KU70, impacting stress-induced cell death pathways (Gajewska2023The). IPO13 also interacts with myopodin, an actin-bundling protein, mediating its nuclear import, which is crucial for its tumor-suppressor functions (Liang2007Interaction).

In non-small cell lung cancer, IPO13 is involved in the nuclear translocation of RFPL3, a process linked to cancer progression and regulated by EGFR signaling (Zohud2020Importin). These interactions highlight IPO13's role in cellular processes and stress responses.
