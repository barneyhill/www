# ATP12A

## Overview
The ATP12A gene encodes the ATPase H+/K+ transporting non-gastric alpha2 subunit, a crucial component of the P2C-type ATPases subgroup, which are integral membrane ionic transporters. This protein functions as a proton pump, facilitating the exchange of protons (H+) and potassium ions (K+) across cell membranes, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining ion balance and pH homeostasis in epithelial cells. The ATP12A protein is characterized by its structure as a heterodimer, consisting of a catalytic α-subunit and an auxiliary β-subunit, with the α-subunit containing transmembrane and cytosolic domains responsible for ATP hydrolysis and auto-phosphorylation (Dębczyński2023ATP12A; Favia2022The). This protein is expressed in various tissues, including the renal cortical collecting ducts, colon, and airways, where it contributes to essential physiological processes such as acid-base regulation and airway surface liquid pH balance (Jakab2014The; Scudieri2018Increased). The clinical significance of ATP12A is underscored by its involvement in respiratory diseases like cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where its expression levels and activity can influence disease pathology and potential therapeutic strategies (Dębczyński2023ATP12A).

## Structure
The ATP12A protein is a proton pump that functions as a heterodimer composed of a catalytic α-subunit and an auxiliary β-subunit. The α-subunit features a transmembrane domain (TMD) with ten membrane-spanning helices and N-and C-terminal cytosolic tails. The TMD contains ion-binding site residues located between transmembrane helices 4 and 8. The cytosolic portion of the α-subunit forms the actuator (A), phosphorylation (P), and nucleotide-binding (N) domains, which are responsible for auto-phosphorylation and ATP hydrolysis (Dębczyński2023ATP12A).

The auxiliary β-subunit is a single-span membrane protein characterized by a large C-terminal ectodomain and a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The association between the α and β subunits is crucial for plasma membrane integration and targeting to the correct cell surface pole (Dębczyński2023ATP12A).

ATP12A is part of the P2C-type ATPases subgroup, which are integral membrane ionic transporters. These proteins are responsible for maintaining electro-chemical gradients across cellular membranes (Favia2022The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
The ATP12A gene encodes the non-gastric H+/K+ ATPase, which is involved in various physiological processes by mediating the exchange of protons (H+) and potassium ions (K+) across cell membranes. This protein is crucial for maintaining ion balance and pH homeostasis in epithelial cells. In healthy human cells, ATP12A is expressed in the apical membranes of renal cortical collecting ducts and the colon brush border, where it plays a significant role in regulating acid-base and potassium homeostasis (Jakab2014The). It is also involved in the acidification of prostate secretions in the anterior lobe, contributing to the maintenance of an acidic environment necessary for proper physiological function (Jakab2014The).

In the exocrine pancreas, ATP12A participates in transepithelial bicarbonate secretion, which is essential for digestive processes (Jakab2014The). The protein's activity is also noted in the airways, where it regulates the pH of airway surface liquid by mediating proton secretion, a process that is typically balanced by bicarbonate transport (Scudieri2018Increased). This balance is crucial for maintaining the ion composition of airway surface liquid, which supports innate defense mechanisms against microbial agents (Scudieri2018Increased).

## Clinical Significance
The ATP12A gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various respiratory diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis (CF). In CF, ATP12A is linked to mucus dysfunction and airway inflammation, especially during Type-2 inflammation mediated by IL-13. This inflammation increases ATP12A expression, leading to decreased airway surface liquid (ASL) volume and increased mucus viscosity, impairing mucociliary function. Silencing ATP12A can normalize ASL volume and viscosity, highlighting its role in mucus alteration (Dębczyński2023ATP12A). ATP12A is also associated with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), where its silencing reduces IL-13-induced eotaxin-3 expression (Dębczyński2023ATP12A).

Increased ATP12A expression is observed in the pancreas of CF patients, contributing to the risk of meconium ileus, a severe condition in newborns. This overexpression may lead to fluid acidification and exacerbate pancreatic dysfunction (Dębczyński2023ATP12A). ATP12A is also overexpressed in non-CF conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggesting its upregulation may occur due to infectious and inflammatory stimuli (Dębczyński2023ATP12A). Targeting ATP12A with inhibitors like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and vonoprazan is being explored as a potential therapeutic strategy for these conditions (Dębczyński2023ATP12A).

## Interactions
ATP12A, also known as the non-gastric H+/K+ ATPase, interacts with various proteins to form functional complexes essential for its role in ion transport. A key interaction is with the β1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, known as ATP1B1. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of ATP12A in epithelial cells. In bronchial epithelial cells, ATP12A and ATP1B1 colocalize in the apical membrane, and their interaction is enhanced by IL-4 treatment, which suggests a role in modulating ATP12A's membrane localization and function (Scudieri2018Increased).

In the anterior prostate of mice, ATP12A forms a complex with the β1 subunit, which is necessary for the apical localization of the enzyme. The absence of ATP12A results in the disappearance of the β1 subunit from the apical membrane, indicating a dependency on ATP12A for its localization (Pestov2006Loss).

In mammalian spermatozoa, ATP12A colocalizes with the Na+/K+ ATPase β1 subunit in the acrosomal region, suggesting a functional interaction that may be important for sperm physiology (Favia2022The). These interactions highlight the importance of ATP12A in various physiological processes through its association with specific β subunits.
