# MTMR9

## Overview
MTMR9 is a gene that encodes the myotubularin-related protein 9, a member of the myotubularin family of proteins. Unlike some other members of this family, MTMR9 is catalytically inactive due to the absence of a conserved cysteine residue in its phosphatase domain. Despite its lack of enzymatic activity, MTMR9 plays a crucial regulatory role by forming complexes with active myotubularins, such as MTMR6, MTMR7, and MTMR8, thereby modulating their activity and substrate specificity. This protein is involved in essential cellular processes, including ER-to-Golgi trafficking and autophagy regulation, impacting the localization and function of various proteins and signaling pathways (Mochizuki2003Characterization; Zou2012Myotubularinrelated). MTMR9's interactions and regulatory functions underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in clinical conditions such as intellectual disability, obesity, and metabolic syndrome (Shi2020Genetic; Yanagiya2007Association; Hotta2011Association).

## Structure
MTMR9 is a member of the myotubularin family, characterized by its lack of catalytic activity due to the absence of a conserved cysteine residue in the phosphatase domain. Despite this, MTMR9 plays a significant role in modulating the activity of other myotubularin proteins through complex formation. The protein contains a coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as MTMR7, MTMR6, and MTMR8 (Mochizuki2003Characterization; Zou2012Myotubularinrelated). This domain facilitates the formation of heterodimeric complexes, enhancing the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of its binding partners (Zou2012Myotubularinrelated).

MTMR9 also features a SET interaction domain (SID), which may contribute to its role as an adapter protein, influencing the localization and function of enzymatically active myotubularins (Mochizuki2003Characterization). The protein is involved in cellular processes such as ER-to-Golgi trafficking and autophagy regulation, impacting the localization of proteins like RAB1A and the secretion of signaling molecules such as WNT3A (Doubravská2020Human). While specific details about the primary and tertiary structures of MTMR9 are not provided, its functional domains and interactions highlight its regulatory role in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
MTMR9 (myotubularin-related protein 9) is a crucial component in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of the secretory pathway and autophagy. It is part of the myotubularin family, which includes both active phosphatases and inactive binding partners. MTMR9 itself is catalytically inactive but modulates the activity and substrate specificity of active myotubularins such as MTMR6 and MTMR8. The MTMR6/MTMR9 complex shows enhanced activity towards phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), while the MTMR8/MTMR9 complex prefers phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) (Zou2012Myotubularinrelated).

MTMR9 is involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking, influencing the localization and function of proteins like RAB1A and WHAMM, which are essential for maintaining Golgi integrity and vesicle trafficking (Doubravská2020Human). It also plays a role in modulating WNT3A secretion, affecting its transport from the ER to the Golgi (Doubravská2020Human). In terms of autophagy, MTMR9, through its interaction with MTMR8, regulates the levels of PtdIns3P, impacting autophagic processes (Zou2012Myotubularinrelated). MTMR9's influence on these pathways highlights its significant role in cellular homeostasis and signaling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MTMR9 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. In the context of nonsyndromic intellectual disability (NSID), genetic variants of MTMR9 have been linked to increased susceptibility. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MTMR9 gene that are significantly associated with NSID, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to this condition (Shi2020Genetic).

MTMR9 has also been implicated in obesity. Research has shown that SNP rs2293855 in the MTMR9 gene is significantly associated with obesity in the Japanese population. This SNP is linked to increased body mass index (BMI) and higher blood pressure in individuals carrying the A-allele homozygote, indicating a role in the regulation of body weight and energy balance (Yanagiya2007Association).

Additionally, MTMR9 is associated with metabolic syndrome, particularly in relation to hypertension and impaired fasting glucose. The SNP rs2293855 in MTMR9 has been identified as significantly associated with these conditions, highlighting its potential influence on metabolic health (Hotta2011Association).

## Interactions
MTMR9, a member of the myotubularin family, is known for its interactions with several other proteins, particularly within its subfamily. MTMR9 forms complexes with active myotubularins such as MTMR6, MTMR7, and MTMR8, enhancing their enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. The MTMR6/MTMR9 complex shows a preference for phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2), significantly increasing MTMR6's activity, while the MTMR8/MTMR9 complex prefers phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), enhancing MTMR8's activity (Mochizuki2003Characterization; Zou2012Myotubularinrelated).

MTMR9 also interacts with MTMR7, where it enhances MTMR7's phosphatase activity, particularly at lower pH levels (Mochizuki2003Characterization). These interactions are crucial for regulating cellular processes such as autophagy and endocytic membrane trafficking. The MTMR8/R9 complex, for instance, is involved in reducing autophagy by altering PtdIns(3)P levels (Zou2012Myotubularinrelated).

MTMR9's role extends to ER-to-Golgi trafficking, where it interacts with RAB1 and RAB2 GTPases, influencing vesicle transport and protein secretion pathways (Doubravská2020Human). These interactions highlight MTMR9's regulatory role in cellular signaling and trafficking processes.
