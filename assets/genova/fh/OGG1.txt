# OGG1

## Overview
The OGG1 gene encodes the enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, a pivotal component of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. This enzyme is primarily responsible for identifying and excising 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), a prevalent oxidative DNA lesion that can lead to mutagenesis if left unrepaired. As a DNA N-glycosylase, OGG1 initiates the repair process by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond of 8-oxoG, thereby preventing mutations and maintaining genomic stability (Boiteux2017Repair). The protein's structure includes a helix-hairpin-helix motif crucial for DNA binding, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, such as PARP-1 and RAD52, which enhance its function in the cellular environment (Kuznetsov2011Mechanism; Noren2011Poly(ADPribose) page 0 of 7). Beyond DNA repair, OGG1 influences gene expression and chromatin remodeling in response to oxidative stress, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular processes (Wang2018The).

## Structure
The human OGG1 protein is a crucial enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, responsible for removing 8-oxoguanine lesions from DNA. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The secondary structure of OGG1 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with a notable helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif that is critical for DNA binding (Kuznetsov2011Mechanism). The tertiary structure of OGG1 is compact and globular, featuring a unique third anti-parallel β-sheet domain that distinguishes it from other members of the base excision repair superfamily (Kuznetsov2011Mechanism).

OGG1 contains a glycosylase domain that facilitates the recognition and excision of 8-oxoguanine lesions. The enzyme's active site includes key residues such as Gly-42, Lys-249, and Asp-268, which are involved in substrate recognition and catalysis (Tyugashev2019Roles). The protein also features a binding pocket formed by residues like Phe-319 and Cys-253, which are crucial for its specificity and activity (Bjørås2002Reciprocal).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, influencing OGG1's activity and stability. Additionally, splice variants of OGG1 can result in different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The protein typically exists as a monomer, indicating no quaternary structure (Wang2021The).

## Function
The human OGG1 gene encodes the enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, which plays a critical role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. This enzyme is responsible for recognizing and excising 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), a common oxidative lesion in DNA that can lead to mutagenesis if not repaired. OGG1 operates primarily in the nucleus, where it maintains genomic stability by preventing mutations, particularly GC to TA transversions, which can result from unrepaired 8-oxoG lesions (Boiteux2017Repair).

OGG1 functions as a DNA N-glycosylase, initiating the repair process by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond of 8-oxoG, which is facilitated by key residues such as D268 and K249. This action results in the formation of an abasic site, which is further processed by other enzymes in the BER pathway to restore the DNA to its undamaged state (Boiteux2017Repair).

The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with chromatin remodelers, which enhance its access to damaged sites within the chromatin structure. This regulation is crucial for its efficient function in the cellular environment (Boiteux2017Repair). OGG1's role extends beyond DNA repair, as it also influences gene expression by modulating transcription factor binding and chromatin remodeling in response to oxidative stress (Wang2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OGG1 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. The Ser326Cys (S326C) polymorphism in OGG1 is linked to decreased DNA repair activity, leading to increased susceptibility to several cancers, including lung, gastric, prostate, and orolaryngeal cancers, due to higher mutation rates under oxidative stress (Bravard2009Oxidation). This variant is also associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, particularly in Asian and Caucasian populations (Sampath2019Roles).

OGG1 deficiency in mice models results in features of metabolic syndrome, including obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance, indicating its role in energy metabolism and glucose tolerance (Sampath20128Oxoguanine; Vartanian20178oxoguanine). In Alzheimer's disease, mutations in OGG1, such as the C 796-deleted mutation, lead to impaired DNA repair mechanisms, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Mao2007Identification). Reduced OGG1 activity is observed in the brains of patients with mild cognitive impairment and late-stage Alzheimer's, potentially due to oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation byproducts (Shao2008Altered).

OGG1 also plays a role in regulating inflammation. Disruption of the OGG1 gene in mice leads to reduced inflammatory responses, suggesting its involvement in autoimmune and allergic conditions (Mabley2004Potential).

## Interactions
OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. OGG1 interacts with Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a DNA-damage sensor protein. This interaction is enhanced by oxidative stress and involves the N-terminal region of OGG1 binding to the BRCT domain of PARP-1. OGG1 stimulates the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of PARP-1, which is important for DNA repair processes. However, activated PARP-1 can inhibit the incision activity of OGG1, indicating a complex regulatory relationship (Noren2011Poly(ADPribose) page 0 of 7, Noren2011Poly(ADPribose) page 3 of 7).

OGG1 also interacts with the recombination protein RAD52, which enhances OGG1's incision activity, potentially increasing its turnover rate. This interaction is significant after oxidative stress, suggesting a cooperative role in repairing oxidative DNA damage (de2009The).

Additionally, OGG1 interacts with RECQL4, a DNA helicase, which enhances OGG1's catalytic activity, particularly its AP lyase activity. This interaction is regulated by the acetylation state of RECQL4, modulated by SIRT1 deacetylase, and is crucial for the repair of oxidative base lesions like 8-oxoG (Duan2020Interaction).
