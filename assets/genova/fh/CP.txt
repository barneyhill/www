# CP

## Overview
The CP gene encodes ceruloplasmin, a multicopper oxidase protein that plays a pivotal role in iron metabolism and oxidative stress defense. Ceruloplasmin is primarily involved in the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+), facilitating iron binding to transferrin for transport in the bloodstream. This function is crucial for maintaining iron homeostasis and preventing iron accumulation in tissues. Beyond its role in iron metabolism, ceruloplasmin exhibits antioxidant properties, acting as a radical scavenger to protect cells from oxidative damage. The protein's structure, characterized by six plastocyanin-type domains and copper-binding sites, supports its diverse enzymatic activities. Mutations in the CP gene can lead to disorders such as aceruloplasminemia, highlighting its clinical significance in iron-related pathologies (Linder2016Ceruloplasmin; Roeser1970The; Bielli2002Structure).

## Structure
Ceruloplasmin (CP) is a copper-binding glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 132 kDa, consisting of a single polypeptide chain of 1,046 amino acids (Takahashi1984Singlechain). The protein is organized into six plastocyanin-type domains arranged in a triangular array, each comprising a beta-barrel structure typical of small blue cupredoxin proteins like azurin and plastocyanin (Zaitseva1996The). These domains include six copper atoms, with three forming a trinuclear cluster at the interface of domains 1 and 6, and three mononuclear sites in domains 2, 4, and 6 (Lindley1997An; Zaitseva1996The).

The primary structure of ceruloplasmin includes attachment sites for four glucosamine oligosaccharides, contributing to its glycosylation (Takahashi1984Singlechain). The secondary structure features alternating patterns of domains with disulfide bonds and glucosamine oligosaccharide attachment sites (Takahashi1984Singlechain). The tertiary structure is characterized by a pseudo-threefold axis and cupredoxin-type folds with large loop insertions (Lindley1997An). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed in the context provided.

Ceruloplasmin's structure supports its multifunctionality, playing roles in copper transport, iron homeostasis, and defense against oxidative stress (Bielli2002Structure). The protein's spatial organization and copper-binding sites are crucial for its enzymatic activities, including its oxidase function (Bielli2002Structure).

## Function
Ceruloplasmin (CP) is a multicopper oxidase primarily involved in iron metabolism. It facilitates the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+), which is essential for the binding of iron to transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the blood. This ferroxidase activity is crucial for maintaining normal plasma iron levels and ensuring efficient iron turnover (Roeser1970The). Ceruloplasmin is active at the cell membrane-plasma interface, where it aids in the mobilization of iron from reticuloendothelial cells and hepatocytes, preventing iron accumulation in tissues (Harris1999Targeted).

In addition to its role in iron metabolism, ceruloplasmin exhibits antioxidant properties. It acts as a radical scavenger, neutralizing reactive oxygen species such as peroxide and superoxide, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage (Linder2016Ceruloplasmin). Ceruloplasmin also participates in the oxidation of various organic compounds and plays a role in the formation of S-nitrosoglutathione, which is significant in signal transduction (Bielli2002Structure). These diverse functions highlight ceruloplasmin as a multifunctional protein, or "moonlighting" protein, with critical roles in maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis (Bielli2002Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ceruloplasmin (CP) gene can lead to aceruloplasminemia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by iron accumulation in various organs, including the brain, liver, and pancreas. This condition manifests with symptoms such as diabetes mellitus, retinal degeneration, and neurological issues like ataxia and dementia due to iron overload in the basal ganglia and other tissues (Ondrejkovičová2020New; Hellman2002CERULOPLASMIN). Aceruloplasminemia is caused by a complete absence of serum ceruloplasmin, leading to significant iron accumulation and related symptoms (Harris1999Targeted).

Heterozygous mutations in the CP gene, while typically asymptomatic, have been associated with neurological symptoms in some cases. These include movement disorders and brain iron overload, suggesting that partial ceruloplasmin deficiency can affect cerebral iron metabolism (Borges2019Clinical; Kuhn2005Extrapyramidal). Additionally, CP gene variants have been linked to hyperferritinemia and liver damage in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), indicating a role in altered iron metabolism and increased liver iron (Corradini2021Ceruloplasmin). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CP gene mutations in various iron-related disorders.

## Interactions
Ceruloplasmin (CP) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in physiological and pathological processes. CP interacts with activated protein C, affecting the inactivation rates of coagulation factors Va and VIII. This interaction suggests that CP can protect these factors from inactivation, potentially through direct binding (Walker1990Characterization).

CP also forms complexes with lactoferrin (LF) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), which are significant in inflammatory conditions. The CP-LF complex is characterized by a high-affinity interaction, with a dissociation constant of 1.07 μM, and is involved in iron metabolism and host defense mechanisms (Pulina2002Studies; Sokolov2017Comparison). The CP-MPO complex inhibits MPO's prooxidant activity, which is crucial in regulating inflammation (Vasilyev2019Looking).

CP interacts with proteins from the serprocidin family, such as azurocidin, neutrophilic elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3, acting as a competitive inhibitor. These interactions are influenced by ionic strength and are significant in modulating immune responses (Sokolov2010Study).

Additionally, CP forms a complex with ferritin during iron loading, enhancing its ferroxidase activity. This interaction is species-dependent and involves a specific recognition site on the H subunit of ferritin (Reilly1998Evidence).
