# PRPSAP2

## Overview
PRPSAP2, or phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase associated protein 2, is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in nucleotide biosynthesis. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its role in modulating the activity of the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS) enzyme complex. Unlike other PRPS isozymes, PRPSAP2 lacks catalytic activity due to unique structural features, such as non-homologous regions in its catalytic flexible loop, which prevent the coordination of ATP and ribose-5-phosphate (Karki2024Evolutionary). Despite its lack of direct catalytic function, PRPSAP2 plays a crucial role in the formation of higher-order assemblies within the PRPS complex and acts as a negative regulator of PRPS activity, influencing nucleotide availability for DNA replication and repair (Ugbogu2022Contribution). The protein is also implicated in broader protein interaction networks and has been identified as a candidate oncogene in certain cancers, such as osteosarcoma, where it may contribute to tumorigenesis through its regulatory functions (Both2012Identification).

## Structure
PRPSAP2, a protein associated with the PRPS enzyme complex, exhibits unique structural characteristics that differentiate it from other PRPS isozymes. The molecular structure of PRPSAP2 is marked by unique insertions in the catalytic flexible (CF) loop, known as non-homologous regions (NHRs), which inhibit its catalytic function by preventing the coordination of ATP and ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) in the closed conformation of the catalytic loop (Karki2024Evolutionary). Despite this, PRPSAP2 shares a high degree of conservation in active site residues with PRPS1 across Opisthokonta, although adaptive changes in loop regions post-duplication indicate strong selective pressure against catalytic function (Karki2024Evolutionary).

PRPSAP2 is involved in forming higher-order assemblies within the PRPS complex, driven by structural changes at the N-terminus (Karki2024Evolutionary). The protein's interactions with other PRPS isozymes are crucial for its role in modulating the kinetics of catalytic loop opening in adjacent PRPS1/2 (Karki2024Evolutionary). The presence of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in PRPSAP2 is noted, although these regions do not directly facilitate complex assembly (Karki2024Evolutionary). The structural differences between PRPSAP2 and other PRPS proteins have been maintained since their divergence, highlighting the evolutionary adaptations that have influenced these interactions (Karki2024Evolutionary).

## Function
PRPSAP2 (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase associated protein 2) is involved in the regulation of nucleotide biosynthesis. It modulates the activity of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPS), an enzyme crucial for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. PRPSAP2 is thought to act as a negative regulator of PRPP synthetase, influencing the availability of nucleotides necessary for DNA replication and repair, thereby impacting cellular proliferation and metabolism (Ugbogu2022Contribution). 

In healthy human cells, PRPSAP2 is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with PRPS to fine-tune nucleotide production, ensuring balanced cell growth and function. Although PRPSAP2 shares high amino acid sequence similarity with PRPSAP1, it does not contain an ATP-catalytic binding site, which means it cannot directly participate in the phosphoribosyl transferase reaction (Ugbogu2022Contribution). The abundance of PRPSAP2 is described as extremely scarce, and its role as a negative regulator of PRPS enzymes is mainly attributed to PRPSAP1 (Srivastava2021NOTCH1driven). The specific function of PRPSAP2 in healthy human cells remains less defined compared to its role in pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PRPSAP2 is involved in a complex network of protein interactions. It is part of a cluster associated with the protein PSMA1, which includes various other proteins such as PSMA4, FAF1, CUL1, and TPRKB, among others. This cluster suggests that PRPSAP2 may play a role in a broader protein interaction network, potentially influencing cellular processes through these associations (Zivanic2012The).

In the context of cancer research, PRPSAP2 has been identified as a candidate oncogene in osteosarcoma, where it is overexpressed due to gene amplification. Although specific interactions of PRPSAP2 in this context are not detailed, its overexpression suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis, possibly through interactions that affect cellular proliferation and metabolic pathways (Both2012Identification).

PRPSAP2 is also mentioned in studies related to nucleotide biosynthesis, where it is suggested to have a regulatory function similar to PRPSAP1, although it is less abundant. This implies that PRPSAP2 might interact with PRPS enzymes, influencing purine and pyrimidine metabolism, which are crucial for nucleotide synthesis and cellular proliferation (Srivastava2021NOTCH1driven).
