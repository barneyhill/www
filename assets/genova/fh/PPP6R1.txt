# PPP6R1

## Overview
PPP6R1 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 6 regulatory subunit 1, a critical component of the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) complex. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit, playing a pivotal role in modulating various cellular processes, including signal transduction, DNA repair, and immune response regulation. As a regulatory subunit, PPP6R1 is involved in the dephosphorylation of target proteins, thereby influencing pathways such as NF-κB signaling and DNA damage repair mechanisms (Ziembik2017Functions; Ohama2019The). The protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its regulatory functions (Stefansson2008Protein). PPP6R1 is expressed in multiple tissues, with notable abundance in immune cells, underscoring its significance in immune cell signaling and homeostasis (Ziembik2017Functions).

## Structure
PPP6R1, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. The primary structure of PPP6R1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the backbone of the protein. The secondary structure of PPP6R1 may include alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its biological activity. In terms of quaternary structure, PPP6R1 interacts with other subunits to form a functional protein complex.

Specific domains within PPP6R1, such as ankyrin repeats, are common and play a role in protein-protein interactions. These domains are critical for the regulatory functions of PPP6R1. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can occur and may influence the protein's activity, localization, or interaction with other molecules. Splice variant isoforms of PPP6R1 may exist, potentially altering the protein's function or cellular localization. These structural features and modifications are integral to the diverse roles that PPP6R1 plays in cellular signaling and regulation.

## Function
PPP6R1 encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. PPP6R1, also known as SAPS1, partners with PP6 to target the inhibitory protein IκBε, reducing its phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. This action limits the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor essential for immune responses, thereby maintaining the balance of NF-κB signaling crucial for proper immune function and cellular responses (Ziembik2017Functions).

In addition to its role in NF-κB signaling, PPP6R1 is involved in DNA damage repair, particularly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through the non-homologous end-joining pathway. PPP6R1 interacts with DNA-PKcs, facilitating its dephosphorylation and activation, which is vital for the repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage (Ohama2019The).

PPP6R1 is expressed in various human tissues, with higher protein levels observed in the lung, bladder, spleen, and pancreas. It is abundant in immune cells, such as B cells and NK cells, suggesting a significant role in immune cell signaling (Ziembik2017Functions). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and stress response.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP6R1 gene, which encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), have been implicated in various clinical conditions. PPP6R1 is involved in the regulation of immune responses and cell death pathways, particularly through its role in NF-κB signaling and TNFα-mediated apoptosis. Dysregulation of PPP6R1 can lead to enhanced NF-κB activation, which is crucial for immune responses and has potential implications in inflammatory diseases (Ziembik2017Functions).

In the context of cancer, alterations in PPP6R1 expression have been associated with breast cancer. The expression of PPP6R1, along with NAT14 and SUV420H2, has been analyzed in breast cancer studies, suggesting that changes in their expression may be linked to the disease (Gao2024Androgen). Although specific mutations in PPP6R1 are not directly mentioned, the gene's involvement in critical signaling pathways suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to oncogenesis.

Furthermore, PPP6R1, as part of the PP6 complex, plays a role in TNFα-mediated cell death. While the loss of PPP6R1 alone does not significantly affect TNFα-induced apoptosis, its regulatory function in conjunction with other subunits is crucial for proper cell death regulation, which may have implications in cancer progression and immune evasion (Wu2022PP6).

## Interactions
PPP6R1, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. PPP6R1 interacts directly with the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the catalytic subunit of PP6 (PP6c), forming a complex that plays a significant role in the DNA damage response. This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal region of PPP6R1, which is necessary and sufficient for binding to DNA-PK (Hosing2012PP6). 

PPP6R1 also associates with ankyrin repeat proteins, such as ARS-A, ARS-B, and ARS-C, which are part of the PP6 holoenzyme complex. These interactions are specific to PP6 and do not occur with other phosphatases like PP2A or PP4 (Stefansson2008Protein). 

In the context of NF-κB signaling, PPP6R1 interacts with IκBε, influencing the pathway by limiting NF-κB activation. This interaction is part of PP6's role as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling (Ziembik2017Functions). 

Additionally, PPP6R1 is involved in the replication machinery of the influenza A virus, interacting with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which suggests a role in viral replication (York2014Interactome).
