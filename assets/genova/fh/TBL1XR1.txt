# TBL1XR1

## Overview
TBL1XR1 is a gene that encodes the TBL1X/Y related 1 protein, which is a critical component of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) complexes. This protein is categorized as a transcriptional corepressor/coactivator exchange factor, playing a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation through chromatin remodeling. The TBL1XR1 protein is characterized by its N-terminal domain and WD40 repeat domain, which facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as N-CoR and β-catenin, influencing pathways like Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK signaling (Hu2023The; Nishi2017De). Mutations in the TBL1XR1 gene are associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in both normal cellular function and disease (Arroyo2021TBL1XR1; Wang2020TBL1XR1).

## Structure
The TBL1XR1 protein is composed of two main structural domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the WD40 repeat domain. The NTD is crucial for the protein's interaction with other components of the corepressor complex, such as N-CoR and β-catenin. A specific mutation, Phe10Leu, within the NTD, affects the protein's structural stability by reducing the contact area of the 10th residue with surrounding residues, except for Val44. This mutation decreases the interaction with N-CoR while increasing binding to β-catenin, enhancing Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity (Nishi2017De).

The WD40 domain is characterized by tandem repeats of approximately 40-60 amino acids, forming a β-propeller structure that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This domain is involved in the repressive function of nuclear receptors by supporting histone deacetylation on target genes (Hu2023The). TBL1XR1 functions as a transcriptional corepressor/coactivator exchange factor, necessary for the ubiquitylation-dependent dissociation of corepressors upon activation signals (Hu2023The).

TBL1XR1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by PKCδ, which is essential for its role in activating nuclear receptor transcription (Hu2023The). The protein may also be regulated by SUMOylation, influencing its function as a molecular switch for transcriptional activation and repression (Nishi2017De).

## Function
The TBL1XR1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) complexes, which are involved in transcriptional regulation through chromatin remodeling. In healthy human cells, TBL1XR1 plays a significant role in modulating gene expression by influencing histone deacetylation, primarily through its interaction with HDAC3, a major histone deacetylase associated with these complexes (Mastrototaro2021TBL1XR1; Yoon2003Purification).

TBL1XR1 is involved in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for cell proliferation and differentiation. It ensures proper MAPK signaling transduction and is involved in both gene repression and de-repression through its interaction with NCOR/SMRT complexes (Mastrototaro2021TBL1XR1). The protein also plays a role in the transcriptional activity of β-catenin on Wnt target genes, maintaining a balance in Wnt signaling, which is crucial for neural development and function (Mastrototaro2021TBL1XR1).

TBL1XR1's function extends to maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells, influencing processes like DNA replication, cell cycle, and neuron differentiation, which are vital for normal brain function (Mastrototaro2021TBL1XR1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBL1XR1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders. These include intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia (Nagy2024The). Pierpont Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, is specifically linked to certain missense variants in TBL1XR1, such as p.Tyr446Cys, p.Tyr446His, p.Cys325Tyr, and p.Gly237Asp. This syndrome is characterized by developmental delays, hearing loss, facial dysmorphisms, and abnormal fat distribution in the distal limbs (Lemattre2018TBL1XR1; Bajaj2022Novel).

The TBL1XR1 gene is also implicated in tumorigenesis, with mutations associated with poor outcomes in primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PTL). These mutations correlate with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Wang2020TBL1XR1). Additionally, TBL1XR1 mutations have been linked to West syndrome and Rett syndrome-like features, expanding the clinical spectrum of disorders associated with this gene (Saitsu2014A).

Overall, the diverse phenotypic outcomes of TBL1XR1 mutations highlight the gene's significant role in various developmental and pathological conditions (Arroyo2021TBL1XR1).

## Interactions
TBL1XR1 is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is a component of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) repressor complex. This complex includes histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), and TBL1XR1 is crucial for the repressive function of type II nuclear receptors by supporting histone deacetylation on target genes (Hu2023The; Nagy2024The).

TBL1XR1 interacts with β-catenin, influencing the transcriptional activity of Wnt target genes. This interaction is essential for the regulation of neural development and the MAPK signaling pathway (Mastrototaro2021TBL1XR1). TBL1XR1 also participates in the histone-to-protamine replacement process during spermiogenesis, affecting chromatin compaction and integrity (Zhou2021Deficiency).

The protein is involved in the ubiquitylation-dependent dissociation of corepressors upon receipt of an activating signal, serving as a transcriptional corepressor/coactivator exchange factor. This function is necessary for the activation of several transcription factors, including NFκB and CBF1 (Hu2023The). TBL1XR1's interactions are mediated through its WD40 repeat domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Nagy2024The).
