# NDUFV3

## Overview
NDUFV3 is a gene that encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit V3, a component of mitochondrial complex I, which is the first enzyme in the electron transport chain. This protein is integral to the mitochondrial respiratory chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, thereby contributing to the proton gradient essential for ATP synthesis. NDUFV3 exists in two isoforms, NDUFV3-S and NDUFV3-L, which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with the former predominantly found in heart and skeletal muscle, and the latter in liver, brain, and lung tissues. The protein is located at the tip of the mitochondrial matrix-sided N-module of complex I, near the NADH binding site, suggesting a potential regulatory role in modulating substrate affinity and influencing the efficiency of NADH oxidation (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification; Dibley2016A). Although not directly involved in catalysis, NDUFV3 may play a role in the assembly and regulation of complex I, impacting mitochondrial efficiency and energy production (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification; Dibley2016A).

## Structure
The NDUFV3 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, known as flavoprotein 3, which exists in two isoforms: a short isoform (NDUFV3-S) and a long isoform (NDUFV3-L) (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification). NDUFV3-S is approximately 10 kDa and predominantly found in heart and skeletal muscle, while NDUFV3-L is about 50 kDa and more common in liver, brain, and lung tissues (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification). The primary structure of NDUFV3 includes a N-terminal coil, an α-helix, and a C-terminal coil, with the C-terminal coil interacting with the C-terminal coil of NDUFS4 (Padavannil2022The).

The secondary structure of NDUFV3 involves these coils and helices, contributing to its role in complex I. The tertiary structure is characterized by the folding of these elements, allowing NDUFV3 to bind in the cleft between NDUFV1 and NDUFV2 (Padavannil2022The). The quaternary structure involves its incorporation into complex I, where it is located at the tip of the mitochondrial matrix-sided N-module, near the NADH binding site (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification).

NDUFV3-L has an additional 423 amino acid residues on its N-terminus, predicted to be disordered, and includes a string of 10 serine residues, with three identified as phosphorylated, indicating its role as a mitochondrial phosphoprotein (Padavannil2022The). The isoforms are produced through alternative splicing, with NDUFV3-L resulting from the gain of an additional exon (Dibley2016A).

## Function
The NDUFV3 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is the first enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex is essential for ATP production as it facilitates electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane necessary for ATP synthesis (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification; Dibley2016A). NDUFV3 exists in two isoforms, NDUFV3-S (short) and NDUFV3-L (long), which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. NDUFV3-S is predominantly found in heart and skeletal muscle, while NDUFV3-L is more prevalent in liver, brain, and lung tissues (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification).

The NDUFV3 subunit is located at the tip of the mitochondrial matrix-sided N-module of complex I, near the NADH binding site, suggesting its role in modulating substrate affinity and potentially influencing the efficiency of NADH oxidation (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification). Although NDUFV3 is not directly involved in enzyme catalysis, it may play a regulatory role in complex I assembly and function, affecting mitochondrial efficiency and energy production in healthy human cells (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification; Dibley2016A). The presence of multiple phosphorylation sites on the long isoform, NDUFV3-L, adds complexity to the regulation of complex I activity (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The NDUFV3 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is crucial for cellular energy production. Mutations or alterations in NDUFV3 can lead to mitochondrial disorders, impacting energy production and potentially contributing to conditions such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. These disorders are characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation, which can result in a range of clinical symptoms, including neurological and muscular dysfunctions (de1997Molecular).

The NDUFV3 gene produces two isoforms, NDUFV3-S and NDUFV3-L, through alternative splicing. These isoforms are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with NDUFV3-S found in heart and skeletal muscle, and NDUFV3-L in liver and brain. The presence of these isoforms correlates with changes in the kinetic parameters of complex I, particularly substrate affinity, suggesting a potential regulatory role. However, knockout studies in HEK293T cells have shown that the absence of NDUFV3 does not significantly affect cellular oxygen consumption, indicating that NDUFV3 may not be critical for the basic function of complex I (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification; Dibley2016A).

Despite the structural presence of NDUFV3 in complex I, its exact functional role and clinical significance remain largely unexplored, necessitating further research to understand its impact on mitochondrial diseases (GuerreroCastillo2017Identification).

## Interactions
NDUFV3 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain. It is part of the N module, which is essential for electron entry into complex I. This module includes other subunits such as NDUFS1, NDUFV1, and NDUFV2, and forms a 300 kDa intermediate that eventually assembles with other intermediates to form mature complex I (Mckenzie2010Assembly). 

Phosphoproteomic analysis has identified phosphorylation sites on NDUFV3 at S98 and S470, suggesting that its phosphorylation may play a role in the regulation of mitochondrial functions and processes. This phosphorylation is part of a broader network of protein-protein interactions among mitochondrial phosphoproteins, particularly those involved in metabolic pathways and mitochondrial organization (Sunitha2020Human).

In the context of complex I deficiency, studies have shown that NDUFV3 levels are significantly reduced in mitochondria deficient in the NDUFS4 subunit. This reduction is associated with decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates and impaired respiratory capacities, highlighting the importance of NDUFV3 in maintaining mitochondrial function and respiratory electron transport (Gella2020Mitochondrial; Gella2019Mitochondrial).
