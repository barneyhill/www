# DENND2B

## Overview
DENND2B is a gene that encodes the protein DENN domain containing 2B, also known as St5, which is involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking. This protein is particularly significant in multiciliated cells (MCCs), where it plays a crucial role in axonemogenesis, the process of axoneme extension following basal body docking. DENN domain containing 2B is associated with actin-based structures and is essential for the proper assembly of subapical actin foci, contributing to the maintenance of basal body planar polarity and the elongation of ciliary axonemes. The protein's regulatory function on Cp110 levels is vital for MCC ciliogenesis, and its disruption is linked to ciliopathies and related symptoms such as chronic otitis media and recurrent respiratory infections. Additionally, DENND2B is implicated in various diseases, including epithelial cancers and inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Tu2017Highcontent; Syed2024Advances).

## Function
DENND2B, also known as St5, is a protein involved in intracellular signaling and membrane trafficking, particularly in multiciliated cells (MCCs). It plays a crucial role in axonemogenesis, the process of axoneme extension following basal body docking. DENND2B is associated with actin-based structures and is essential for the proper assembly of subapical actin foci in MCCs. The protein's function is critical for maintaining basal body planar polarity and facilitating the elongation of ciliary axonemes from docked basal bodies. Disruption of DENND2B, such as through knockdown experiments, leads to increased levels of Cp110 at basal bodies, indicating that DENND2B regulates Cp110 levels, which is vital for MCC ciliogenesis (Tu2017Highcontent).

DENND2B is also implicated in actin-related activities necessary for MCC development and function. Its role in these processes suggests that it may be linked to human ciliopathies, as it has been associated with birth defect syndromes that exhibit symptoms similar to ciliopathies, including chronic otitis media and recurrent respiratory infections (Tu2017Highcontent). The protein's activity in these cellular processes highlights its importance in maintaining proper cellular and organismal function.

## Clinical Significance
DENND2B has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking. In cancer, particularly epithelial cancers, DENND2B's activation of Rab13 enhances the invasive potential of cancer cells. Disrupting this signaling axis can impair the spread and migratory capacity of aggressive epithelial cancer cells, suggesting that DENND2B could be a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Syed2024Advances). Additionally, alterations in DENND2B expression have been associated with familial thyroid cancer, where changes in its structure can lead to uncontrolled cell growth, indicating its potential role in cancer development (Tous2023Identification).

DENND2B is also identified as a novel biomarker for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is overexpressed in IBD, suggesting a role in inflammation and healing. The gene's involvement in MAPK signaling pathways may influence the disease's pathogenesis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in IBD (Syed2024Advances). The identification of DENND2B as a significant biomarker in IBD highlights its potential in early detection and personalized treatment approaches (Syed2024Advances). Further research is needed to fully understand its role in these diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
DENND2B, also known as St5, plays a crucial role in multiciliated cell (MCC) development, particularly in axonemogenesis following basal body docking. It is associated with actin-based structures and is essential for the assembly of subapical actin foci in MCCs. Knockdown of DENND2B disrupts basal body planar polarity and suppresses the elongation of ciliary axonemes from docked basal bodies, indicating its involvement in MCC axoneme assembly. This disruption is linked to increased levels of Cp110 at basal bodies, suggesting that DENND2B acts as a novel regulator of Cp110 levels, which is critical for MCC ciliogenesis. Despite these effects, DENND2B knockdown does not impact the recruitment of the IFT-B subunit Ift20 or the localization of Fak and Ttbk2, proteins known to interact with Cp110 and actin (Tu2017Highcontent).

The role of DENND2B in regulating Cp110 levels highlights its potential involvement in human ciliopathies and its relevance to airway diseases, as Cp110 expression levels are altered in conditions like chronic rhinosinusitis (Tu2017Highcontent). However, specific physical interactions of DENND2B with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context.
