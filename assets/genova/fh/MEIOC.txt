# MEIOC

## Overview
The MEIOC gene encodes a protein known as meiosis specific with coiled-coil domain, which plays a pivotal role in the meiotic process, a critical phase of sexual reproduction. This protein is categorized as a coiled-coil domain-containing protein and is specifically expressed in germ cells during meiotic prophase I. MEIOC is essential for the stabilization of meiotic mRNAs, a function that is crucial for the proper initiation and progression of meiosis. The protein interacts with YTHDC2, an RNA helicase, to form a complex that stabilizes meiotic mRNAs, thereby ensuring the correct progression of meiosis. This interaction is independent of RNA presence and involves the conserved coiled-coil domain of MEIOC, highlighting its structural and functional significance (Soh2017Meioc; Abby2016Implementation). The absence of MEIOC results in meiotic defects, underscoring its necessity for successful meiosis completion (Abby2016Implementation).

## Function
The MEIOC gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the meiotic process, which is essential for sexual reproduction and fertility. MEIOC is specifically expressed in germ cells during meiotic prophase I and is crucial for the stabilization of meiotic mRNAs, ensuring proper initiation and progression of meiosis (Abby2016Implementation). The protein interacts with YTHDC2, an RNA helicase, to stabilize meiotic mRNAs in the testis, a process that is independent of RNA presence and involves the conserved coiled-coil domain of MEIOC (Abby2016Implementation). This interaction is vital for maintaining the stability of meiotic transcripts, which is necessary for the proper progression of meiosis (Abby2016Implementation).

MEIOC is localized to the cytoplasmic compartment of meiocytes and is present at the onset of meiosis, indicating its ongoing role in maintaining meiotic mRNA stability (Abby2016Implementation). The absence of MEIOC leads to meiotic defects, such as abnormal metaphases, indicating its necessity for meiosis completion (Abby2016Implementation). MEIOC's role is distinct from other meiosis regulators like STRA8, as it remains present throughout meiotic prophase I, highlighting its importance in the meiotic program (Abby2016Implementation).

## Interactions
MEIOC is known to physically interact with YTHDC2, an RNA helicase involved in the regulation of the meiotic cell cycle in mice. This interaction has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments, suggesting that MEIOC and YTHDC2 form a complex that may regulate mRNA post-transcriptionally. The MEIOC/YTHDC2 complex is thought to destabilize target mRNAs associated with the mitotic cell cycle, facilitating the transition to a meiotic cell cycle program (Soh2017Meioc).

The MEIOC/YTHDC2 complex is crucial for maintaining an extended meiotic prophase I, preventing premature progression to metaphase. This interaction is essential for the proper regulation of germ cell development and meiotic progression, as evidenced by the similar meiotic phenotypes observed in YTHDC2 and MEIOC mutants (Jain2018ketu).

MEIOC's interaction with YTHDC2 is not dependent on MEIOC for YTHDC2 expression, indicating a specific functional collaboration rather than a regulatory dependency (Soh2017Meioc). The MEIOC/YTHDC2 complex is analogous to the BAM/BGCN complex in Drosophila, suggesting a conserved mechanism across species for regulating germline development (Soh2017Meioc).
