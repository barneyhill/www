# IFITM3

## Overview
Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a gene that encodes a small, type II transmembrane protein involved in the immune response against viral infections. The IFITM3 protein is a critical component of the host's antiviral defense, primarily by inhibiting viral entry into host cells. It achieves this by disrupting viral membrane fusion within endosomes and lysosomes, thereby preventing viral replication and spread. The protein is characterized by its structural features, including a long C-terminal α-helix and an amphipathic helix crucial for its antiviral activity (Ling2016Combined; Chesarino2017IFITM). Post-translational modifications, such as S-palmitoylation, are essential for its function, enhancing membrane interactions and stabilizing its structure (Garst2021SiteSpecific; Chesarino2017IFITM). IFITM3 also plays a role in regulating immune cell functions and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, influencing the severity of viral infections (Clement2022IFITM3; Friedlová2022IFITM). Genetic variations in IFITM3, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, have been linked to differences in susceptibility and severity of viral infections, including influenza and COVID-19 (Hachim2020InterferonInduced; Allen2017SNPmediated).

## Structure
The IFITM3 protein is a small, 133-residue antiviral protein characterized by its involvement in the immune response against viral infections. Structurally, IFITM3 is known to have a type II transmembrane topology, featuring a long C-terminal α-helix spanning residues A96 to A131, which traverses the micelles, and two short intramembrane α-helices in the first predicted hydrophobic segment (Ling2016Combined). These short helices are partially buried in the micelles and do not possess transmembrane properties (Ling2016Combined).

A key structural feature of IFITM3 is an amphipathic helix located within a hydrophobic domain, which is crucial for its antiviral activity (Chesarino2017IFITM). This helix, comprising amino acids 59-68, is characterized by a hydrophobic face and a primarily hydrophilic face, suggesting its role in altering or stabilizing membrane shape (Chesarino2017IFITM).

Post-translational modifications are significant for IFITM3's function. S-palmitoylation at cysteine residues C71, C72, and C105 is essential for its antiviral activity, with C72 being the most critical site (Garst2021SiteSpecific; Chesarino2017IFITM). These modifications enhance membrane interactions and stabilize the amphipathic helix, contributing to the protein's antiviral mechanism (Garst2021SiteSpecific; Chesarino2017IFITM).

## Function
The IFITM3 protein is a critical component of the immune response, primarily known for its role in inhibiting viral entry into host cells. It is part of the interferon-inducible transmembrane protein family and is active in endosomes and lysosomes, where it disrupts viral membrane fusion, thereby limiting viral replication and spread (Feeley2011IFITM3; Sun2016Constitutively). IFITM3 is essential for protecting cells from a variety of viruses, including influenza A, by preventing the emergence of viral genomes from the endosomal pathway and inhibiting the transfer of viral contents into the host cell cytosol (Feeley2011IFITM3).

Beyond its antiviral functions, IFITM3 is involved in regulating immune cell functions. In T cells, it is part of T-cell receptor signaling, while in B cells, it plays a role in activation and affinity maturation, impacting antibody production (Friedlová2022IFITM). IFITM3 also regulates pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in dendritic cells, influencing the severity of viral infections (Clement2022IFITM3). The protein's activity is modulated by posttranslational modifications, which affect its localization and function within the cell (Friedlová2022IFITM).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IFITM3 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of viral infections. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs34481144 in the IFITM3 promoter is associated with severe influenza outcomes. The risk allele (A) of this SNP is linked to lower IFITM3 expression, reduced binding of the transcription factor IRF3, and increased binding of the inhibitory factor CTCF, which collectively contribute to a higher risk of severe influenza (Allen2017SNPmediated). This SNP also affects the methylation status of the IFITM3 promoter, influencing CD8+ T-cell abundance and potentially impacting the immune response to influenza (Allen2017SNPmediated).

Another SNP, rs12252, has been associated with severe influenza outcomes, particularly in East Asian populations. The homozygous CC genotype of this SNP is linked to impaired IFITM3 function, leading to increased viral replication and severe disease (Lee2017IFITM3). In the context of COVID-19, IFITM3 expression is upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, and polymorphisms like rs12252-C/C have been linked to increased disease severity (Hachim2020InterferonInduced). These findings underscore the role of IFITM3 in modulating susceptibility and severity of viral infections.

## Interactions
IFITM3 interacts with several proteins that influence its antiviral activity. A notable interaction is with vesicle membrane protein associated protein A (VAPA), which IFITM3 disrupts to prevent VAPA's association with oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP). This disruption affects intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, leading to increased endosomal cholesterol and decreased membrane fluidity, thereby inhibiting viral fusion (Ren2020Current; Smith2014IFITM).

IFITM3 also forms oligomers, a process crucial for its antiviral function. The GxxxG motif, particularly glycine-95, is essential for this oligomerization. Mutations at this site, such as G95L, impair oligomerization and reduce antiviral activity. This oligomerization is thought to increase membrane rigidity, contributing to the inhibition of virus-cell fusion (Rahman2020Homologyguided).

Additionally, IFITM3 interacts with other IFITM family members, such as IFITM1 and IFITM2, and with host proteins like ZMPSTE24, which are important for its antiviral effects (Rahman2020Homologyguided). These interactions may enhance the antiviral protection provided by IFITM3, highlighting its role in the immune response against viral infections.
