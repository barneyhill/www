# ZFAND2B

## Overview
ZFAND2B is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger AN1-type containing 2B, also known as AIRAPL, which is a proteostasis factor involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis. AIRAPL plays a significant role in regulating the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) pathway by modulating the translocation and degradation of the IGF1 receptor, thereby influencing cellular function and longevity (SantiagoFernández2016Proteostasis). The protein is implicated in processes such as protein folding, energy metabolism, and synaptic function, with its activity being crucial for normal cellular operations and organismal health (Klüver2024Multiomic). Additionally, ZFAND2B has been associated with clinical conditions, including myeloid transformation and cancer, highlighting its potential significance in disease contexts (Osorio2015Loss). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the diverse roles and mechanisms of ZFAND2B in human health and disease.

## Function
The ZFAND2B gene encodes the proteostasis factor AIRAPL, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular proteostasis, a process essential for cellular function and longevity. AIRAPL is involved in the regulation of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) pathway by controlling the translocation and degradation of the IGF1 receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum. This regulation is important for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing abnormal cell proliferation (SantiagoFernández2016Proteostasis). In healthy cells, AIRAPL contributes to cellular homeostasis by ensuring proper protein folding and degradation, which is vital for organismal health and longevity (Klüver2024Multiomic).

In Zfand2b knockout mice, the absence of this gene leads to a reduced lifespan and alterations in energy pathways and metabolism, indicating its involvement in energy metabolism and synaptic function. The upregulation of proteins related to the chaperone complex and glycolytic processes, along with the downregulation of proteins associated with mRNA splicing and synaptic transmission, suggests that ZFAND2B is involved in processes related to protein folding and energy metabolism (Klüver2024Multiomic). The gene's activity in the cytoplasm may also play a role in modulating inflammatory responses and apoptosis, although specific details in healthy human cells are not fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The ZFAND2B gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to its role in myeloid transformation and cancer. The loss of ZFAND2B in mice has been shown to lead to deregulation of IGF-1 signaling, which contributes to myeloid transformation, a process that can lead to hematological malignancies (Osorio2015Loss). This suggests that alterations in ZFAND2B expression or function may be linked to similar processes in humans.

In the context of genetic mutations, a study identified a missense mutation in the ZFAND2B gene, which accounts for about 2% of genetic variance. However, this specific mutation does not affect the protein's function or structure, indicating that its clinical significance might be limited or influenced by other mutations (Lee2023Identification).

Additionally, ZFAND2B has been listed among the top significantly mutated genes in pulmonary carcinoid tumors, although the specific clinical implications of these mutations remain unclear (Asiedu2018Pathways). The involvement of ZFAND2B in these conditions highlights its potential significance in cancer biology, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and impact.
