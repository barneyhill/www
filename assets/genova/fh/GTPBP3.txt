# GTPBP3

## Overview
GTPBP3 is a human gene that encodes the mitochondrial GTP binding protein 3, a GTPase enzyme involved in the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs. This protein plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of 5-taurinomethyluridine (m5U) at the wobble position of mitochondrial tRNAs, a modification essential for accurate mitochondrial protein synthesis and efficient respiratory chain function (Peng2021The). The GTP binding protein 3 is characterized by its GTPase activity, which is crucial for its function in tRNA modification, and it forms homodimers in solution, a feature conserved among eukaryotic homologues (Villarroya2008Characterization). Mutations in the GTPBP3 gene are linked to Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 23 (COXPD23), a mitochondrial disorder that manifests with symptoms such as lactic acidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, underscoring the gene's importance in mitochondrial health and cellular energy production (Kopajtich2014Mutations; Zhang2023Pathogenicity).

## Structure
The human GTPBP3 protein is a mitochondrial GTP-binding protein involved in tRNA modification. It consists of 492 amino acids and includes an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, which is cleaved upon import into mitochondria, resulting in a mature form (Peng2021The). The protein contains a canonical G domain with typical G1 to G4 motifs for GTP binding and hydrolysis (Villarroya2008Characterization). The G domain is crucial for its GTPase activity, although it shows low catalytic efficiency compared to its bacterial homologue, MnmE (Villarroya2008Characterization; Peng2021The).

GTPBP3 forms homodimers in solution, a property that is conserved among eukaryotic MnmE homologues (Villarroya2008Characterization). The dimerization is mediated by the N-terminal domain and is independent of nucleotides and potassium, suggesting a structural role in constructing the binding site for tetrahydrofolate (THF) (Villarroya2008Characterization). The protein can form high-molecular-mass complexes through disulfide bridges, which resolve into dimers in the presence of reducing agents (Villarroya2008Characterization).

Alternative splicing of GTPBP3 results in multiple isoforms, with some variants lacking specific exons that may impact the protein's functionality (Villarroya2008Characterization). These isoforms include differences in the G domain length, yet they exhibit similar biochemical properties in vitro (Villarroya2008Characterization).

## Function
The human gene GTPBP3 encodes a GTPase enzyme that plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, particularly in the modification of mitochondrial tRNAs. GTPBP3 is involved in the biosynthesis of 5-taurinomethyluridine (m5U) at the wobble position 34 of mitochondrial tRNAs, a modification essential for accurate and efficient protein synthesis within mitochondria (Peng2021The). This modification enhances the precision of codon-anticodon interactions, crucial for the proper decoding of mitochondrial mRNAs (Peng2021The).

GTPBP3's activity is vital for maintaining mitochondrial respiratory chain efficiency, impacting cellular energy production and overall organismal health. The protein exhibits intrinsic GTPase activity, which is significantly higher in its mature form compared to its precursor, indicating its active role in GTP hydrolysis (Peng2021The). This GTPase activity is crucial for its function in tRNA modification, as evidenced by the inability of inactive mutants to support yeast growth under respiratory conditions (Peng2021The).

GTPBP3 is localized in mitochondria, where it forms dimers and interacts with hMTO1, a partnership necessary for its function in tRNA modification (Peng2021The). Defects in GTPBP3 can lead to mitochondrial diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular energy production (Peng2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GTPBP3 gene are associated with Combined Oxidative Phosphorylation Deficiency 23 (COXPD23), a mitochondrial disorder characterized by lactic acidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and encephalopathy. This condition typically presents in infancy and affects organs with high energy demands, such as the brain, heart, and liver (Kopajtich2014Mutations; Zhang2023Pathogenicity). Clinical features of COXPD23 include hyperlactatemia, developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, and abnormal visual development (Yan2021Novel; Zhang2023Pathogenicity).

The GTPBP3 gene is crucial for the post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNA, specifically in the synthesis of 5-taurinomethyluridine (τm5U). Defects in this process lead to mitochondrial translation defects and reduced activity of respiratory chain complexes, contributing to the clinical manifestations of COXPD23 (Kopajtich2014Mutations; Peng2021The). Mutations in GTPBP3 can result in decreased protein levels due to proteasome-dependent degradation, impairing the gene's GTPase activity essential for its function (Peng2021The).

The severity of the disease varies, with some cases presenting neonatal onset and early mortality, while others have milder symptoms and longer survival (Yan2021Novel; Kopajtich2014Mutations).

## Interactions
GTPBP3 is known to interact with the mitochondrial protein MTO1, forming a complex essential for the modification of mitochondrial tRNA at the wobble position 34. This interaction is crucial for the biosynthesis of 5-taurinomethyluridine (m5U) in mitochondrial tRNAs, which is necessary for accurate mitochondrial mRNA decoding (Peng2021The). The interaction between GTPBP3 and MTO1 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells, where GTPBP3-Myc was shown to coprecipitate with MTO1-FLAG, indicating a physical interaction in vivo (Peng2021The).

GTPBP3 also forms homodimers, a property that is mediated by its N-terminal domain. This dimerization occurs independently of guanine nucleotides and is influenced by ionic strength and buffer conditions (Villarroya2008Characterization). The dimerization of GTPBP3 is similar to its bacterial homologue MnmE, although GTPBP3 does not require potassium for this process (Villarroya2008Characterization).

Mutations in GTPBP3 can disrupt its interactions and lead to structural instability, affecting its function in tRNA modification and mitochondrial activity. These mutations can impair the protein's stability and GTPase activity, which are critical for its role in mitochondrial function (Peng2021The).
