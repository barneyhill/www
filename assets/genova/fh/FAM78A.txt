# FAM78A

## Overview
FAM78A is a gene that encodes the protein family with sequence similarity 78 member A, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, where it plays a role in tumor progression and patient prognosis. FAM78A is associated with DNA methylation patterns in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, contributing to the cancer positive CpGI methylator phenotype (CIMP) that correlates with aggressive tumor behavior. Additionally, its expression is influenced by FoxO signaling in cardiac tissue during cancer cachexia, highlighting its potential role in muscle function. In pancreatic cancer, FAM78A is part of a gene signature used to predict patient survival, underscoring its significance in cancer biology (Shum2015Cardiac; Rydzanicz2013Genomics; Wu2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
FAM78A has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), FAM78A is part of a cancer positive CpGI methylator phenotype (CIMP) characterized by DNA hypermethylation. This methylation profile is associated with more aggressive tumor phenotypes and poorer patient outcomes. The presence of CIMP in non-cancerous renal tissues suggests that these alterations may occur in a precancerous stage, influencing tumor behavior (Rydzanicz2013Genomics).

In the context of cancer cachexia, a condition often associated with cancer, FAM78A is among the downregulated genes in cardiac tissue, with its expression being FoxO dependent. This suggests a role in the molecular response of cardiac muscles to cancer cachexia, potentially affecting muscle function and health (Shum2015Cardiac).

In pancreatic cancer, FAM78A is included in a nine-gene signature developed to predict overall survival. Although the specific role of FAM78A in this context is not detailed, its inclusion in the prognostic signature indicates its potential relevance in cancer progression and patient prognosis (Wu2019Identification).
