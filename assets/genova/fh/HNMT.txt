# HNMT

## Overview
The HNMT gene encodes the enzyme histamine N-methyltransferase, which is a critical component in the metabolic pathway responsible for the inactivation of histamine, a biogenic amine involved in numerous physiological processes, including neurotransmission, gastric acid secretion, and immune response. As a methyltransferase, the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to histamine, converting it into N-methylhistamine, thereby regulating histamine levels in various tissues, particularly in the central nervous system (Horton2001Two; Yoshikawa2019Histamine). The HNMT gene is located on chromosome 2q22.1 and is expressed in several brain regions, where it plays a pivotal role in maintaining histamine homeostasis (Yoshikawa2019Histamine; Schwelberger2017Mapping). Variations in the HNMT gene, including polymorphisms and mutations, have been associated with altered enzyme activity and susceptibility to neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Ledesma2008The; Heidari2015Mutations).

## Structure
Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) is a monomeric protein composed of 292 amino acids with a molecular weight of 33 kDa (Yoshikawa2019Histamine; Schwelberger2017Mapping). The primary structure includes a single polypeptide chain, and the protein is encoded by the HNMT gene located on chromosome 2q22.1 (Schwelberger2017Mapping). 

The secondary structure of HNMT features a two-domain architecture. The larger N-terminal domain exhibits a classic methyltransferase fold, which includes an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) binding motif (Schwelberger2017Mapping). The tertiary structure is characterized by a histamine-binding domain that includes key amino acids such as Tyr-15, Phe-19, Phe-22, Glu-28, and others, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Jiménez2023Drug). 

HNMT does not form a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomeric protein (Schwelberger2017Mapping). The enzyme is responsible for the methylation of histamine, a process that involves the transfer of a methyl group from SAM to histamine, forming N-methylhistamine (Horton2001Two). The protein's activity and stability can be influenced by polymorphic variants, such as Thr105 and Ile105, which differ in enzymatic activity and thermal stability (Horton2001Two).

## Function
Histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the inactivation of histamine, a neurotransmitter involved in various physiological functions. HNMT catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to histamine, resulting in the formation of N-methylhistamine and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (Horton2001Two; Yoshikawa2019Histamine). This methylation process is essential for regulating histamine levels in tissues, particularly in the central nervous system (CNS), where HNMT is the sole enzyme responsible for histamine inactivation (Horton2001Two; Oroszi2005Thr105Ile).

HNMT is widely expressed in the CNS, including regions such as the frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, and cerebellar cortices, and is found in both neurons and glial cells (Yoshikawa2019Histamine). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining histamine homeostasis, preventing excessive histamine accumulation, which could lead to various disorders (Yoshikawa2019Histamine). In the absence of HNMT, as seen in knockout mice, increased brain histamine concentrations can lead to aggressive behaviors and dysregulated sleep-wake cycles, highlighting its role in modulating these physiological processes (Naganuma2017Histamine). HNMT's function is vital for the regulation of histaminergic neurotransmission and the termination of histamine's effects in the brain (Yoshikawa2019Histamine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, most notably nonsyndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability (NS ARID). Specific mutations, such as p.Gly60Asp and p.Leu208Pro, have been identified in consanguineous families and are associated with disrupted enzymatic activity and reduced protein stability, leading to decreased inactivation of histamine in the central nervous system (Heidari2015Mutations). These mutations affect the enzyme's ability to bind its cofactor, S-adenosylmethionine, and result in protein misfolding and aggregation (Heidari2015Mutations).

The p.Leu208Pro mutation, in particular, is considered potentially pathogenic due to its rarity and predicted impact on protein structure (Heidari2015Mutations). In addition to intellectual disability, HNMT mutations have been associated with other symptoms such as aggression, delayed speech, autism, and sleep disturbances, as seen in a case of a 23-year-old male with a homozygous mutation in the HNMT gene (Verhoeven2020Adult).

Alterations in HNMT expression and activity have also been linked to other conditions, including essential tremor and Parkinson's disease, where specific polymorphisms like Thr105Ile are associated with altered enzyme activity and disease susceptibility (Ledesma2008The; Yoshikawa2019Histamine).
