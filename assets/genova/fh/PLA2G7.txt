# PLA2G7

## Overview
The PLA2G7 gene encodes the enzyme lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), also known as platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH). This enzyme is a member of the phospholipase A2 superfamily and is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of oxidized phospholipids in low-density lipoproteins (LDL), playing a critical role in lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes (Stafforini2015Plasma; Murakami2020Updating). Lp-PLA2 is synthesized by macrophages and circulates in the bloodstream, predominantly bound to LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Stafforini2015Plasma). The enzyme's activity is calcium-independent and is not acutely regulated, which distinguishes it from other phospholipases (Stafforini2015Plasma). PLA2G7 has been implicated in various physiological and pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer, due to its role in modulating inflammatory responses and lipid levels (Khan2023The; Vainio2011Phospholipase).

## Structure
The PLA2G7 gene encodes the enzyme lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), also known as PAF-acetylhydrolase. This enzyme is a 45 kDa protein that is primarily synthesized by macrophages and circulates in the bloodstream bound to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Stafforini2015Plasma; Murakami2020Updating). The primary structure of Lp-PLA2 includes a unique GXSXG motif characteristic of serine esterases, with a catalytic triad composed of serine (S273), aspartate (D296), and histidine (H351) (Stafforini2015Plasma). 

The enzyme features a classic lipase/esterase α/β hydrolase fold, which is common among enzymes in the phospholipase A2 superfamily (Cao2011LipoproteinAssociated). Specific residues, such as W115 and L116, are crucial for its interaction with lipid membranes, facilitating its binding to lipoproteins (Cao2011LipoproteinAssociated). The enzyme's activity is calcium-independent, and it is not acutely regulated, functioning independently of calcium ions (Stafforini2015Plasma). 

Lp-PLA2 is susceptible to oxidative inactivation, particularly by peroxynitrite, which affects residues such as M117, Y307, and Y335, impacting its function in oxidative stress environments (Stafforini2015Plasma). The enzyme's interaction with LDL involves a 160-amino acid domain of apoB-100, while its binding to HDL requires a carboxyl terminal domain (Stafforini2015Plasma).

## Function
PLA2G7, also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of oxidized phospholipids in low-density lipoproteins (LDL). This activity is crucial in regulating oxidized lipid levels, which can impact inflammatory and atherosclerotic processes in the body (Murakami2020Updating). The enzyme is secreted by macrophages and mast cells and is primarily found in human plasma, where it is bound to LDL (Murakami2020Updating).

In healthy human cells, PLA2G7 is involved in the metabolism of platelet-activating factor (PAF), a phospholipid that plays a role in inflammation and cancer. The enzyme's activity is associated with the regulation of lipid levels, particularly lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which is involved in cell migration and metastasis (Vainio2011Phospholipase). PLA2G7's function in lipid metabolism is linked to its role in various physiological and pathological conditions, including cardiovascular health and cancer (Khan2023The).

PLA2G7 is also implicated in cancer biology, where its expression is associated with aggressive forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer, and it influences processes like cell migration and invasion (Vainio2011Phospholipase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLA2G7 gene, which encodes lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), have been linked to several cardiovascular and inflammatory conditions. The V279F mutation is particularly significant in the Japanese population, where it is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases. This mutation leads to a loss of enzyme activity, contributing to higher levels of oxidized LDL, a known risk factor for atherosclerosis (Karasawa2015Naturally; Miwa2009Association).

In the Chinese Han population, polymorphisms in PLA2G7, such as rs13210554, have been associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction. The T allele of this polymorphism is more frequent in myocardial infarction patients, suggesting a genetic predisposition to these conditions (Hou2008Associations).

Epigenetic changes, such as hypomethylation of the PLA2G7 gene, have been linked to increased expression of Lp-PLA2, contributing to plaque vulnerability and progression of atherosclerosis. This suggests that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in regulating the gene's expression and its impact on cardiovascular health (Li2021DNA).

The V279F mutation is also associated with asthma severity in the Japanese population, although its prevalence and impact vary across studies (Karasawa2015Naturally).

## Interactions
PLA2G7, also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), interacts primarily with lipoproteins in human plasma. It forms complexes with low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL), with 70-80% of its activity associated with LDL and 20-30% with HDL (Kono2019Plateletactivating; Stafforini2015Plasma). The interaction with LDL is facilitated by specific structural features of PLA2G7, including residues Trp115, Leu116, and Tyr205, which are crucial for binding (Stafforini1999Molecular; Kono2019Plateletactivating). The carboxyl terminal domain of PLA2G7 is necessary for its association with HDL (Stafforini2015Plasma).

PLA2G7 also plays a role in the regulation of inflammatory responses by degrading platelet-activating factor (PAF) and oxidized phospholipids, which are involved in various disease processes (Tjoelker1995Plasma). In the context of breast cancer, particularly in BRCA1 mutant cases, PLA2G7 interacts with the Wnt signaling pathway. Silencing PLA2G7 leads to altered β-catenin distribution, suggesting a regulatory role in the pathway (Liao2023PLA2G7PAFAH). These interactions highlight the enzyme's involvement in both lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes.
