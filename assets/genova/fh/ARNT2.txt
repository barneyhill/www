# ARNT2

## Overview
The ARNT2 gene encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2, a transcription factor belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in response to environmental and developmental signals. ARNT2 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and developing kidney, where it is involved in critical processes such as neurodevelopment and the differentiation of secretory neurons in the hypothalamus (Hao2013Reciprocal; Michaud2000ARNT2). The protein functions by forming heterodimers with other bHLH/PAS proteins, such as Single Minded 1 (Sim1) and Neuronal PAS 4 (NPAS4), to modulate transcriptional activities (Hao2013Reciprocal). Mutations in the ARNT2 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including congenital brain malformation syndromes and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in human health (Di2015Genetic; Webb2013ARNT2).

## Structure
The ARNT2 protein is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors. It is characterized by a bHLH domain, which is involved in DNA binding and dimerization, and PAS domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Kolonko2019bHLH–PAS; Hirose1996cDNA). The primary structure of ARNT2 consists of 712 amino acids, with significant sequence identity to the ARNT protein, particularly in the bHLH and PAS domains (Hirose1996cDNA). The bHLH domain is crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator, while the PAS domains contribute to the formation of heterodimers with other proteins, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Kolonko2019bHLH–PAS; Hirose1996cDNA).

ARNT2 can form heterodimers with other bHLH/PAS proteins, which is essential for its role in gene regulation (Hirose1996cDNA). The protein's quaternary structure involves these heterodimeric interactions, which are important for recognizing and binding specific DNA sequences (Hirose1996cDNA). Splice variants of ARNT2 have been identified, which may lead to different isoforms with distinct functions (Powell2002Identification). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
ARNT2 (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in response to environmental signals. It is part of the basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH/PAS) family of transcription factors, which are involved in various biological processes, including development, homeostasis, and stress response (Hao2013Reciprocal). ARNT2 is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and developing kidney, suggesting its involvement in specific neuronal functions and brain development (Hao2013Reciprocal).

In healthy cells, ARNT2 forms heterodimers with other bHLH/PAS proteins, such as Single Minded 1 (Sim1) and Neuronal PAS 4 (NPAS4), to regulate transcriptional activities (Hao2013Reciprocal). It is particularly important for the development of secretory neurons in the hypothalamus, where it acts as a dimerization partner for Sim1, facilitating the terminal differentiation of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) (Hosoya2001Defective; Michaud2000ARNT2). ARNT2's role in these processes is critical, as evidenced by the impaired hypothalamic development observed in ARNT2-null mice (Hao2013Reciprocal). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences the expression of genes involved in neurodevelopment and other cellular responses (Aitola2003Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARNT2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A specific mutation, c.1374_1375dupTC, in ARNT2 is associated with a congenital brain malformation syndrome characterized by hypopituitarism, post-natal microcephaly, visual and renal anomalies. This mutation leads to a frameshift at residue p.Tyr459, resulting in a premature termination codon and likely triggering nonsense-mediated decay, significantly reducing ARNT2 mRNA and protein levels (Webb2013ARNT2). Affected individuals exhibit severe phenotypes, including developmental anomalies and potentially premature death (Webb2013ARNT2).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, a genetic variant, rs17225178, in the ARNT2 gene has been significantly associated with Asperger Syndrome, a condition on the autism spectrum. This variant is linked to modifications in transcription factor binding sites and chromatin regulatory regions in neural cells, suggesting a role in the genetic architecture of autism spectrum conditions (Di2015Genetic).

Additionally, ARNT2 mutations have been implicated in metabolic disorders. A missense mutation, R74C, in Arnt2 in mice leads to hyperphagic obesity, diabetes, and hepatic steatosis, indicating its role in energy balance and feeding behavior regulation (Turer2018A).

## Interactions
ARNT2 (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2) is a transcription factor that participates in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and PAS domains. ARNT2 can heterodimerize with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to form DNA-binding complexes. These interactions are ligand-dependent, with ARNT2 effectively competing with ARNT for dimerization with AHR when in excess (Dougherty2007Analysis). Despite its ability to form complexes with AHR in vitro, ARNT2 does not complement AHR-mediated signaling in ARNT-deficient cell lines as effectively as ARNT (Dougherty2007Analysis).

ARNT2 also interacts with NPAS4, another bHLH/PAS transcription factor. The interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activity of the NPAS4/ARNT2 complex, which regulates genes involved in neuronal function. Variants in NPAS4, such as F147S, disrupt dimerization with ARNT2, leading to a loss of function (Bersten2014Human).

Additionally, ARNT2 forms dimers with SIM1 and SIM2 proteins, which are involved in regulating energy homeostasis. Certain variants of SIM1 and SIM2 show impaired dimerization with ARNT2, affecting their ability to regulate gene expression (Sullivan2014Characterization).
