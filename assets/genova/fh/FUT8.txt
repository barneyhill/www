# FUT8

## Overview
FUT8 is a gene that encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 8, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the core fucosylation of N-glycans. This enzyme is categorized as a glycosyltransferase and is essential for the addition of fucose to the innermost N-acetylglucosamine residue of N-linked glycans, forming an α1,6-linkage. The core fucosylation process is crucial for various cellular functions, including the modulation of growth factor receptor activity, cell adhesion, and migration. The FUT8 protein is characterized by a multi-domain structure, including a catalytic domain with a GT-B fold and a unique SH3 domain, which is vital for substrate recognition and enzymatic activity (Tomida2020The; GarcíaGarcía2020Structural). Dysregulation of FUT8 has been implicated in several diseases, including congenital disorders of glycosylation and various cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Liang2022Fucosyltransferase; Ng2020Expanding).

## Structure
The FUT8 protein, also known as α1,6-fucosyltransferase, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein involved in core fucosylation of N-glycans. It consists of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The catalytic domain includes three conserved peptidic consensus sequences (motifs I, II, and III) located in the Rossmann fold, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Javaud2000Ancestral; Juliant2014The).

The tertiary structure of FUT8 reveals a multi-domain organization, including a coiled-coil domain, a catalytic domain with a GT-B fold, and a C-terminal SH3 domain. The SH3 domain is crucial for substrate recognition and enzymatic activity, interacting with the GlcNAc residue on the α1,3-mannose arm of the acceptor glycan (Tomida2020The; GarcíaGarcía2020Structural). The protein's structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are important for its folding and stability (Juliant2014The).

FUT8 is known to have several isoforms, including a short form lacking the cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain, which may affect its localization and function (Tomida2020The). The enzyme's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are not conserved across all species (Juliant2014The).

## Function
The FUT8 gene encodes the enzyme α1,6-fucosyltransferase, which is responsible for core fucosylation, a critical post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells. This process involves the addition of a fucose sugar to the innermost N-acetylglucosamine residue of N-linked glycans, forming an α1,6-linkage. Core fucosylation is essential for various cellular functions, including the activation of growth factor receptors, cell adhesion, and cell migration (GarcíaGarcía2020Structural). The enzyme's activity is crucial for normal physiological processes, as evidenced by gene knockout studies in mice, which resulted in early postnatal death and severe developmental issues (GarcíaGarcía2020Structural).

FUT8 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the core fucosylation of glycoproteins, impacting their function and localization within cells (Tomida2020The). The SH3 domain within FUT8 is essential for its enzymatic activity and localization, as well as for its interaction with ribophorin I (RPN1), which stimulates FUT8 activity (Tomida2020The). Core fucosylation also plays a significant role in modulating the humoral immune response by altering antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (GarcíaGarcía2020Structural). Understanding the function and mechanism of FUT8 can aid in developing inhibitors for therapeutic purposes, such as cancer treatment (GarcíaGarcía2020Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FUT8 gene, which encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 8, are associated with several diseases. Pathogenic variants in FUT8 cause FUT8-CDG (Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation), a rare inherited metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as intrauterine growth restriction, severe developmental delays, neurological impairments, and respiratory complications (Ng2020Expanding). Individuals with FUT8-CDG often present with severe global developmental delays, cognitive impairment, and various skeletal abnormalities (Ng2020Expanding).

In cancer, FUT8 is implicated in the progression and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and breast cancer. High expression of FUT8 in LUAD is associated with poorer overall survival, and its knockdown in cell lines inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Liang2022Fucosyltransferase). In breast cancer, FUT8 is upregulated in highly invasive cells, and its knockdown reduces cell invasiveness, implicating it in tumor progression and metastasis (Tu2017FUT8).

FUT8 is also involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Silencing FUT8 leads to structural changes in lung organoids that mimic COPD, and decreased FUT8 activity is linked to more frequent COPD exacerbations (Wu2022Loss). In mice, FUT8 deficiency results in emphysema-like changes due to dysregulation of TGF-β1 receptor activation (Wang2005Dysregulation).

## Interactions
Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in core fucosylation. A key interaction is with Ribophorin I (RPN1), a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. This interaction is mediated by the SH3 domain of FUT8, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and localization. RPN1 positively regulates FUT8 activity, as demonstrated by reduced enzymatic activity and core fucosylation in RPN1-depleted cells (Tomida2020The). The SH3 domain of FUT8 is unique among glycosyltransferases and is critical for binding to acceptor glycans, with His535 being particularly important for the FUT8 reaction (Tomida2020The).

FUT8 also interacts with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor proteins I and II, facilitating their core fucosylation. This modification is crucial for TGF-β signal transduction, which is linked to increased invasiveness in breast cancer cells (Tu2017FUT8). The core fucosylation of these receptors by FUT8 enhances their function in cell signaling, contributing to cancer progression (Tu2017FUT8). These interactions highlight the role of FUT8 in modifying glycoproteins involved in critical cellular processes.
