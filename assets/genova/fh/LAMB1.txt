# LAMB1

## Overview
LAMB1 is a gene that encodes the laminin subunit beta 1, a crucial component of the laminin protein family, which are heterotrimeric glycoproteins involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The laminin subunit beta 1 protein plays a significant role in cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, and differentiation, contributing to the structural integrity and biochemical support of tissues (Liu2015A; Li2021Extracellular). As a part of the ECM, laminin subunit beta 1 interacts with cell surface receptors, including integrins, influencing cell signaling pathways that are vital for synaptic plasticity and neuromuscular junction formation (Liu2015A; Verrou2019Phosphorylation). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its function and interactions (Verrou2019Phosphorylation). LAMB1 is expressed predominantly in epithelial tissues and the brain, where it is essential for maintaining normal neuronal architecture and function, with implications in both physiological and pathological conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer progression (Petz2011La; Li2021Extracellular).

## Structure
The LAMB1 gene encodes the laminin β1 subunit, a component of the laminin protein family, which are heterotrimeric glycoproteins composed of α, β, and γ chains. Laminin β1 is involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation (Liu2015A; Li2021Extracellular). The protein sequence of LAMB1 consists of 1,786 amino acids, and its structure includes specific domains such as the coiled-coil domain, which is essential for trimerization with other laminin subunits (Liu2015A; Verrou2019Phosphorylation).

The laminin β1 subunit is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation. Phosphorylation sites have been mapped, and several kinases, such as PKA, PKC, CKII, CKI, and GPCR1, are involved in these modifications, which regulate the protein's active sites and functions (Verrou2019Phosphorylation). These modifications are crucial for the protein's role in cell adhesion and interaction with integrin receptors, impacting processes like synaptic plasticity and neuromuscular junction formation (Liu2015A).

The laminin β1 subunit's quaternary structure involves its integration into the ECM as part of the laminin trimer, which is essential for maintaining structural integrity and facilitating cell signaling (Liu2015A).

## Function
LAMB1, encoding the laminin subunit beta 1, is a critical component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, LAMB1 is involved in maintaining the integrity of the ECM, which is essential for providing structural and biochemical support to cells. It contributes to cellular adhesion and migration, processes vital for tissue development and repair (Verrou2019Phosphorylation). LAMB1 is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues and is crucial for cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, polarization, survival, and signaling (Verrou2019Phosphorylation).

In the brain, particularly in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), LAMB1 influences synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity. Knockdown studies in mice have shown that LAMB1 deficiency leads to increased dendritic complexity and spine density, enhancing synaptic transmission through both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms (Li2021Extracellular). LAMB1 also regulates actin dynamics and synaptic function, maintaining normal actin organization and synaptic plasticity through the Src-dependent RhoA/ROCK/LIMK signaling pathway (Li2021Extracellular). These functions highlight LAMB1's importance in maintaining normal neuronal architecture and function, which is crucial for healthy synaptic activity and plasticity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LAMB1 gene, which encodes the laminin β1 subunit, are associated with several neurological disorders. In humans, homozygous mutations in LAMB1 have been linked to cobblestone lissencephaly, a severe developmental brain disorder characterized by brain dysplasia and hydrocephalus. These mutations result in defective basement lamina at the pial surface, leading to significant brain malformations (Liu2015A). In mice, a mutation in the laminin β1 subunit, referred to as lamb1t, causes a dystonia-like movement disorder with brain and spinal neuronal defects. This mutation leads to a truncated protein that affects synaptic function and organization, contributing to dystonic symptoms (Liu2015A).

Alterations in LAMB1 expression levels have also been implicated in cancer progression, including gliomas and colorectal cancer, due to its role in cell adhesion and migration. The gene's involvement in cell attachment and chemotaxis suggests that variations in or near LAMB1 may contribute to autism susceptibility, although specific mutations have not been directly causative (Hutcheson2004Examination). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LAMB1 in both neurodevelopmental and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
Laminin subunit beta 1 (LAMB1) is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix, participating in various interactions that influence cellular processes. LAMB1 forms part of the laminin heterotrimeric complexes, which include one alpha, one beta, and one gamma chain. These complexes interact with cell surface receptors such as integrins, playing a significant role in cell adhesion, migration, and signaling (Li2021Extracellular).

In the context of neuropathic pain and associated psychiatric disorders, LAMB1 interacts with integrin β1 in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of mice. This interaction is essential for the activation of the Src-dependent RhoA/LIMK/cofilin signaling pathway, which regulates actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Disruption of this interaction leads to abnormal actin organization and synaptic spine remodeling, contributing to pain hypersensitivity and anxiodepression-like behaviors (Li2021Extracellular).

LAMB1 is also involved in cancer progression, where it interacts with the La protein. This interaction enhances internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation of LAMB1 during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Petz2011La). These interactions highlight LAMB1's role in both physiological and pathological processes.
