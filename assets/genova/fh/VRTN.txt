# VRTN

## Overview
The VRTN gene, also known as Vertnin, encodes a transcription factor that is pivotal in the development of thoracic vertebrae in mammals. This gene is responsible for producing a DNA-binding protein that localizes to the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of genes essential for vertebral development. The protein encoded by VRTN is particularly active during the formation of thoracic somites, influencing the segmentation and patterning of vertebrae. It plays a significant role in modulating the Notch signaling pathway, specifically by upregulating NOTCH2, which is crucial for vertebral segmentation and somite formation. Variations in the VRTN gene can lead to differences in the number of thoracic vertebrae, as evidenced by studies in pigs, where certain alleles are associated with an increased number of vertebrae and ribs. This highlights the gene's critical role in vertebral development and its potential impact on vertebrate segmentation (Duan2018VRTN).

## Structure


## Function
The VRTN gene, also known as Vertnin, encodes a transcription factor crucial for the development of thoracic vertebrae in mammals. It functions as a DNA-binding protein that localizes to the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of genes involved in vertebral development (Duan2018VRTN). VRTN is particularly active during the critical stages of thoracic somite formation, influencing the segmentation and patterning of vertebrae (Duan2018VRTN).

VRTN modulates the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for somite formation. It specifically upregulates the expression of NOTCH2, a gene implicated in vertebral segmentation, thereby affecting the periodicity of somite formation and increasing the number of thoracic vertebrae (Duan2018VRTN). The gene's activity is linked to the segmentation clock, a mechanism that regulates the timing of somite formation.

Mutations in the VRTN gene can lead to variations in the number of thoracic vertebrae, as observed in studies on pigs, where specific alleles increase the number of vertebrae and ribs (Duan2018VRTN). This highlights VRTN's role in vertebral development and its potential impact on vertebrate segmentation.

## Interactions
The VRTN gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of thoracic vertebrae in mammals. VRTN is known to interact with DNA, as demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing, which identified specific DNA regions bound by VRTN. These interactions suggest that VRTN functions as a DNA-binding transcription factor, regulating the expression of target genes involved in vertebral development (Duan2018VRTN).

VRTN has been shown to influence the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for somite formation and vertebral segmentation. It up-regulates the expression of NOTCH2 and activates HES1 transcription, indicating a role in modulating this pathway (Duan2018VRTN). The interaction with the Notch pathway suggests that VRTN may participate in multiprotein complexes or engage in regulatory interactions that affect gene expression patterns critical for vertebral development.

The study of VRTN in pigs has identified two causative mutations that affect its expression, further supporting its role in vertebral development through interactions with DNA and possibly other proteins involved in developmental pathways (Duan2018VRTN).
