# NCDN

## Overview
The NCDN gene encodes the protein neurochondrin, a cytoplasmic protein predominantly expressed in neural tissues. Neurochondrin is involved in various cellular processes, including dendrite morphogenesis, neural outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity regulation, which are essential for learning and memory (Thompson2017Neurochondrin; Dateki2005Neurochondrin). It functions as a negative regulator of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation, influencing synaptic plasticity, particularly in the hippocampus (Fatima2020Generation; Dateki2005Neurochondrin). Neurochondrin also interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptors, modulating their expression and signaling pathways, which are crucial for long-term synaptic plasticity (Weihua2019Neurochondrin; Nicolas2022A). Additionally, neurochondrin is implicated in maintaining cell polarity and intracellular trafficking, particularly in motor neurons (Thompson2017Neurochondrin). Mutations in the NCDN gene have been associated with neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in neural development and function (Nicolas2022A; Dateki2005Neurochondrin).

## Function
Neurochondrin (NCDN) is a cytoplasmic protein predominantly expressed in neural tissue, where it plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in dendrite morphogenesis, neural outgrowth, and the regulation of synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for maintaining normal neural function and facilitating learning and memory processes (Thompson2017Neurochondrin; Dateki2005Neurochondrin). NCDN acts as a negative regulator of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation, a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity, particularly in the hippocampus, which is essential for spatial learning (Fatima2020Generation; Dateki2005Neurochondrin).

In addition to its role in synaptic function, NCDN interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5), modulating their cell surface expression and downstream signaling pathways. This interaction is important for long-term synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum and hippocampus (Weihua2019Neurochondrin; Nicolas2022A). NCDN is also involved in maintaining cell polarity and intracellular trafficking, particularly in elongated cells like motor neurons, where it may facilitate the transport of mRNAs or proteins (Thompson2017Neurochondrin). These functions highlight NCDN's critical role in neural development and function, impacting organismal outcomes such as learning, memory, and neural stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NCDN gene, which encodes the neurochondrin protein, have been linked to several neurological conditions. A study identified a de novo mutation in the NCDN gene in a patient with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with FET proteinopathy (FTLD-FET). This mutation results in neurochondrin haploinsufficiency, leading to reduced levels of the protein and altered FUS granule dynamics, which are implicated in the pathology of FTLD-FET (Nicolas2022A). The mutation introduces a premature stop codon, triggering nonsense-mediated decay and contributing to the disease's progression (Nicolas2022A).

In another study, neurochondrin was shown to negatively regulate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation. Mice with neural tissue-specific neurochondrin deficiency exhibited increased CaMKII phosphorylation, leading to spatial learning defects and epileptic seizures. This suggests that neurochondrin plays a critical role in maintaining normal neurological function and that its deficiency can contribute to epileptogenesis (Dateki2005Neurochondrin).

Additionally, neurochondrin interacts with the Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, suggesting a potential role in the pathology of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). Mis-localization of neurochondrin due to SMN reduction could affect cellular pathways, potentially contributing to SMA pathogenesis (Thompson2017Neurochondrin).

## Interactions
Neurochondrin (NCDN) is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in neural function and pathology. NCDN interacts with the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, which is crucial for the pathology of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). This interaction occurs within mobile cytoplasmic vesicles, suggesting a role in vesicular transport and mRNA trafficking, independent of snRNP assembly (Thompson2017Neurochondrin). NCDN also interacts with SmB and SmN proteins, co-localizing with them in vesicles, indicating a potential cellular role for SMN (Thompson2017Neurochondrin).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, NCDN interacts with the RNA-binding protein FUS. A de novo mutation in NCDN can lead to haploinsufficiency, affecting FUS granule dynamics and suggesting a feedback loop of toxicity between NCDN and FUS (Nicolas2022A). This interaction is significant in the pathology of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) associated with FET proteinopathy (Nicolas2022A).

NCDN is also involved in interactions with G protein-coupled receptors, such as metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGLuR1 and mGLuR5), which are important for synaptic plasticity regulation in the cerebellum and hippocampus (Weihua2019Neurochondrin).
