"The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunophilin protein family, which play a role in immunoregulation and basic cellular processes involving protein folding and trafficking. This encoded protein is a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that binds to the immunosuppressants FK506 and rapamycin. It is thought to mediate calcineurin inhibition. It also interacts functionally with mature hetero-oligomeric progesterone receptor complexes along with the 90 kDa heat shock protein and P23 protein. This gene has been found to have multiple polyadenylation sites. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009].", "symbol": "FKBP5", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1414627"}, "unigene": "Hs.407190", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "Q13451", "TrEMBL": "Q2TA84"}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "FKBP5"}}
