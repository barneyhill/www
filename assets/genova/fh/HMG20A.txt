# HMG20A

## Overview
HMG20A is a gene that encodes the high mobility group 20A protein, which is a chromatin remodeling factor involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by the presence of a highly conserved HMG box domain, which facilitates its interaction with DNA and influences chromatin structure. HMG20A plays a critical role in various biological processes, including the maintenance of functional maturity in islet beta cells, regulation of mitochondrial metabolism in astrocytes, and modulation of neuronal differentiation. It is involved in several protein interactions, notably with chromatin-modifying complexes such as BHC/CoREST and NuRD, and with calcium-binding proteins like S100A6. Clinically, alterations in HMG20A expression have been associated with conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and oral squamous cell carcinomas, highlighting its significance in both metabolic and oncogenic pathways (Na2022HMG20A; MelladoGil2018The; Sumoy2000HMG20A).

## Structure
HMG20A encodes a protein of 347 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 40.1 kDa. The protein contains a highly conserved HMG box domain, which is crucial for its role in DNA binding and chromatin structure modulation (Sumoy2000HMG20A). The HMG box is characterized by an L-shaped fold consisting of three alpha-helices, which facilitates interactions with DNA, often causing bending and unwinding of the DNA structure (Štros2007The). 

The C-terminal region of HMG20A, particularly residues 311-347, is important for its interaction with S100A6, a calcium-binding protein. This interaction is calcium-dependent and involves specific residues, with residues 338-342 being essential for efficient binding (Yamamoto2021Identification). The protein can also interact with other S100 family proteins, such as S100A1, S100A2, and S100B, but not with S100A4, A11, A12, and calmodulin (Yamamoto2021Identification).

HMG20A is known to have several alternative transcripts, suggesting the existence of splice variant isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the available context (Sumoy2000HMG20A). The protein's role as a chromatin remodeling factor is supported by its interaction with other proteins, such as β-dystrobrevin, which may influence chromatin dynamics and neuronal differentiation (Yamamoto2021Identification).

## Function
The HMG20A gene encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, playing a crucial role in maintaining the functional maturity of islet beta cells, which are responsible for insulin secretion. In beta cells, HMG20A regulates key genes such as NeuroD and Mafa, essential for metabolism-insulin secretion coupling, while preventing the expression of Rest, a repressor of beta cell development genes (MelladoGil2018The). HMG20A is also expressed in astrocytes, where it supports mitochondrial metabolism and survival. It regulates the LSD1-CoREST complex, which is important for demethylation processes and neuron-specific gene repression, thereby influencing astrocyte survival and motoneuron support (Lorenzo2021Thea).

In the central nervous system, HMG20A is involved in reactive astrogliosis, a process that maintains neuronal integrity. It modulates the expression of genes related to cell migration, adhesion, and lipid metabolism, impacting astrocyte phenotypic states and neuron viability (Lorenzo2021The; Lorenzo2021Thea). HMG20A's interaction with the LSD1-CoREST complex also plays a role in neuronal differentiation by activating neuron-specific genes (Yamamoto2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HMG20A gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. In the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), HMG20A expression is decreased in islets from T2DM donors, which is associated with impaired beta cell function and insulin secretion. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of HMG20A, known as rs7119, affects miRNA binding and reduces gene expression, contributing to beta cell de-differentiation and dysfunction in T2DM (MelladoGil2018The).

HMG20A is also implicated in obesity and related metabolic disorders. Its expression is increased in the hypothalamus and adipose tissue of obese individuals, suggesting a role in glucose homeostasis and insulin demand adaptation. However, in obese diabetic patients, normal levels of HMG20A in white adipose tissue are associated with a non-reactive phenotype, potentially leading to neurodegeneration and altered glucose homeostasis (Lorenzo2021The; Lorenzo2021Thea).

In oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC), HMG20A acts as a key enhancer driver for DNA repair-related genes, with higher expression levels correlating with poorer survival outcomes. It is significantly overexpressed in metastatic OSCC tissues, indicating its role in cancer progression (Na2022HMG20A).

## Interactions
HMG20A is a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. It interacts with several chromatin-modifying complexes, including the BHC/CoREST and NuRD complexes. Within the BHC/CoREST complex, HMG20A associates with proteins such as HMG20B, GSE1, PHF21A, KDM1A, RCOR1, and RCOR3 (Herchenröther2022The). In the NuRD complex, HMG20A binds to components like MTA1, HDAC1, and CHD4, with its C-terminal coiled-coil domain being sufficient for this interaction (Herchenröther2022The).

HMG20A also interacts with the H2A.Z/PWWP2A complex, binding to chromatin loci that are either H2A.Z/PWWP2A-cobound promoters or intronic enhancers without these proteins (Herchenröther2022The). It is involved in early head and heart developmental transcription programs, affecting neural crest cell and cardiomyocyte differentiation (Herchenröther2022The).

Additionally, HMG20A is a novel binding partner for the calcium-binding protein S100A6, with this interaction occurring in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The S100A6-binding region in HMG20A is identified as residues 311-342 (Yamamoto2021Identification). This interaction suggests a potential regulatory mechanism in neuronal gene expression (Yamamoto2021Identification).
