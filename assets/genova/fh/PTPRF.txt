# PTPRF

## Overview
PTPRF, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F, is a gene that encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type-III motifs, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular region with two phosphatase domains. The protein plays a crucial role in cellular signaling, particularly in processes such as cell adhesion, neurite growth, and insulin signaling. It is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and interacts with various proteins to modulate pathways critical for cellular communication and tissue organization. PTPRF has been implicated in several diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and various cancers, where it can act as a tumor suppressor or a positive regulator of signaling pathways, depending on the context (Hendriks2013Protein; Gan2020Inhibition; Cornejo2021LAR).

## Structure
PTPRF, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F, is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein consists of an extracellular domain (E-domain) with three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like motifs and eight fibronectin type-III motifs, a single transmembrane domain (TM), and an intracellular phosphatase domain (P-domain) (Gan2020Inhibition). The E-domain undergoes post-translational proteolytic cleavage but remains associated with the TM domain (Gan2020Inhibition).

The intracellular region of PTPRF contains two phosphatase domains: a catalytically active D1 domain and a pseudophosphatase D2 domain. The D2 domain, although typically inactive due to sequence deviations, maintains the classical PTP fold and can modulate the activity of the D1 domain (hay2021structure). The D2 domain may also serve as a protein scaffold, interacting with proteins such as Liprin-α, which influences receptor clustering and inactivation (hay2021structure).

PTPRF is part of the R2B family of receptor tyrosine phosphatases, which are known for their large extracellular domains and tandem intracellular PTP domains (hay2021structure). The protein's structure allows it to play a role in cell signaling, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer, where it has been identified as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling (Gan2020Inhibition).

## Function
PTPRF, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F, is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PTPRF plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for cell adhesion and neurite growth. It facilitates the formation of focal adhesions by linking the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, promoting neurite outgrowth and synaptic differentiation (Cornejo2021LAR). PTPRF interacts with extracellular matrix ligands to activate its catalytic function, leading to the dephosphorylation of ABL1, which subsequently activates AKT and CDK1, enhancing cell adhesion and promoting dendrite and axon growth (Cornejo2021LAR).

PTPRF is also involved in the regulation of insulin signaling pathways. It acts as a negative modulator of the insulin signaling pathway, influencing downstream Akt/PKB and MAP kinase activities, which are crucial for metabolic processes (Hendriks2013Protein). Additionally, PTPRF is implicated in mammary gland development and neuronal function, with its deficiency leading to neuronal deficits and variable mammary gland development in mice (Hendriks2023Hereditable). These functions highlight PTPRF's multifaceted role in maintaining cellular communication and tissue organization.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTPRF gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a candidate mutation in PTPRF was identified through whole-exome sequencing, suggesting its potential role in T2DM susceptibility due to its involvement in insulin signaling pathways (Toonen2020WholeExome). The gene's interaction with insulin receptor substrates and its role in dephosphorylating the insulin receptor highlight its significance in insulin resistance, a key feature of T2DM (Hendriks2023Hereditable).

PTPRF has also been associated with developmental abnormalities. Germline mutations in PTPRF have been linked to conditions such as amastia and athelia, characterized by the absence of breast tissue and the nipple-areola complex (Hendriks2023Hereditable). A specific case of syndromic amastia was associated with a disruption in PTPRF, leading to significantly decreased RNA and protein levels (Ausavarat2011PTPRF).

In cancer, PTPRF mutations and alterations have been reported in colorectal, lung, and breast cancers. It is considered a tumor suppressor in many cancers, with its deletion or down-regulation contributing to carcinogenesis (Du2015Receptortype). However, in colorectal cancer, PTPRF has been identified as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling, suggesting a complex role that may vary depending on the cancer type (Gan2020Inhibition).

## Interactions
PTPRF, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. PTPRF interacts with the insulin receptor (INSR) and insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1 and IRS2), where it dephosphorylates the tyrosine-kinase domain of the insulin receptor, inhibiting its activation and downstream signaling. This interaction is crucial in insulin signaling pathways and may contribute to the pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) (Toonen2020WholeExome).

In the context of colorectal cancer, PTPRF interacts with LRP6, a co-receptor in the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction enhances Wnt signaling by promoting the phosphorylation of LRP6, which is essential for the activation of the Wnt pathway. PTPRF's role in this pathway is linked to its ability to regulate the formation of LRP6-containing signalosomes via an endocytosis-dependent mechanism (Gan2020Inhibition).

PTPRF is also targeted by miR-24, a microRNA that enhances tumor invasion and metastasis by repressing PTPRF expression, leading to increased phosphorylation of EGFR, a key player in tumor progression (Du2013MicroRNA). Additionally, PTPRF is involved in synaptic organization through interactions with post-synaptic ligands, mediating trans-synaptic adhesion (Wojtowicz2020A).
