# TTC24

## Overview
TTC24 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 24, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that TTC24 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. The specific functions and pathways involving TTC24 are still under investigation, but its involvement in cellular mechanisms highlights its potential significance in understanding complex biological systems. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise roles and interactions of the TTC24 protein in human health and disease.
