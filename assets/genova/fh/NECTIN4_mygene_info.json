The encoded protein contains two immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) C2-type domains and one Ig-like V-type domain. It is involved in cell adhesion through trans-homophilic and -heterophilic interactions. It is a single-pass type I membrane protein. The soluble form is produced by proteolytic cleavage at the cell surface by the metalloproteinase ADAM17/TACE. The secreted form is found in both breast tumor cell lines and breast tumor patients. Mutations in this gene are the cause of ectodermal dysplasia-syndactyly syndrome type 1, an autosomal recessive disorder. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found but the full-length nature of the variant has not been determined.[provided by RefSeq, Jan 2011].", "symbol": "NECTIN4", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1426335"}, "unigene": ["Hs.732297", "Hs.492490"], "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "Q96NY8", "TrEMBL": "K4PZ75"}}
