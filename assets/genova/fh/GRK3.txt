# GRK3

## Overview
GRK3, or G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. The protein product of GRK3, also known as G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3, plays a pivotal role in the desensitization of activated GPCRs through phosphorylation, thereby modulating cellular responses to external stimuli (Penela2003Mechanisms; Métayé2005Pathophysiological). This kinase is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the heart, lungs, and leukocytes, and is particularly significant in the olfactory system for regulating receptor desensitization (Métayé2005Pathophysiological). GRK3's interactions with other proteins, such as G protein subunits and heat shock proteins, underscore its importance in cellular signaling pathways and its potential implications in various clinical conditions, including psychiatric disorders and cancer (Salim2006Role; Hollins2009The; Li2022GRK3).

## Function
GRK3, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, plays a crucial role in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. It phosphorylates activated GPCRs, leading to receptor desensitization, which is essential for maintaining cellular responsiveness to external stimuli (Penela2003Mechanisms; Métayé2005Pathophysiological). GRK3 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, lung, and leukocytes, and is particularly important in the olfactory system, where it regulates olfactory receptor desensitization (Métayé2005Pathophysiological).

In cardiac myocytes, GRK3 modulates GPCR signaling, which is vital for cardiac function. It specifically desensitizes myocardial α1B-adrenergic receptors, influencing cardiovascular responses (Sato2015The; Métayé2005Pathophysiological). GRK3 is also involved in the regulation of opioid receptor tolerance, as evidenced by studies on GRK3-deficient mice (Métayé2005Pathophysiological).

At the molecular level, GRK3 is recruited to the plasma membrane from the cytosol through interactions with Gβγ subunits, enhancing GPCR phosphorylation and ensuring that only agonist-occupied receptors are desensitized (Sato2015The). This precise regulation of receptor signaling is crucial for preventing excessive cellular responses and maintaining homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the GRK3 gene have been implicated in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Studies have shown that both the expression and protein levels of GRK3 are reduced in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia. This reduction is associated with elevated brain levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), increased turnover of kynurenic acid (KYNA), and enhanced dopaminergic transmission, which are linked to psychosis-like behaviors (Sellgren2021GRK3). In bipolar disorder, decreased GRK3 expression is associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid KYNA levels and a history of psychotic symptoms (Sellgren2021GRK3).

In gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), GRK3 is overexpressed and associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, including increased cell invasion and tumor growth. This overexpression correlates with higher rates of lymph node metastases and shorter overall survival in patients. GRK3 is linked to the Hippo/YAP1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for GAC progression and cancer stem cell attributes. A novel GRK3 inhibitor, LD2, has shown potential in reducing these aggressive phenotypes, suggesting GRK3 as a therapeutic target in advanced GAC (Li2022GRK3).

## Interactions
GRK3 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. One significant interaction is with the 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90), which stabilizes GRK3 in neuronal cells. This interaction is essential for maintaining steady-state levels of GRK3 and is disrupted by the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, leading to proteasome-mediated degradation of GRK3 (Salim2006Role). 

GRK3 also interacts with G protein subunits, particularly the Gβγ dimers. The C-terminus of GRK3 binds exclusively to free Gβγ dimers, not to those in rearranged heterotrimers, indicating a role in G protein signaling dynamics (Hollins2009The). This interaction is crucial for the rapid dissociation of G protein heterotrimers, facilitating swift signaling responses (Hollins2009The).

In the context of CXCR4 signaling, GRK3 is involved in the phosphorylation of the receptor, which is necessary for its internalization and desensitization. This process is critical in conditions like WHIM syndrome, where GRK3 dysfunction leads to impaired CXCR4 signaling (Balabanian2008Leukocyte). These interactions highlight GRK3's pivotal role in modulating receptor activity and cellular responses.
