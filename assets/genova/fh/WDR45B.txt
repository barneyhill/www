# WDR45B

## Overview
WDR45B is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 45B protein, which is categorized as a β-propeller protein. This protein plays a pivotal role in the autophagy pathway, particularly in neural cells, by facilitating the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a critical step for intracellular degradation and recycling of cellular components (Ji2021The; Ji2021βpropeller). The WD repeat domain 45B protein interacts with phosphatidylinositol phosphates, which is essential for its membrane association and function in autophagy (Ji2021βpropeller). Mutations in the WDR45B gene are linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as β-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) and intellectual disability, underscoring its importance in neural health and cognitive function (Ji2019Role). Additionally, alterations in WDR45B expression have been implicated in cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, where it influences tumor proliferation and migration through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Li2023AutophagyRelated).

## Structure
WDR45B is a β-propeller protein involved in the regulation of autophagosome maturation into autolysosomes in neural cells. The protein interacts with phosphatidylinositol phosphates, specifically binding to PI(3)P, PI(4)P, and PI(5)P, with a stronger interaction noted with PI(3,5)P2. This interaction is crucial for its membrane association, primarily dependent on PI(3)P (Ji2021βpropeller). WDR45B facilitates the lipid transfer activity of ATG2, which is essential for autophagosome expansion, indicating its role in modulating autophagosome size (Ji2021βpropeller).

WDR45B forms a complex with the tether protein EPG5 and SNARE proteins, such as STX17, SNAP29, and VAMP8, which is vital for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Mutations in WDR45B associated with diseases like BPAN and intellectual disability disrupt its binding with EPG5, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity for proper function (Ji2021βpropeller). The protein's structure is characterized by WD40 repeats, which form a beta-propeller structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions. These structural features are crucial for its role in autophagy, although specific details on its primary, secondary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
WDR45B is a β-propeller protein that plays a critical role in the autophagy pathway, particularly in neural cells. It is involved in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, a key step in autophagy necessary for intracellular degradation and recycling of cellular components (Ji2021The; Ji2021βpropeller). WDR45B, along with its homolog WDR45, facilitates the recruitment of the tether protein EPG5 to late endosomes/lysosomes, which is essential for the formation of the SNARE complex that mediates autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Ji2021βpropeller).

In healthy cells, WDR45B is associated with late endosomes/lysosomes and interacts with phosphatidylinositol phosphates, particularly PI(3)P, which is crucial for its membrane association and function in autophagy (Ji2021βpropeller). The protein's activity is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function, as it ensures the proper degradation of misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, thereby preventing the accumulation of autophagy substrates like SQSTM1 and ubiquitin-positive aggregates (Ji2019Role). Mutations in WDR45B can lead to neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in neural health and cognitive function (Ji2019Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR45B gene are associated with several neurodegenerative and intellectual disorders. These mutations can lead to β-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) and intellectual disability (ID), characterized by impaired autophagy processes in neural cells. Specifically, mutations disrupt the interaction of WDR45B with the tether protein EPG5, which is crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion, leading to autophagy defects (Ji2021βpropeller). In WDR45B knockout mice, these defects manifest as late-onset neurodegeneration, axonal swelling, and severe motor and cognitive impairments, including learning and memory deficits (Ji2019Role).

Alterations in WDR45B expression are also linked to cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The gene promotes tumor proliferation and migration through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Its expression is characterized by copy number gain and DNA methylation, which can predict HCC prognosis. WDR45B is co-expressed with GRB2 and TRIM37, both associated with cancer progression. Knockdown of WDR45B in HCC cells inhibits autophagy, suggesting its role in promoting autophagy by inhibiting the Akt/mTOR pathway, which is crucial for drug resistance in advanced HCC (Li2023AutophagyRelated).

## Interactions
WDR45B is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in autophagy. It interacts with the tether protein EPG5, which is essential for targeting to late endosomes/lysosomes and promoting the formation of SNARE-tether fusion complexes necessary for autophagosome maturation. In the absence of WDR45B, EPG5 mistargets to autophagosomes, impairing its interaction with the SNARE complex and the assembly of the fusion machinery (Ji2021The; Ji2021βpropeller). WDR45B also interacts with phosphatidylinositol phosphates, particularly PI(3,5)P2, which is crucial for its membrane association (Ji2021βpropeller).

WDR45B forms complexes with SNARE proteins such as STX17, SNAP29, and VAMP8, which are essential for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Mutations in WDR45B that are related to specific diseases result in reduced interaction with EPG5, further supporting its role in autophagy (Ji2021βpropeller). Additionally, WDR45B interacts with ATG2B, forming a complex that is involved in lipid transfer activity, possibly through the ATG2-WIPI complex (Ji2021βpropeller). These interactions highlight the importance of WDR45B in maintaining proper autophagic flux and cellular homeostasis.
