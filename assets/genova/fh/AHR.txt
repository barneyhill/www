# AHR

## Overview
The AHR gene encodes the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in mediating cellular responses to environmental signals. This receptor is categorized as a transcription factor and is involved in various physiological processes, including cell differentiation, immune regulation, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The AHR protein is characterized by its basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains, which facilitate DNA binding and dimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) (Uemura2020Biochemical; Dai2022Structural). AHR is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in developmental and physiological processes (MuleroNavarro2016New). Dysregulation of AHR has been implicated in various diseases, including ocular disorders and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Hammond2022More; Juricek2017AhRdeficiency).

## Structure
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a protein that functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor. It is composed of 848 amino acids and includes several functional domains. The N-terminal region contains a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, which is crucial for DNA binding and dimerization, and includes nuclear localization and export signals (Uemura2020Biochemical). The middle region of AHR contains the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains, divided into PAS-A and PAS-B. The PAS-A domain is involved in dimer formation, while the PAS-B domain serves as the ligand-binding site (Uemura2020Biochemical; Dai2022Structural). The PAS-B domain is specifically noted for its role in ligand binding and interaction with HSP90 (Dai2022Structural).

The PAS-A domain forms a homodimer with a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and four α-helices, with the A=α-helix being essential for dimerization (Wu2013Structure). The C-terminal region contains a transcriptional activation domain (TAD) with a glutamine-rich site (Uemura2020Biochemical). AHR forms a heterodimer with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) via the bHLH and PAS-A domains, which is essential for its function (Uemura2020Biochemical). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. AHR is involved in cell differentiation, pluripotency, and stemness, influencing the differentiation of multiple cell types, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), adipocytes, and immune cells such as Treg and Th17 lymphocytes (Singh2009The; MuleroNavarro2016New). It acts as a negative regulator of hematopoiesis, maintaining HSCs in a quiescent state and preventing excessive proliferation, which is crucial for long-term stem cell functionality (Singh2009The).

AHR functions as a chemical sensor, translating external and internal signals into cellular responses. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression networks essential for physiological and developmental processes, particularly in response to environmental signals (KAWAJIRI2017The). AHR is expressed ubiquitously in human cells and is highly conserved, suggesting its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis across various tissues, including cardiac, hematopoietic, and epithelial systems (MuleroNavarro2016New).

In the immune system, AHR regulates the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, playing a critical role in both innate and adaptive immunity. It suppresses inflammatory cytokines to prevent persistent inflammation and is involved in the regulation of antigen-presenting cells (KAWAJIRI2017The). AHR also contributes to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and immune defense by regulating the expansion of specific lymphoid cells and cytokine production (KAWAJIRI2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) gene are linked to several ocular diseases and conditions. A loss of function mutation in the AHR gene is associated with nystagmus, an involuntary eye movement disorder. This mutation results in a truncated AHR protein, leading to decreased expression and function, and is also observed in AHR knockout mice, which exhibit optic nerve myelin sheath deficiencies and increased optic nerve inflammation (Hammond2022More; Mayer2019Homozygous).

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a hereditary degenerative retinal disease, is linked to a loss of function mutation in the AHR gene, causing retinal thinning and photoreceptor loss (Hammond2022More). Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss, is associated with decreased AHR expression with aging. AHR knockout mice develop AMD-like pathology, including retinal pigment epithelium and choroidal atrophy, suggesting that AHR loss contributes to AMD (Hammond2022More).

AHR deficiency is also implicated in inflammatory demyelinating diseases. In AHR knockout mice, there is a disorganization of the myelin sheath in the optic nerve, linked to decreased expression of myelin-associated glycoprotein and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a role in demyelinating conditions (Juricek2017AhRdeficiency).

## Interactions
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a ligand-activated transcription factor. AHR forms a complex with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and the immunophilin-like protein ARA9 (also known as XAP2), which stabilizes AHR in the cytoplasm and enhances its response to ligands (Carver1997Liganddependent; Carver1998Characterization). Upon ligand binding, AHR translocates to the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), which is essential for DNA binding and gene activation (Tappenden2013The; Swanson2002DNA).

The AHR/ARNT heterodimer specifically binds to DNA sequences containing the GCGTG motif, with the interaction being influenced by specific amino acids in both AHR and ARNT (Swanson2002DNA). AHR also interacts with other proteins such as p23, Cdk4, and the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), linking it to cell cycle regulation and kinase signaling (Tappenden2013The). Additionally, AHR's interaction with mitochondrial proteins suggests a role in cellular energetics and stress responses (Tappenden2013The). The phosphorylation status of AHR and ARNT affects their DNA binding and transactivation potential, highlighting the complexity of AHR-mediated signaling pathways (Swanson2002DNA).
