# TMEM169

## Overview
TMEM169 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 169, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and maintaining cell structure. While the specific function of transmembrane protein 169 remains to be fully elucidated, it is hypothesized to be involved in cellular communication and molecular transport due to its structural properties. Further research is needed to understand its interactions and potential implications in human health and disease.
