# TMEM200C

## Overview
TMEM200C is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 200C, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are not yet fully understood. TMEM200C has garnered attention due to its potential role in cancer biology, where it has been identified as a significantly mutated gene in certain types of cancer, such as adult T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and gastric cancer (Li2019Genomic; Gong2020Tumor). Additionally, TMEM200C has been associated with reproductive traits in livestock, indicating its broader biological significance beyond human health (BÜLBÜL2024Genomewide). Ongoing research aims to elucidate the full spectrum of its functions and implications in both health and disease contexts.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM200C gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In adult T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), TMEM200C was identified as one of the significantly mutated genes, suggesting its potential role as a driver mutation in this aggressive lymphoid neoplasm (Li2019Genomic). In gastric cancer, TMEM200C was found to be significantly more mutated in tumors with high purity, indicating a possible association with tumor progression and prognosis (Gong2020Tumor).

Beyond cancer, TMEM200C has been associated with reproductive traits in livestock, such as twinning rates in cattle and fertility in goats, although its clinical significance in human fertility remains unexplored (BÜLBÜL2024Genomewide). The gene has also been linked to semen traits in composite ram breeds, where it may influence reproductive biology through its involvement in molecular functions and biological processes related to fertility (BÜLBÜL2024Genomewide).

While TMEM200C's role in human diseases is still being elucidated, these findings highlight its potential as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as its involvement in reproductive biology. Further research is needed to fully understand its clinical implications across different conditions.
