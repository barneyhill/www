# BDKRB2

## Overview
The BDKRB2 gene encodes the bradykinin receptor B2, a critical component of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically classified as a seven-transmembrane receptor. This receptor is integral to the physiological actions of bradykinin, a peptide that plays a significant role in processes such as vasodilation, inflammation, and pain modulation. The B2 receptor is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues and is constitutively active, meaning it is functional under normal physiological conditions. Upon activation by bradykinin, the receptor engages in complex signaling pathways involving Gαq and Gαi proteins, which lead to diverse cellular responses, including the regulation of vascular tone and inflammatory processes (LeebLundberg2005International). The receptor's activity is finely regulated through mechanisms such as phosphorylation and acylation, ensuring precise control over its signaling capabilities (LeebLundberg2005International).

## Structure
The BDKRB2 gene encodes the B2 bradykinin receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by a single polypeptide chain that spans the cell membrane seven times, forming seven-transmembrane helices typical of class A GPCRs (LeebLundberg2005International; Shen2022Function). The receptor has an extracellular N-terminal domain and an intracellular C-terminal domain, with three extracellular and three intracellular loops (LeebLundberg2005International). The B2 receptor contains motifs common to the rhodopsin family of GPCRs, such as DRY and NPXXY, and has sites for N-linked glycosylation, phosphorylation, and acylation (LeebLundberg2005International).

The receptor's primary structure consists of 391 amino acids, with the N-terminus spanning Met1 to Asn57 and the C-terminus ranging from Gln352 to Gln391 (Shen2022Function). The B2 receptor has three potential glycosylation sites at Asn30, Asn39, and Asn207, and a palmitoylation site at Cys351 (Shen2022Function). Phosphorylation sites include several serines and threonines, which are predicted to be phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (Shen2022Function).

The B2 receptor can form monomeric, dimeric, and possibly higher-order oligomeric structures, and it also forms heterodimeric complexes with other receptors, such as the B1 receptor and the AT1 receptor (LeebLundberg2005International). These interactions can affect receptor signaling and are crucial for its physiological functions.

## Function
The BDKRB2 gene encodes the bradykinin B2 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating the physiological effects of bradykinin in healthy human cells. This receptor is primarily involved in processes such as vasodilation, inflammation, and pain response. It is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and is constitutively active, meaning it is present and functional under normal physiological conditions (LeebLundberg2005International).

The B2 receptor is activated by bradykinin, leading to the stimulation of Gαq proteins, which in turn activate phospholipase Cβ. This activation results in the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and the mobilization of intracellular calcium, which are critical for various cellular responses, including smooth muscle contraction and vasodilation (LeebLundberg2005International). The receptor also interacts with Gαi proteins, inhibiting adenylate cyclase and stimulating mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, which are important for vascular and pain responses (LeebLundberg2005International).

In vascular endothelial cells, the B2 receptor mediates the release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, which are key mediators of vasodilation and blood flow regulation (LeebLundberg2005International). The receptor's activity is modulated by phosphorylation and acylation, which are essential for its desensitization and internalization, maintaining receptor function and preventing overstimulation (LeebLundberg2005International).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BDKRB2 gene, which encodes the bradykinin receptor B2, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In psychiatric disorders, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BDKRB2, such as rs945032 and rs8016905, have been associated with panic disorder, substance abuse, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, suggesting a shared genetic susceptibility across these conditions (Gratacòs2009Identification).

In the context of cardiovascular health, the BDKRB2 gene has been linked to blood pressure regulation and vascular resistance. The BE1 polymorphism, particularly the +9/+9 genotype, is associated with increased systolic blood pressure and vascular resistance, contributing to hypertension and increased left ventricular mass, especially in certain ethnic groups (Pretorius2007The). Additionally, the BDKRB2 C-58 T polymorphism affects the antihypertensive response to enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, with the TT genotype linked to a poorer response (Silva2012eNOS).

In gliomas, BDKRB2 expression is significantly higher in high-grade tumors, indicating its potential role in tumor progression and malignancy (Stadnicka2024Kinin). The gene's involvement in hereditary angioedema has also been studied, with numerous variants identified, although no direct genotype-phenotype association was found (Veronez2019Genetic).

## Interactions
The bradykinin receptor B2 (BDKRB2) is involved in several protein interactions that modulate its signaling pathways. A notable interaction is with AltB2R, an alternative protein encoded by the same BDKRB2 gene. AltB2R enhances B2R signaling by increasing the efficacy of G-protein coupling, specifically with Gαq and Gαi2/3 proteins, which leads to increased intracellular calcium levels and activation of the ERK1/2-MAPK pathway (Gagnon2021Potentiation). This interaction is specific to B2R, as AltB2R does not affect the signaling of the bradykinin B1 receptor (B1R) (Gagnon2021Potentiation).

AltB2R and B2R colocalize in the cytoplasm and membranes, suggesting a physical interaction that is confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays (Gagnon2021Potentiation). This interaction does not alter the internalization rate or cell-surface density of B2R, indicating that AltB2R modulates signaling through specific G-protein interactions rather than changes in receptor internalization (Gagnon2021Potentiation). The coexpression of AltB2R and B2R in certain cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers, suggests a potential role in disease progression (Gagnon2021Potentiation).
