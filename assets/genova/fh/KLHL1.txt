# KLHL1

## Overview
KLHL1 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch like family member 1, which is a neuronal actin-binding protein involved in the modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a BTB/POZ domain and multiple Kelch repeats, which facilitate its interactions with actin and other proteins. KLHL1 plays a critical role in the regulation of calcium channel function, particularly influencing the CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) and CaV3.2 (T-type) channels, thereby affecting synaptic function and neuronal excitability. The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and is involved in organizing the actin cytoskeleton, modulating neurite outgrowth, and maintaining dendritic spine morphology. Alterations in KLHL1 expression or function have been associated with neurological and metabolic disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neuronal and physiological functions (Perissinotti2021Genetic; Aromolaran2010Ttype).

## Structure
KLHL1 is a protein characterized by several distinct structural domains. It contains a BTB/POZ domain, which is involved in protein dimerization and binding, and six Kelch repeats that form a β-propeller structure, facilitating interactions with actin and other proteins (Shi2019Kelchlike; Aromolaran2010Ttype). The BTB/POZ domain is located at the NH2-terminal region, while the Kelch repeats are situated at the COOH terminus (Aromolaran2010Ttype). These structural features are crucial for KLHL1's role in modulating calcium channel function and cytoskeletal organization (Aromolaran2010Ttype).

KLHL1 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The protein can form multimers and bind actin filaments, suggesting a role in actin cytoskeleton organization (Aromolaran2007The). KLHL1 is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functions (Shi2019Kelchlike). These structural and functional attributes highlight KLHL1's involvement in cellular processes such as neurite outgrowth and calcium channel modulation (Aromolaran2010Ttype).

## Function
The KLHL1 gene encodes a neuronal actin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in modulating voltage-gated calcium channels, specifically the CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) and CaV3.2 (T-type) channels. In healthy neurons, KLHL1 enhances the recycling and presence of these channels at the plasma membrane, thereby increasing calcium current density. This modulation is essential for maintaining calcium current homeostasis and proper synaptic function, as it affects synapsin I levels and the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which are critical for balancing excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs (Perissinotti2015Calcium; Aromolaran2010Ttype).

KLHL1 is brain-specific and cytosolic, capable of forming multimers and binding actin filaments. It is involved in organizing actin, modulating neurite outgrowth, and influencing the morphology of dendritic spine heads. KLHL1 may also anchor proteins essential for postsynaptic function, such as ion channels (Aromolaran2007The). The protein's interaction with the actin cytoskeleton is significant for its regulatory role, as it facilitates the modulation of calcium channels without requiring high sequence homology (Aromolaran2010Ttype). The deletion of KLHL1 in Purkinje neurons leads to dendritic deficits and motor coordination loss, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Aromolaran2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the KLHL1 gene have been linked to several neurological and metabolic conditions. The genetic deletion of KLHL1 leads to hyperexcitability in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, resulting in a lack of electrical responses to leptin, a hormone crucial for energy homeostasis. This alteration contributes to obesity due to disrupted energy balance and feeding behaviors in KLHL1 knockout (KO) mice (Perissinotti2021Genetic). The absence of KLHL1 causes an overexpression of CaV3.1 T-type calcium channels, increasing neuronal excitability and leading to leptin resistance, which is associated with obesity phenotypes (Perissinotti2021Genetic).

KLHL1 also plays a role in pain perception. In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, KLHL1 modulates the expression of CaV3.2 channels, which are involved in pain signaling. KLHL1 knockout mice exhibit reduced CaV3.2 expression, leading to decreased neuronal excitability and increased mechanical pain thresholds, indicating reduced pain sensitivity (MartínezHernández2020KLHL1). These findings suggest that KLHL1 is a physiological modulator of pain sensitivity and may be a potential target for pain management therapies.

## Interactions
KLHL1 (kelch like family member 1) is known to participate in several protein interactions, particularly with components of calcium channels. KLHL1 interacts with the α1A subunit of P/Q-type calcium channels, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which indicate a physical interaction. This interaction is supported by co-localization studies in HEK cells, where KLHL1 and α1A show a high degree of co-localization, suggesting that KLHL1 modulates the electrophysiological properties of these channels by increasing their current density (Aromolaran2007The).

KLHL1 also interacts with the α1H subunit of CaV3.2 T-type calcium channels. This interaction increases the current density and calcium influx during action potential waveforms, suggesting a role in channel trafficking or turnover. The interaction is confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunolocalization studies, showing that KLHL1 is primarily localized in the cytosol, plasma membrane, and Golgi network, where it colocalizes with α1H (Aromolaran2010Ttype).

KLHL1's interaction with actin is crucial for its modulatory effects on calcium channels. The protein contains kelch repeats that form a β-propeller structure, which interacts with actin, indicating the cytoskeleton's role in channel modulation (Aromolaran2010Ttype).
