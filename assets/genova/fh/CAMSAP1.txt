# CAMSAP1

## Overview
CAMSAP1, or calmodulin regulated spectrin associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, specifically at the minus ends. The protein, categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, plays a critical role in stabilizing microtubule networks, which are essential for maintaining cellular architecture and facilitating intracellular transport. CAMSAP1 is particularly significant in neuronal cells, where it contributes to the establishment of neuronal polarity and the differentiation of axons and dendrites, processes vital for proper neuronal function and development (Zhou2020CAMSAP1). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by MARK2 kinase, which influences its microtubule-binding capacity and, consequently, its role in cellular processes (Zhou2020CAMSAP1). Additionally, CAMSAP1 is implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer, where its expression levels and mutations can impact prognosis and treatment outcomes (Wang2022Noncoding; Yi2022CAMSAP1).

## Structure
CAMSAP1, a protein involved in microtubule stabilization, features a crucial C-terminal CKK domain that binds to microtubule minus ends, playing a significant role in their recognition and protection. This domain is conserved across eukaryotes and is essential for the protein's function in organizing non-centrosomal microtubule networks (Atherton2017A). The CKK domain has a compact, globular structure with two N-terminal α-helices and a central five-stranded β-sheet, as revealed by X-ray crystallography (Atherton2017A). 

The interaction of the CKK domain with microtubules is characterized by its binding at the inter-protofilament interface, primarily associating with β-tubulin subunits (Atherton2017A). This binding is facilitated by electrostatic interactions, with the CKK domain showing a preference for microtubule minus ends over plus ends (Atherton2017A). 

CAMSAP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by MARK2 kinase, which affects its microtubule-binding ability and influences neuronal polarity (Zhou2020CAMSAP1). The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can impact its function and localization. However, specific details on the primary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CAMSAP1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CAMSAP1 (calmodulin regulated spectrin associated protein 1) is a crucial regulator of microtubule dynamics, particularly at the minus ends, which are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function. In healthy human cells, CAMSAP1 stabilizes microtubule minus-ends, preventing their depolymerization and ensuring the stability of the microtubule network. This stabilization is vital for various cellular processes, including cell shape maintenance, intracellular transport, and proper cell division (Zhou2020CAMSAP1).

CAMSAP1 is involved in the establishment of neuronal polarity by regulating the stability of noncentrosomal microtubule minus-ends. It plays a significant role in axon and dendrite differentiation, which is crucial for neuronal development and function. The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation through the MARK2 signaling pathway, which affects its binding to microtubules and influences the asymmetric distribution of microtubules necessary for neuronal polarity (Zhou2020CAMSAP1).

In osteoblasts, CAMSAP1 is directly regulated by miR-126, suggesting its involvement in bone formation and interaction with endothelial cells, which is important for osteoblast function and differentiation (Strassburg2017Calmodulin). CAMSAP1's role in these processes highlights its importance in both cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
CAMSAP1 mutations and alterations in its expression levels have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), CAMSAP1 mutations are associated with improved prognosis and increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. These mutations activate anti-tumor immunity, mediate tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition, contributing to better patient outcomes (Yi2022CAMSAP1). The mutation frequency of CAMSAP1 in SCLC patients varies, with 21.99% in the Zhujiang cohort and 7.27% in a reported cohort, and is linked to longer overall survival (Yi2022CAMSAP1).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), CAMSAP1 overexpression is linked to poor clinical outcomes. It is associated with advanced tumor stages and grades, and correlates with poor overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals. The overexpression of CAMSAP1 in LIHC is regulated by the AC145207.5/LINC01748-miR-101-3p axis, which influences its expression and contributes to a suppressed immune microenvironment (Wang2022Noncoding). CAMSAP1 expression is also associated with immune checkpoint genes, suggesting a role in immune regulation and potential tumor immune escape (Wang2022Noncoding).

## Interactions
CAMSAP1 interacts with several proteins and is involved in various cellular processes. It binds to microtubule minus-ends, playing a crucial role in stabilizing microtubule seeds and regulating microtubule dynamics. This interaction is essential for neuronal polarization and axon-dendrite differentiation (Zhou2020CAMSAP1).

CAMSAP1 is phosphorylated by MARK2 kinase, which affects its ability to bind to microtubules and influences neuronal polarity. The interaction between CAMSAP1 and MARK2 involves the region of amino acids 1,287 to 1,464 of CAMSAP1 and the MARK2 spacer domain, with phosphorylation occurring at the serine residue S1485 (Zhou2020CAMSAP1).

CAMSAP1 also interacts with Wdr47, which recruits CAMSAP1 to the ciliary central lumen, facilitating the formation of central microtubules in cilia. This interaction is mapped to the linker region between the CH and the first coiled coil domains of CAMSAP1 (312-858 aa) (Liu2021Wdr47).

CAMSAP1 is regulated by miR-126, which directly binds to its mRNA, affecting its expression levels. This regulation is significant for cellular polarization and migration (Strassburg2017Calmodulin).
