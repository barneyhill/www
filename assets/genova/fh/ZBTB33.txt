# ZBTB33

## Overview
ZBTB33 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and BTB domain containing 33, commonly referred to as Kaiso. Kaiso is a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger and BTB/POZ domains, which facilitate its role in gene regulation. The protein is involved in binding both methylated and unmethylated DNA sequences, allowing it to influence gene expression by interacting with chromatin and other transcription factors. Kaiso's ability to bind methylated CpG dinucleotides and specific unmethylated motifs positions it as a versatile regulator, capable of acting as both a repressor and an activator of transcription depending on the context (Daniel2002The; Blattler2013ZBTB33). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as CTCF and histone deacetylase complexes, further modulate its regulatory functions (Defossez2005The; Blattler2013ZBTB33). Kaiso's role in various cellular processes, including autophagy and cancer progression, underscores its clinical significance, particularly in the context of tumor biology (Wang2018Kaiso; Singhal2021Kaiso).

## Structure
ZBTB33, also known as Kaiso, is a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger and BTB/POZ domains. The protein is composed of 672 amino acids and includes an N-terminal POZ/BTB domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions, and a nuclear localization signal (Blattler2013ZBTB33). The C-terminal region contains three tandem C2H2 zinc finger domains responsible for DNA binding. These zinc finger domains are crucial for Kaiso's ability to bind specific DNA motifs, including both methylated CpG dinucleotides and an unmethylated sequence-specific consensus (Daniel2002The; Blattler2013ZBTB33).

The zinc finger domains mediate DNA binding, while the POZ domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, potentially inhibiting DNA binding through homodimerization and conformational changes (Daniel2002The). Kaiso's interaction with the adhesion cofactor p120 ctn, which inhibits its DNA binding, is mediated through its C-terminal zinc finger region (Daniel2002The).

ZBTB33 can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. The protein may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity. However, specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
ZBTB33, also known as Kaiso, is a transcription factor that plays a complex role in gene regulation within healthy human cells. It is known for its ability to bind both methylated and unmethylated DNA, influencing gene expression through interactions with chromatin and other transcription factors. In methylated contexts, ZBTB33 binds to specific motifs within compacted DNA, potentially acting as a pioneer factor that can uncompact heterochromatin and recruit transcriptional machinery, suggesting a role in priming heterochromatin for transcriptional activation (Lin2019ZBTB33).

In contrast, recent studies indicate that ZBTB33 also binds to unmethylated regions associated with actively expressed genes, challenging the traditional view of its function as a repressor. This binding is often found at highly active promoters marked by high levels of acetylated histones, suggesting a role in maintaining active gene expression (Blattler2013ZBTB33). The protein's function is influenced by DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy, which contribute to cell type-specific binding patterns (Blattler2013ZBTB33). ZBTB33's interaction with other proteins, such as CTCF, further modulates its role in transcriptional regulation (Defossez2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZBTB33 gene, also known as Kaiso, have been implicated in various cancers. In gliomas, Kaiso expression is significantly increased, particularly in high-grade gliomas, and is negatively correlated with miR-181a levels. miR-181a acts as a tumor suppressor by downregulating Kaiso, inhibiting glioma cell proliferation and progression (Wang2018Kaiso). In breast cancer, Kaiso's subcellular distribution is associated with cancer outcomes. Cytoplasmic Kaiso is linked to more aggressive subtypes, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and is predictive of poor survival. Kaiso's interaction with autophagy-related proteins like LC3A/B suggests a role in autophagy regulation, impacting cancer progression and patient survival (Singhal2021Kaiso).

In cervical cancer, miR-4262 targets Kaiso, suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell proliferation. Overexpression of Kaiso can reverse the suppressive effects of miR-4262, indicating its role as a tumor promoter (Feng2018Upregulation). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZBTB33 in cancer, where its altered expression and interactions contribute to tumor progression and metastasis.

## Interactions
ZBTB33, also known as Kaiso, is a transcription factor that interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids. It specifically binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides and an unmethylated sequence motif, TNGCAGGA, through its C2H2 zinc finger domains (Blattler2013ZBTB33). Kaiso forms homodimers or heterodimers via its BTB/POZ domain, a common feature of its protein family (Lin2019ZBTB33).

Kaiso interacts with the CTCF protein, a DNA-binding protein that acts as an enhancer blocker. This interaction occurs between the C-terminal region of CTCF and the POZ domain of Kaiso, and it has been shown to modulate CTCF's enhancer-blocking activity (Defossez2005The). The interaction between Kaiso and CTCF is specific, as CTCF does not interact with the POZ domains of other proteins (Defossez2005The).

Kaiso also interacts with the SMRT/NCoR histone deacetylase complexes, suggesting a role in transcriptional repression. This interaction is thought to occur when Kaiso binds to methylated DNA in promoter regions, recruiting the NCoR complex to repress transcription (Blattler2013ZBTB33). Additionally, Kaiso has been linked to autophagy-related processes through its interaction with LC3A/B proteins, which are involved in autophagocytic flux and immune modulation in breast cancer (Singhal2021Kaiso).
