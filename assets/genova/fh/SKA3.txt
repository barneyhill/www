# SKA3

## Overview
The SKA3 gene encodes the spindle and kinetochore-associated complex subunit 3, a protein integral to the spindle and kinetochore-associated (SKA) complex. This complex is essential for stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachments during cell division, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability. SKA3, along with SKA1 and SKA2, forms a heterotrimeric structure that interacts with microtubules, facilitating their attachment to kinetochores. The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its function in mitosis and meiosis. SKA3's role extends to interactions with other mitotic proteins, such as the NDC80 complex and polo-like kinase-1, highlighting its importance in cell cycle regulation and its potential involvement in oncogenic processes. Aberrant expression of SKA3 has been linked to various cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Abad2014Structural; Wang2022SKA3; Tang2021Upregulation).

## Structure
The SKA3 protein is a component of the spindle and kinetochore-associated (SKA) complex, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachments during cell division. SKA3, along with SKA1 and SKA2, forms a heterotrimeric structure that is essential for the complex's function. The SKA complex is characterized by a W-shaped dimer of triple helical bundles, with SKA3 contributing to this structural configuration (Abad2014Structural).

The primary structure of SKA3 includes specific amino acid sequences that are subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. Phosphorylation at serine 34 (S34) in the hinge region of SKA3 is particularly important for regulating kinetochore-microtubule attachment stability. This modification affects the protein's ability to bind and track depolymerizing microtubules, influencing the overall stability of kinetochore attachments (Maciejowski2017Mps1).

In terms of quaternary structure, SKA3 interacts with SKA1 and SKA2 to form the SKA complex, which binds to microtubules through multiple contact sites, allowing it to recognize microtubules in various conformations (Abad2014Structural). The complex's ability to bind both straight and curved microtubule structures is facilitated by the structural flexibility provided by its components (Abad2014Structural).

## Function
The SKA3 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the spindle and kinetochore-associated (SKA) complex, which plays a significant role in mitosis. In healthy human cells, SKA3 is involved in ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division by facilitating the attachment of microtubules to kinetochores. This attachment is essential for accurate chromosome alignment and segregation, thereby maintaining genomic stability and preventing aneuploidy (Wang2022SKA3; Tang2021Upregulation).

SKA3 operates within the mitotic spindle apparatus, where it collaborates with the NDC80 complex to control and promote proper mitotic exit. It is also involved in meiotic spindle migration and anaphase spindle stability (Hu2018SKA3). The protein's activity is crucial for the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly during the G1/S and G2/M transitions, by influencing the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin D1 and p21 (Tang2021Upregulation).

In summary, SKA3 is vital for normal mitotic progression and genomic stability in healthy cells, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and cell division (Hu2018SKA3; Tang2021Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SKA3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often correlates with poor prognosis. In laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), SKA3 is highly expressed and associated with larger tumor size, advanced clinical stage, and poorer survival outcomes. Knockdown of SKA3 in LSCC cells significantly reduces proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Gao2020Targeting). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SKA3 overexpression is linked to enhanced cell proliferation and poor prognosis, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Tang2021Upregulation). 

In bladder cancer, high SKA3 expression is associated with poor overall and disease-free survival. It is also linked to immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in immune evasion (Wang2022SKA3). SKA3 is similarly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma, where it promotes cell growth and migration, correlating with poor prognosis (Sun2019SKA3). In cervical cancer, SKA3 overexpression enhances cell proliferation and migration by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, indicating its role in tumor progression (Hu2018SKA3). These findings highlight SKA3's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
SKA3, a component of the spindle and kinetochore-associated (SKA) complex, participates in several critical protein interactions essential for mitotic progression. Within the SKA complex, SKA3 interacts with SKA1 and SKA2 to form a heterotrimeric structure that localizes to spindle microtubules and kinetochores, facilitating stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments (Sivakumar2017Role). This complex is regulated by mitotic kinases such as Aurora B and Cdk1, which phosphorylate SKA proteins to control their localization and function (Sivakumar2017Role).

SKA3 also interacts with the NDC80 complex, a crucial component for recruiting SKA proteins to kinetochores. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation events mediated by Aurora B and Cdk1, with SKA3 phosphorylation at specific residues being essential for its recruitment to kinetochores (Sivakumar2017Role). Additionally, SKA3 is involved in a feedback loop with SKA1, which recruits phosphatase PP1 to kinetochores, necessary for dephosphorylating kinetochore substrates and promoting SKA localization (Sivakumar2017Role).

In the context of cancer, SKA3 interacts with polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) in breast cancer cells, where it stabilizes PLK-1 protein levels, preventing its degradation and promoting cell proliferation (Ruan2020SKA3). This interaction highlights SKA3's role in oncogenic processes, making it a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
