# NOP9

## Overview
NOP9 is a gene that encodes the NOP9 nucleolar protein, a member of the PUF family of RNA-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes 11 Pumilio (PUM) repeats that form a superhelical structure, allowing it to bind RNA with high specificity and flexibility (Zhang2016Nop9; Wang2017Nop9). The NOP9 nucleolar protein plays a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis by ensuring the proper maturation of 18S rRNA, a key component of the small ribosomal subunit. It achieves this by binding to the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of pre-rRNA, preventing premature cleavage and ensuring correct processing (Zhang2016Nop9; Zhang2020Nop9). The protein's function is essential for cellular health, and disruptions in its expression or mutations in the NOP9 gene have been linked to various health conditions, including cancer and language-learning impairments (Zhang2020Nop9).

## Structure
The NOP9 nucleolar protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes 11 Pumilio (PUM) repeats, forming a C-shaped or U-shaped fold, depending on the study (Zhang2016Nop9; Wang2017Nop9). These PUM repeats are arranged into a superhelical structure, which is distinct from the classical PUF proteins that typically have eight repeats (Wang2017Nop9). Each PUM repeat consists of three α-helices, contributing to the protein's ability to bind RNA (Wang2017Nop9).

The tertiary structure of NOP9 is described as a right-handed superhelix, which becomes more compact upon RNA binding, indicating a degree of structural plasticity (Wang2017Nop9). This flexibility allows NOP9 to adapt its conformation to interact with both single-stranded and structured RNA elements, such as those found in the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of pre-rRNA (Zhang2020Nop9; Zhang2016Nop9).

NOP9's RNA-binding capability is facilitated by specific motifs within the PUM repeats, such as the SfxxE/D motif, which is involved in RNA recognition (Zhang2016Nop9). The protein's interaction with RNA is crucial for its role in ribosome biogenesis, particularly in preventing premature cleavage of pre-18S rRNA (Zhang2016Nop9). There is no mention of post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
NOP9 is a nucleolar protein essential for the maturation of 18S rRNA, a critical component of the small ribosomal subunit. It plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis by ensuring the correct processing of pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) in the nucleolus. NOP9 prevents premature cleavage of the 20S pre-rRNA by the endonuclease Nob1, which is crucial for the proper maturation of 18S rRNA (Zhang2016Nop9; Zhang2020Nop9). The protein binds specifically to the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region of the 20S pre-rRNA, stabilizing it and preventing premature processing (Zhang2016Nop9).

NOP9 is a member of the PUF family of RNA-binding proteins, characterized by its ability to recognize both structured and single-stranded RNA elements. It contains eleven α-helical repeats that facilitate its binding to specific RNA sequences, including a single-stranded RNA sequence within the 18S rRNA and a stem-loop in the ITS1 region (Zhang2020Nop9). This binding is essential for the correct folding of the central pseudoknot region of the rRNA, which is necessary for the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit (Wang2017Nop9). In humans, defects in NOP9 are associated with various health issues, including breast cancer and language-learning impairments, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal health (Zhang2020Nop9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the NOP9 gene have been linked to several health conditions. In humans, changes in NOP9 expression levels or sequence are associated with diseases such as breast cancer, autoimmunity, and learning or language impairments. These associations highlight the clinical significance of NOP9, as its proper function is crucial for ribosomal RNA processing, and disruptions can lead to disease (Zhang2020Nop9).

The absence of Nop9 in yeast is lethal, underscoring its essential role in ribosome biogenesis. This suggests that similar disruptions in humans could have severe consequences, potentially affecting cellular growth and proliferation. Such disruptions may contribute to pathological conditions by impacting ribosomal function, which is vital for protein synthesis and cell function (Zhang2020Nop9).

While the structural and functional studies of Nop9 focus on its interactions with RNA elements, they do not directly address the clinical implications of NOP9 mutations or expression changes. However, the critical role of Nop9 in ribosome assembly and its interaction with specific RNA sequences suggest that any alterations could have significant effects on cellular processes and disease development (Zhang2020Nop9).

## Interactions
NOP9 is an essential RNA-binding protein involved in the processing of preribosomal RNA, specifically in the maturation of the 18S small ribosomal subunit rRNA. It interacts with both structured and single-stranded RNA elements of preribosomal RNA. NOP9 binds to the 20S preribosomal RNA, recognizing the 5' single-stranded region and the central double-stranded stem region, while the 3' single-stranded region adds sequence-independent binding energy to the interaction (Zhang2020Nop9). The protein uses a combination of amino- and carboxy-terminal modules for sequence and structural recognition, with the amino-terminal PUM repeats recognizing single-stranded RNA sequences or structured duplexes, and the carboxy-terminal repeats recognizing purine-rich single-stranded RNA (Zhang2020Nop9).

NOP9 also binds to the central pseudoknot region of 18S rRNA, specifically recognizing nucleotides 1140-1150 in a bipartite manner. This interaction involves specific motifs for guanine and cytosine recognition, with hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, and stacking interactions contributing to the binding (Wang2017Nop9). NOP9's interaction with 18S rRNA is crucial for the early processing of 18S rRNA and its release is necessary for the maturation of the 90S pre-ribosomal particle (Wang2017Nop9).
