# RHEX

## Overview
The RHEX gene, also known as C1ORF186, encodes a protein that functions as a regulator of hemoglobinization and erythroid cell expansion. This protein is primarily associated with the plasma membrane and is characterized by an N-terminal α-helical transmembrane domain, which facilitates its role in signal transduction. RHEX is a critical component of the erythropoietin (EPO) signaling pathway, where it interacts with the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and JAK2 kinase, undergoing phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues. These interactions are essential for the regulation of erythroid progenitor cell growth and differentiation, particularly during the transition from proerythroblasts to basophilic erythroblasts. The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in erythropoiesis and its potential implications in hematological disorders such as thalassemia and myeloproliferative diseases (Verma2014RHEX).

## Structure
The RHEX protein, also known as C1ORF186, is characterized by its unique molecular structure and specific functional domains. It is encoded at a six-exon locus, producing a singular predicted 1.6 kb nucleotide coding transcript (Verma2014RHEX). The primary structure of RHEX includes an amino-terminal hydrophobic region, which is indicative of its role in membrane association, and two carboxy-terminal candidate growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) binding sites (Verma2014RHEX). The secondary structure features an N-terminal α-helical transmembrane domain, which supports its localization at the plasma membrane (Verma2014RHEX).

RHEX is highly conserved in humans and primates, but it is not detected in rats, mice, or lower vertebrates, highlighting its evolutionary specificity (Verma2014RHEX). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific tyrosine sites (Y132 and Y141) upon erythropoietin (EPO) stimulation, which is mediated by JAK2 kinase (Verma2014RHEX). These phosphorylation sites potentially interact with the adaptor protein GRB2, influencing ERK1/2 activity and playing a role in signaling pathways that regulate erythroid differentiation (Verma2014RHEX). The quaternary structure involves coimmunoprecipitation with the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and JAK2 complexes, suggesting its role as an upstream mediator in red cell production (Verma2014RHEX).

## Function
The RHEX gene, also known as C1ORF186, encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of erythropoiesis, the process of red blood cell production. RHEX is predominantly expressed in erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) and the kidney, and it is a significant target in the erythropoietin (EPO) signaling pathway, which is essential for red blood cell production (Verma2014RHEX). The protein is associated with the plasma membrane and is involved in signal transduction, as indicated by its amino-terminal hydrophobic region and two carboxy-terminal candidate GRB2 binding sites (Verma2014RHEX).

RHEX is phosphorylated upon EPO stimulation and co-immunoprecipitates with the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and JAK2, suggesting its involvement in the EPO/EPOR signaling pathway (Verma2014RHEX). This interaction is crucial for the expansion of erythroid progenitor cells and the development of erythroblasts, particularly during the transition from proerythroblasts to basophilic erythroblasts (Verma2014RHEX). Knockdown studies have shown that reducing RHEX expression limits cell growth and affects ERK1,2 activity, which is important for cell proliferation and erythroblast development (Verma2014RHEX). These findings highlight the gene's role in supporting erythroblast development and erythroid progenitor cell expansion, with implications for understanding erythropoiesis and potential impacts on conditions like myeloproliferative diseases and thalassemia (Verma2014RHEX).

## Clinical Significance
The RHEX gene is implicated in several hematological conditions due to its role in erythroid progenitor cell expansion and erythroblast development. Alterations in RHEX expression or function can lead to ineffective erythropoiesis, as observed in conditions like thalassemia and myeloproliferative diseases. Knockdown studies of RHEX have shown persistent erythroblastic features and decreased hemoglobin beta transcript levels, indicating its critical role in erythroid differentiation (Verma2014RHEX).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), particularly the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype, RHEX is subject to super-enhancer hypermutation. This hypermutation occurs in 21% of ABC-DLBCL cases, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of this lymphoma subtype (Bal2022Super-enhancer).

RHEX is also involved in anemia associated with monoclonal gammopathy and multiple myeloma. The gene's involvement in the erythropoietin (EPO)/EPO receptor (EPOR) pathway suggests its role in erythroid recovery, although the specific molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Verma2020Molecular).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of RHEX in various blood-related disorders, emphasizing the need for further research into its pathways and interactions.

## Interactions
RHEX, a regulator of hemoglobinization and erythroid cell expansion, participates in several key interactions within erythropoiesis. It is a target of the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor (EPOR) signaling pathway and is associated with the plasma membrane, where it co-immunoprecipitates with EPOR and JAK2 complexes. This association suggests that RHEX is involved in EPO signaling pathways, particularly as a JAK2 target, with phosphorylation occurring at specific tyrosine residues (Y132 and Y141) upon EPO stimulation (Verma2014RHEX).

RHEX also interacts with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2), an adaptor protein that can mediate effects on ERK1/2 activity through the SOS and RAS pathways. The interaction between RHEX and GRB2 is enhanced upon EPO exposure, indicating a role in modulating erythroid progenitor cell growth and development (Verma2014RHEX).

Additionally, RHEX's phosphorylation is regulated by PTPN18, a phosphatase that limits EPO-induced phosphorylation of RHEX at the p-Y141 site. This regulation suggests that RHEX may have a role in modulating EPOR turnover and signaling (Held2020PhosphoPTM).
