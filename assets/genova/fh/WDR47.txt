# WDR47

## Overview
WDR47 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 47 protein, which is a multidomain protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neuronal and ciliary functions. The protein is characterized by its WD40 domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and play a critical role in neuronal survival and migration (Bayam2023Biallelic). WDR47 is essential for the formation and maintenance of ciliary central microtubules in multiciliated cells, influencing ciliary motility and structure (Liu2021Wdr47). It interacts with proteins such as CAMSAPs and Katanin to stabilize microtubule networks, crucial for both ciliary and neuronal functions (Liu2021Wdr47). Mutations in the WDR47 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including corpus callosum dysgenesis and microcephaly, highlighting its significance in brain development and function (Bayam2023Biallelic).

## Structure
The WDR47 protein is a multidomain protein characterized by several structural domains, including N-terminal LISH and CTLH domains, and seven C-terminal WD40 domains. The LISH and CTLH domains are crucial for neuronal migration and survival, while the WD40 domains are essential for neuronal survival and are involved in protein-protein interactions (Bayam2023Biallelic). The WD40 domains form a Î²-propeller structure, which is a common feature of WD-repeat proteins, facilitating their role as scaffolds for protein interactions (He2018Genome-Wide).

A notable feature of the WDR47 protein is the N-terminal domain (WDR47-NTD), which forms an intertwined dimer through a subdomain known as the cross over region (COR). This region includes a critical salt bridge between Arginine 193 and Glutamate 205, stabilizing the dimer. Mutations in this region, such as the substitution of Arginine 193 with Histidine, disrupt the salt bridge, leading to destabilization of the dimer and reduced protein expression (Bayam2023Biallelic).

WDR47 also interacts with CAMSAP family proteins, particularly CAMSAP2, at microtubule minus ends, playing a role in stabilizing the microtubule network during neuronal development (Buijs2021WDR47).

## Function
WDR47 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of ciliary central microtubules (CP MTs) in multiciliated cells. It is essential for the proper localization of CP proteins such as Spef1, Hydin, Spag6, and Spag16, which are critical for ciliary function. In the absence of WDR47, these proteins are significantly reduced, leading to defects in ciliary motility and structure (Liu2021Wdr47). WDR47 interacts with Camsaps and Katanin to facilitate the generation of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays, which are important for the planar beating of cilia. Katanin severs peripheral microtubules to create central microtubule seeds, while Camsaps stabilize these seeds, and WDR47 concentrates Camsaps into the axonemal central lumen to ensure correct positioning of the central microtubules (Liu2021Wdr47).

WDR47 is also involved in the regulation of intraflagellar transport (IFT) in cilia, particularly in the AWB chemosensory neurons of C. elegans. It influences the velocity of IFT components, indirectly affecting the IFT machinery and maintaining cilia morphology and function (Song2022A). This protein is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to neuronal development and function (Song2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR47 gene are associated with a rare neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD) and microcephaly in humans. These mutations lead to neuronal loss and significant neuroanatomical abnormalities, including microcephaly, cerebellar abnormalities, and hydrocephalus (Bayam2023Biallelic). The severity of CCD is linked to the degree of loss of function caused by specific WDR47 variants, with some mutations leading to neonatal death and agenesis of the corpus callosum (Bayam2023Biallelic).

WDR47 deficiency results in compromised axonal transport and microtubule instability, contributing to early neuronal death and reduced progenitor numbers, which are key factors in the development of microcephaly (Bayam2023Biallelic). The gene's role in maintaining mitochondrial and microtubule homeostasis is crucial for neuronal survival, and its loss leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species, and oxidative stress, paralleling mechanisms observed in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (Bayam2023Biallelic).

Additionally, WDR47 mutations have been linked to intellectual disability and other brain disorders, such as autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, due to their impact on corpus callosum development and neuronal migration (BenMahmoud2022A).

## Interactions
WDR47 interacts with several proteins involved in the formation and positioning of central microtubules in cilia. It plays a crucial role in recruiting Camsaps (Camsap1, Camsap2, and Camsap3) to the ciliary central lumen, which is essential for the proper formation of central microtubules. This interaction is mediated through the N-terminal region of WDR47, while the C-terminal region targets WDR47 to the ciliary central lumen, facilitating the enrichment of Camsaps and proper central pair (CP) formation (Liu2020Wdr47; Liu2021Wdr47). 

WDR47 also interacts with the microtubule-severing enzyme Katanin, which is necessary for generating central microtubule seeds by severing axonemal microtubule doublets. Katanin's activity is crucial for the proper formation of central microtubules, and it interacts with Camsap2 and Camsap3, localizing in multicilia (Liu2021Wdr47). 

In addition to its role in ciliary function, WDR47 is implicated in neuronal processes, where it interacts with motor proteins such as dynein and kinesin. These interactions influence the transport of intracellular organelles, including lysosomes and mitochondria, and are crucial for maintaining microtubule homeostasis (Bayam2023Biallelic).
