# NIPAL3

## Overview
NIPAL3 is a gene that encodes the protein NIPA like domain containing 3, which is primarily involved in the transmembrane transport of magnesium ions. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and plays a critical role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis within cells, a process essential for various physiological functions such as enzyme activity, DNA stability, and energy production. The expression of NIPAL3 is regulated by a complex network involving the long non-coding RNA HOXA11-AS and specific microRNAs, which modulate its activity in certain cellular contexts, such as keloid fibroblasts. This regulatory mechanism highlights the gene's involvement in broader cellular processes and its potential impact on conditions like keloid formation (Wang2021HOXA11AS).

## Structure


## Function
NIPAL3 (NIPA like domain containing 3) encodes a protein that is primarily involved in the transport of magnesium ions across cell membranes. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular processes, including enzyme function, DNA stability, and energy production. The activity of NIPAL3 is primarily localized to the cell membrane, where it facilitates the transmembrane movement of magnesium ions, a fundamental cellular process (Wang2021HOXA11AS).

In the context of keloid fibroblasts, NIPAL3 expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA HOXA11-AS through a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network involving specific microRNAs, such as hsa-miR-19a-3p, hsa-miR-141-3p, and hsa-miR-140-5p. These microRNAs act as molecular sponges to downregulate NIPAL3 expression when HOXA11-AS is knocked down (Wang2021HOXA11AS). Although the specific function of NIPAL3 in healthy human cells is not directly addressed in the study, its role in magnesium ion transport suggests it is vital for maintaining cellular magnesium levels, which are critical for numerous physiological functions (Wang2021HOXA11AS).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The NIPAL3 gene encodes a protein that is involved in magnesium ion transmembrane transport, a fundamental cellular process. In keloid fibroblasts, NIPAL3 is regulated by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) HOXA11-AS through a complex network involving specific microRNAs (miRNAs). This regulatory mechanism is part of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, where HOXA11-AS interacts with miRNAs such as hsa-miR-19a-3p, hsa-miR-141-3p, and hsa-miR-140-5p. These miRNAs act as molecular sponges, downregulating NIPAL3 expression when HOXA11-AS is knocked down (Wang2021HOXA11AS). The study highlights that the knockdown of HOXA11-AS in keloid fibroblasts leads to significant changes in mRNA expression, including that of NIPAL3, suggesting its role as a downstream target in this regulatory pathway (Wang2021HOXA11AS). This interaction network suggests that NIPAL3 is part of a broader molecular framework that influences cellular processes such as hyperproliferation and differentiation in keloid fibroblasts, potentially impacting keloid formation and other conditions (Wang2021HOXA11AS). The involvement of NIPAL3 in these interactions underscores its potential significance in cellular regulatory mechanisms.
