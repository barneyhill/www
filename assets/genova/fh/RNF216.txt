# RNF216

## Overview
RNF216 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 216, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is characterized by its RING finger domains, which are essential for its role in ubiquitination, a process that tags proteins for degradation or functional modification. RNF216 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of immune signaling pathways and neuronal functions. It plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions by influencing receptor trafficking and dendritic morphology. Mutations in the RNF216 gene have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Gordon Holmes syndrome, highlighting its importance in maintaining neurological health (Margolin2013Ataxia; Husain2016TRIAD3RNF216).

## Structure
RNF216, also known as ring finger protein 216, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase characterized by the presence of RING finger domains, which are crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity. The protein contains two RING domains, RING1 and RING2, separated by an in-between RING fingers (IBR) domain, forming a C-terminal RING1-between-RING2 (RBR) domain structure (Husain2016TRIAD3RNF216). This domain arrangement is essential for its function in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes.

The RNF216 protein also features a hairpin-like loop that connects a beta-sheet and an alpha-helix in an antiparallel fashion, which may play a role in its interaction capabilities (Neocleous2020GnRH). The molecular structure of RNF216 is further influenced by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which regulates its activity and function in cellular processes (Li2019RNF216).

Splice variants of RNF216 may exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The protein's structure and modifications are integral to its role in regulating synaptic and cognitive functions, as well as its involvement in diseases like Gordon Holmes syndrome (Husain2016TRIAD3RNF216).

## Function
RNF216, also known as TRIAD3, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitination process, primarily forming K63-linked ubiquitin chains. This activity suggests a non-degradative role, potentially acting on SUMOylated substrates, which is contrary to previous reports associating RNF216 with K48-linked ubiquitination leading to proteasomal degradation (Seenivasan2019Mechanism). RNF216 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of innate immunity signaling components like TOLL-like receptors and autophagy regulators such as BECN1. It also influences the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein ARC, which is relevant for neurodegeneration (Seenivasan2019Mechanism).

In neurons, RNF216 is distributed in both pre-and postsynaptic regions and plays a role in receptor trafficking in dendrites. It is crucial for regulating dendritic arborization and dendritic spine morphology, which are important for proper neuronal function and connectivity (Kadirvelu2023The). The protein's activity is regulated through phosphorylation, particularly at Ser-719 within the RING2 domain, enhancing its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Seenivasan2019Mechanism). RNF216's function in healthy human cells is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNF216 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, most notably Gordon Holmes syndrome (GHS), which is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, dementia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. These mutations can lead to disordered ubiquitination, affecting protein degradation pathways crucial for neuronal function (Sayman2024A; Margolin2013Ataxia). Specific mutations, such as R660C and R694C, impair the degradation of the Arc protein, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and memory, contributing to cognitive impairments observed in GHS (Husain2016TRIAD3RNF216).

RNF216 mutations have also been linked to other conditions, including Huntington-like disease and 4H syndrome, which share overlapping symptoms such as cognitive decline and movement disorders (Wu2022Gordon). The phenotypic variability in these disorders is influenced by the specific mutations within RNF216, with some affecting the RBR domain, crucial for its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (Wu2022Gordon).

Research using zebrafish models has demonstrated that RNF216 mutations can lead to developmental abnormalities in the eye and brain, further supporting the gene's role in neurodevelopmental processes (Margolin2013Ataxia). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RNF216 in maintaining neurological health.

## Interactions
RNF216, also known as ring finger protein 216, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing multiple cellular processes. It is known to interact with Toll-like receptors, such as TLR4, TLR8, and TLR9, targeting them for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby regulating innate immune signaling (Evankovich2020Tolllike). RNF216 also interacts with proteins involved in autophagy and immune signaling, including RIP1, TRAF3, and BECN1 (Evankovich2020Tolllike).

In the context of neuronal injury, RNF216 interacts with the Arc-AMPAR pathway, mediating neuronal damage following subarachnoid hemorrhage (Chen2020RNF216). It is also involved in synaptic plasticity, with its expression affecting dendritic arborization and spine morphology in hippocampal neurons (Kadirvelu2023The).

RNF216 has been shown to interact with DIAPH3 in cholangiocarcinoma, promoting its polyubiquitination and degradation, which suppresses tumor growth and metastasis by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and ERK signaling (Tu2020RNF216). Additionally, RNF216 interacts with proteins involved in endocytic processes, such as AP2s1, VPS35, and Ankrd13D, suggesting a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Schwintzer2019TRIAD3RNF216).
