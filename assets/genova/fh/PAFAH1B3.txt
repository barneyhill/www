# PAFAH1B3

## Overview
PAFAH1B3 is a gene that encodes the α1 subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b (PAF-AH1B) complex, a serine hydrolase enzyme involved in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling. The protein product, known as platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b catalytic subunit 3, plays a critical role in hydrolyzing platelet-activating factor (PAF) and oxidized phospholipids, thereby modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Long2011The; Kono2019Plateletactivating). As part of a heterotrimeric complex, PAFAH1B3 interacts with other subunits to influence processes such as Golgi complex organization and endosomal membrane trafficking (Bechler2011The; Bechler2010The). The protein is also implicated in neuronal development through its interaction with the LIS1 protein, which is crucial for neuronal migration (Nothwang2001Functional). Clinically, alterations in PAFAH1B3 expression have been associated with various cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Nothwang2001Functional; Tang2022PAFAH1B3).

## Structure
The PAFAH1B3 gene encodes the α1 subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) enzyme complex, which is a serine hydrolase involved in lipid metabolism. The α1 subunit is a 29-kDa protein that contains 231 amino acids and features a trypsin-like catalytic triad composed of Ser47, Asp192, and His195, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Hattori2015Intracellular; Kono2019Plateletactivating). The protein can form homodimers and heterodimers with the α2 subunit, contributing to its functional diversity (Hattori2015Intracellular).

The quaternary structure of the PAF-AH complex involves a heterotrimeric assembly, where the α1 and α2 subunits provide catalytic activity, while the β subunit, which contains WD-40 repeats, is involved in protein-protein interactions but not in catalysis (Hattori2015Intracellular). The β subunit is nearly identical to the LIS1 protein, which is associated with neuronal development (Hattori2015Intracellular).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may influence the activity and interactions of the PAFAH1B3 protein, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in hydrolyzing platelet-activating factor, a key signaling molecule in inflammation and other physiological processes.

## Function
PAFAH1B3 encodes a catalytic subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) Ib complex, which plays a crucial role in cellular processes by hydrolyzing platelet-activating factor (PAF) and oxidized phospholipids. This activity is essential for modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Long2011The; Kono2019Plateletactivating). The PAFAH Ib complex, including PAFAH1B3, is involved in the functional organization of the Golgi complex, where it regulates membrane tubule formation and trafficking. The catalytic activity of PAFAH1B3 is vital for maintaining Golgi structure, as its knockdown results in Golgi fragmentation and impaired reassembly (Bechler2010The).

PAFAH1B3 also plays a role in endosomal membrane trafficking, influencing the distribution and recycling of endosomes. Overexpression of PAFAH1B3 alters endosome distribution, similar to defects in dynein-dependent transport, and affects the recycling route of endocytosed transferrin and its receptors (Bechler2011The). In the nervous system, PAFAH1B3 is highly expressed and forms a major catalytic unit, suggesting a role in nervous system function, although its exact physiological functions remain largely unknown (Long2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PAFAH1B3 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), high PAFAH1B3 expression is associated with poor prognosis, advanced TNM stage, and distant metastasis. It promotes cell proliferation and invasion, and its knockdown results in cell cycle arrest and reduced tumor growth (Tang2022PAFAH1B3). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PAFAH1B3 is significantly upregulated and linked to poorer overall and disease-free survival. Its expression correlates with factors such as age, sex, and TP53 mutational status, and its inhibition reduces cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Xu2021Identification).

In breast cancer, PAFAH1B3 is overexpressed in tumors compared to normal tissue, correlating with lower recurrence-free survival. Its knockdown impairs cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness (Mulvihill2014Metabolic). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high PAFAH1B3 expression is linked to lymph node metastasis and larger tumor size. It promotes cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, and its expression is negatively regulated by KLF9, a known cancer progression inhibitor (Dong2024PAFAH1B3).

PAFAH1B3 is also involved in neurological disorders. A fusion gene involving PAFAH1B3 and CLK2, resulting from a chromosomal translocation, has been linked to mental retardation, ataxia, and brain atrophy. This fusion leads to a truncated, functionally inactive protein, highlighting PAFAH1B3's role in brain development (Nothwang2001Functional).

## Interactions
PAFAH1B3 is a subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1B (PAF-AH1B) complex, which is a G-protein-like heterotrimer involved in the inactivation of platelet-activating factor (PAF). This complex includes two other subunits, PAFAH1B1 and PAFAH1B2, and is responsible for hydrolytic activity. PAFAH1B3 interacts with the LIS1 protein, which is crucial for neuronal migration. The interaction between PAFAH1B3 and LIS1 is disrupted in cases where PAFAH1B3 is truncated, such as in the fusion gene PAFAH1B3∆ex5-CLK2∆ex1, leading to impaired brain development and function (Nothwang2001Functional).

The PAFAH1B3 protein is part of a complex that includes the α1, α2, and β subunits, with the β subunit being almost identical to the LIS1 gene. This complex is involved in various biological processes, including neuronal development. The α subunits, which include PAFAH1B3, provide catalytic activity, while the β subunit enhances the activity of the α2/α2 homodimer (Hattori2015Intracellular). The interaction of PAFAH1B3 with LIS1 is significant for its role in brain development, as it is developmentally regulated and correlates with neuronal migration (Nothwang2001Functional).
