# MYO5C

## Overview
MYO5C is a gene that encodes the motor protein myosin VC, a member of the class V myosin family. This protein is characterized by its role as a nonprocessive motor with a low duty ratio, primarily involved in intracellular transport and membrane trafficking. Myosin VC is distinguished by its structural composition, which includes a motor domain, a neck region with IQ motifs, a coiled-coil domain, and a globular tail domain, each contributing to its function in cellular processes (Kengyel2024Motor; Dolce2020Unveiling). Unlike other myosin V isoforms, myosin VC lacks a PEST domain, which influences its size and functional properties (Takagi2008Human). The protein is predominantly expressed in exocrine tissues, where it facilitates the movement and secretion of secretory granules, and it interacts with various Rab GTPases to mediate vesicle trafficking and melanosome biogenesis (Jacobs2009Myosin; Bultema2014Myosin). These interactions underscore its critical role in maintaining cellular organization and function.

## Structure
Myosin VC (MYO5C) is a motor protein with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein is composed of two heavy chains, each featuring a motor domain, a neck region with six IQ motifs, a coiled-coil domain, and a globular tail domain (Kengyel2024Motor). The motor domain binds actin in an ATP-dependent manner, while the neck region binds calmodulin or myosin light chains, which are crucial for its function (Kengyel2024Motor). The coiled-coil domain facilitates dimerization, and the globular tail domain is involved in cargo recognition and regulation (Dolce2020Unveiling).

MYO5C lacks the PEST domain found in other myosin V isoforms, making it smaller by approximately 12 kDa (Takagi2008Human). The protein's structure is further characterized by the absence of a PEST site, which is present in myosin Va and Vb, and by structural differences in the hinge region connecting the lever arm to the coiled-coil domain (Kengyel2024Motor). These structural features contribute to its function as a low duty ratio, nonprocessive motor, primarily involved in membrane trafficking and cargo transport (Takagi2008Human). The globular tail domain also plays a role in regulating motor functions through a tail inhibition mechanism influenced by calcium ions (Yao2016Identification).

## Function
MYO5C (myosin VC) is a class V myosin motor protein that plays a critical role in secretory granule trafficking within cells. It is particularly abundant in exocrine tissues such as the pancreas, prostate, and mammary gland, where it is involved in the movement and secretion of granules (Jacobs2009Myosin). MYO5C localizes to small puncta and slender tubules within cells, with the puncta associated with secretory granule markers like chromogranin A and Rab27b, and the tubules labeled by Rab8a (Jacobs2009Myosin). The puncta move slowly and independently of microtubules, while the tubules move rapidly and depend on microtubules, indicating distinct roles in cellular trafficking (Jacobs2009Myosin).

MYO5C is also involved in the exocytosis process in lacrimal gland acinar cells, where it colocalizes with Rab3D and associates with the actin cytoskeleton, facilitating the pairing of primed secretory vesicles with actin coats (Marchelletta2008The). In melanocytes, MYO5C interacts with Rab32 and Rab38 proteins, contributing to the biogenesis and secretion of melanosomes, although it is not directly involved in the secretion of mature melanosomes (Bultema2014Myosin). These functions highlight MYO5C's role in intracellular transport and secretion processes, essential for maintaining cellular organization and function.

## Interactions
MYO5C, also known as myosin VC, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular transport. It interacts with several Rab GTPases, which are key regulators of vesicle trafficking. MYO5C specifically binds to Rab3A, Rab32, and Rab38, facilitating processes such as exocytosis and melanosome biogenesis (Dolce2020Unveiling; Bultema2014Myosin). The interaction with Rab3A occurs at the globular tail domain of MYO5C, and this binding is selective, as Rab3A does not interact with Myosin Vb (Dolce2020Unveiling). 

MYO5C also interacts with Rab32 and Rab38, which are essential for melanosome biogenesis. These interactions are specific to MYO5C and do not occur with other class V myosins like Myosin Va and Myosin Vb (Bultema2014Myosin). The binding sites for these interactions are located in the tail domain of MYO5C, with specific exons being crucial for binding (Bultema2014Myosin). 

Additionally, MYO5C interacts with other proteins such as Rab7a and Rab8a, which are involved in melanosome biogenesis, but not with Rab11a or Rab27a (Bultema2014Myosin). These interactions highlight the role of MYO5C in the trafficking and secretion of melanosomes.
