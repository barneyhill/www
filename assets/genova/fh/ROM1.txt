# ROM1

## Overview
ROM1 is a gene that encodes the retinal outer segment membrane protein 1, an integral membrane protein involved in the structural integrity and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane segments and is known to form a heterotetrameric complex with peripherin-2 (PRPH2), a critical component in the morphogenesis and maintenance of photoreceptor outer segment discs. ROM1 plays a regulatory role in the stability and organization of these discs, contributing to the proper trafficking and complex formation of PRPH2, which is essential for visual signal transduction. Although ROM1 is not capable of initiating outer segment formation independently, it is crucial for maintaining the structural organization of photoreceptor cells, thereby influencing the phenotype of retinal degenerative diseases when mutated (Clarke2000Rom1; Conley2018Prph2; Goldberg1996Subunit).

## Structure
ROM1 (retinal outer segment membrane protein 1) is an integral membrane protein characterized by four transmembrane segments and a large hydrophilic loop. It shares a similar topography with peripherin/rds, another protein involved in photoreceptor disk morphogenesis, and exhibits 35% identity with peripherin/rds (Molday1994Peripherinrds). The L3-4 loop of ROM1 shares 49% identity with peripherin/rds, suggesting potential functional motifs important for its role in disk morphogenesis (Molday1994Peripherinrds).

ROM1 forms part of a tetrameric quaternary structure in complex with peripherin/rds, which is crucial for the stability and morphogenesis of photoreceptor outer segments (Goldberg1996Subunit). The complex is composed of disulfide-linked homodimers that associate to form a tetramer, with ROM1 and peripherin/rds interacting through noncovalent interactions (Goldberg1996Subunit). ROM1 does not readily form disulfide-linked oligomers on its own, indicating a reliance on peripherin/rds for stable complex formation (Loewen2000Disulfidemediated).

ROM1 lacks a consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation, consistent with the absence of migration changes upon endoglycosidase treatment (Molday1994Peripherinrds). This suggests that ROM1 does not undergo significant glycosylation as a post-translational modification.

## Function
The ROM1 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for the structural integrity and function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. ROM1 is homologous to peripherin-2 (PRPH2) and is involved in the formation and maintenance of photoreceptor outer segment (OS) discs, which are essential for capturing light and initiating visual signal transduction (Clarke2000Rom1; Conley2018Prph2). ROM1 and PRPH2 form oligomers that are vital for OS morphogenesis. While PRPH2 is essential for initiating OS formation, ROM1 plays a regulatory role, contributing to the structural stability of photoreceptor discs (Clarke2000Rom1; Conley2018Prph2).

ROM1 is involved in the trafficking and complex formation of PRPH2, which is crucial for the proper morphogenesis and maturation of photoreceptor OSs. It influences the distribution and trafficking of PRPH2 complexes, ensuring proper OS structure (Conley2018Prph2). ROM1 forms disulfide-linked heteromeric complexes with PRPH2, which are essential for maintaining the structural organization of photoreceptor discs (Zulliger2018Oligomerization). Although ROM1 is not capable of initiating OS formation on its own, it can target the OS without PRPH2, indicating its role in the structural integrity of photoreceptor cells (Conley2018Prph2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ROM1 gene are implicated in several retinal degenerative diseases. A digenic form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) arises from mutations in both the ROM1 and peripherin/RDS genes. Individuals who are double heterozygotes for mutations in these genes exhibit the disease phenotype, characterized by severely reduced electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes, while single heterozygotes remain asymptomatic (Goldberg1996Defective; Kajiwara1994Digenic). This digenic inheritance pattern is distinct from typical monogenic forms of RP (Kajiwara1994Digenic).

ROM1 mutations can also modify the phenotypes associated with PRPH2 mutations, influencing the transition between cone-targeted diseases like macular dystrophy and rod-targeted diseases such as RP. For example, the Y141C mutation in PRPH2, which retains ROM1 binding, leads to macular dystrophy, while mutations that disrupt this interaction result in RP (Conley2017Rom1). Additionally, a homozygous frameshift mutation in ROM1 has been linked to late-onset pattern macular dystrophy, a condition characterized by hyperautofluorescent flecks and reduced visual sensitivity (Ma2019Lateonset).

The role of ROM1 in modifying retinal disease phenotypes suggests its potential as a therapeutic target, although its effects can be variable and unpredictable (Strayve2020ROM1).

## Interactions
ROM1 interacts with peripherin/rds (also known as peripherin-2 or PRPH2) to form a heterotetrameric complex that is crucial for the stability and organization of photoreceptor outer segment discs. This complex is composed of disulfide-linked homodimers of peripherin/rds and ROM1, which associate through noncovalent interactions, likely involving hydrophobic transmembrane regions (Goldberg1996Subunit). The interaction between ROM1 and peripherin/rds is essential for the proper assembly and function of photoreceptor outer segments, as demonstrated by the ability of ROM1 to recruit mutant peripherin/rds into functional heterotetrameric complexes (Goldberg1996Defective).

ROM1 also plays a role in photoreceptor-specific membrane fusion processes. It enhances the fusion of membranes containing peripherin/rds, suggesting that ROM1 acts as an accessory factor in forming a fusion-competent complex (Boesze-Battaglia2007ROM-1). Although ROM1 is not inherently fusogenic, its presence in a complex with peripherin/rds significantly increases membrane fusion rates, indicating its role in photoreceptor renewal and disk morphogenesis (Boesze-Battaglia2007ROM-1).
