# ZBTB8OS

## Overview
ZBTB8OS is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and BTB domain containing 8 opposite strand. This protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in DNA binding, and a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which is often associated with protein-protein interactions. The specific biological functions of the ZBTB8OS-encoded protein remain to be fully elucidated, but it is believed to play a role in gene expression regulation and cellular processes. The gene has been implicated in various diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, gliomas, and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, suggesting its potential importance in these contexts (Liu2019Key; Wei2023Stalled; Mhatre2023Functional).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The ZBTB8OS gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its potential role in gene expression regulation and cellular processes. In the context of cardiovascular diseases, ZBTB8OS has been identified as significant in multiple analyses related to heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases, suggesting its potential relevance in these conditions. However, specific details about its mutations, expression alterations, or interactions in cardiovascular diseases are not provided, indicating a need for further research (Mhatre2023Functional).

In gliomas, particularly IDH-mutant gliomas, ZBTB8OS is part of a 1p19q classifier used to predict the 1p19q co-deletion status, which is relevant for glioma subtypes and their genetic characteristics. The clinical significance of ZBTB8OS mutations or expression changes in gliomas remains unspecified, highlighting an area for future investigation (Wei2023Stalled).

ZBTB8OS is also mentioned in the context of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), where it is listed among genes upregulated in the condition. However, the clinical implications of its upregulation in T2DM are not detailed, suggesting that its role in this disease is not yet fully understood (Liu2019Key).
