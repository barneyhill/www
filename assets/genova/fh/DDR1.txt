# DDR1

## Overview
DDR1, or discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in epithelial cells. The DDR1 protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes a discoidin domain that facilitates binding to collagen, distinguishing it from other receptor tyrosine kinases (Franceschi2023Discoidin). This protein plays a critical role in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and extracellular matrix remodeling, processes essential for tissue development and maintenance (Belfiore2018A). DDR1 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, where it contributes to maintaining structural integrity and function (Sakamoto2001Expression). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are significant in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where DDR1 is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Dawoud2023Clinical; Chen2021Recent). As a transmembrane receptor, DDR1's activation and signaling pathways are of considerable interest for therapeutic targeting in diseases characterized by abnormal DDR1 activity (Albrecht2020Transmembrane).

## Structure
The DDR1 protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes several key domains: an N-terminal discoidin domain (DS), a discoidin-like domain (DS-like), an extracellular juxtamembrane domain (EJXM), a transmembrane domain (TM), an intracellular juxtamembrane domain (IJXM), and a kinase domain (KD) (Denny2021Inhibitors). The DS domain is crucial for binding to triple-helical collagens, distinguishing DDR1 from other receptor tyrosine kinases (Franceschi2023Discoidin).

DDR1 exists in five isoforms (DDR1a-e) due to alternative splicing. Isoforms DDR1a-c are full-length functional receptors, while DDR1d and DDR1e are truncated and lack kinase activity (Chen2021Recent). The secondary structure of DDR1 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing for proper receptor function and interaction with ligands.

In terms of quaternary structure, DDR1 can form homodimers on the cell surface, which is essential for its activation and function (Agarwal2019Discoidin). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in DDR1's activation and signaling pathways (Vogel2006Sensing).

## Function
DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in epithelial cells. It is activated by collagen binding, which leads to a delayed and prolonged signaling response. This activation is crucial for processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling (Belfiore2018A; Sakamoto2001Expression).

In healthy human cells, DDR1 is involved in the regulation of cell migration and differentiation, contributing to tissue remodeling and development. It acts as a scaffold for adaptors and signaling proteins, facilitating the propagation of signaling networks initiated by ligand-stimulated receptor tyrosine kinases (Belfiore2018A). DDR1 is predominantly expressed in epithelial cells, where it is found on the basolateral surface, suggesting a role in maintaining epithelial integrity and function (Sakamoto2001Expression).

DDR1's interaction with collagen, particularly type IV collagen, is significant in the bronchial epithelium, indicating its potential role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of airway tissues (Sakamoto2001Expression). Through these interactions, DDR1 influences cellular communication and ECM interactions, which are essential for normal cellular functions and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1) plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions influencing tumor progression and metastasis. Overexpression of DDR1 is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis in several cancers, including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers (Dawoud2023Clinical; Chen2021Recent). In breast cancer, DDR1 is linked to increased proliferation and invasion, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, where its dysregulation correlates with poorer outcomes (Chen2021Recent). DDR1 also contributes to chemoresistance in glioblastoma and breast cancer by activating the AKT signaling pathway (Yang2023A).

In colorectal carcinoma, DDR1 expression is associated with advanced disease stages and higher-grade tumor types, such as mucinous and signet ring carcinomas. It correlates with lymph node invasion and potentially supports metastasis through a Wnt/β-catenin-dependent mechanism (Dawoud2023Clinical). DDR1's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in cell migration and invasion, modulating cytoskeletal organization and interacting with proteins like E-cadherin and STAT3 in various cancers (Majo2021The).

DDR1 is also implicated in treatment resistance across multiple cancer types, including lung, breast, and pancreatic cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Majo2021The).

## Interactions
DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1) is involved in several physical interactions that are crucial for its function. DDR1 forms stable, non-covalent dimers in the absence of a ligand, with dimerization occurring through contacts between extracellular domains, cytoplasmic domains, and transmembrane regions. This dimerization is maintained in an inactive state through N-glycosylation at a conserved N211 residue (Albrecht2020Transmembrane). Upon collagen binding, DDR1 undergoes clustering on the cell surface, which is essential for its activation. This clustering involves lateral dimer association and phosphorylation between dimers, a process that does not require identical cytoplasmic regions and can occur with DDR2 as the donor kinase (Juskaite2017Collagen).

DDR1's activation mechanism involves specific transmembrane domain contacts, which are crucial for signaling between DDR1 dimers. These interactions are independent of ectodomain contacts, highlighting the importance of the transmembrane domain in DDR1's physical interactions (Juskaite2017Collagen). DDR1 also interacts with the tetraspanin TM4SF1, which promotes DDR1 clustering in breast cancer cells, although this interaction requires the DDR1 ectodomain (Juskaite2017Collagen). These interactions underscore DDR1's role in cellular responses to the extracellular matrix and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases associated with abnormal DDR1 activity.
