# ATP6V1H

## Overview
ATP6V1H is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit H, a component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. V-ATPase is a critical enzyme complex involved in the acidification of intracellular compartments, which is essential for various cellular processes such as protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking. The ATP6V1H gene produces two isoforms of the protein through alternative splicing, which differ in their structural and functional properties. The protein encoded by ATP6V1H, known as V1H, plays a regulatory role in the V1 domain of V-ATPase by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis when the V1 domain is not associated with the V0 domain, thus preventing uncoupled ATPase activity. This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular energy efficiency and preventing the rapid dissipation of proton gradients. V1H is also involved in several protein interactions, including those with the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) and the Nef protein from HIV-1, highlighting its role in cellular trafficking and viral infectivity (Geyer2002Subunit; Jefferies2008Subunit). Additionally, ATP6V1H has clinical significance, with mutations linked to diseases such as osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease, making it a potential therapeutic target (Duan2016Deficiency; Hu2018Genomewide).

## Structure
The ATP6V1H gene encodes the H subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), which is part of the V1 domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis. This protein exists in two isoforms, a long and a short one, resulting from alternative splicing. The long isoform includes an additional eighteen amino acids that are conserved among mammalian species, located near the central position of a concave surface formed by the protein's large N-terminal head and small C-terminal tail. The absence of these amino acids in the short isoform results in a larger angle between the N and C parts, creating more open space in the central concave region (Zhao2018Analysis).

The long isoform has more hydrogen bonds and phosphorylation sites in the region of the eighteen amino acids, with six phosphorylation sites in human and mouse ATP6V1H and five in zebrafish (Zhao2018Analysis). The short isoform has an increased isoelectric point and a higher proportion of hydrophobic amino acids, leading to a sparser construct in the central region compared to the long isoform (Zhao2018Analysis). The Ramachandran plot indicates that the main protein structure of the two isoforms is quite similar, with only minor differences in the 'not allowed' regions (Zhao2018Analysis).

## Function
The ATP6V1H gene encodes the V1H subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), a crucial enzyme complex involved in acidifying intracellular compartments. This acidification is essential for various cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking (Molina2011Decreased; Hu2018Genomewide). The V-ATPase is composed of two main domains: the V1 domain, responsible for ATP hydrolysis, and the V0 domain, which facilitates proton translocation across membranes (Collins2020Regulation). 

Subunit H, encoded by ATP6V1H, plays a regulatory role in the V1 domain by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis when the V1 domain is not associated with the V0 domain, thus preventing uncoupled ATPase activity (Jefferies2008Subunit). This subunit acts as a mechanical brake, bridging the peripheral and central stalks of the V-ATPase, which is vital for maintaining cellular energy efficiency and preventing rapid dissipation of proton gradients (Jefferies2008Subunit). 

In healthy human cells, ATP6V1H is active in organelles such as lysosomes and endosomes, where it contributes to maintaining the acidic environment necessary for optimal enzyme activity and cellular homeostasis (Hu2018Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATP6V1H gene are associated with several diseases, primarily osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease. ATP6V1H deficiency has been linked to bone matrix loss and impaired bone formation, contributing to osteoporosis. This is due to its role in regulating the balance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity through the TGF-β1 pathway. The deficiency leads to decreased V-ATPase activity, increased intracellular pH, and impaired bone resorption, resulting in decreased bone density and increased serum calcium levels (Duan2016Deficiency). 

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the ATP6V1H gene, rs1481950, has been associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE) activity, a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's. The minor allele of this SNP correlates with higher BACE activity, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This SNP is also linked to atrophy in Alzheimer's-related brain regions and increased CSF phosphorylated tau protein levels, indicating a potential influence on Alzheimer's disease progression (Hu2018Genomewide). 

These findings highlight ATP6V1H as a potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease.

## Interactions
The ATP6V1H protein, also known as V1H, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. V1H binds to the medium chain of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), a key component of the endocytic machinery. This interaction is mediated by the central ARM repeats (3-6) in V1H and the N-terminal domain of the medium chain of AP-2 (Geyer2002Subunit). V1H also interacts with other components of the AP-2 complex, such as α and/or β2-adaptin (Geyer2002Subunit).

V1H has been shown to interact with the Nef protein from HIV-1. The C-terminal flexible loop of Nef is crucial for binding to V1H, and this interaction is important for the internalization of CD4, a receptor critical for HIV entry into cells (Geyer2002Subunit). The interaction between V1H and Nef enhances virion infectivity, indicating a significant role in the viral replicative cycle (Geyer2002Subunit).

Additionally, ATP6V1H interacts with the TGF-b receptor I, which is involved in the regulation of bone marrow stromal cell proliferation and differentiation (Li2018ATP6V1H). These interactions suggest that ATP6V1H plays a multifaceted role in cellular trafficking and signaling pathways.
