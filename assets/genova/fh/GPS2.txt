# GPS2

## Overview
The GPS2 gene encodes the G protein pathway suppressor 2, a protein that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, inflammation, and metabolic pathways. As a component of the NCoR-SMRT corepressor complex, GPS2 is involved in modulating gene expression by interacting with nuclear receptors and other transcription factors, thereby influencing processes such as erythroid differentiation and bile acid biosynthesis (Sanyal2007Involvement; Ma2020GPS2). Additionally, GPS2 functions as a negative regulator of non-proteolytic ubiquitination, impacting inflammatory signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Lentucci2017Inhibition). The protein's interactions with various cellular components underscore its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Liang2019Hepatocytespecific; Chan2021Loss).

## Function
The GPS2 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including erythroid differentiation, inflammation regulation, and bile acid biosynthesis. In erythroid differentiation, GPS2 is crucial for stabilizing the erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF/KLF1), preventing its degradation and enhancing its transcriptional activity, which is essential for the maturation of erythroid cells (Ma2020GPS2). GPS2's role in erythropoiesis is highlighted by its necessity for the proper differentiation of erythroid cells in human umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells (Ma2020GPS2).

In the context of inflammation, GPS2 acts as a negative regulator of non-proteolytic ubiquitination, particularly inhibiting the E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc13. This inhibition is crucial for controlling pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, thereby preventing aberrant activation of autoimmune reactions and chronic inflammation (Lentucci2017Inhibition).

GPS2 is also involved in the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis by acting as a corepressor complex subunit. It interacts with nuclear receptors to modulate transcriptional repression, influencing the expression of key enzymes in bile acid synthesis (Sanyal2007Involvement). GPS2's diverse roles in cellular processes underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper physiological function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the GPS2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and metabolic disorders. In breast cancer, especially triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), GPS2 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene. Its loss is associated with increased tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion, primarily through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This suggests that GPS2 downregulation may contribute to cancer development and progression, and it could serve as a biomarker for breast cancers responsive to PI3K-class inhibitor drugs (Chan2021Loss).

In the context of metabolic diseases, GPS2 plays a significant role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepatocyte-specific loss of GPS2 in mice has been shown to alleviate diet-induced steatosis and fibrosis by activating lipid catabolic genes, suggesting that GPS2 promotes fatty liver disease progression by antagonizing PPARα (Liang2019Hepatocytespecific).

GPS2 is also involved in regulating inflammatory responses. Its overexpression in adipose tissue and macrophages can impair proinflammatory responses, leading to improved insulin signaling, although it may also result in hepatic steatosis (Cardamone2012A).

## Interactions
GPS2 (G protein pathway suppressor 2) is involved in numerous protein interactions that play critical roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the p53 protein, forming a complex both in vivo and in vitro, which suggests a role in modulating p53 transactivation (Peng2001AMF1). GPS2 also interacts with the exchange factor TBL1, which is crucial for its stability and the assembly of the NCoR-SMRT corepressor complex (Huang2015Exchange). 

In the context of inflammatory signaling, GPS2 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 and members of the TRAF family, including TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF6, affecting the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Cardamone2012A). GPS2 also plays a role in transcriptional repression by interacting with SHP, HDAC1, and HDAC3, acting as a bridging factor between SHP and the N-CoR complex (Sanyal2007Involvement).

GPS2 is involved in the inhibition of Ubc13-mediated ubiquitination, impacting B cell development and signaling pathways such as BCR and TLR (Lentucci2017Inhibition). It also interacts with E6 proteins from human papillomavirus, leading to its degradation in vivo (Degenhardt2001Gps2). These interactions highlight GPS2's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and signaling.
