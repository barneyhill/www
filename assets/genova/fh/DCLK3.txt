# DCLK3

## Overview
DCLK3 (doublecortin like kinase 3) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the kinase family, specifically involved in neuronal development and function. The protein, also named DCLK3, is characterized by a conserved kinase domain and a single DCX domain, which is part of the doublecortin superfamily known for its role in microtubule binding and stabilization (Reiner2006The). DCLK3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the striatum, where it plays a crucial role in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive processes (Galvan2018The). The protein's kinase activity, including autophosphorylation, is essential for its function in cellular signaling pathways and neuroprotection, notably against mutant huntingtin, which is relevant to Huntington's disease (Galvan2018The). Additionally, DCLK3 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in colorectal cancer, through its involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Liu2017The).

## Structure
The DCLK3 protein is characterized by a highly conserved kinase domain, which is crucial for its function across species (Galvan2018The). It contains a single DCX domain, specifically a C-terminal repeat, which is part of the doublecortin (DCX) superfamily known for its role in microtubule binding and stabilization (Reiner2006The). The primary structure of DCLK3 includes two mRNA species: a long form (L-DCLK3) and a short form (S-DCLK3), with the long form being more prominent in the striatum and exhibiting higher autophosphorylation activity (Galvan2018The).

A specific lysine residue (K543) is essential for the kinase activity of DCLK3, and mutation of this residue abolishes its activity (Galvan2018The). The protein is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of neurons, indicating its potential involvement in various cellular processes (Galvan2018The). While the context does not provide detailed information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, it suggests that the functional activities of DCLK3 can be modified by specific amino acid substitutions within the DCX domains (Reiner2006The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions (Galvan2018The).

## Function
DCLK3 (doublecortin like kinase 3) is a protein-coding gene that plays a significant role in neuronal development and function. It is part of the doublecortin family, which is known for its involvement in microtubule stabilization and neuronal migration. DCLK3 is expressed in the brain, particularly in the striatum, and is implicated in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive processes (Galvan2018The).

The protein encoded by DCLK3 exhibits kinase activity, which is crucial for its function in phosphorylation pathways that are essential for cellular signaling and structural dynamics. This kinase activity includes autophosphorylation, a process that is vital for the protein's function in neuroprotection against mutant huntingtin, a condition relevant to Huntington's disease (Galvan2018The). The presence of a conserved lysine residue (K543) is critical for its kinase activity, and mutation of this residue leads to a loss of function (Galvan2018The).

DCLK3's role in neuroprotection and cellular signaling pathways suggests its involvement in maintaining neuronal health and function. Its activity in the brain highlights its potential impact on cognitive processes and synaptic plasticity, contributing to the overall structural and functional integrity of neurons (Galvan2018The).

## Clinical Significance
DCLK3 has been implicated in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) through its altered expression levels. The non-coding variant rs1800734 enhances DCLK3 expression via long-range chromatin interactions, which are more pronounced in A-homozygous cell lines. This increased expression is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that contributes to cancer malignancy and metastasis (Liu2017The). Elevated DCLK3 expression has been observed in tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues, correlating with CRC progression (Liu2017The). The variant rs1800734 interacts with ETS family transcription factors, increasing enhancer activity and DCLK3 expression, which promotes EMT and metastasis (Liu2017The).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, DCLK3 has been studied for its potential neuroprotective role against mutant huntingtin, relevant to Huntington's disease. The kinase activity of DCLK3, particularly its short form (S-DCLK3), has been shown to decrease cell death induced by mutant huntingtin models, suggesting a protective mechanism (Galvan2018The). Transcriptomic analysis has identified significant gene expression changes regulated by DCLK3, indicating its role in modulating gene expression in a kinase-dependent manner, which may contribute to its neuroprotective effects (Galvan2018The).

## Interactions
DCLK3 (doublecortin like kinase 3) is involved in several interactions that influence its function and role in cellular processes. The non-coding variant rs1800734 enhances the expression of DCLK3 through long-range chromatin interactions, which are facilitated by the binding of ETS family transcription factors to the A-allele of rs1800734. This interaction increases the risk of tumor metastasis by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer (Liu2017The).

DCLK3 is also noted for its interaction with CDK5, a protein known to promote cancer metastasis through EMT regulation. Although the full molecular mechanism of DCLK3 in regulating EMT is not fully characterized, its interaction with CDK5 suggests a role in cancer progression (Liu2017The).

In the context of neuroprotection, DCLK3 has been shown to reduce cell death induced by mutant huntingtin protein in striatal neurons, indicating its potential interactions in neuroprotective pathways. However, specific protein interactions or nucleic acid interactions of DCLK3 in this context are not detailed (Galvan2018The).

DCLK3 does not interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase KLHL15, as it lacks the conserved FRY sequence necessary for such interactions, which is present in other doublecortin-like kinases (Song2024Mutations; Song2020The).
