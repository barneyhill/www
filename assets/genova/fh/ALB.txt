# ALB

## Overview
The ALB gene encodes human serum albumin (HSA), a highly abundant and multifunctional protein in blood plasma, primarily synthesized in the liver. Albumin is categorized as a transport protein, playing a pivotal role in maintaining oncotic pressure and pH balance within the bloodstream, which is essential for fluid distribution across body compartments (Mishra2021Structural; Roche2008The). Structurally, albumin is a single polypeptide chain with a molecular mass of approximately 66.5 kDa, characterized by a high content of cysteine residues forming disulfide bridges that confer stability (Sugio1999Crystal; Caridi2022Variations). The protein's tertiary structure is organized into three homologous domains, allowing it to bind a wide array of ligands, including fatty acids, hormones, drugs, and metal ions, thus facilitating nutrient transport and cellular homeostasis (Mishra2021Structural; Fanali2012Human). Additionally, albumin exhibits antioxidant properties, primarily through metal ion binding, which helps prevent oxidative stress (Roche2008The). The gene's expression is intricately regulated by interactions with various transcription factors, underscoring its critical role in physiological processes (Cereghini1987Factors; Wu1994The).

## Structure
The human albumin gene (ALB) encodes a protein that is a single polypeptide chain consisting of 585 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 66.5 kDa (Minchiotti2008Mutations; Caridi2022Variations). The primary structure includes a notable abundance of cysteine residues, which form 17 disulfide bridges, contributing to the protein's stability (Sugio1999Crystal; Fanali2012Human).

The secondary structure of albumin is predominantly composed of α-helices, accounting for about 67% of the protein, with no β-sheet structures present (KraghHansen2013Human; Caridi2022Variations). The tertiary structure is described as a heart-shaped molecule, organized into three homologous domains (I, II, and III), each further divided into two subdomains (A and B) (Sugio1999Crystal; Fanali2012Human). These domains are connected by flexible loops, allowing for structural flexibility (KraghHansen2013Human).

Post-translational modifications of albumin include glycation and oxidation, with some variants exhibiting N-glycosylation due to specific mutations (Fanali2012Human). The protein's structure allows it to bind a wide range of ligands, playing a crucial role in transport and maintaining plasma oncotic pressure (Sugio1999Crystal; Fanali2012Human).

## Function
The ALB gene encodes human serum albumin (HSA), a multifunctional protein that plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis in healthy human cells. HSA is the most abundant protein in blood plasma and is primarily synthesized in the liver. It is involved in regulating oncotic pressure and pH balance in the bloodstream, which is essential for fluid distribution between compartments (Mishra2021Structural; Roche2008The).

HSA functions as a major transport protein, binding and carrying a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous ligands, including fatty acids, hormones, drugs, and metal ions. It has multiple high-affinity and low-affinity binding sites for fatty acids, which are asymmetrically distributed throughout the protein (Mishra2021Structural). This binding capacity is crucial for nutrient transport and cellular homeostasis (Mishra2021Structural).

HSA also exhibits significant antioxidant properties, primarily through its ability to bind metal ions such as Cu2+ and Zn2+, thereby preventing the formation of free radicals and oxidative stress (Roche2008The; Turell2013The). The Cys-34 residue in HSA plays a pivotal role in scavenging reactive oxygen species, providing protection against oxidative damage (Roche2008The). These functions underscore the importance of HSA in maintaining cellular health and preventing oxidative stress-related damage (Roche2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALB gene can lead to several clinically significant conditions. Familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (FDH-T4) and familial dysalbuminemic hypertriiodothyroninemia (FDH-T3) are caused by specific mutations that increase the binding affinity of albumin for thyroid hormones, resulting in elevated serum levels of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), respectively. These conditions are dominantly inherited and can complicate the administration of ALB-binding drugs, although they do not cause disease due to normal free hormone concentrations (Zhao2023Clinical; Caridi2022Variations).

Congenital analbuminemia (CAA) is another condition resulting from mutations in the ALB gene, characterized by absent or severely reduced serum albumin levels. This autosomal recessive disorder can lead to severe prenatal complications and increased mortality in early childhood due to fluid retention and respiratory infections (Caridi2022Variations).

Hypoalbuminemia, often acquired, is associated with low serum albumin levels due to factors like decreased liver production or increased loss, and is linked to conditions such as sepsis and hepatic cirrhosis (Caridi2022Variations). These mutations and conditions highlight the critical role of albumin in maintaining physiological balance and its impact on health when altered.

## Interactions
The human albumin gene (ALB) encodes a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. Albumin interacts with nuclear factor 1 (NFI), a protein that binds to the DEII region of the albumin promoter, as demonstrated by footprint analyses showing competition between rat albumin DEII and adenovirus NFI binding sequences (Cereghini1987Factors). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of albumin gene expression, as NFI or a modified form of it binds to the DEII region, confirmed by experiments using partially purified NFI from HeLa cells (Cereghini1987Factors).

Albumin also interacts with transcription factors such as HNF1 and C/EBPα, which synergistically activate the albumin promoter. This activation involves specific domains within these transcription factors, highlighting the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating albumin expression (Wu1994The). C/EBPα, in particular, interacts with the albumin promoter through three trans-activation elements and requires cooperation with NF-Y for maximal activation (Nerlov1994Three). These interactions illustrate the complex regulatory mechanisms governing albumin gene expression, involving both direct binding to DNA and interactions with other transcription factors.
