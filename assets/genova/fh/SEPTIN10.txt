# SEPTIN10

## Overview
SEPTIN10 is a gene that encodes the protein septin 10, a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins. Septins are a group of cytoskeletal proteins that play critical roles in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization. Septin 10, in particular, is part of the SEPT6 subgroup, which is characterized by its involvement in forming stable coiled-coil dimers and hetero-oligomeric complexes essential for filament assembly and cellular structure maintenance (Dolat2013Septin; Valadares2017Septin). Although septin 10 exhibits low GTPase activity, it is crucial for stabilizing septin oligomers and is abundantly expressed in dendritic cells, where it may play a role in immune responses (Dolat2013Septin; Valadares2017Septin). The protein's interactions and structural features, such as its conserved GTP-binding domain, underscore its importance in cellular organization and function (Valadares2017Septin).

## Structure
SEPTIN10 is a member of the septin family, characterized by a conserved GTP-binding domain known as the G-domain. This domain is crucial for the protein's function and is involved in binding guanine nucleotides, although SEPTIN10 itself exhibits low GTPase activity and cannot hydrolyze GTP (Valadares2017Septin). The G-domain is flanked by N- and C-terminal domains, which are common structural features among septins (Valadares2017Septin).

The secondary structure of SEPTIN10 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of septin proteins. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its function in filament assembly (Valadares2017Septin). SEPTIN10 forms part of hetero-oligomeric complexes, contributing to its quaternary structure, which is vital for its role in cellular processes (Valadares2017Septin).

SEPTIN10 is part of the SEPT6 group, which includes other septins like SEPT6, SEPT8, SEPT11, and SEPT14. This group is known for forming stable coiled-coil dimers, which are important for filament assembly and inter-filament interactions (Valadares2017Septin). Common post-translational modifications of septins, including SEPTIN10, involve phosphorylation, which can regulate their function and interactions.

## Function
SEPTIN10 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and cytoskeletal organization. SEPTIN10 is part of the SEPT6 group, which is characterized by a lack of catalytic activity and constitutive GTP binding, suggesting a role in stabilizing septin oligomers (Dolat2013Septin). In healthy human cells, SEPTIN10 is abundantly expressed in dendritic cells, where it localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Its expression is transcriptionally upregulated upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide, indicating a potential role in the immune response, particularly in antigen presentation and the regulation of immune cell functions (Dolat2013Septin).

SEPTIN10, like other septins, is involved in forming oligomeric complexes and filamentous structures that act as scaffolds and diffusion barriers, controlling protein localization and contributing to cellular organization (Dolat2013Septin). Although the specific functions of SEPTIN10 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its expression patterns and involvement in immune responses suggest it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular structure and function, particularly in the context of the immune system (Dolat2013Septin).

## Interactions
SEPTIN10 is a member of the septin family of GTP-binding proteins, which are known to form hetero-oligomeric complexes and interact with other proteins to facilitate various cellular processes. SEPTIN10 is part of the SEPT6 subgroup, which includes SEPT6, SEPT8, SEPT11, and SEPT14. This subgroup is involved in forming septin filaments through polymerization of core particles, requiring specific interfaces for interaction between septin monomers (Rosa2020Molecular). 

The interaction of SEPTIN10 with other septins is crucial for the assembly and function of septin complexes. SEPTIN10, like other septins, participates in forming higher-order structures through homo- and hetero-dimerization mediated by their GTP-binding domains. Mutations in the G-G interface, which involves elements of the GTP-binding pocket, can disrupt septin assembly and function. SEPTIN10 is specifically mentioned as having mutations in the invariant glycine preceding a critical histidine residue in this interface, highlighting its role in septin dimerization (Angelis2016Septin).

SEPTIN10's interactions are essential for its role in cellular structure and function, contributing to the organization of the cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics. These interactions are vital for understanding the biochemical and structural aspects that govern septin filament assembly and function.
