# CSPP1

## Overview
CSPP1, or centrosome and spindle pole associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for microtubule dynamics and ciliogenesis. The CSPP1 protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, playing a significant role in stabilizing microtubules, which are essential for various cellular processes, including cell division and the formation of cilia. The protein localizes to centrosomes and kinetochore microtubules during cell division, contributing to spindle apparatus organization and chromosome segregation. Additionally, CSPP1 is vital for ciliogenesis, where it stabilizes microtubule ends and interacts with other proteins to ensure proper ciliary function. Mutations in CSPP1 are linked to ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome, characterized by neurological and developmental abnormalities (Patzke2010CSPP; van2022CSPP1).

## Structure
CSPP1, a centrosome and cilia-associated protein, has multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, including CSPP-L and CSPP-S. CSPP-L is the longer isoform, containing several predicted helical domains interspersed with regions of unknown structure, while CSPP-S lacks 294 amino acids at the N-terminus and has an internal deletion of 52 amino acids (van2022CSPP1). The CSPP-L isoform includes a 294 amino acid extension at the N-terminus and a 51 amino acid insertion between coiled-coil regions, contributing to its distinct functional properties (Patzke2006CSPP).

The CSPP1 protein features a microtubule-organizing region (MTOR) crucial for its function, preventing microtubule catastrophes and aiding in microtubule binding (van2022CSPP1). It also contains a dimerization domain (DD) and a leucine zipper (LZ), which are important for microtubule binding and stabilization (van2022CSPP1). CSPP1 binds to the luminal side of microtubules, stabilizing growing ends and damaged lattices, similar to the action of taxanes (van2022CSPP1).

CSPP1's structure includes domains responsible for inhibiting polymerization and preventing shrinkage, both predicted to be helical and less than a hundred amino acids long (van2022CSPP1). The protein's ability to stabilize microtubules is crucial for its role in ciliogenesis and microtubule dynamics.

## Function
The CSPP1 gene encodes the centrosome and spindle pole associated protein 1, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules, essential components of the cell's cytoskeleton. CSPP1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell division and ciliogenesis. During cell division, CSPP1 localizes to the centrosomes and kinetochore microtubules, contributing to the organization of the spindle apparatus and ensuring proper chromosome segregation (Patzke2010CSPP; Shaheen2014Mutations).

CSPP1 is also vital for ciliogenesis, the formation of cilia, which are important for cellular signaling pathways such as Hedgehog signaling. CSPP1 localizes to the transition zone and axoneme of the primary cilium, where it stabilizes microtubule ends and damaged lattices, preventing depolymerization and promoting ciliary axoneme elongation (van2022CSPP1; Shaheen2014Mutations). The protein interacts with nephrocystin 8 (NPHP8) and is necessary for the correct localization of NPHP8 to the basal body, which is crucial for ciliogenesis (Patzke2010CSPP).

CSPP1's role in stabilizing microtubules is similar to the action of microtubule-stabilizing compounds like taxanes, as it binds to polymerizing microtubule ends, preventing shrinkage and inducing pausing (van2022CSPP1). This stabilization is essential for maintaining microtubule integrity and dynamics, which are critical for various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and cell motility (van2022CSPP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CSPP1 gene are primarily associated with Joubert syndrome (JS), a ciliopathy characterized by a distinctive mid-hindbrain malformation known as the "molar tooth sign" on brain imaging. Individuals with CSPP1 mutations often present with symptoms such as hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, ataxia, and various ophthalmologic findings, including retinopathy and nystagmus (Akizu2014Mutations). CSPP1 mutations typically involve truncating variants, which lead to severe loss of function and are significant in the context of JS (Bachmann-Gagescu2015Joubert).

CSPP1 is also implicated in a broader range of ciliopathy phenotypes, including Meckel-Gruber syndrome, which is associated with perinatal lethality and occipital encephalocele. These conditions result from impaired ciliogenesis and defects in sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling due to CSPP1 mutations (Shaheen2014Mutations). Despite its known interactions with nephronophthisis-associated proteins, individuals with CSPP1 mutations do not typically present with kidney disease, indicating a more neural-specific function (Akizu2014Mutations).

A novel CSPP1 mutation has also been identified in a case of Inflammatory Linear Verrucous Epidermal Nevus (ILVEN), suggesting a potential link to this rare skin condition, although the exact role of CSPP1 in ILVEN remains to be fully elucidated (REN2020Inflammatory).

## Interactions
CSPP1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and ciliogenesis. It is part of a multiprotein module at ciliary tips, which includes TOGARAM1 and CEP104. These proteins likely bind to the outer microtubule surface, while CSPP1 binds to the inner surface, stabilizing growing microtubule ends and damaged lattices from the luminal side (van2022CSPP1). CSPP1 is also involved in controlling the elongation and stability of ciliary axonemes, and its absence, or that of its binding partners, impairs ciliogenesis, resulting in shorter cilia (van2022CSPP1).

CSPP1 interacts with nephrocystin proteins, particularly NPHP8, at the transition zone of cilia. CSPP-L, an isoform of CSPP, can form a ternary complex with NPHP4 through its binding to NPHP8. This interaction is crucial for the localization of NPHP8 to the basal body, which is essential for ciliogenesis (Patzke2010CSPP). CSPP-L's interaction with NPHP8 and NPHP4 has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments in both cell lines and bovine retina extracts (Patzke2010CSPP). These interactions highlight CSPP1's role in ciliary function and its potential involvement in ciliopathies.
