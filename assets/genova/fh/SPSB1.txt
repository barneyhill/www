# SPSB1

## Overview
SPSB1 is a gene that encodes the protein splA/ryanodine receptor domain and SOCS box containing 1, which is a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein is characterized by the presence of a SOCS box and a SPRY domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. SPSB1 functions primarily as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, playing a significant role in controlling inflammation and immune responses. Additionally, it is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms and TGF-β signaling, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating key biological processes. The protein's interactions with various cellular components, such as c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase and hnRNP A1, further underscore its involvement in critical pathways, including those implicated in cancer progression and metastasis (Mekbib2019The; Wang2017SPSB1mediated; Liu2018Ras).

## Structure
SPSB1 is a protein that contains a SOCS box and a SPRY domain, both of which are crucial for its function. The SOCS box is involved in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination, acting as an adaptor to recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes to target proteins (Wang2017SPSB1mediated). The SPRY domain is essential for protein binding, mediating interactions with other proteins such as Ras, where the Y129 residue plays a critical role (Liu2018Ras). 

The SOCS box domain is necessary for SPSB1's inhibitory activity on NF-κB, as mutants lacking this domain show impaired function (Georgana2020Cullin5). However, the SOCS box is not required for SPSB1's interaction with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, suggesting distinct roles for these domains in different interactions (Georgana2020Cullin5).

SPSB1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitylation, which is crucial for its role in regulating hnRNP A1 in EGF signaling (Wang2017SPSB1mediated). Multiple splice variants of SPSB1 exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
SPSB1 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning as part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In healthy human cells, SPSB1 acts as a negative regulator of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for controlling inflammation and immune responses. Depletion of SPSB1 leads to increased NF-κB activity, while its overexpression suppresses NF-κB activity in a dose-dependent manner. This regulation occurs without affecting other signaling pathways such as IRF-3, AP-1, and JAK-STAT, highlighting its specificity in modulating NF-κB responses (Georgana2019Cullin5).

SPSB1 also plays a role in the regulation of circadian rhythms by targeting the protein RevErbα for proteasomal degradation, thereby influencing the transcription of the Bmal1 gene, a key component of the circadian clock (Mekbib2019The). Additionally, SPSB1 is involved in the regulation of TGF-β signaling by promoting the degradation of the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII), thus acting as a negative regulator of this pathway (Liu2018Ras). These functions underscore SPSB1's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating key biological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SPSB1 gene have significant implications for cancer progression. SPSB1 is implicated in breast cancer recurrence by enhancing c-MET signaling, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (Wang2017SPSB1mediated). In lung adenocarcinoma, SPSB1 is upregulated alongside Rac1b, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Wang2017SPSB1mediated). The gene also plays a role in modulating EGF signaling pathways, where its interaction with hnRNP A1 affects alternative splicing and cell migration, processes that are critical in cancer metastasis (Wang2017SPSB1mediated).

SPSB1 is also involved in the regulation of TGF-β signaling, acting as a negative regulator of the TGF-β type II receptor. Alterations in SPSB1 expression, particularly due to interactions with oncogenic Ras, can enhance TGF-β signaling, promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increasing cancer cell invasiveness (Liu2018Ras). These findings suggest that targeting SPSB1 and its pathways could offer new strategies for cancer treatment, especially for patients resistant to EGFR inhibitors (Wang2017SPSB1mediated).

## Interactions
SPSB1 interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes through these interactions. It is known to bind with the c-MET receptor tyrosine kinase, enhancing c-MET signaling, which is crucial for cell survival and is implicated in breast cancer recurrence (Feng2014SPSB1). SPSB1 also interacts with the protein p21, promoting its degradation through ubiquitin-mediated processes, which affects cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells (Kim2019SPSB1).

SPSB1 forms a complex with Ras, a protein involved in TGF-β signaling. This interaction involves the SPRY domain of SPSB1 and leads to its degradation, thereby stabilizing the TGF-β type II receptor and enhancing TGF-β signaling (Liu2018Ras). The interaction between Ras and SPSB1 is mediated by the Y129 residue in the SPRY domain, and mutations in this domain can disrupt the interaction (Liu2018Ras).

SPSB1 also interacts with hnRNP A1, a splicing regulator, facilitating its ubiquitylation in response to EGF signaling. This interaction is crucial for EGF-driven cell migration and involves the recruitment of Elongin B/C-Cullin complexes to attach polyUb chains to hnRNP A1 (Wang2017SPSB1mediated).
