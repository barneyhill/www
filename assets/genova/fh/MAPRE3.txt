# MAPRE3

## Overview
MAPRE3, or microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 3, is a gene that encodes the protein end-binding protein 3 (EB3), which is a crucial component of the microtubule-associated protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cell polarity, motility, and mitotic spindle formation. EB3 localizes to the plus ends of microtubules, where it interacts with various proteins to stabilize microtubules and facilitate their interactions with other cellular structures. These interactions are vital for maintaining chromosomal stability and supporting intracellular transport. The protein's function is particularly important in the context of cancer, where it has been implicated in the progression of glioma and other cancers due to its role in microtubule dynamics and cellular structure maintenance (Kim2010Frameshift; Wang2023Dynamic).

## Structure


## Function
MAPRE3, also known as end-binding protein 3 (EB3), is a member of the microtubule-associated protein family involved in regulating microtubule dynamics. In healthy human cells, MAPRE3 localizes to the plus ends of microtubules, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cell polarity, motility, and mitotic spindle formation. These functions are essential for normal cellular processes such as cell division and intracellular transport (Kim2010Frameshift).

MAPRE3 interacts with several proteins, including drebrin, CLIP170, and APCL, a homologue of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene. These interactions suggest that MAPRE3 is involved in stabilizing microtubules and facilitating their interactions with other cellular structures, which is vital for processes like vesicular transport and chromosomal stability (Kim2010Frameshift).

The protein's ability to bind directly to the F-actin-binding protein drebrin is particularly important for enriching filopodia, structures necessary for cell attachment and motility. This interaction underscores MAPRE3's role in maintaining cell structure and function (Kim2010Frameshift). Overall, MAPRE3 is integral to the dynamic regulation of microtubules, influencing various cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
MAPRE3, also known as end-binding protein 3 (EB3), has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in microtubule dynamics. In glioma, a type of brain tumor, MAPRE3 is identified as a hub protein in protein-protein interaction networks, indicating its significant role in the disease. It is differentially expressed in glioma tissues compared to normal tissues, with most microtubule plus end regulatory genes (MPERGs) being upregulated, including MAPRE3. This differential expression is associated with significant prognostic differences in glioma patients, suggesting that MAPRE3 may play a role in cancer and immune-related pathways, particularly those associated with cancer stemness (Wang2023Dynamic).

In gastric and colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), MAPRE3 is frequently mutated. The study identified frameshift mutations in the polycytosine repeat (C8) region of exon 5, leading to premature stops in amino acid synthesis. These mutations result in the loss of the C-terminal 100 amino acids, causing a loss-of-function mutation that affects interactions with the F-actin-binding protein drebrin, potentially influencing cell polarity, motility, and mitotic spindle formation. However, no significant associations were found between MAPRE3 mutations and clinicopathological features such as age, sex, or patient survival (Kim2010Frameshift).

## Interactions
MAPRE3, also known as EB3, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics. It is known to interact with several proteins, including drebrin, CLIP-170, and APCL, a homologue of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene. These interactions are significant for maintaining microtubule stability and dynamics, which are essential for cellular processes such as cell polarity and chromosomal stability (Kim2010Frameshift).

In the context of neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells, MAPRE3 is suggested to interact with SKA3, a member of the spindle kinetochore associated complex. This interaction is proposed to promote cell cycle exit and induce differentiation, thereby mediating NRF-1-regulated neurite outgrowth (Tong2013Novel).

MAPRE3 does not show direct interaction with the Jun protein, a transcription factor involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation. This was demonstrated through pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, where MAPRE3 did not co-immunoprecipitate with Jun, indicating no direct interaction in this context (Horisawa2004In).
