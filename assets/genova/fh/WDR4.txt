# WDR4

## Overview
The WDR4 gene encodes the WD repeat domain 4 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, including tRNA modification and cilia function. The protein is characterized by its WD repeat motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and form a propeller-like structure crucial for its function (Michaud2000Isolation). WDR4 is a key component of the METTL1-WDR4 complex, responsible for the N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification of tRNA, a modification essential for tRNA stability and efficient protein synthesis (Jin2023Structural). Beyond its role in tRNA modification, WDR4 is involved in cilia maintenance and acts as a substrate adaptor for the Cullin 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, influencing protein degradation pathways (Burkhalter2024Cilia; Wu2023Wdr4). Mutations in WDR4 are linked to developmental disorders such as Galloway-Mowat syndrome and microcephalic primordial dwarfism, underscoring its critical role in brain development and cellular signaling (Shaheen2015Mutation; Braun2018Mutations).

## Structure
The WDR4 protein is characterized by the presence of four WD repeats, which are motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These repeats typically begin with Gly-His (GH) and end with Trp-Asp (WD), with 23 to 41 amino acids in between, forming a propeller structure stabilized by ligand interactions or contact with other WD repeats (Michaud2000Isolation). The secondary structure of these WD repeats includes three β-strands and two turns, similar to the G protein β subunit, which also forms a propeller structure. WDR4 also contains three strong α-helices at the C-terminus (Michaud2000Isolation).

The tertiary structure of WDR4 is suggested to be propeller-like, which is important for its function in protein interactions (Michaud2000Isolation). In the context of the METTL1-WDR4 complex, WDR4 displays a β-propeller architecture with seven blades, and blade 7 is followed by a long α-helix embedded in the interface between blade 1 and blade 7 (Jin2023Structural). This complex involves hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions, with a buried area of approximately 1004.4 Å² (Jin2023Structural). WDR4 is crucial for maintaining METTL1 protein levels and function, as its depletion decreases METTL1 expression and tRNA m7G modification levels (Jin2023Structural).

## Function
The WDR4 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the METTL1-WDR4 complex, responsible for the N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification of tRNA. This modification is essential for the stability and function of tRNAs, which in turn supports efficient and accurate protein synthesis in cells (Jin2023Structural). WDR4 is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to the regulation of protein synthesis and cellular growth by maintaining normal levels of METTL1 protein and facilitating m7G tRNA methylation (Lin2018Mettl1/Wdr4-Mediated).

In addition to its role in tRNA modification, WDR4 is involved in cilia function. Loss of WDR4 leads to cilia defects, indicating its role in maintaining cilia structure and function independently of METTL1 (Burkhalter2024Cilia). WDR4 also acts as a substrate adaptor for the Cullin 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, influencing protein degradation and recycling processes, which are crucial for cellular homeostasis (Wu2023Wdr4).

Mutations in WDR4 are associated with developmental disorders, such as microcephalic primordial dwarfism, due to its critical role in brain development and cellular signaling pathways (Lin2018Mettl1/Wdr4-Mediated; Wu2023Wdr4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR4 gene are associated with several severe developmental disorders. One such condition is Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS), characterized by a combination of renal and neurological symptoms. Patients with GAMOS often present with microcephaly, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and renal issues such as nephrotic range proteinuria and focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis. The severity of symptoms can vary within families, and the condition is linked to a homozygous mutation in WDR4 that affects splicing (Braun2018Mutations).

WDR4 mutations are also implicated in microcephalic primordial dwarfism, a condition marked by severe growth retardation and microcephaly. This disorder is associated with brain malformations, severe epileptic encephalopathy, and distinct facial dysmorphisms. The mutations impair the 7-methylguanosine modification of tRNA, crucial for proper cellular function, leading to the observed clinical features (Trimouille2017Further; Shaheen2015Mutation).

The WDR4-R170L mutation specifically results in reduced tRNA methylation, contributing to the pathogenesis of microcephalic primordial dwarfism. This mutation leads to neurological abnormalities, including severe microcephaly and agenesis of the corpus callosum, highlighting a significant impact on brain development (Shaheen2015Mutation).

## Interactions
WDR4 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its biological functions. It acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the binding of other proteins such as DDX20 and Egr1, forming a complex that is important for transcriptional regulation in bladder cancer. This complex represses the transcription of the ARRB2 gene, a tumor suppressor, by recruiting DDX20 to the transcriptional regulatory region, thereby inhibiting Egr1-facilitated transcription (Wang2023WDR4).

WDR4 also interacts with METTL1 to form a complex that enhances tRNA N7-methylguanosine methyltransferase activity. This interaction is essential for maintaining normal METTL1 protein levels and tRNA m7G modification, which are crucial for tRNA stability and function. The METTL1-WDR4 complex is structurally similar to the yeast tRNA m7G methyltransferase complex Trm8-Trm82, with interactions involving hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (Jin2023Structural).

In the context of cerebellar development, WDR4 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of Arhgap17, a GTPase-activating protein, leading to the activation of Rac1, which supports granule neuron precursor proliferation (Wu2023Wdr4). These interactions highlight WDR4's role in various cellular processes and its potential implications in disease contexts.
