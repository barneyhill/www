# DEFB130A

## Overview
The DEFB130A gene encodes the protein defensin beta 130A, which is a member of the β-defensin family, known for their role in the innate immune response. Defensin beta 130A is a small, cationic, and amphipathic peptide that exhibits antimicrobial properties, primarily through its ability to disrupt microbial membranes. This protein is characterized by a conserved arrangement of six cysteine residues forming three disulfide bonds, which are essential for its structural stability and function (Terkawi2017Involvement; Pazgier2006Human). The unique structural features of defensin beta 130A, including its 'defensin-like' topological fold and a distinct acidic region, contribute to its selective antimicrobial activity without causing hemolysis of host cells (Terkawi2017Involvement).

## Structure
The DEFB130A gene encodes the β-defensin 130A protein, which is a small, cationic, and amphipathic peptide with a molecular weight of approximately 7 kDa. The primary structure of DEFB130A includes a conserved arrangement of six cysteine residues that form three disulfide bonds, a characteristic feature of β-defensins (Terkawi2017Involvement; Pazgier2006Human). These disulfide bonds are crucial for the stability of the protein's secondary structure, which consists of both α-helix and β-sheet conformations (Terkawi2017Involvement).

The tertiary structure of DEFB130A is described as having a 'defensin-like' topological fold, with a core composed of the β-sheet and an α-helix stabilized by disulfide bridges (Pazgier2006Human). This structure is typical among β-defensins and contributes to their antimicrobial activity. DEFB130A also features a unique acidic region on its surface, distinguishing it from other β-defensins (Terkawi2017Involvement).

The protein's amphipathic nature and high cationic charge, with a net charge of +9, are important for its interaction with microbial membranes, contributing to its antimicrobial properties (Terkawi2017Involvement). The peptide does not exhibit hemolytic activity at concentrations up to 200 μM, indicating its selectivity for microbial over host cell membranes (Terkawi2017Involvement).
