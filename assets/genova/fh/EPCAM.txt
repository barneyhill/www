# EPCAM

## Overview
The EPCAM gene encodes the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. EpCAM is primarily involved in the formation and maintenance of cell-cell junctions, such as adherens junctions and tight junctions, which are vital for the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues (Huang2018Functions). The protein is characterized by its extracellular domain, which contains epidermal growth factor-like repeats that facilitate homophilic interactions and adhesion (Balzar2001Epidermal). Beyond its structural role, EpCAM is implicated in various signaling pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, influencing processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer progression (EslamiS2020Epithelial). Mutations in the EPCAM gene are associated with congenital tufting enteropathy and Lynch syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in both hereditary and sporadic diseases (Tutlewska2013Germline; Pathak2018EPCAMmutation).

## Structure
The EPCAM gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion, consisting of a single polypeptide chain. The primary structure of EpCAM includes 314 amino acids, with a 265-amino acid extracellular domain, a 23-amino acid hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a 26-amino acid hydrophilic intracellular domain (Gires2020Expression). The extracellular domain, known as EpEX, features a three-partite fold with amino-terminal, thyroglobulin-like, and carboxy-terminal domains, forming heart-shaped homodimers on the cell surface (EslamiS2020Epithelial; Gires2020Expression). 

EpCAM undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at asparagine residues Asn 74, Asn 111, and Asn 198, which are crucial for its stability and expression (Gires2020Expression). The protein also undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), where it is cleaved by ADAM family proteases and the γ-secretase complex, releasing fragments that participate in intracellular signaling (Gires2020Expression). 

EpCAM's role in cell adhesion is complex, involving interactions with other molecules like claudins and cadherins, and it may not function solely as a homophilic cell adhesion molecule (Gires2020Expression). The protein is also involved in signaling pathways, influencing processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression (EslamiS2020Epithelial).

## Function
The EPCAM gene encodes the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation in healthy human cells. EpCAM is involved in the formation and maintenance of cell-cell junctions, particularly adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs), which are essential for the structural integrity and function of epithelial tissues (Huang2018Functions). It interacts with claudin proteins, such as claudin-7, to form complexes that protect these proteins from degradation, thereby maintaining their levels and function (Huang2018Functions).

EpCAM is also involved in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and polarity. It affects tight junctions without causing gross abnormalities in cell polarity and is involved in several signaling pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway and the activation of AKT, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Huang2018Functions). In the intestinal epithelium, EpCAM maintains the integrity of TJs, which are essential for selective permeability and barrier function (Huang2018Functions).

Subcellularly, EpCAM is localized to TJs, AJs, and lateral membranes, and its intracellular domain can be found in the cytoplasm, perinucleus, and nuclei of certain carcinoma cells (Huang2018Functions). This localization supports its role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EPCAM gene are linked to several diseases, most notably congenital tufting enteropathy (CTE) and Lynch syndrome. CTE is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic inactivation of EPCAM, leading to severe chronic diarrhea and growth restriction in infants. This condition is characterized by intestinal defects such as villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, with focal epithelial tufts in the duodenum and jejunum (Pathak2018EPCAMmutation; Huang2018Functions). 

Lynch syndrome, a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, is associated with monoallelic deletions at the 3' end of EPCAM. These deletions result in the epigenetic silencing of the downstream MSH2 gene, crucial for DNA mismatch repair, thereby increasing the risk of colorectal and other cancers (Tutlewska2013Germline; Pathak2018EPCAMmutation). EPCAM deletions account for a significant proportion of MSH2 inactivating mutations and are often mediated by Alu repeat recombination events (Ligtenberg2012EPCAM).

Alterations in EPCAM expression are also implicated in various cancers, including epithelial carcinomas and acute myeloid leukemia. EPCAM is involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis, interacting with proteins like β-catenin to promote oncogenesis (Huang2018Functions). Its expression levels can influence disease progression, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context (Huang2018Functions).

## Interactions
EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling. It interacts with claudin proteins, particularly claudin-7, forming complexes that are crucial for the localization and expression of claudin-7 in the intestinal epithelium. This interaction is essential for maintaining the integrity of tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial tissues (Lei2012EpCAM). EpCAM also forms complexes with other claudins, such as claudins 2, 3, and 15, although the interaction with claudin-15 is relatively weak (Lei2012EpCAM).

EpCAM's extracellular domain contains epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) repeats that mediate lateral and reciprocal interactions necessary for homophilic adhesions. These interactions involve the formation of dimers and tetramers, which are important for its adhesion function (Balzar2001Epidermal). The EGF-like repeats are also involved in the recruitment of α-actinin, an adapter protein that anchors EpCAM to F-actin, facilitating its role in cell adhesion (Balzar2001Epidermal).

EpCAM is also implicated in signaling pathways, forming a complex with β-catenin and Lef-1, which translocates to the nucleus to activate genes related to cell proliferation, such as c-Myc and cyclins A and E, promoting oncogenesis (Lei2012EpCAM).
