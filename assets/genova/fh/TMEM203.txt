# TMEM203

## Overview
TMEM203 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 203, a protein integral to cellular membranes, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum. This protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and contribute to its role in cellular processes such as calcium signaling and inflammatory responses (Li2019TMEM203; Shambharkar2015TMEM203). TMEM203 is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis and plays a crucial role in the STING-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway, which is essential for immune responses. The protein's interactions with calcium modulatory proteins and its involvement in immune signaling underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and reproductive health issues (Li2019TMEM203; Shambharkar2015TMEM203).

## Structure
TMEM203 is a transmembrane protein encoded by the TMEM203 gene, characterized by its conserved nature across vertebrate species. The protein is composed of 136 amino acids and is predicted to have four transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function as a membrane protein (Li2019TMEM203; Shambharkar2015TMEM203). These transmembrane domains are crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as STING, where the N-terminal transmembrane domains of both proteins facilitate their interaction (Li2019TMEM203).

TMEM203 lacks obvious regulatory domains in its short cytoplasmic regions, which are exposed on either side of the membrane (Li2019TMEM203). Despite the absence of distinct functional domains, TMEM203 is involved in significant cellular processes, including calcium signaling and inflammatory responses (Li2019TMEM203; Shambharkar2015TMEM203).

The protein's tertiary and quaternary structures are not detailed in the available literature, nor are any specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms mentioned. TMEM203's role in cellular processes is primarily attributed to its interactions with other proteins and its localization within cellular membranes, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum (Li2019TMEM203; Shambharkar2015TMEM203).

## Function
TMEM203 is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is involved in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which increases cytoplasmic calcium concentrations and activates calcineurin-dependent transcription factors, such as CRCT1 and NFAT, by elevating basal calcium levels (Shambharkar2015TMEM203). TMEM203 is associated with calcium modulatory proteins within the ER, including IP3R, SERCA2, and STIM1, which are critical for the regulation of calcium influx and efflux into the ER (Shambharkar2015TMEM203).

In addition to its role in calcium homeostasis, TMEM203 is a crucial regulator of STING-mediated inflammatory signaling in macrophages. It is necessary for the activation of STING, which subsequently activates TBK1 and IRF3, leading to the induction of type I interferons and other immune responses (Li2019TMEM203). TMEM203 interacts with STING, forming a functional complex that is essential for the proper functioning of the STING pathway, particularly in response to stimuli like cGAMP and viral infections (Li2019TMEM203). This interaction highlights TMEM203's role in modulating immune responses in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM203 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in inflammatory signaling and calcium homeostasis. Alterations in TMEM203 expression are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease characterized by excessive type I interferon production. In SLE patients, TMEM203 expression is upregulated in T cells, correlating with disease activity and inversely with plasma levels of complement factor C3, a marker of innate immunity activation. This suggests that TMEM203 may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE by modulating STING-mediated inflammatory pathways (Li2019TMEM203).

In the context of reproductive health, TMEM203 is essential for spermatogenesis. Deficiency in TMEM203 leads to male infertility due to defects in spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis, characterized by malformed sperm heads and reduced haploid spermatids. This is linked to its role in regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis, as TMEM203 deficiency results in altered calcium handling in testicular cells (Shambharkar2015TMEM203).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMEM203 in both autoimmune and reproductive disorders, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for conditions involving dysregulated inflammation and calcium signaling.

## Interactions
TMEM203 is involved in several key interactions with proteins that regulate calcium signaling and inflammatory pathways. It interacts with STING, a protein crucial for inflammatory signaling in macrophages. This interaction is facilitated by the N-terminal transmembrane domains of both proteins, with STING's dimerization domain playing a significant role. TMEM203 localizes STING to lysosomes, and this process is disrupted in TMEM203 knockout cells (Li2019TMEM203). The interaction between TMEM203 and STING is competitive with STIM1, another protein involved in calcium regulation, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism (Li2019TMEM203).

TMEM203 also interacts with several proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are involved in calcium regulation, such as IP3R, SERCA2, and STIM1. These interactions suggest that TMEM203 is part of a complex that regulates calcium influx and efflux in the ER (Shambharkar2015TMEM203). Overexpression of TMEM203 leads to increased cytoplasmic calcium levels and activation of calcineurin, which results in the nuclear translocation of transcription factors like CRCT1 and NFAT, highlighting its role in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) (Shambharkar2015TMEM203). These interactions underscore TMEM203's role in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis and modulating immune responses.
