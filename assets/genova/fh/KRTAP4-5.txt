# KRTAP4-5

## Overview
KRTAP4-5 is a gene that encodes the keratin associated protein 4-5, a member of the keratin-associated protein family. This family of proteins is crucial for the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of hair fibers, as they interact with keratin intermediate filaments to form a supportive matrix. The protein encoded by KRTAP4-5 is predominantly active in the hair cortex, where it contributes to the overall texture and strength of hair. Additionally, KRTAP4-5 is expressed in the skin and plays a role in keratinization and skin development, particularly under environmental influences such as smoking and UV exposure. These factors can modulate the expression of KRTAP4-5, impacting skin differentiation and development, especially in specific populations like middle-aged female smokers (Lin2017The; Pease2022Transcriptomic).

## Function
KRTAP4-5 (keratin associated protein 4-5) is a member of the keratin-associated protein family, which plays a significant role in the structure and function of hair. These proteins interact with keratin intermediate filaments to form a matrix that provides mechanical strength and resilience to hair fibers. KRTAP4-5 is primarily active in the hair cortex, contributing to hair fiber integrity and texture (Lin2017The).

In the context of skin, KRTAP4-5 is involved in the processes of keratinization and skin development. It is expressed in the skin, particularly in conditions affected by environmental factors such as smoking and UV exposure. These factors can influence the expression of KRTAP4-5, which is associated with changes in skin development and differentiation, especially in middle-aged female smokers (Pease2022Transcriptomic). The expression of KRTAP4-5 is also linked to changes in fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix, which are crucial for maintaining skin structure and function (Pease2022Transcriptomic).

While the specific molecular activities of KRTAP4-5 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, its role in hair and skin suggests it is integral to maintaining the structural integrity and resilience of these tissues.
