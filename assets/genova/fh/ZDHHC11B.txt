# ZDHHC11B

## Overview
ZDHHC11B is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type containing 11B, which is part of the DHHC family of proteins characterized by the presence of a zinc finger DHHC domain. This domain is involved in palmitoylation, a post-translational modification process that attaches palmitic acid to cysteine residues on target proteins, thereby influencing their membrane association, stability, and function. The ZDHHC11B protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein trafficking, due to its role as a palmitoyltransferase. While the specific biological functions and interactions of ZDHHC11B remain under investigation, its involvement in critical cellular pathways suggests potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
