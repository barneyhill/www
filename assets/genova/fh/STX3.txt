# STX3

## Overview
STX3 is a gene that encodes the protein syntaxin 3, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) protein family, which is integral to the process of vesicle fusion and exocytosis. Syntaxin 3 is characterized as a transmembrane protein with a SNARE motif, playing a pivotal role in membrane fusion processes, particularly in polarized epithelial cells and the retina (Kakakhel2020Syntaxin). The protein is involved in the trafficking of essential proteins and the maintenance of cellular polarity, influencing processes such as the localization of photoreceptor proteins and the expression of epithelial sodium channels (Vogel2015Cargoselective; Rauh2020Effects). Mutations in the STX3 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including microvillus inclusion disease and early-onset severe retinal dystrophy, highlighting its significance in both normal physiological functions and disease states (Janecke2021Pathogenic).

## Structure
Syntaxin 3 (STX3) is a member of the SNARE protein family, which plays a crucial role in vesicle fusion. The protein contains a transmembrane domain and a SNARE motif, essential for its function in membrane fusion processes (Kakakhel2020Syntaxin). The Habc domain of STX3 is a significant structural feature, consisting of a three-helix bundle. This domain is structurally conserved across the syntaxin family, despite low sequence conservation, and is similar to the GAT domain found in GGA proteins, which are involved in ubiquitin binding (Giovannone2017The; Giovannone2020The).

STX3 is known to bind to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, a function attributed to its Habc domain. This domain's structure allows it to interact with ubiquitin through conserved hydrophobic interactions and a salt bridge, similar to the GAT domain of GGA proteins (Giovannone2017The; Giovannone2020The). The protein can undergo mono-ubiquitination, which influences its endocytosis and sorting into the endosomal/MVB pathway (Giovannone2020The).

Mutational analysis has identified key residues in the Habc domain, such as L77, E78, L80, and E83, which are involved in binding to ubiquitin chains. Alterations in these residues can affect the protein's interaction with ubiquitin, highlighting their importance in STX3's function (Giovannone2020The).

## Function
Syntaxin 3 (STX3) is a t-SNARE protein that plays a critical role in the process of vesicle fusion and exocytosis, particularly in polarized epithelial cells. It is primarily active at the apical plasma membrane, where it facilitates the selective transport of cargo molecules. STX3 interacts with various proteins, including Myosin Vb (Myo5B), Rab8, Rab11, synaptotagmin-like protein 4a (Slp4a), and Vamp7, to mediate the final steps of the apical trafficking pathway. This process is essential for the proper localization of transporters and enzymes, maintaining epithelial polarity and function (Vogel2015Cargoselective).

In the retina, STX3 is involved in the trafficking of photoreceptor outer segment proteins, such as peripherin 2 (PRPH2) and rhodopsin. It ensures the correct localization of these proteins, which is crucial for photoreceptor function and vision. Knockout models have shown that the absence of STX3 leads to rapid photoreceptor degeneration and mislocalization of outer segment proteins (Kakakhel2020Syntaxin).

STX3 also influences the expression of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) by promoting the insertion of vesicles carrying these channels into the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing their surface expression (Rauh2020Effects).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STX3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in STX3 have been linked to microvillus inclusion disease (MVID), a severe congenital enteropathy. These variants can also lead to a syndromic condition characterized by early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (EOSRD) when they affect both retinal and intestinal transcripts (Janecke2021Pathogenic). The STX3B transcript, which is highly expressed in the retina, is crucial for photoreceptor survival, and its disruption results in severe visual impairment (Janecke2021Pathogenic).

In a consanguineous Tunisian family, a homozygous missense mutation in STX3 (c.122A>G, p.E41G) was identified, leading to autosomal recessive congenital cataract and intellectual disability. This mutation alters the protein's structure, particularly affecting the three-helix domain, and is predicted to be damaging (Chograni2014Autosomal).

Alterations in STX3 expression levels have also been implicated in cancer. In lung cancer, STX3 is downregulated and acts as a protective gene, with higher expression levels associated with better patient survival (Chen2021The). Conversely, in breast cancer, STX3 promotes tumor growth through the PTEN-PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway (Chen2021The).

## Interactions
Syntaxin 3 (STX3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in membrane trafficking and exocytosis. STX3 interacts with the serotonin transporter (SERT), where its overexpression in cells like COS-7 and AD293 leads to reduced SERT uptake activity by anchoring it in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, thus affecting its plasma membrane expression. In Caco-2 cells, STX3 knockdown slightly decreases serotonin uptake, indicating a positive regulatory role of STX3 on SERT in these cells (Motoike2021Syntaxin).

STX3 also binds ubiquitin, specifically K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, through its Habc domain, a novel characteristic for SNARE proteins. This interaction may influence its interactions with regulatory proteins such as munc13, synaptotagmin, and munc18, affecting SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (Giovannone2020The).

In mast cells, STX3 is crucial for compound exocytosis, interacting with Munc18-2, which is essential for mast cell degranulation. This interaction facilitates the homotypic fusion step of multigranular compound exocytosis (Sanchez2019Syntaxin).

In polarized epithelial cells, STX3 interacts with Myo5B, Rab11a, and other proteins to facilitate selective apical exocytosis, crucial for proper cargo transport to the apical plasma membrane (Vogel2015Cargoselective).
