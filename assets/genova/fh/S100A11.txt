# S100A11

## Overview
S100A11 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A11, a member of the S100 protein family characterized by its EF-hand motifs that facilitate calcium ion binding. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and motility, by undergoing conformational changes upon calcium binding, which enable interactions with target proteins (Zhang2021The). S100A11 is predominantly found in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Donato2012Functions). It is known to interact with proteins such as annexins A1 and A2, impacting processes like plasma membrane repair and endosomal organization (Jaiswal2014S100A11; Zhang2021The). Clinically, S100A11 is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions affecting tumor progression and patient prognosis (Xiao2017S100A11; Zheng2021Comprehensive).

## Structure
The S100A11 protein is a member of the S100 family, characterized by its ability to bind calcium ions through EF-hand motifs. It has a molecular weight of approximately 13 kDa and contains two EF-hand domains, a non-canonical EF-hand at the N-terminus and a canonical EF-hand at the C-terminus, which facilitate calcium binding and subsequent conformational changes (Zhang2021The). 

The secondary structure of S100A11 is predominantly α-helical, as confirmed by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, which shows characteristic α-helical spectra with minima near 208 nm and 222 nm (SantamariaKisiel2011Identification). Upon calcium binding, S100A11 undergoes significant conformational changes, exposing previously buried residues and increasing hydrophobic surface area, which is crucial for its interaction with target proteins such as annexins A1 and A2 (SantamariaKisiel2011Identification).

In terms of quaternary structure, S100A11 can form homodimers, which are essential for its function. The dimerization is mediated by interactions between helices I and IV, and the protein remains dimeric even in engineered chimeric forms (SantamariaKisiel2011Identification). The protein's structure is further stabilized by intraloop hydrogen bonds and calcium chelation, which are critical for maintaining its functional conformation (SantamariaKisiel2011Identification).

## Function
S100A11, a member of the S100 protein family, plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and motility by binding calcium ions, which induces conformational changes that enable interactions with target proteins (Zhang2021The). In normal human keratinocytes, S100A11 is phosphorylated by PKCα upon stimulation by calcium ions or TGFβ, promoting the expression of the p21 gene, which inhibits cell proliferation (Zhang2021The). This protein also interacts with actin filaments, inhibiting ATPase activity, which suggests a role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics (Donato2003Intracellular).

S100A11 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes like cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It translocates to the nucleus upon phosphorylation, where it binds to nucleolin and activates the cell cycle modulator p21 WAF1/CIP1, inhibiting cell growth (Donato2012Functions). S100A11 also plays a role in apoptosis by promoting the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to the nucleus, inducing apoptosis in tumor cells (Zhang2021The). Additionally, S100A11 is involved in the organization of early endosomes by interacting with Annexin A1, affecting endosomal localization and structural organization (Zhang2021The).

## Clinical Significance
S100A11, a member of the S100 protein family, is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low protein expression of S100A11 is observed, while high mRNA expression is linked to poor overall survival. Genetic mutations in S100A11 are prevalent in HCC, correlating with shorter survival and significant immune infiltration, particularly with dendritic cells (Zheng2021Comprehensive).

In pancreatic cancer, S100A11 is overexpressed and promotes cell proliferation through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to TP53 mutation status, indicating a potential interaction between S100A11 expression and genetic alterations in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Xiao2017S100A11; Li2021Prognostic).

In ovarian cancer, high S100A11 expression is associated with worse overall survival, particularly in serous ovarian cancer. It interacts with the p53 protein, inhibiting its expression and phosphorylation, which may contribute to tumor progression (Ma2019Prognostic).

S100A11 is also implicated in colorectal neoplasia, with significant differences in mRNA expression between controls and advanced adenoma groups, suggesting its role in colorectal carcinogenesis (Peterova2021Tissue).

## Interactions
S100A11 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It forms a complex with annexin A2 (ANXA2), which is essential for plasma membrane repair (PMR) by facilitating actin polymerization and membrane resealing in a calcium-dependent manner (Jaiswal2014S100A11). This interaction is particularly important in metastatic cancer cells, where S100A11 and ANXA2 help maintain membrane integrity and support cell invasiveness (Jaiswal2014S100A11).

S100A11 also interacts with annexin A1 (ANXA1), affecting endosomal organization and cholesterol transport, which is crucial for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulation (Zhang2021The). In the context of focal adhesion dynamics, S100A11 is involved in disassembly processes through interactions with myosin II-driven contractility and Piezo1-mediated calcium entry (Mohammed2023S100A11).

Additionally, S100A11 acts as a plasminogen receptor on the surface of triple-negative breast cancer cells, forming a complex with annexin A2 to facilitate plasmin generation, which enhances cancer cell invasiveness (Takahashi2024Lysyl). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of S100A11 in cellular signaling and structural organization.
