# OSBPL9

## Overview
OSBPL9 is a gene that encodes the protein oxysterol-binding protein-like 9 (ORP9), which is a member of the oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) family. This protein is primarily involved in lipid transport and cellular lipid homeostasis, playing a critical role in the transport of cholesterol between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). ORP9 exists in two isoforms: ORP9L, the full-length protein, and ORP9S, a truncated variant. ORP9L functions as a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4P)-dependent cholesterol transfer protein, while ORP9S acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor affecting cholesterol synthesis and distribution. The protein's structure includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a VAMP-associated protein (VAP) binding FFAT motif, and a sterol-binding domain, which are essential for its localization and function in lipid transport and signaling (Ngo2009Oxysterol; Liu2014Characterization). ORP9's interactions with VAPs and other proteins underscore its significance in maintaining cellular lipid balance and its potential regulatory roles in cellular signaling pathways (Kentala2016OSBPRelated).

## Structure
OSBPL9 encodes two protein variants, ORP9L and ORP9S, which are part of the oxysterol-binding protein family. ORP9L is a full-length protein that includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a VAMP-associated protein (VAP) binding FFAT motif, and a sterol-binding domain. The PH domain is specific for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4P) and is crucial for membrane binding and localization to the trans-Golgi network (Ngo2009Oxysterol; Liu2014Characterization). The sterol-binding domain, although homologous to other oxysterol-binding proteins, does not bind oxysterols in vitro (Ngo2009Oxysterol). ORP9S, a truncated variant, lacks the N-terminal PH domain, which affects its localization and function, acting as a dominant negative variant that inhibits ER-Golgi protein transport (Ngo2009Oxysterol; Liu2014Characterization).

The protein structure of ORP9 includes a conserved lipid-binding fold, characterized by a beta-barrel with a hydrophobic interior, capped with a flexible lid, allowing for the binding of sterols and phospholipids (Liu2014Characterization). The binding pocket involves conserved histidine residues crucial for PI-4P binding (Liu2014Characterization). The protein's domain organization suggests its primary function in lipid transport and signaling, mediated by interactions with organelle membranes (Liu2014Characterization).

## Function
OSBPL9, also known as oxysterol-binding protein-related protein 9 (ORP9), plays a crucial role in cholesterol transport and cellular lipid homeostasis. It is involved in the transport of cholesterol between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the trans-Golgi network (TGN), which is essential for maintaining Golgi structure and function (Ngo2009Oxysterol). ORP9 exists in two forms: ORP9L, the full-length protein, and ORP9S, a truncated variant. ORP9L is a PI-4P-dependent cholesterol transfer protein that facilitates cholesterol extraction and transfer between liposomes, with its activity enhanced by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4P) (Ngo2009Oxysterol). The protein's pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and sterol-binding domain are critical for its localization and function, with the PH domain targeting it to the Golgi and the sterol-binding domain retaining it in the ER (Ngo2009Oxysterol).

ORP9 interacts with VAMP-associated protein-A (VAP-A), which regulates its partitioning between the ER and Golgi apparatus. This interaction is mediated by a conserved FFAT motif in ORP9 and is crucial for its role in lipid or sterol transfer between these compartments (Wyles2004VAMPassociated). ORP9L's activity is vital for cholesterol distribution in post-Golgi and endosomal compartments, while ORP9S acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor, affecting cholesterol synthesis and distribution (Ngo2009Oxysterol).

## Interactions
OSBPL9, also known as ORP9, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in lipid transport and cellular processes. ORP9 interacts with VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs) through its FFAT motif, which is essential for its association with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Kentala2016OSBPRelated). This interaction is significant for the protein's role in sterol transfer between the ER and Golgi apparatus (Ngo2009Oxysterol).

ORP9 exists in two isoforms, ORP9L and ORP9S, which have distinct effects on cellular functions. ORP9L interacts with phosphoinositides, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI-4P), through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, influencing its localization between the ER and Golgi (Ngo2009Oxysterol). This interaction is crucial for maintaining Golgi structure and function, as well as for cholesterol distribution within the secretory pathway (Ngo2009Oxysterol).

ORP9 also forms dimers with other proteins, such as ORP11, mediated by its dimerization motif (Kentala2016OSBPRelated). These interactions highlight the role of OSBPL9 in lipid homeostasis and its potential regulatory functions in cellular signaling pathways.
