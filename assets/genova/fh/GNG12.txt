# GNG12

## Overview
GNG12 is a gene that encodes the G protein subunit gamma 12, a component of heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal transduction. The protein encoded by GNG12 is categorized as a transducer and transmembrane-signal regulator, playing a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways by modulating guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity. This activity is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, particularly in cancer contexts (Yuan2021Low). G protein subunit gamma 12 is known for its involvement in the regulation of inflammatory responses, acting as a negative regulator by down-regulating inflammatory mediators such as nitrite and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) (Larson2009Gng12; Chen2020Whole). The protein's structural features, including its ability to form a functional dimer with G protein beta subunits, facilitate its participation in complex signaling networks (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). GNG12's expression and function have significant implications in various diseases, including tuberculosis, glioma, and serous epithelial ovarian cancer, where its dysregulation is associated with poor clinical outcomes (Zhang2019Evaluation; Cai2021A; Chen2020Whole).

## Structure
GNG12 encodes the gamma subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, which play a crucial role in signal transduction. The primary structure of GNG12 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function and interactions. The secondary structure of the protein may include elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure refers to the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules and its role in cellular signaling pathways.

In terms of quaternary structure, GNG12 interacts with other G protein subunits to form a functional heterotrimeric complex. This interaction is vital for the protein's role in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to intracellular effectors. Post-translational modifications, such as prenylation, are known to occur in GNG12. Prenylation is a lipid modification that facilitates the protein's association with cell membranes, thereby influencing its localization and function within the cell. These structural features and modifications are critical for the proper functioning of GNG12 in signal transduction pathways.

## Function
GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is involved in several molecular processes and plays a significant role in cell biology. It encodes a transducer and transmembrane-signal regulator that is crucial for guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity, which is involved in the catalysis of GTP to GDP. This activity is associated with the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cells, particularly in the context of cancer progression (Yuan2021Low). GNG12 is active in the cell membrane, where it participates in the modulation of signaling pathways that affect organismal outcomes such as immune response and neural activity.

In healthy human cells, GNG12 acts as a negative regulator of inflammation. It has been shown to down-regulate nitrite and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels, thereby modulating inflammatory responses and preventing excessive inflammation (Larson2009Gng12; Chen2020Whole). The gene's expression is upregulated in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, indicating its role in controlling inflammatory markers in microglial cells (Larson2009Gng12). Despite its involvement in these processes, the specific functions of GNG12 in healthy human cells remain less understood, particularly outside the context of inflammation and cancer (Yuan2021Low).

## Clinical Significance
GNG12 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in inflammation and immune response regulation. In the context of tuberculosis (TB), hypermethylation of the GNG12 gene is associated with poorer outcomes in patients. This epigenetic alteration may predispose individuals to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection by dampening host immune responses, leading to delayed sputum conversion and advanced lesions. High DNA methylation levels at specific CpG sites of GNG12 correlate with significantly lower one-year survival rates in TB patients (Chen2020Whole).

In glioma, GNG12 expression is linked to poor prognosis. It is associated with increased infiltration of M2 macrophages, which are linked to poor survival outcomes. The expression of GNG12 by glioma cells influences the tumor microenvironment, contributing to the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (Cai2021A).

In serous epithelial ovarian cancer, high expression levels of GNG12 are associated with poor overall and progression-free survival. This suggests that alterations in GNG12 expression may have clinical significance in the prognosis of this cancer type (Zhang2019Evaluation).

GNG12 also acts as a negative regulator of inflammation in microglial cells, modulating the production of inflammatory mediators like TNF-α and nitrite, which may have implications in neurodegenerative diseases (Larson2009Gng12).

## Interactions
GNG12, or G protein subunit gamma 12, is involved in forming a functional dimer with G protein beta subunits, which is crucial for its role in signal transduction. In its Gβ-bound form, GNG12 exhibits a highly extended α-helical structure that participates in coiled-coil formation with the N-terminal tail of the Gβ subunit. This interaction signifies a disorder-to-order transition, resulting in a tightly bound Gβγ subunit (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The intrinsic disorder of GNG12, with a percentage of disordered residues (PDR) of 61.1%, suggests its involvement in dynamic interactions that require structural transitions (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).

While specific physical interactions of GNG12 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in the G protein complex implies interactions with various receptors and signaling proteins. The structural flexibility and intrinsic disorder of GNG12 likely facilitate its participation in multiple signaling pathways, although precise interaction partners are not explicitly mentioned in the available context (Fonin2019Multifunctionality). The multifunctionality of G proteins, including GNG12, is supported by their ability to form various heterotrimers and engage in complex signaling networks (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).
