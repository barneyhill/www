# PFN1

## Overview
Profilin 1 (PFN1) is a gene that encodes the actin-binding protein profilin 1, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is essential for various cellular processes, including actin polymerization, cell motility, and membrane dynamics. Profilin 1 functions by binding to actin monomers and facilitating their addition to the growing ends of actin filaments, thereby influencing cell shape and movement (Murk2021Profilin; Ding2012Molecular). It also interacts with poly-L-proline motifs and phosphoinositide lipids, which are crucial for its regulatory functions (Pimm2022Visualizing). Mutations in the PFN1 gene have been associated with diseases such as familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and early-onset Paget's disease of bone, highlighting its clinical significance (Wei2020Mutations; Wu2012Mutations). As a key regulator of actin dynamics, PFN1 is a potential therapeutic target for conditions involving cytoskeletal dysfunction.

## Structure
Profilin 1 (PFN1) is a small cytosolic protein that plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton regulation. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a compact, globular protein with a molecular weight of approximately 15 kDa (Pimm2022Visualizing). The secondary structure of PFN1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stable conformation (Boopathy2015Structural). The tertiary structure is characterized by a conserved fold that facilitates binding to actin and other ligands, such as poly-L-proline (PLP) containing ligands and phosphoinositide (PIP) lipids (Pimm2022Visualizing).

PFN1 does not typically form quaternary structures but can interact with other proteins, such as actin, to regulate essential cell behaviors (Pimm2022Visualizing). The protein's ability to bind actin is crucial for maintaining cellular reserves of unassembled actin monomers and inhibiting new filament formation (Pimm2022Visualizing). PFN1 can also stimulate actin assembly when paired with certain PLP-containing ligands (Pimm2022Visualizing). Common post-translational modifications of PFN1 include phosphorylation, which may affect its function and interactions. There are known splice variants of PFN1 that could influence its role in cellular dynamics and disease states (Pimm2022Visualizing).

## Function
Profilin 1 (PFN1) is a critical actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin polymerization, a fundamental process for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating cell motility. PFN1 promotes actin assembly by facilitating the addition of actin monomers to the barbed ends of actin filaments, a process essential for cell migration and membrane protrusion (Ding2012Molecular). It also accelerates nucleotide exchange on G-actin, converting ADP-actin to ATP-actin, which is necessary for actin filament elongation (Murk2021Profilin).

PFN1 acts as a gatekeeper for actin assembly, influencing both Arp2/3-dependent and independent pathways. It preferentially delivers actin monomers to pathways involving Ena/VASP and formins, while inhibiting Arp2/3 complex-based nucleation (Rotty2015Profilin1). This regulation is crucial for maintaining F-actin levels and proper actin dynamics, particularly in cells lacking the Arp2/3 complex (Rotty2015Profilin1).

In vascular endothelial cells, PFN1 is essential for migration, invasion, and capillary morphogenesis. It interacts with actin and polyproline ligands, which are crucial for these processes (Ding2009Both). PFN1's role in actin dynamics is vital for cellular processes such as signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and maintaining cell shape (Murk2021Profilin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PFN1 gene are clinically significant as they have been linked to several diseases, most notably early-onset Paget's disease of bone (PDB) and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In PDB, PFN1 mutations, including truncating and missense mutations, lead to severe skeletal deformities and high bone turnover markers. These mutations result in a severe subtype of early-onset PDB, often associated with giant cell tumors (Wei2020Mutations; Merlotti2020Mutation). The pathogenic role of PFN1 mutations in PDB is supported by mouse models that exhibit similar phenotypes (Wei2020Mutations).

In ALS, PFN1 mutations such as C71G, M114T, and G118V are associated with familial cases, accounting for 1-2% of these cases. These mutations disrupt actin dynamics, leading to inhibited neurite outgrowth and altered growth cone morphology, which are critical in motor neuron function (Wu2012Mutations). Mutant PFN1 proteins tend to form insoluble aggregates, a common feature in neurodegenerative diseases (Wu2012Mutations).

Altered expression of PFN1 is also implicated in cancer progression, affecting cell motility and invasion, although specific details on this aspect are less documented in the provided context.

## Interactions
Profilin 1 (PFN1) is a key regulator of actin dynamics, primarily through its interactions with actin monomers (G-actin) and poly-L-proline motifs in various proteins. PFN1 binds to actin monomers, which is crucial for its role in modulating actin assembly and inhibiting the Arp2/3 complex-dependent branch nucleation (Rotty2015Profilin1). This interaction directs actin monomers towards formin and Ena/VASP pathways, away from Arp2/3-based assembly, highlighting its role as a gatekeeper in actin assembly (Rotty2015Profilin1).

PFN1 also interacts with proteins such as Ena/VASP, which are significant in compensating for the loss of Arp2/3 complex in maintaining F-actin levels (Rotty2015Profilin1). In the context of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), PFN1 is involved in tumor cell proliferation and migration, interacting with actin and other actin assembly factors like Mena/VASP proteins, which are crucial for actin polymerization and membrane protrusion (Allen2020Actin-binding).

Additionally, PFN1's interactions with actin and polyproline are essential for vascular endothelial cell functions, including migration, invasion, and capillary morphogenesis (Ding2009Both). These interactions underscore PFN1's pivotal role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
