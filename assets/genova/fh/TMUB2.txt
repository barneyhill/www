# TMUB2

## Overview
TMUB2, or transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. The protein encoded by TMUB2 is characterized by the presence of transmembrane domains and a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, classifying it as a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This system is pivotal for the degradation and turnover of proteins, particularly those that are misfolded or in excess. TMUB2 forms a complex with RNF185 and MBRL, which is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of specific substrates, such as CYP51A1TM, thereby ensuring the quality control of endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins (van2020Quality). Beyond its role in protein degradation, TMUB2 is implicated in cellular processes related to aging and cancer, with its expression levels increasing with age and being associated with oncogenesis (RosaFernandes2022Global).

## Structure


## Function
TMUB2, or transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain containing 2, is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis in cells. It forms part of a complex with RNF185 and MBRL, playing a role in the degradation of specific substrates such as CYP51A1TM. This complex is essential for the quality control of ER membrane proteins, ensuring that misfolded or excess proteins are properly degraded (van2020Quality).

TMUB2 contains transmembrane domains and a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, which are indicative of its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a key pathway for protein degradation and turnover. The RNF185/MBRL complex, which includes TMUB2, targets proteins for ubiquitination, marking them for degradation by the proteasome (van2020Quality).

In addition to its role in protein degradation, TMUB2 is associated with cellular processes related to aging and oncogenesis, as its expression increases with age in various tissues and is linked to cancer development and progression (RosaFernandes2022Global). The specific mechanisms and substrates involved in these processes are not fully detailed, but TMUB2's involvement in ERAD suggests a significant role in cellular stress responses and protein quality control.
