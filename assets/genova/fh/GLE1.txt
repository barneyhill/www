# GLE1

## Overview
The GLE1 gene encodes the GLE1 RNA export mediator, a pivotal protein involved in the nuclear export of mRNA and the regulation of translation, particularly under stress conditions. This protein is categorized as an RNA export mediator and is essential for the proper functioning of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), where it regulates the activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5, facilitating mRNA transit from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Folkmann2014Insights; Mason2020Functions). GLE1's function is modulated by inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), which enhances its interaction with Dbp5, and by its ability to oligomerize, which is crucial for its roles in mRNA export and stress granule dynamics (Folkmann2014Insights; Mason2020Functions). Mutations in the GLE1 gene are linked to severe motor neuron diseases, including Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome 1 (LCCS1) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), underscoring its importance in neuromuscular health (Kaneb2014Deleterious; Tan2017The).

## Structure
The GLE1 protein is characterized by distinct structural domains that are crucial for its function in mRNA export. It contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain and an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), both of which are essential for oligomerization and function during mRNA export and stress response (Folkmann2014Insights; Mason2020Functions). The coiled-coil domain, spanning amino acids 152 to 360, forms a parallel orientation with a heptad repeat pattern, where hydrophobic residues at positions a and d form the core of the oligomer (Mason2020Functions). 

The C-terminal domain of GLE1 is involved in IP6 coordination and is crucial for ATPase stimulation of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 (Folkmann2014Insights). This domain is composed of alpha-helix HEAT repeats, which are important for the protein's stability and function (Folkmann2014Insights).

GLE1 exists in at least two isoforms, GLE1A and GLE1B, resulting from alternative splicing. GLE1B contains a 39 amino acid extension that interacts with Nup42 on the nuclear pore complex, facilitating mRNA export, while GLE1A is involved in stress granule formation and translation initiation during cellular stress (Mason2020Functions). The protein's oligomerization is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its interaction with other proteins and its role in stress granule dynamics (Mason2020Functions).

## Function
The GLE1 gene encodes a protein that is essential for mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, a critical step in gene expression. In healthy human cells, Gle1 functions at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by regulating the activity of the DEAD-box protein Dbp5, which is crucial for mRNA export. This regulation is facilitated by inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), which promotes an open conformation of Dbp5 for efficient ATP and RNA loading, ensuring proper mRNA transit through the NPC (Folkmann2014Insights).

Gle1 is also involved in translation regulation, particularly during stress responses. It influences stress granule dynamics and is critical for translation initiation and termination. Gle1 interacts with translation initiation factors, such as eIF3f, suggesting a conserved role in translation initiation across species (Bolger2008The; Mason2020Functions).

The protein's function is highly dependent on its ability to oligomerize, which is necessary for its role in mRNA export and stress granule assembly. Disruption of Gle1 oligomerization can lead to defects in these processes, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Mason2020Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLE1 gene are associated with several severe motor neuron diseases. Notably, GLE1 mutations are linked to Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome 1 (LCCS1) and Lethal Arthrogryposis with Anterior Horn Cell Disease (LAAHD), both characterized by fetal akinesia, joint contractures, and severe neuromuscular defects, often resulting in prenatal or perinatal lethality (Seytanoglu2016Deficiency; Tan2017The). LCCS1 is particularly severe, leading to death before the 32nd week of gestation, while LAAHD presents a milder phenotype with some infants surviving shortly after birth (Jühlen2018Moonlighting).

In addition to these congenital conditions, GLE1 mutations have been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons. Studies have identified deleterious mutations in GLE1, such as splice site, nonsense, and missense mutations, which disrupt RNA metabolism and contribute to ALS pathogenesis through a haploinsufficiency mechanism (Kaneb2014Deleterious; Li2021Mutation). These mutations affect the localization and function of the hGle1 protein, particularly its interaction with the nuclear pore complex, which is crucial for mRNA export (Kaneb2014Deleterious; Li2021Mutation). The phenotypic spectrum of GLE1-related disorders has expanded to include milder forms resembling congenital myopathy, highlighting the gene's critical role in motor neuron health (Cerino2020Extension).

## Interactions
GLE1 is a critical protein involved in mRNA export and interacts with several other proteins and nucleic acids to perform its functions. In humans, GLE1 interacts with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein hNup155. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal 29 residues of hGle1, which bind to a 177 C-terminal amino acid span in hNup155, facilitating mRNA export by allowing GLE1 to interact with hNup155 on both sides of the NPC (Rayala2004The).

GLE1 also associates with the DEAD-box protein Dbp5, a crucial interaction for mRNA export. This interaction is regulated by inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), which promotes an open conformation of Dbp5, facilitating ATP and RNA loading necessary for mRNA remodeling (Folkmann2014Insights). In yeast, GLE1 forms a complex with Nab2 and Gfd1, where Gfd1 acts as a bridging factor between GLE1 and Nab2-bound mRNA during export (Suntharalingam2004Nuclear).

In translation, GLE1 interacts with the translation termination factor Sup45 and the initiation factor eIF3, specifically the eIF3f subunit in humans. These interactions suggest a role for GLE1 in translation initiation and termination, highlighting its function beyond mRNA export (Bolger2008The).
