# TLR6

## Overview
TLR6 (Toll-like receptor 6) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane receptor, which plays a pivotal role in the innate immune system by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The protein product, toll-like receptor 6, is characterized by its extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) homology domain, which are essential for ligand recognition and downstream signaling (Takeuchi2001Discrimination; Asami2021Structural). TLR6 often forms heterodimers with TLR2, enabling the recognition of specific microbial components such as di-acylated lipopeptides, which are crucial for initiating immune responses (Takeuchi2001Discrimination; Jin2008Structures). The receptor is involved in activating signaling pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, thereby contributing to inflammatory responses and antiviral defense (Kumar2022TollLike; Asami2021Structural). TLR6's role in immune regulation underscores its significance in both innate and adaptive immunity (Kumar2022TollLike; Aluri2021TollLike).

## Structure
TLR6 is a type I transmembrane receptor characterized by an extracellular domain composed of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, a single transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) homology domain (Takeuchi2001Discrimination; Asami2021Structural). The LRR motifs form a horseshoe-like structure, which is crucial for ligand recognition and binding (Asami2021Structural). The TIR domain is involved in downstream signaling, interacting with adaptor proteins to activate transcription factors such as NF-κB (Takeuchi2001Discrimination; Asami2021Structural).

TLR6 often forms heterodimers with TLR2, which is essential for recognizing specific bacterial lipoproteins and initiating immune responses (Takeuchi2001Discrimination; Jin2008Structures). The interaction between TLR6 and TLR2 is necessary for the recognition of diacylated lipopeptides, while TLR2 alone can recognize both diacylated and triacylated lipopeptides (Takeuchi2001Discrimination).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in TLR6, which may influence its stability and function (Asami2021Structural). These modifications are crucial for the proper folding and function of the receptor, impacting its ability to respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns.

## Function
TLR6 (Toll-like receptor 6) is a crucial component of the innate immune system, primarily involved in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). It is a type I transmembrane protein that forms heterodimers with TLR2 to detect di-acylated lipopeptides from Gram-negative bacteria and mycoplasma, as well as other microbial components (Dey2022Structural; Asami2021Structural; Kumar2022TollLike). The recognition of these ligands is facilitated by leucine-rich repeats in its extracellular domain, which are essential for ligand specificity (Dey2022Structural).

Upon ligand binding, TLR6 activates signaling pathways that lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons, which are vital for inflammatory responses and antiviral defense (Asami2021Structural). This signaling is primarily mediated through the MyD88-dependent pathway, involving the formation of a myddosome complex and activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB (Kumar2022TollLike; Asami2021Structural). TLR6 is localized to the plasma membrane and is involved in immune regulation, playing a role in both innate and adaptive immune responses (Kumar2022TollLike; Aluri2021TollLike).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TLR6 gene have been implicated in various diseases. The Pro249Ser single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TLR6 is associated with a reduced risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD), suggesting a protective role against these conditions. This SNP is linked to decreased IL-6 release and reduced NF-κB activation, which may contribute to its protective effects (Hamann2013Association).

In Kawasaki Disease (KD), TLR6 variants, including intronic and exonic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), have been associated with susceptibility. These variants can affect ligand-binding affinity and NF-κB activation, potentially altering immune responses and contributing to KD susceptibility (Kim2017Whole).

TLR6 expression is significantly higher in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This increased expression is associated with enhanced cytokine production, contributing to liver inflammation and disease progression (AriasLoste2016Increased).

In tuberculosis (TB), the rs5743810 SNP in TLR6 is associated with a protective effect against the disease, potentially due to altered NF-κB signaling and cytokine production (Schurz2015TLR1; Varzari2021Synergistic).

## Interactions
TLR6 (Toll-like receptor 6) is known for its role in forming heterodimers with TLR2, which is crucial for recognizing specific ligands such as di-acylated bacterial lipopeptides. This interaction is stabilized by a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic residues that form hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions at the dimerization interface (Berglund2015The). The TLR2-TLR6 complex is characterized by a central hydrophobic core surrounded by hydrophilic residues, contributing to the stability of the complex despite a reduced number of internalized acyl tails at the dimer interface (Berglund2015The).

The transmembrane domains (TMDs) of TLR6 exhibit strong homotypic interactions, and the TIR domains are involved in downstream signaling. The TIR domains of TLR6 form symmetrical homodimeric interfaces, involving the CD loop, DD loop, and αC helix, which are important for receptor signaling (Berglund2015The). TLR6 also participates in the recognition of viral proteins, such as the HIV p24 protein, through its interaction with TLR2 (Zhou2021Viral).

In the context of immune responses to pathogens, TLR6 modulates cytokine production, influencing the balance between Th1 and Th2 cytokines during infections like candidiasis (Netea2008Role). These interactions highlight the critical role of TLR6 in immune signaling and pathogen recognition.
