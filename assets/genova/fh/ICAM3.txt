# ICAM3

## Overview
ICAM3, or intercellular adhesion molecule 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein product, ICAM-3, is predominantly expressed on the surface of leukocytes, including neutrophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes, and plays a pivotal role in immune cell adhesion and signaling. As a ligand for the integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), ICAM-3 facilitates critical interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells, which are essential for immune surveillance and response (Campanero1993ICAM3; de1992Intercellular). The protein's structure, characterized by five immunoglobulin-like domains and significant glycosylation, is crucial for its function in mediating cell adhesion processes and enhancing T cell activation (Song2005An; Sadhu1994LFA1). ICAM-3 is also involved in the formation of the immunological synapse during T cell and antigen-presenting cell interactions, acting as a costimulatory molecule in early T cell receptor signaling events (Montoya2002Role).

## Structure
ICAM-3 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its five immunoglobulin-like domains, which contribute to its secondary and tertiary structures (de1994Characterization; Sadhu1994LFA1). The protein is predominantly a straight rod, approximately 15 nm in length, suggesting a head-to-tail arrangement of these domains (Sadhu1994LFA1). The N-terminal domain of ICAM-3 is crucial for its interaction with integrins such as LFA-1 and αLβ2, with specific residues like Glu-37 and Thr-38 forming part of the integrin binding site (Song2005An; Sadhu1994LFA1).

ICAM-3 is heavily glycosylated, with five N-linked glycosylation sites on its domain 1, which influence its binding kinetics and prevent dimerization (Song2005An). These glycans are located on the periphery of the binding site, affecting the on-rate of binding to integrins (Song2005An). The protein's quaternary structure includes a dimeric form when expressed as an ICAM-3-IgG chimera, with a molecular weight of about 225 kD under non-reducing conditions (Sadhu1994LFA1). ICAM-3's structure and post-translational modifications are essential for its role in immune responses and cell adhesion processes.

## Function
ICAM-3, or intercellular adhesion molecule 3, is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of leukocytes, including neutrophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes. It plays a crucial role in the immune response by mediating cell adhesion processes. ICAM-3 serves as a ligand for the integrin leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), facilitating interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells, which are essential for immune surveillance and response (Campanero1993ICAM3; de1992Intercellular).

ICAM-3 is involved in the regulation of the LFA-1/ICAM-1 adhesion pathway, enhancing T cell activation and aggregation by increasing the avidity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1. This interaction is critical for the initial stages of immune cell activation and signaling (Campanero1993ICAM3). ICAM-3 also plays a role in the morphological changes of T lymphoblasts, such as the formation of a uropod-like structure, which is important for cell movement and interaction (Campanero1994ICAM3).

In the context of T lymphocyte and antigen-presenting cell (APC) interactions, ICAM-3 is crucial for the initial adhesive events that lead to APC recognition by T lymphocytes. It acts as a costimulatory molecule in early T cell receptor signaling events, contributing to the formation of a functional immunological synapse (Montoya2002Role).

## Interactions
ICAM3 (intercellular adhesion molecule 3) is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, primarily in the context of immune cell adhesion and signaling. It interacts with the leukocyte integrin αLβ2, also known as LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1), which is crucial for immune surveillance and leukocyte responsiveness. This interaction is characterized by a common docking mode shared among ICAM subfamily members, with ICAM3 binding to the αL I domain through specific polar interactions, including MIDAS coordination, salt bridges, and hydrogen bonding networks (Song2005An).

ICAM3 also plays a role in the regulation of the LFA-1/ICAM-1 cell adhesion pathway. It supports LFA-1-dependent lymphocyte adhesion and can enhance the avidity of LFA-1 for ICAM-1, facilitating T lymphoblast attachment and aggregation (Campanero1993ICAM3). This interaction is essential for the initial phases of leukocyte cell-cell contacts and may act as the first counter-receptor for LFA-1, initiating interactions that lead to more stable cell-cell adhesion via ICAM-1 (Campanero1993ICAM3).

In the context of T cell interactions with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), ICAM3 accumulates at the site of contact, playing a predominant role in early adhesive interactions and TCR-triggered signaling events (Montoya2002Role).
