# PGS1

## Overview
Phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase 1 (PGS1) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme crucial for lipid biosynthesis, specifically phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), which are vital for mitochondrial function and integrity. The enzyme, categorized as a synthase, catalyzes the conversion of CDP-diacylglycerol to phosphatidylglycerophosphate, a precursor in the biosynthesis of PG and CL. These lipids are essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane structure and function, impacting processes such as energy production and apoptosis regulation. PGS1 is a core component of the cardiolipin synthesis complex, interacting with various proteins to facilitate mitochondrial organization and dynamics. Mutations or dysregulation of PGS1 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions affecting cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial integrity (Kawasaki1999Isolation; Morita2015Enzymatic; Serricchio2018Cardiolipin).

## Function
Phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase 1 (PGS1) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), both of which are essential for mitochondrial function and integrity. PGS1 catalyzes the conversion of CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) to phosphatidylglycerophosphate (PGP), which is subsequently dephosphorylated to form PG. This process occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where PGS1 is highly active (Osman2011Making; Morita2015Enzymatic).

PGS1 is a core component of the cardiolipin synthesis complex (CSC) in human cells, forming scaffold-like assemblies that facilitate the organization and interaction of other proteins involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis. It interacts with proteins such as CLS1 and PTPMT1, forming a stable platform that is crucial for the structural organization of the CSC (Serricchio2018Cardiolipin).

The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining mitochondrial membrane organization and function, impacting processes such as energy production, mitochondrial protein import, and apoptosis regulation. PGS1's role in these processes underscores its importance in cellular energy metabolism and overall cell health (Serricchio2018Cardiolipin; Kawasaki1999Isolation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PGS1 gene can lead to significant mitochondrial dysfunction, impacting cellular energy metabolism. In studies involving Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, defects in PGS1 expression were linked to reduced biosynthesis of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), resulting in mitochondrial abnormalities such as enlarged and swollen mitochondria with reduced electron density. These defects impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, leading to growth challenges in glucose-depleted media (Kawasaki1999Isolation). 

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PGS1 mutations resulted in the loss of PG and CL, causing temperature-sensitive growth defects and compromised cell wall integrity due to decreased β-1,3-glucan levels. This highlights the gene's role in maintaining cell wall integrity and suggests potential implications for similar pathways in humans (Zhong2007Upregulation). 

In the context of OPA1-related diseases, PGS1 has been identified as a functional suppressor of mitochondrial fragmentation. Depleting PGS1 in OPA1 mutant fibroblasts improved mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetic function, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for modulating mitochondrial dynamics in these conditions (Cretin2021Highthroughput).

## Interactions
PGS1 (phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase 1) is involved in several protein interactions within the mitochondrial environment. It is a core component of the cardiolipin synthesizing complex (CSC) and can oligomerize, forming scaffold-like structures within mitochondrial tubules. This oligomerization is crucial for its association with the CSC (Serricchio2018Cardiolipin).

PGS1 interacts with various cardiolipin-dependent membrane organizing proteins, including prohibitin 1 and 2, MICOS core proteins (MIC60, MIC19), and MICOS-associated proteins (SAM50, GRP-75, HSP70). These interactions are confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which show that endogenous PHB, MIC60, and TP-α co-precipitate with PGS1 (Serricchio2018Cardiolipin). PGS1 also interacts with SLP-2 and ATP5A, suggesting a role in stabilizing MICOS assemblies by providing cardiolipin (Serricchio2018Cardiolipin).

In the context of mitochondrial dynamics, PGS1 has been identified as a functional suppressor of mitochondrial fragmentation in OPA1 mutant fibroblasts. This suppression is linked to its role in the cardiolipin synthesis pathway, impacting mitochondrial fission and fusion processes (Cretin2021Highthroughput). These interactions highlight PGS1's significant role in mitochondrial maintenance and organization.
