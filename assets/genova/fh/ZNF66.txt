# ZNF66

## Overview
ZNF66 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 66, which is a member of the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger domains, which enable them to bind to DNA and regulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 66 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, and has been studied for its role in cancer and neurological disorders. The gene's expression and its encoded protein's function have been linked to prognostic outcomes in certain cancers, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, as well as genetic predispositions to conditions like migraines in specific populations (Rink2009Gene; Tian2020Identifying; Khan2022WholeExome).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
ZNF66 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer and migraine research. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ZNF66 is part of an 8-mRNA signature used to predict patient survival. High expression levels of ZNF66 are associated with a lower risk of death, suggesting its role as a protective factor in HNSCC prognosis (Tian2020Identifying). This gene is included in a prognostic risk model, where it contributes to a lower risk score, indicating its potential importance in cancer prognosis (Tian2020Identifying).

In the context of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), ZNF66, as part of the KRAB-ZNF gene family, was found to be differentially expressed in patients who did not respond well to imatinib mesylate treatment. This suggests that ZNF66 expression levels might influence treatment outcomes in GIST (Rink2009Gene).

Additionally, ZNF66 has been associated with migraine in females of Arab ancestry. Several variants of ZNF66 were identified as statistically significant in this population, although the clinical implications of these variants remain unclear (Khan2022WholeExome).
