# CIMAP3

## Overview
CIMAP3 is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary microtubule associated protein 3, which plays a crucial role in the structural and functional integrity of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells that are involved in movement and sensory functions. The protein encoded by CIMAP3 is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, which is essential for the stabilization and organization of microtubules within cilia. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and signal transduction, by facilitating the proper assembly and maintenance of ciliary structures. Mutations or dysregulation of CIMAP3 can lead to ciliary dysfunction, which is associated with a range of clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
