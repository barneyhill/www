# ZSCAN16

## Overview
ZSCAN16, or zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 16, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a SCAN domain. These proteins are typically involved in transcriptional regulation, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and apoptosis. The ZSCAN16 protein functions as a transcription factor, influencing the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. Recent studies have highlighted its significance in cancer biology, particularly in bladder cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it has been implicated in promoting tumor progression and serving as a potential therapeutic target (Lv2021Long; Li2020ZSCAN16; Liu2021ZSCAN16AS1).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZSCAN16 has been identified as a potential oncogene in bladder cancer, where it is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Studies have shown that ZSCAN16 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of bladder cancer cells by regulating key signaling pathways, including NF-κB, AKT, mTOR, and P38. Knockdown of ZSCAN16 in bladder cancer cells leads to increased apoptosis and reduced tumor growth, suggesting its role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2020ZSCAN16).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the long non-coding RNA ZSCAN16-AS1 is significantly upregulated and associated with worse patient outcomes. ZSCAN16-AS1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA, sequestering microRNA-451a, which results in increased expression of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2). This interaction promotes malignant properties such as cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inhibiting apoptosis. Knockdown of ZSCAN16-AS1 reduces these malignant characteristics and tumor growth in vivo, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HCC (Lv2021Long; Liu2021ZSCAN16AS1).
