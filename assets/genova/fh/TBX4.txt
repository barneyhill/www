# TBX4

## Overview
The TBX4 gene encodes the T-box transcription factor 4, a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, which are critical regulators of developmental processes. This transcription factor is primarily involved in lung development and function, playing a pivotal role in the TBX4-FGF10 signaling pathway essential for epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during lung organogenesis. TBX4 is expressed in lung fibroblasts and is associated with super-enhancers that regulate lung-specific gene expression, influencing processes such as hypoxia response and extracellular matrix organization. The protein's activity is predominantly nuclear, where it binds to DNA to modulate gene expression, impacting cell differentiation and organogenesis. Mutations in the TBX4 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including pulmonary arterial hypertension and small patella syndrome, highlighting its significance in both normal development and disease (Horie2018TBX4; Karolak2021Potential; KerstjensFrederikse2013TBX4mutations).

## Function
The TBX4 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in lung development and function. It is part of the T-box family of transcription factors and is involved in the TBX4-FGF10 signaling pathway, which is essential for epithelial-mesenchymal signaling during early lung organogenesis. This pathway is crucial for lung branching morphogenesis, and disruptions in TBX4 can lead to developmental disorders such as acinar dysplasia and congenital alveolar dysplasia (Karolak2021Potential).

TBX4 is specifically expressed in lung fibroblasts, where it is associated with super-enhancers that drive lung-specific transcriptional regulation. In normal human lung fibroblasts, TBX4 regulates genes involved in the response to hypoxia and extracellular matrix organization, while also influencing cytokine production (Horie2018TBX4). The gene's expression is linked to super-enhancers marked by high levels of histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), indicating its role in lung fibroblast-specific gene expression (Horie2018TBX4).

TBX4 also interacts with other signaling pathways, such as SHH-FOXF1, and is involved in the regulation of genes associated with lung development, including those in the Wnt signaling pathway (Karolak2021Potential). Its activity is primarily nuclear, where it binds to DNA and modulates gene expression, impacting cell differentiation and organogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBX4 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and small patella syndrome (SPS). TBX4 mutations can lead to childhood-onset PAH, characterized by severe pulmonary hypertension and associated lung abnormalities. These mutations are often de novo and can include microdeletions in the 17q23.2 region, which encompasses the TBX4 gene (KerstjensFrederikse2013TBX4mutations). In some cases, TBX4 mutations have been linked to pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), a rare form of PAH (HernandezGonzalez2020Clinical).

SPS, also known as coxopodopatellar syndrome, is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by patellar aplasia and skeletal abnormalities, including foot and pelvis malformations. These skeletal anomalies are frequently observed in patients with TBX4 mutations (Thoré2020Phenotype). Despite the presence of these mutations, mental retardation is not typically associated with SPS, which may lead to under-recognition of the syndrome (KerstjensFrederikse2013TBX4mutations).

In neonates, TBX4 mutations can result in persistent pulmonary hypertension, often requiring intensive treatment such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (Maddaloni2024Neonatal). These mutations can also cause significant developmental issues in the lungs, contributing to conditions like pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis and interstitial fibrosis (Galambos2019Phenotype).

## Interactions
TBX4 is a transcription factor involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in lung development. It interacts with the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for lung development, and is enriched for TBX4 binding sites (Karolak2021Potential). TBX4 also interacts with the SHH-FOXF1 signaling pathway, important for lung bud formation, by binding to the FOXF1 lung-specific distal core enhancer interval (Karolak2021Potential). 

TBX4 is part of a transcriptional network with TBX2, and their binding sites are enriched within the FENDRR locus, suggesting interactions between the TBX4-FGF10 and SHH-FOXF1 pathways (Karolak2021Potential). TBX4 and TBX5 genetically interact in lung development, affecting lung branching morphogenesis and tracheal/bronchial cartilage formation. Their combined deficiency leads to severe defects in lung branching, linked to the loss of expression of regulatory genes like FGF10 and Wnt2 (Arora2012Multiple).

In lung fibroblasts, TBX4 is associated with super-enhancers, driving transcriptional programs specific to these cells. Knockdown of TBX4 in normal human lung fibroblasts results in significant changes in gene expression, indicating its role in super-enhancer-mediated transcriptional regulation (Horie2018TBX4).
