# TLN1

## Overview
The TLN1 gene encodes talin 1, a large cytoskeletal protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular adhesion and mechanotransduction. Talin 1 is categorized as a mechanosensitive adapter protein, linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and facilitating communication between the extracellular matrix and intracellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its complex structure, including an N-terminal FERM domain and a C-terminal rod domain, which are essential for its interactions with integrins and actin. Talin 1 is involved in various cellular processes, such as integrin activation, cell migration, and the maintenance of cell junctions, particularly in endothelial cells and podocytes. Beyond its structural role, talin 1 also participates in nuclear functions, influencing gene expression. Mutations and dysregulation of TLN1 have been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and cardiovascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Das2014Mechanisms; Da2022A; Pulous2019TalinDependent; TANG2013miR9).

## Structure
Talin 1 (TLN1) is a large cytoskeletal protein composed of 2,541 amino acids, encoded by the TLN1 gene. Its primary structure includes a sequence of 18 domains, with a notable N-terminal FERM domain and a C-terminal rod domain (Goult2013RIAM; GallegoPaez2022A). The FERM domain is atypical, containing four subdomains (F0-F3), and is involved in binding to acidic membrane phospholipids and β-integrin tails (Goult2013RIAM; Klapholz2017Talin).

The secondary structure of TLN1 features multiple alpha-helices, particularly within the rod domain, which consists of 13 helical bundles (R1-R13) (Klapholz2017Talin; Goult2018Talin). The rod domain also contains vinculin-binding sites (VBSs) and actin-binding sites (ABSs), which are crucial for its role in mechanotransduction and cellular adhesion (Klapholz2017Talin; Goult2018Talin).

In terms of tertiary structure, TLN1 can exist in both open and autoinhibited states, with the latter involving intramolecular interactions that mask binding sites (Goult2013RIAM; GallegoPaez2022A). The quaternary structure of TLN1 includes its ability to form dimers, facilitated by a C-terminal dimerization helix (Gingras2007The).

TLN1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has splice variant isoforms, including a cancer-associated exon 17b, which affects its mechanosensitivity (GallegoPaez2022A). These structural features enable TLN1 to function as a mechanosensitive adapter linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton.

## Function
Talin 1 (TLN1) is a mechanosensitive protein that plays a crucial role in cell adhesion by linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. It is involved in integrin activation, which is essential for cell adhesion, shape change, and migration. TLN1 facilitates communication between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the intracellular cytoskeleton, influencing the organization of the actin network and the composition of focal adhesions (Das2014Mechanisms). 

In endothelial cells, TLN1 is vital for the activation of β1 integrins, which are crucial for maintaining vascular integrity and endothelial barrier function. It stabilizes cell-cell junctions by regulating the localization and function of VE-cadherin, a key protein in endothelial junctions (Pulous2019TalinDependent). 

TLN1 also has a nuclear role, where it interacts with chromatin and influences gene expression. It regulates a specific subset of genes, suggesting its involvement in nuclear functions beyond its known role in integrin adhesion complexes (Da2022A). 

In podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney, TLN1 is essential for maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier by facilitating podocyte adhesion to the glomerular basement membrane through integrins (Tian2015Podocyteassociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TLN1 gene, which encodes the protein talin 1, have been implicated in several diseases. In ovarian serous carcinoma (OSC), TLN1 is upregulated and associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. The overexpression of TLN1 activates the FAK/AKT signaling pathway, promoting tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion (TANG2013miR9).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high TLN1 expression is linked to poor prognosis, particularly in older patients and those with intermediate or poor cytogenetic risk. TLN1 is involved in key signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and FLT3, contributing to drug resistance and poor overall survival (Cui2022Identification).

TLN1 mutations are also associated with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), a condition characterized by the tearing of the coronary artery wall. Rare missense variants in TLN1 have been identified in individuals with SCAD, suggesting a genetic association with this condition (Turley2019Rare).

Additionally, a heterozygous splice-site variant in TLN1 has been linked to systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS), affecting cell-ECM adhesion and integrin activation, which disrupts vascular integrity (Elefant2022Talin1).

## Interactions
Talin 1 (TLN1) is a key cytoskeletal protein that interacts with various proteins to facilitate cell adhesion and signaling. It directly binds to integrins, linking them to the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for the formation and regulation of focal adhesions (Das2014Mechanisms; Atherton2015Vinculin). Talin 1 contains multiple actin-binding sites, with the R4 and R8 domains being essential for actin binding and force transmission, which are critical for focal adhesion stabilization (Atherton2015Vinculin).

Talin 1 also interacts with vinculin, a protein that stabilizes focal adhesions by binding to talin and actin. This interaction is significant for talin turnover and focal adhesion dynamics (Goult2013RIAM; Atherton2015Vinculin). The binding of vinculin to talin is mutually exclusive with the binding of RIAM, another protein involved in adhesion assembly and turnover (Goult2013RIAM).

Additionally, talin 1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) at integrin-mediated adhesion sites. CDK1 phosphorylates talin, affecting its mechanosensitivity and potentially influencing adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics (Gough2021Talin). This interaction highlights talin's role as a mechanosensitive signaling hub that integrates various signals to produce diverse cellular responses (Gough2021Talin).
