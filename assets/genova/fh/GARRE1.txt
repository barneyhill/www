# GARRE1

## Overview
GARRE1 is a gene that encodes the protein granule associated Rac and RHOG effector 1, also known as MiniBAR. This protein functions as a dual effector for the GTPases Rac1 and Rab35, playing a pivotal role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation. Cilia are microtubule-based structures that extend from the surface of many eukaryotic cells and are essential for various cellular signaling pathways and developmental processes. MiniBAR is involved in regulating membrane trafficking and acto-Myosin II-dependent contractility, which are critical for cilia elongation and function. The protein's interactions with Rac1 and Rab35 are crucial for its localization and function, particularly in the context of vesicular transport and ciliogenesis. Mutations in the GARRE1 gene have been associated with developmental defects and ciliopathies, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1).

## Function
GARRE1, also known as MiniBAR, is a dual effector for Rac1 and Rab35 GTPases, playing a crucial role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation. Cilia are essential for cellular signaling and development, acting as cellular antennas that detect chemical and mechanical signals. GARRE1 is involved in controlling membrane trafficking and acto-Myosin II-dependent contractility, which are necessary for cilia elongation and function (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1).

GARRE1 interacts specifically with the GTP-bound forms of Rac1 and Rab35, facilitating its role in membrane dynamics and vesicular transport. It accumulates at the ciliary base and is involved in the localization of proteins such as IFT88 and ARL13B into cilia, which is essential for cilia elongation (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1). The protein's interaction with Rab35 is particularly crucial for its vesicular localization and function in ciliogenesis (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1).

In zebrafish, GARRE1 is essential for normal cilia length and beating, which are critical for establishing the left-right axis during development. Its depletion leads to developmental defects, highlighting its importance in proper cellular function and potential implications in ciliopathies (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GARRE1 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In the context of reading performance, a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) identified GARRE1 as a gene linked to reading disabilities. The presence of certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), particularly rs2599553, in the GARRE1 gene was found to confer a 2.11 relative risk for meeting reading disability criteria by Grade 2. Children with the minor allele of this SNP exhibited consistently lower reading skills from Grade 1 to Grade 5, with performance deficits ranging from one-third to over one-half of a standard deviation below age expectations (Adams2021Genome).

In another study, GARRE1, also known as MiniBAR, was implicated in ciliogenesis, a process crucial for cilia formation. Mutations in MiniBAR, such as A140V, 140T, and M144K, have been identified in cancer biopsies, including endometrioid carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. These mutations disrupt the interaction between MiniBAR and Rac1, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis. The study also indicated that alterations in MiniBAR could be linked to ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by cilia dysfunction, as MiniBAR is essential for normal cilia length and function (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1).

## Interactions
GARRE1, also known as MiniBAR, is a dual effector protein that interacts with the GTPases Rac1 and Rab35. These interactions occur through specific binding domains: the Rac1 binding domain (Rac1BD) and the Rab35 binding domain (Rab35BD). GARRE1 preferentially binds to the GTP-bound forms of Rac1 and Rab35, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid assays, gel filtration experiments, and isothermal titration calorimetry (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1). The Rac1BD overlaps with a domain predicted to form a truncated BAR domain, which is involved in sensing membrane curvature (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1). 

GARRE1's interaction with Rab35 is crucial for its localization on vesicles, and the co-overexpression of Rac1 and Rab35 induces the formation of intracellular MiniBAR tubules (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1). The protein also plays a role in ciliogenesis by controlling the trafficking of key cilia proteins such as ARL13B and IFT88, and by limiting acto-Myosin II-dependent contractility (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1). GARRE1's interactions with Rac1 and Rab35 are essential for its function in ciliogenesis, as shown by the effects of specific point mutations that disrupt these interactions (Serres2023MiniBARGARRE1).
