# TAX1BP3

## Overview
TAX1BP3 is a gene that encodes the protein Tax1 binding protein 3, which is characterized by the presence of a PDZ domain. This domain is a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions, playing a crucial role in various cellular signaling pathways. Tax1 binding protein 3 is involved in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The protein is highly expressed in the heart and brain, indicating its significant role in these tissues, although it is also present in other organs. TAX1BP3 interacts with several proteins, including β-catenin and the Tax protein from the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), influencing both cellular and viral processes. Mutations in the TAX1BP3 gene have been associated with developmental disorders and diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular function and integrity (Reinstein2015Mutations; Mohanty2015PDZ).

## Structure
The TAX1BP3 gene encodes a protein known as Tax1 binding protein 3, which contains a PDZ domain, a common structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This domain is characterized by a six-stranded antiparallel β-barrel flanked by two α-helices, forming a compact fold typical of PDZ domains (Mohanty2015PDZ). The PDZ domain in TAX1BP3 is involved in binding to the C-terminus of target proteins through a PDZ-binding groove, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins (Mohanty2015PDZ).

The protein's structure is further defined by a conserved Leu-Gly-Phe (LGF) motif, which is essential for forming hydrogen bonds with the C-terminal carboxylate group of binding partners. The leucine and phenylalanine residues contribute hydrophobicity to the binding pocket, while glycine is necessary for the proper formation of hydrogen bonds (Mohanty2015PDZ).

TAX1BP3 is highly expressed in the heart and brain and is involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. It interacts with several proteins, and mutations in this gene can disrupt its structure and stability, affecting its ability to interact with other proteins (Reinstein2015Mutations). The protein may also exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which can influence its structural and functional properties.

## Function
TAX1BP3, or Tax1 binding protein 3, is a small PDZ domain-containing protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is vital for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Reinstein2015Mutations). This protein is highly expressed in the human heart and brain, although it is ubiquitously present in other organs, indicating its broad functional significance (Reinstein2015Mutations).

TAX1BP3 interacts with several proteins, such as the tax protein, LIN7, MAGI-1, Rhotekin, and β-catenin, and is involved in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways (Reinstein2015Mutations). These interactions suggest that TAX1BP3 is integral to signal transduction pathways that influence cellular communication and structural integrity. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and at cell junctions, contributing to cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion (Reinstein2015Mutations).

Mutations in TAX1BP3 have been linked to significant developmental issues, such as dilated cardiomyopathy and septo-optic dysplasia, highlighting its essential role in heart and brain development (Reinstein2015Mutations). The disruption of TAX1BP3's structure and stability due to mutations can impair its ability to interact with other proteins, leading to these developmental abnormalities (Reinstein2015Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAX1BP3 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A study identified a novel autosomal recessive syndrome in a Bedouin family, characterized by dilated cardiomyopathy and septo-optic dysplasia, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in the TAX1BP3 gene. This mutation disrupts the protein's structure and interactions, affecting heart and brain development (Reinstein2015Mutations).

In the context of multiple myeloma, TAX1BP3 is noted as a potential tumor suppressor gene within a poor-survival minimal common region, suggesting its role in tumor suppression and relevance in prognosis (Carrasco2006Highresolution). In hepatocellular carcinoma, alterations in TAX1BP3 expression have been associated with metformin resistance, indicating its involvement in drug resistance mechanisms (Gao2023Analysis).

TAX1BP3 is also implicated in neurite growth and regeneration. Its downregulation leads to shorter neurites, although this effect can be mitigated by inhibiting ROCK, highlighting its role in neuronal development (Schünemann2024Effects). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TAX1BP3 in various pathological conditions, including its potential impact on cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
TAX1BP3, also known as TIP-1, is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in multiple signaling pathways. It is known to interact with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, influencing processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation (Reinstein2015Mutations; Mohanty2015PDZ). TAX1BP3 also interacts with the Tax protein from the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), impacting viral replication and cell transformation (Mohanty2015PDZ).

The protein contains a PDZ domain, which allows it to bind to various target proteins through both C-terminal and internal recognition motifs. This includes interactions with proteins like Ankyrin-B, MED1, CYLD, MYO18B, and others involved in cancer pathways (Mohanty2015PDZ). TAX1BP3 also interacts with Kir 2.3, a potassium channel, potentially functioning as a negative regulator by displacing Kir 2.3 from its complex, which may lead to endosomal targeting (Alewine2006TIP1).

In addition to these interactions, TAX1BP3 is involved in the regulation of β-catenin in Wnt signaling and may modulate p53 protein stability, contributing to radio resistance in gliomas (Mohanty2015PDZ). These interactions highlight TAX1BP3's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
