# GP1BB

## Overview
The GP1BB gene encodes the glycoprotein Ib platelet subunit beta (GPIbβ), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in platelet adhesion and hemostasis. GPIbβ is a component of the GPIb-IX-V complex, which is essential for the interaction of platelets with the vascular subendothelium, particularly through binding to von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Barozzi2021A). This interaction is crucial for the initiation of the hemostatic process, facilitating platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury. Structurally, GPIbβ contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a transmembrane helix, and an intracytoplasmic domain, with post-translational modifications such as glycosylation contributing to its stability and function (Sivapalaratnam2017Rare; Barozzi2021A). Mutations in GP1BB can lead to Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a rare bleeding disorder characterized by macrothrombocytopenia and impaired platelet function (Fiore2020High).

## Structure
The GP1BB gene encodes the glycoprotein Ib platelet subunit beta (GPIbβ), a component of the GPIb-IX-V complex, which is crucial for platelet adhesion. The primary structure of GPIbβ includes a signal peptide and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which is essential for its function (Sivapalaratnam2017Rare). The protein is a transmembrane protein with a glycosylated N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane helix, and an intracytoplasmic domain (Barozzi2021A). 

The secondary structure of GPIbβ likely involves alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of proteins with LRR domains. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, particularly involving cysteine residues that form linkages with GPIbα, which are crucial for the protein's stability and conformation (Busonero2020A). 

In terms of quaternary structure, GPIbβ interacts with GPIbα and GPIX to form a hetero-tetrameric receptor complex in a 1:2:1 stoichiometry. This interaction is essential for the surface expression and function of the complex (Quach2020Structure‐function). The transmembrane domains of GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX form a four-helical bundle, which stabilizes the complex (Quach2020Structure‐function). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which is important for the protein's function and stability (Barozzi2021A).

## Function
The GP1BB gene encodes the glycoprotein Ibβ (GPIbβ) subunit, which is a critical component of the GPIb-IX complex on the surface of platelets. This complex is essential for platelet adhesion to the vascular subendothelium, a key step in the formation of a blood clot. The GPIb-IX complex is composed of GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX subunits in a 1:2:1 stoichiometry, and it functions as the platelet receptor for von Willebrand factor (vWF). This interaction is crucial for the initiation of the hemostatic process, as it allows platelets to adhere to sites of vascular injury (Barozzi2021A).

Each subunit of the GPIb-IX complex is a transmembrane protein with a glycosylated N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane helix, and an intracytoplasmic domain. The correct assembly and surface expression of the GPIb-IX complex require the proper assembly of all three subunits, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and matures in the Golgi apparatus before being translocated to the plasma membrane (Barozzi2021A). In healthy individuals, the GPIbβ protein is correctly assembled into the GPIb-IX receptor complex, facilitating normal platelet function and clot formation (Barozzi2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GP1BB gene are associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS), a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by macrothrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and mucocutaneous bleeding. BSS results from defects in the GPIb-IX-V complex, which is crucial for platelet adhesion. Mutations in GP1BB, along with GP1BA and GP9, lead to impaired expression and function of this complex, causing the clinical manifestations of BSS (Fiore2020High; Savoia2010Clinical).

Specific mutations in GP1BB, such as c.265A>G (p.Asn89Asp) and c.528_550del, have been identified in patients with BSS. The c.265A>G mutation is associated with impaired expression of the GPIb-IX-V complex and is prevalent in patients from Reunion Island (Fiore2020High). The c.528_550del mutation affects the cytoplasmic domain of GPIbβ, leading to a milder form of BSS with reduced complex expression and mild bleeding tendencies (Barozzi2021A).

Another mutation, p.P27S, found in the Sardinian population, affects the assembly and stability of the GPIb-IX-V complex, leading to macrothrombocytopenia and altered platelet function (Busonero2020A). These mutations highlight the genetic heterogeneity and variable expressivity of BSS.

## Interactions
The GP1BB gene encodes the GPIbβ subunit, which is a critical component of the GPIb-IX complex on the platelet surface. This complex is essential for platelet adhesion and is composed of GPIbα, GPIbβ, and GPIX subunits in a 1:2:1 stoichiometry (Barozzi2021A). GPIbβ interacts with GPIX to form a heterodimeric interface, with the C-terminal cap of GPIbβ engaging the convex face loops of GPIX. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization and proper surface expression of the GPIb-IX complex (McEwan2011Quaternary). 

Mutations in GPIbβ can disrupt these interactions, leading to conditions such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS), characterized by bleeding disorders and macrothrombocytopenia (McEwan2011Quaternary). The side chain of GPIbβ-Tyr106 is particularly important, forming a hydrogen bond with GPIX-Arg87 and being surrounded by salt bridges involving other residues, which are essential for the interaction and surface expression of the complex (McEwan2011Quaternary).

Additionally, the phosphorylation of Ser 166 on GPIbβ by PKA is crucial for the binding of 14-3-3 proteins, which negatively regulates von Willebrand factor (VWF) binding to the GPIb-IX complex (Chen20181433).
