# FAM178B

## Overview
FAM178B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 178 member B. This protein is implicated in transcription regulation, primarily through its interactions with transcription factors such as STAT1, STAT3, and ESR2, suggesting a role in modulating gene expression (Garzón2016A; garzon2016computational). The protein is categorized under transcription factor activity, aligning with its potential regulatory functions in cellular homeostasis and various cellular processes. The gene's paralog, FAM178A (also known as SLF2), is involved in DNA repair, indicating a possible shared functional theme in maintaining genomic integrity (Garzón2016A). The PrePPI database supports these functional annotations by predicting protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for understanding the broader biological roles of FAM178B (Garzón2016A).

## Function
FAM178B is a gene that encodes a protein potentially involved in transcription regulation in healthy human cells. Computational analysis using the GSEA/PrePPI procedure has provided a novel annotation for FAM178B, suggesting that it interacts with transcription factors such as STAT1, STAT3, and ESR2. This interaction implies a role in transcription regulation, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating various cellular functions (Garzón2016A; garzon2016computational).

The protein encoded by FAM178B is associated with the molecular function of 'transcription factor activity,' indicating its involvement in the regulation of gene expression. This activity is consistent with the role of its paralog, FAM178A (now known as SLF2), which is involved in DNA repair processes (Garzón2016A). The PrePPI database, which includes both direct and indirect interactions, supports these findings by providing extensive coverage and overlap with other interaction databases, highlighting its utility in functional annotation (garzon2016computational).

Overall, FAM178B's interactions with key transcription factors suggest its significant role in transcriptional regulation, impacting cellular processes and potentially influencing organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
FAM178B is suggested to interact with several transcription factors, indicating a potential role in transcription regulation. Notably, five of its top interactors are annotated with the Gene Ontology molecular function "transcription factor activity," including STAT1, STAT3, and ESR2. This suggests that FAM178B may influence transcriptional processes through these interactions (Garzón2016A).

The PrePPI database, a computational tool for predicting protein-protein interactions, provides a comprehensive resource for exploring the interactions of FAM178B. Although specific interactions involving FAM178B are not detailed, PrePPI's predictions are based on structural modeling and other data sources, offering insights into potential interaction partners and functional relationships (Garzón2016A).

The study by Hein et al. mapped the human interactome using quantitative BAC-GFP interactomics, identifying over 28,000 interactions. While specific interactions involving FAM178B are not mentioned, the study provides a resource for exploring protein interactions in HeLa cells, which could include FAM178B (Hein2015A). These interactions are crucial for understanding the role of FAM178B in cellular processes and its potential involvement in multiprotein complexes or transient regulatory interactions.
