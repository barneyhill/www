# WNT8A

## Overview
WNT8A is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 8A, which is part of the Wnt family of secreted signaling proteins. These proteins are integral to the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical regulator of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. Wnt family member 8A is characterized by its complex molecular structure, including conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, and is involved in various developmental processes such as craniofacial development and body axis extension. The protein functions primarily in the cell membrane and extracellular space, interacting with receptors to initiate signaling cascades that influence gene expression and cellular behavior. Dysregulation of WNT8A has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including Hirschsprung's disease, non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate, and osteoarthritis, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease pathogenesis (Cunningham2015Wnt8a; Miller2001Thewnts; Mohamad2021Downregulation).

## Structure
The WNT8A protein is a member of the Wnt family, characterized by a complex molecular structure essential for its function in signaling pathways. The primary structure of WNT8A includes a sequence of amino acids with conserved cysteine residues, which are crucial for forming intramolecular disulfide bonds (Miller2001Thewnts). The secondary structure features an amino-terminal core domain (NTD) and a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). The NTD is distantly related to saposins and consists of multiple helices in an anti-parallel bundle, while the CTD resembles cysteine-knot growth factors (Nygaard2021Structural).

The tertiary structure of WNT8A involves the folding of these domains into a three-dimensional shape, stabilized by disulfide bonds. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at Asn103 and Asn262, and palmitoleation at a conserved serine residue on hairpin 2, which are critical for its interaction with the WLS (Wntless) protein and its signaling activity (Nygaard2021Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, WNT8A forms a complex with WLS, which is essential for its transport and secretion. This interaction is mediated by specific hairpin loops and involves a significant buried surface area, indicating a tight binding between the two proteins (Nygaard2021Structural).

## Function
WNT8A is a member of the Wnt gene family, which encodes secreted signaling proteins that play a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for various developmental processes, including cell fate determination, proliferation, and migration. In healthy human cells, WNT8A is involved in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, influencing craniofacial development and body axis extension (Cunningham2015Wnt8a; Mohamad2021Downregulation).

WNT8A proteins are active in the cell membrane and extracellular space, where they interact with receptors to initiate signaling cascades that regulate gene expression and cellular behavior. The Wnt signaling pathway, mediated by receptors such as LRP5 and LRP6, is essential for normal bone density and has been implicated in various developmental processes (Mohamad2021Downregulation). WNT8A, along with other Wnt proteins, is involved in maintaining the axial stem cell niche necessary for posterior growth during early somite stages, highlighting its role in body axis extension (Cunningham2015Wnt8a).

In the context of craniofacial development, WNT8A is important for lip and palate formation, and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of cleft deformities (Mohamad2021Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WNT8A gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the lower intestine, specific polymorphisms in the WNT8A gene, such as rs78301778 and rs6596422, are associated with an increased risk. The study found that the null genotypes of these SNPs, as well as the T allele at rs78301778 and the G allele at rs6596422, are significantly linked to HSCR. Increased expression of WNT8A mRNA and protein levels in stenotic colon segments of HSCR patients further supports its role in the disease's pathogenesis (GAO2013Polymorphisms).

In non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P) among the Malay population, WNT8A expression is significantly downregulated in affected tissues. This downregulation suggests a role for WNT8A in craniofacial development, and its altered expression may contribute to the formation of cleft lip and/or palate (Mohamad2021Downregulation).

In osteoarthritis (OA), increased expression of WNT8A in the synovium of murine models is associated with cartilage damage and synovial inflammation, implicating WNT8A in the progression of OA through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (van2015Induction).

## Interactions
WNT8A is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its role in signaling pathways. It interacts with Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors to activate the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for various developmental processes (Mohamad2021Downregulation). WNT8A also interacts with the same LRP6 domain as WNT10B, and it has been found to inhibit WNT10B activity in HEK293 cells, suggesting a regulatory role in modulating Wnt signaling (Alok2017Wnt).

In the context of embryonic development, WNT8A is part of a positive autoregulatory loop with WNT3A, β-catenin, and FGF signaling, which is essential for anterior trunk development and somite formation (Cunningham2015Wnt8a). This interaction highlights the cooperative function of WNT8A with other signaling molecules to maintain the axial stem cell niche and prevent ectopic Sox2 expression, which is associated with neural differentiation (Cunningham2015Wnt8a).

WNT8A is also regulated by retinoic acid (RA) signaling, which represses its expression through a retinoic acid response element (RARE) located upstream of the WNT8A transcription start site. This interaction is confirmed by the binding of RA receptors to the RARE, indicating a direct regulatory mechanism (Cunningham2015Wnt8a).
