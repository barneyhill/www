# PPP1R3C

## Overview
The PPP1R3C gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3C, a crucial regulatory component of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) involved in glycogen metabolism. This protein, also known as protein targeting to glycogen (PTG), plays a significant role in the regulation of glycogen synthesis by modulating the activities of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase. As a regulatory subunit, PPP1R3C targets PP1 to glycogen, thereby promoting glycogen synthesis and storage by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase and activating glycogen synthase. The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis and influencing whole-body energy metabolism. Its expression and activity are regulated by various factors, including hypoxia-inducible factors, which can lead to increased glycogen accumulation under low oxygen conditions. The gene's involvement in hepatic glucose metabolism and its potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic disorders underscore its clinical significance (Shen2010Hypoxia‐inducible; Ji2019PPP1R3C).

## Structure
The PPP1R3C gene encodes a protein that is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), involved in glycogen metabolism. The protein consists of 285 amino acids and has a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 9.17 and a molecular weight of 326.9 kDa (Mohindra2013Molecular). The primary structure analysis of PPP1R3C reveals several post-translational modification sites, including two protein kinase C sites, five casein kinase II sites, two N-glycosylation sites, and two N-myristoylation sites (Mohindra2013Molecular).

The secondary structure of PPP1R3C includes 3 sheets, 4 beta hairpins, 1 beta bulge, 10 strands, 1 helix, 17 beta turns, and 3 gamma turns. A Ramachandran plot analysis showed that 73.4% of residues are in the most favored regions, with the remaining 26.6% in additionally allowed regions (Mohindra2013Molecular). The protein contains a carbohydrate-binding type-21 (CBM21) domain between amino acids 133-241, which is crucial for its role in glycogen metabolism (Mohindra2013Molecular).

Multiple sequence alignment has identified a conserved tetramer PP1-binding motif (KVXF) in fishes and amphibians, while mammals have a conserved RVVF motif, indicating evolutionary conservation of its functional domains (Mohindra2013Molecular).

## Function
The PPP1R3C gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which plays a significant role in glycogen metabolism. This protein, also known as protein targeting to glycogen (PTG), is involved in the regulation of glycogen synthesis by modulating the activity of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase. PPP1R3C targets PP1 to glycogen, inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase activity and activating glycogen synthase activity, thereby promoting glycogen synthesis and storage (Ji2019PPP1R3C).

In healthy human cells, PPP1R3C is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis. It acts as a positive regulator of glycogen synthesis, influencing whole-body energy metabolism (Ji2019PPP1R3C). The protein's activity is regulated by various factors, including hypoxia-inducible factors under low oxygen conditions, which can lead to increased expression of PPP1R3C and subsequent glycogen accumulation (Shen2010Hypoxia‐inducible).

PPP1R3C also plays a role in hepatic glucose metabolism, where its expression is influenced by the cAMP pathway. Overexpression of PPP1R3C in the liver can increase hepatic glucose production and gluconeogenic gene expression, while its knockdown can decrease these processes (Ji2019PPP1R3C). This dual role in gluconeogenesis and glycogen synthesis highlights its importance in glucose regulation and potential as a therapeutic target in metabolic disorders.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PPP1R3C gene, which encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3C, have been implicated in several glycogen storage diseases. In Lafora disease, a form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy, the N249S mutation in PPP1R3C results in an amino acid substitution that affects the interaction of the protein targeting to glycogen (PTG) with its partners. This mutation reduces the interaction with laforin and glycogen phosphorylase, leading to decreased glycogen synthesis. The N249S mutation is associated with a milder phenotype of Lafora disease, characterized by slower progression of neurological symptoms (Guerrero2011A).

In the context of adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD), a neurological variant of glycogen storage disease type IV, the deficiency of PPP1R3C in mouse models has shown therapeutic potential. Knockout of PPP1R3C leads to a reduction in polyglucosan bodies and glycogen accumulation, improving neuropathological features such as gliosis and neuromuscular function. This suggests that PPP1R3C could be a target for therapeutic strategies in managing APBD (Chown2020GYS1). Despite these findings, no pathological state has been directly associated with PPP1R3C deficiency in humans, indicating the need for further research (Chown2020GYS1).

## Interactions
PPP1R3C, also known as protein targeting to glycogen (PTG), is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a significant role in glycogen metabolism. It interacts with the catalytic subunit of PP1, modulating its activity to influence glycogen synthesis and mobilization. PPP1R3C is involved in the activation of glycogen synthase (GYS1) through PP1-mediated dephosphorylation, which enhances glycogen synthesis. This interaction is crucial for its role in glycogen metabolism, as demonstrated in studies where the knockout of PPP1R3C in a mouse model of Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease (APBD) led to reduced polyglucosan body accumulation and improved neuromuscular function (Chown2020GYS1).

Under hypoxic conditions, PPP1R3C expression is upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), which promotes glycogen accumulation in human MCF-7 cells. This regulation involves a functional hypoxia response element upstream of the PPP1R3C gene, indicating a transcriptional control mechanism that links PPP1R3C to cellular responses to low oxygen levels (Shen2010Hypoxia‐inducible). These interactions highlight PPP1R3C's role in both normal and pathological glycogen storage processes.
