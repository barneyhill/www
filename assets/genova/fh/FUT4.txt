# FUT4

## Overview
The FUT4 gene encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 4, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of the Lewis x (Le^x) antigen, a fucosylated carbohydrate structure that plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion and signal transduction. Fucosyltransferase 4 catalyzes the transfer of fucose, a hexose sugar, to N-acetyllactosamine precursors, contributing to the formation of the Le^x antigen on the surface of cells, particularly during early human embryogenesis (CailleauThomas2000FUT4). The expression of FUT4 is notably high in embryonic tissues and leukocytes, but it diminishes in most adult tissues, indicating its critical function during early development (CailleauThomas2000FUT4). The enzyme's stability and resistance to inhibitors like N-Ethylmaleimide further underscore its biological importance (CailleauThomas2000FUT4). Beyond its developmental roles, aberrant expression of FUT4 has been implicated in various cancers, where it influences tumor progression and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Li2017Tumorsuppressive; Gao2020FUT4siRNA).

## Function
The FUT4 gene encodes an α3-fucosyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of the Le x antigen on the surface of proliferating cells during early human embryogenesis. This enzyme is active in embryos less than 8 weeks old and is involved in transferring fucose to specific acceptor molecules, primarily type-2 N-acetyllactosamine precursors, to synthesize the Le x antigen (CailleauThomas2000FUT4). The Le x antigen is part of the Lewis blood group-related antigens and is implicated in cell-cell interactions, potentially influencing signal transduction pathways that promote cellular proliferation (CailleauThomas2000FUT4).

FUT4 is expressed early in human embryogenesis and is associated with a myeloid-like activity profile, mainly found in leukocytes (CailleauThomas2000FUT4). The enzyme exhibits a high resistance to N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) inhibition and retains significant activity even at elevated temperatures, indicating its stability (CailleauThomas2000FUT4). In transfected COS7 cells, FUT4 shows a higher percentage of positive cells expressing Le x epitopes compared to FUT9, highlighting its efficiency in synthesizing these antigens (CailleauThomas2000FUT4). The expression of FUT4 decreases in most adult tissues, suggesting its primary role during early development (CailleauThomas2000FUT4).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FUT4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and breast cancer. In CRC, overexpression of FUT4 is associated with increased cell proliferation, invasion, and poor overall survival. This overexpression is linked to the activation of signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis (Li2017Tumorsuppressive; Yang2010Overexpression). FUT4 is also involved in chemoresistance, as its upregulation contributes to drug resistance in CRC and hepatocellular carcinoma (Gao2020FUT4siRNA).

In NSCLC, FUT4 overexpression is associated with increased tissue invasiveness and metastasis. Silencing FUT4 enhances chemosensitivity to cisplatin by inactivating the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Blanas2018Fucosylated; Gao2020FUT4siRNA). In breast cancer, FUT4 overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation and invasiveness, and its regulation by micro-RNAs affects drug resistance (Blanas2018Fucosylated).

FUT4's role in cancer is further highlighted by its involvement in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and its potential as a marker for specific cancer subtypes with chromosomal instability and resistance to certain treatments (Giordano2015Cancer-related).
