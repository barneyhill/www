# METAP1

## Overview
Methionyl aminopeptidase 1 (METAP1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme methionyl aminopeptidase 1, which is crucial for the post-translational modification of proteins. This enzyme is categorized as a metalloprotease and is involved in the removal of the N-terminal methionine from nascent polypeptides, a process essential for protein maturation and function (Xiao2010Protein; Zhang2013Pyridinylquinazolines). METAP1 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in cellular processes, including cell growth and viability, by influencing protein processing and cell cycle regulation (Zhang2013Pyridinylquinazolines; Zhang2013Pyridinylpyrimidines). The enzyme's activity is dependent on divalent metal ions, such as cobalt, which are essential for its catalytic function (Hu2007Kinetic). Additionally, METAP1 interacts with ribosomal components, suggesting its involvement in ribosomal association and cellular signaling pathways (Vetro2002Yeast; Addlagatta2005Identification).

## Structure
The human methionyl aminopeptidase 1 (METAP1) is an enzyme involved in the removal of N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins. The primary structure of METAP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Lee2023Structural).

The tertiary structure of METAP1 is characterized by a pita-bread fold, which is a common feature among methionine aminopeptidases. This structure includes a catalytic domain that is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The active site of METAP1 typically involves metal ions, such as cobalt, which are essential for its catalytic function (Lee2023Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, METAP1 can associate with other proteins, although specific details on its quaternary interactions are not extensively covered in the available literature. The enzyme also contains a zinc finger domain, which is important for its interaction with ribosomes, particularly in yeast MetAP1, suggesting a potential role in ribosomal association in humans as well (Vetro2002Yeast).

Post-translational modifications of METAP1 may include phosphorylation and acetylation, which can affect its activity and stability, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Methionine aminopeptidase 1 (METAP1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of proteins by removing the N-terminal methionine from nascent polypeptides, a process essential for protein maturation and function (Xiao2010Protein; Zhang2013Pyridinylquinazolines). This enzymatic activity is crucial for subsequent protein modifications, such as N-α-acetylation, which influences protein folding, interaction, and stability (Zhang2013Pyridinylquinazolines). METAP1 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the N-terminal methionine excision (NME) of various substrates, including the 14-3-3γ protein, indicating its role in protein processing (Zhang2013Pyridinylquinazolines).

In human cells, METAP1 is essential for cell growth and viability. Its downregulation has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and delay cell cycle progression, highlighting its importance in cellular processes (Zhang2013Pyridinylquinazolines; Zhang2013Pyridinylpyrimidines). The enzyme's activity is dependent on the presence of divalent metal ions, such as Co(II), which are crucial for its catalytic function (Hu2007Kinetic). METAP1's role in protein processing and cell cycle regulation underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Interactions
Methionyl aminopeptidase 1 (METAP1) is involved in several interactions with other proteins and ribosomal components. In yeast, METAP1 is associated with the ribosome, primarily interacting with the 60S ribosomal subunit and the 80S translational complex. This association is mediated by its N-terminal zinc finger domain, which is crucial for its normal function and ribosome association (Vetro2002Yeast). The zinc finger domain is thought to facilitate protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, although the specific ribosomal proteins or rRNA involved remain unidentified (Vetro2002Yeast).

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a type Ic METAP1 (MtMetAP1c) features a proline-rich N-terminal extension with a Pro-x-x-Pro (PxxP) motif. This motif is suggested to interact with Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains, which are present in several ribosomal proteins. Such interactions may facilitate the binding of METAP1 to ribosomes, indicating a potential mode of interaction with SH3 domain-containing proteins (Addlagatta2005Identification). The structural analysis of MtMetAP1c supports the possibility of SH3-PxxP interactions, which are known to be involved in cellular signaling complexes (Addlagatta2005Identification). These interactions highlight the role of METAP1 in ribosomal association and its potential involvement in cellular signaling pathways.
