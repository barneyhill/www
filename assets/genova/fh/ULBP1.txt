# ULBP1

## Overview
ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a stress-inducible protein belonging to the MHC class I-related family. The protein, also known as UL16 binding protein 1, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ligand that plays a pivotal role in immune surveillance by interacting with the NKG2D receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. This interaction is crucial for the activation of NK cells, facilitating the recognition and elimination of stressed or abnormal cells, such as those found in tumors or viral infections (Kubin2001ULBP1). ULBP1 is characterized by its unique structure, which includes α1 and α2 domains similar to those in MHC class I molecules, but it lacks the α3 domain (Cao2004UL16). The protein's expression is tightly regulated through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, allowing it to modulate immune responses effectively (Himmelreich2011Posttranscriptional). ULBP1's role in immune regulation and its involvement in various cancers underscore its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Ruan2022Immune; Qi2021Tumor).

## Structure
ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) is a member of the MHC class I-related family of proteins. It is characterized by its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which attaches it to the cell membrane (Cao2004UL16). ULBP1 shares 55-60% amino acid sequence identity with ULBP2 and ULBP3, and 23-26% identity with MICA, another ligand for the NKG2D receptor (Cao2004UL16). Unlike MICA, ULBP1 lacks the α3 domain and is composed of α1 and α2 domains, which are similar to those found in MHC class I molecules (Cao2004UL16).

The three-dimensional structure of ULBP1 suggests a closed peptide-binding groove, indicating that it may not bind peptides (Cao2004UL16). ULBP1 functions as a monomer and does not form a quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are crucial for its stability and function (Cao2004UL16). The binding of NKG2D to ULBP1 is similar to the interaction between a T-cell receptor and an MHC molecule, with several conserved residues contributing to the binding energy (Cao2004UL16).

## Function
ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) is a stress-inducible ligand for the NKG2D receptor, playing a critical role in immune surveillance by facilitating the recognition and destruction of stressed or abnormal cells by natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. In healthy human cells, ULBP1 is involved in the activation of NK cells, enhancing their cytotoxic activity and cytokine production, which are crucial for immune responses against tumors and viral infections (Kubin2001ULBP1).

ULBP1 is a GPI-anchored protein that is rapidly internalized and degraded via the proteasome, a process that regulates its surface expression and ensures a dynamic response to cellular stress (Fernández‐Messina2016A). This rapid turnover allows ULBP1 to modulate immune responses effectively, particularly in transient stress situations, minimizing potential damage to healthy tissues (Fernández‐Messina2016A).

The expression of ULBP1 is regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The transcription factor ATF4 has been shown to bind to the ULBP1 promoter, activating its transcription under stress conditions such as amino acid starvation, which is important for NK cell-mediated tumor elimination (Gowen2015A). The regulation of ULBP1 is crucial for maintaining a balance between effective immune surveillance and preventing autoimmunity (Himmelreich2011Posttranscriptional).

## Clinical Significance
ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in immune regulation. In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), ULBP1 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression increases with tumor stage. High ULBP1 expression is associated with a worse prognosis in COAD patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Ruan2022Immune). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ULBP1 is also upregulated and linked to poor prognosis. It is involved in immune escape mechanisms, particularly through its interaction with PD-L1, which may restrict natural killer cell activity and facilitate immune evasion (Qi2021Tumor).

In ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), altered interactions of ULBP1 with the NKG2D receptor are observed. A-T patients exhibit elevated levels of soluble ULBP1, which may impair NKG2D expression and contribute to immune dysfunction (Desimio2021Altered). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ULBP1 expression on blasts is linked to improved survival outcomes, indicating a potential protective role (Machuldova2021Role). These findings highlight the complex role of ULBP1 in cancer progression and immune evasion, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ULBP1 (UL16 binding protein 1) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in immune responses. It is a ligand for the NKG2D receptor, which is present on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. This interaction is crucial for activating NK cells, leading to cytotoxic responses against stressed or transformed cells (Kubin2001ULBP1).

ULBP1 also interacts with the U20 glycoprotein from human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B). The U20 glycoprotein binds directly to ULBP1 with high affinity, masking it from recognition by the NKG2D receptor. This interaction prevents NK cell activation, serving as an immune evasion strategy by the virus (Weaver2024The). The U20-ULBP1 complex forms a stable 1:1 heterodimer, effectively blocking the NKG2D binding site on ULBP1 (Weaver2024The).

ULBP1 is also involved in interactions with human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein UL16, which can inhibit NK cell activation by binding to ULBP1 and related proteins, thereby modulating immune responses (Kubin2001ULBP1). These interactions highlight ULBP1's role in both activating immune responses and being a target for viral immune evasion mechanisms.
