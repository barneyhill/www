# GPLD1

## Overview
The GPLD1 gene encodes the enzyme glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1 (GPI-PLD), which is a crucial component in the regulation of cell surface protein composition. This enzyme is categorized as a phospholipase and is primarily expressed in the liver, although it is also present in other tissues such as the brain, kidney, and muscle. GPI-PLD functions by cleaving glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, thereby releasing proteins from the cell membrane and influencing various cellular processes, including signal transduction and immune response (Qin2016The; Schofield2000Structure). The enzyme is abundant in mammalian serum and is known to associate with high-density lipoproteins (HDL), playing a significant role in extracellular physiological processes (Abdolmaleki2020Endurance). The activity of GPI-PLD is modulated by divalent cations, which are essential for its catalytic function (Müller2023(Patho)). Alterations in GPLD1 expression or activity have been linked to metabolic disorders and cognitive function, highlighting its clinical significance (Müller2023(Patho)Physiology page 16 of 17).

## Structure
The human GPLD1 gene encodes the enzyme glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1, which is involved in cleaving GPI anchors on proteins. The primary structure of GPLD1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the gene, resulting in a 5.8 kb mRNA primarily expressed in the liver (Schofield2000Structure). The secondary structure of the protein includes domains with homology to EF hands of integrins, which are postulated to be calcium-binding motifs. These motifs are encoded within specific exons, with three located in exons 14, 15, and 17, and the final motif split between exons 21 and 22 (Schofield2000Structure).

The tertiary structure of GPLD1 has not been fully characterized, but it is known to contain structural domains that are crucial for its enzymatic activity. The protein is abundant in mammalian serum and functions to release proteins from their GPI anchors at the cell surface (Schofield2000Structure). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may affect its function and stability, although specific modifications have not been detailed in the available context. The study confirms that there is only one GPLD gene in the human genome, and no splice variant isoforms have been reported in the liver (Schofield2000Structure).

## Function
The human gene GPLD1 encodes the enzyme glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D1 (GPI-PLD), which plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are post-translational modifications that attach proteins to the cell membrane. GPI-PLD facilitates the release of these proteins by cleaving the GPI anchor, thus modulating the composition of cell surface proteins and impacting various cellular processes such as signal transduction, immune response, and cell communication (Qin2016The; Schofield2000Structure).

GPI-PLD is primarily expressed in the liver, but it is also found in other tissues including the brain, kidney, muscle, and immune cells (Qin2016The; Abdolmaleki2020Endurance). The enzyme is abundant in mammalian serum, where it associates with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) (Abdolmaleki2020Endurance). Its activity is mainly extracellular, influencing physiological processes by generating inositolphosphoglycan moieties that act as second messengers in hormone and cytokine-mediated events (Abdolmaleki2020Endurance).

In healthy human cells, GPI-PLD's function is essential for the regulation of cell signaling, adhesion, migration, and immune recognition, as it releases proteins from the plasma membrane by hydrolyzing inositol phosphate linkages (Sidorina2020Combined).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or activity of the GPLD1 gene have been associated with several metabolic disorders. Elevated levels of GPLD1 activity are observed in conditions such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. These conditions are characterized by an imbalance in the transfer and degradation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), which are influenced by the metabolic state and age (Müller2023(Patho)Physiologya page 12 of 20). In particular, GPLD1 activity is upregulated in early insulin resistance and obesity, potentially serving as a compensatory mechanism to manage the increased release of GPI-APs due to metabolic derangement (Müller2023(Patho)Physiology page 16 of 17).

GPLD1 also plays a role in neurogenesis and cognitive function. In aged mice, systemic administration of GPLD1 has been shown to compensate for age-induced cognitive losses, suggesting its involvement in signaling cascades related to cognitive function (Müller2023(Patho)Physiology page 10 of 17). This indicates that GPLD1 could have implications for neurodegenerative diseases, although specific mutations or expression alterations of the GPLD1 gene in humans have not been directly addressed in the provided context. The enzyme's activity and interactions with GPI-APs may serve as biomarkers for metabolic states and age-related changes (Müller2023(Patho)Physiology page 16 of 17).

## Interactions
GPLD1, or glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase D1, is involved in various interactions with glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) in human serum. It forms micelle-like complexes with GPI-APs, cholesterol, and (lyso)phospholipids, recognizing the GPI glycan core through specific binding sites (Müller2023(Patho)Physiologya page 9 of 20). GPLD1 interacts with full-length GPI-APs such as CD55, TNAP, and AChE, and these interactions can be disrupted by compounds like PIG41 and TX-100 (Müller2023(Patho)Physiologya page 8 of 20). 

In the absence of calcium ions, GPLD1 remains catalytically inactive, preventing the insertion of GPI-APs into plasma membranes and thus influencing glycogen synthesis in blood cells (Müller2023(Patho)Physiologya page 12 of 20). The enzyme's activity is modulated by divalent cations, which can activate GPLD1 to cleave GPI anchors, generating inositolglycan-proteins and preventing the pathophysiological transfer of GPI-APs (Müller2023(Patho)Physiologya page 6 of 20). 

GPLD1 also plays a role in the transfer of GPI-APs between cells, such as from adipocytes to blood cells, and this process is influenced by metabolic states and the presence of insulin or antidiabetic agents (Müller2023(Patho)Physiologya page 11 of 20). These interactions are crucial for regulating metabolic phenotypes, including lipid and glycogen synthesis in acceptor cells (Müller2023(Patho)Physiologya page 11 of 20).
