# PSMD8

## Overview
PSMD8 is a gene that encodes the protein proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 8, which is a component of the 26S proteasome complex. This complex is crucial for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins in eukaryotic cells, playing a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis. The PSMD8 protein is part of the non-ATPase regulatory subunit of the proteasome, contributing to the recognition and processing of proteins marked for degradation. This function is essential for various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and stress response. PSMD8 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it helps prevent the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining cellular health and preventing diseases associated with protein aggregation (Schröter2014The; Tanaka1997The26Sproteasome:subunitsandfunctions). Additionally, PSMD8 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast and ovarian cancers, where it influences tumor growth and chemotherapy resistance through interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways (Li2021PSMD8; Li2023PSMD8).

## Function
PSMD8 is a component of the 26S proteasome, a complex essential for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. It is part of the non-ATPase regulatory subunit, contributing to the recognition and binding of ubiquitinated proteins targeted for degradation. This process is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis by regulating protein turnover, which impacts various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and stress responses (Tanaka1997The26Sproteasome:subunitsandfunctions).

In healthy human cells, PSMD8 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a role in preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins. This function is vital for maintaining cellular health and preventing diseases associated with protein aggregation (Schröter2014The). The proteasome, including PSMD8, is involved in the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins, which is particularly important during cellular differentiation and in response to reactive oxygen species (Schröter2014The).

PSMD8's role in the proteasome complex also extends to maintaining pluripotency in stem cells by regulating gene expression and chromatin modifications, which are essential for self-renewal and preventing aberrant transcriptional initiation (Schröter2014The).

## Clinical Significance
PSMD8 has been identified as having significant clinical relevance in various cancers, particularly ovarian cancer. Alterations in PSMD8 expression are associated with poor prognosis in ovarian serous carcinomas, especially in patients with advanced FIGO stages and TP53 mutations. High PSMD8 expression correlates with poor progression-free survival and overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in ovarian cancer (Li2023PSMD8). 

The gene is also implicated in promoting the invasion, migration, and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, indicating its role in cancer progression (Li2023PSMD8). PSMD8 expression is significantly higher in malignant ovarian tissues compared to benign and normal tissues, and its expression level correlates with the FIGO stage of ovarian cancer (Li2023PSMD8).

Beyond ovarian cancer, PSMD8 is part of the broader PSMD family, which is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Dysregulation of this system can lead to various diseases, including cancer, due to its role in protein degradation and cellular processes such as cell growth and cycle progression (Li2023PSMD8).

## Interactions
PSMD8, a component of the 26S proteasome, is involved in protein degradation and interacts with various proteins to influence cellular processes. In breast cancer, PSMD8 interacts with KIF10, a member of the kinesin superfamily, to promote tumor growth and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This interaction is significant as PSMD8 overexpression leads to increased KIF10 levels, which are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. The PSMD8/KIF10 axis activates the ERK signaling pathway, contributing to tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance (Li2021PSMD8).

In ovarian cancer, PSMD8 is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and interacts with other proteasome subunits. It is also a deubiquitinating enzyme within the JAMM domain family, suggesting its role in regulating protein stability and function. PSMD8's interactions extend to immune molecules, correlating with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and various immunomodulators, which may influence the tumor microenvironment and immune response (Li2022PSMD8; Li2023PSMD8).

In the context of sickle cell disease, PSMD8 is part of a cluster dominated by proteasome proteins, indicating altered interactions due to the disease's impact on the erythrocyte protein interactome (Ammann2009Cluster).
