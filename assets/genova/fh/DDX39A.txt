# DDX39A

## Overview
DDX39A is a gene that encodes the protein DExD-box helicase 39A, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family. This protein is involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, RNA transport, and stress response pathways. DExD-box helicase 39A plays a critical role in cellular processes by interacting with proteins and nucleic acids, which is essential for its function in RNA processing. The protein is particularly significant in the context of cancer, where it has been implicated in tumorigenesis and progression, notably in hepatocellular carcinoma and tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Its expression levels and interactions are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and have potential implications for therapeutic targeting (Marijan2024Protein; Zhao2021Integrated; Liu2024TRAIP).

## Clinical Significance
DDX39A, also known as DExD-box helicase 39A, plays a significant role in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DDX39A is identified as a clinically relevant splicing factor. Its expression levels are linked to patient prognosis, and it is one of the most methylated splicing factors, suggesting its involvement in gene expression regulation in HCC (Zhao2021Integrated). The study of DDX39A in HCC highlights its potential as a biomarker for monitoring disease onset and progression, as well as its role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression (Zhao2021Integrated).

Alterations in DDX39A expression or mutations can impact its normal interactions, contributing to disease pathology. The gene's dysregulation is associated with changes in alternative splicing events, which are crucial in cancer development and progression. The potential for DDX39A to serve as a therapeutic target is under investigation, given its significant role in RNA processing and transport, which are critical in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Zhao2021Integrated). These findings underscore the importance of DDX39A in clinical cancer management and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
DDX39A, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, is involved in various protein and nucleic acid interactions crucial for its role in RNA metabolism. It interacts with TRAIP in the context of tongue squamous cell carcinoma, where this interaction enhances cancer progression through epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This interaction is mediated by the HELICc domain of DDX39A, and the expression levels of DDX39A and TRAIP are interdependent (Liu2024TRAIP).

DDX39A also plays a role in stress response pathways, particularly under heat shock conditions, where it aggregates within amyloid bodies (A-bodies). This aggregation is distinct from its paralog DDX39B, which does not aggregate under the same conditions. The central segment of DDX39A is critical for this heat shock-induced aggregation, acting as a temperature-sensitive mechanism (Marijan2024Protein).

In zebrafish, DDX39A is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, interacting with a diverse set of RNAs, including mRNAs that show alternative splicing in DDX39A mutants. This interaction is crucial for proper pre-mRNA splicing and affects the epigenetic status necessary for terminal differentiation (Zhang2018The).
