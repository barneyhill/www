# UNG

## Overview
The UNG gene encodes the enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase, a pivotal component of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is essential for maintaining genomic integrity by excising uracil residues from DNA. These uracil residues can result from the deamination of cytosine or the misincorporation of dUMP during DNA replication. The UNG gene produces two main isoforms through alternative splicing: UNG1, which localizes to mitochondria, and UNG2, which is found in the nucleus (Haug1998Regulation; Nilsen1997Nuclear). Uracil-DNA glycosylase is categorized as a DNA repair enzyme and plays a critical role in both short-patch and long-patch BER pathways, interacting with other repair proteins to facilitate DNA repair processes (KAVLI2007Uracil). The enzyme is also involved in immunoglobulin diversification, contributing to somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, which are vital for immune system function (Doseth2011UracilDNA). Mutations or dysregulation of the UNG gene can lead to immunodeficiencies and have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (D’Errico2017Single; Olinski2021Genomic).

## Structure
The human uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) protein is characterized by a core structure consisting of a parallel beta-sheet of four strands sandwiched between two pairs of alpha-helices (Schormann2014Uracil‐DNA). This structural fold is crucial for its function in DNA repair, as it facilitates the recognition and excision of uracil from DNA. The enzyme contains a specific uracil-binding pocket located in a DNA binding groove, which is essential for substrate specificity and base recognition (Schormann2014Uracil‐DNA).

UNG proteins feature five conserved structural motifs: the catalytic water-activating loop, the Pro-rich loop, the Ura-binding motif, the Gly-Ser loop, and the Leu-intercalation loop. These motifs contribute to the formation of the uracil-binding pocket and are critical for DNA binding and lesion recognition (Zharkov2010UracilDNA; Schormann2014Uracil‐DNA). The enzyme undergoes a conformational change upon binding to DNA, transitioning from an open to a closed state, which is necessary for creating a catalytically competent active center (Parikh2000UracilDNA).

The UNG protein interacts with the DNA backbone, and local DNA unwinding occurs during the catalytic step, facilitated by the insertion of specific residues into the DNA minor groove (Schormann2014Uracil‐DNA). The enzyme's active site is positively charged, aiding in the orientation for scanning and damage detection (Parikh1998Base).

## Function
The UNG gene encodes uracil-DNA glycosylase, an enzyme crucial for the base excision repair (BER) pathway in human cells. This enzyme removes uracil residues from DNA, which can arise from the deamination of cytosine or the misincorporation of dUMP during DNA replication, thereby preventing mutations and maintaining genomic stability (Nilsen1997Nuclear; Krokan2001Properties). The UNG gene produces two isoforms through alternative splicing: UNG1, which is targeted to mitochondria, and UNG2, which is directed to the nucleus (Haug1998Regulation; Nilsen1997Nuclear).

UNG2 is particularly important in the nucleus, where it is involved in both short-patch and long-patch BER pathways, interacting with other repair proteins such as APE1, POLβ, and PCNA (KAVLI2007Uracil). It plays a significant role during the S phase of the cell cycle, repairing uracil at replication forks and contributing to immunoglobulin diversification through processes like somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination (Doseth2011UracilDNA; KAVLI2007Uracil). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and facilitating immune diversity in healthy human cells (Doseth2011UracilDNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UNG gene can lead to significant clinical conditions, primarily affecting the immune system. One such condition is hyper-IgM syndrome, characterized by an inability to perform class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in B cells. This results in elevated levels of IgM and reduced levels of other immunoglobulins, making patients susceptible to recurrent infections and lymphoid hyperplasia (Sousa2007DNAuracil; Kavli2005B). In humans, UNG mutations can also lead to hyper-IgM type 5 immunodeficiency, marked by defects in CSR and recurrent infections (IJspeert2019Repertoire).

Alterations in UNG expression or function can contribute to the development of B-cell lymphomas. In UNG knockout mice, there is an increased incidence of B-cell lymphomas, suggesting a role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing lymphomagenesis (Olinski2021Genomic; Nilsen2003Genetargeted). Dysregulation of UNG, along with aberrant expression of AID and APOBEC enzymes, can lead to increased mutation rates and is implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer and multiple myeloma (Olinski2021Genomic). Additionally, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the UNG gene have been associated with increased risks of colorectal and ovarian cancers (D’Errico2017Single).

## Interactions
Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) is involved in base excision repair and interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids. One significant interaction is with the uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (Ugi), which inhibits UNG by mimicking the DNA backbone. This interaction is characterized by a two-step kinetic process, starting with a reversible docking reaction followed by a locking reaction that forms an essentially irreversible complex (Putnam1999Protein). Ugi binds to the DNA-binding site of UNG, mimicking the shape and charge of DNA, and forms hydrogen bonds with conserved active-site residues (Assefa2014Structural).

The interaction between UNG and Ugi is highly specific, allowing Ugi to inhibit UNG without affecting other DNA-processing enzymes. This specificity is achieved by Ugi's ability to target conserved mechanisms in UNG for DNA deformation and uracil nucleotide flipping (Putnam1999Protein). The binding of Ugi to UNG results in significant fluorescence quenching, indicating a direct interaction, and the complex is stable under physiological conditions (Bennett1993Kinetics). The interaction is primarily enthalpy-driven for cod UNG (cUNG), while it is entropically driven for human UNG (hUNG), with differences attributed to the electrostatic surface potential and hydrophobicity at the protein-Ugi interface (Assefa2014Structural).
