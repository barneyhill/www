# MRPS17

## Overview
The MRPS17 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S17, a vital component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, which is essential for the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. As a structural protein, MRPS17 plays a critical role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (mtSSU) by interacting with other ribosomal proteins and factors involved in ribosome biogenesis (Surovtseva2013Transcriptionindependent; Bogenhagen2014Initial). The protein's function is crucial for cellular energy metabolism, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Gopisetty2016Mammalian; Bao2022Potential).

## Function
MRPS17 encodes a protein that is a component of the small 28S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial ribosome assembly and function, which is essential for the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in cells (Surovtseva2013Transcriptionindependent; Bogenhagen2014Initial). MRPS17 is involved in the early stages of ribosome assembly at mitochondrial DNA nucleoids, where it interacts with nascent rRNA (Bogenhagen2014Initial). It is also part of the small mitochondrial ribosomal subunit and interacts with other proteins such as POLRMT and h-mtTFB1, indicating its role in ribosome biogenesis (Surovtseva2013Transcriptionindependent).

In healthy human cells, MRPS17 is active within the mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function. The protein's involvement in mitochondrial protein synthesis is critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production, which are vital for various cellular processes (He2012Human). The stability and incorporation of MRPS17 into mitoribosomes are essential for its function, as it is synthesized in excess and degraded if not properly assembled (Bogenhagen2018Kinetics).

## Clinical Significance
MRPS17 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. It is upregulated in several cancer types, including bladder, breast, lung, gastric, head and neck, and lymphoma cancers. The expression levels in these cancers are heterogeneous, suggesting a complex role in tumorigenesis that requires further investigation (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). In gastric adenocarcinoma, MRPS17 is part of a gene model identified as a reliable prognostic biomarker, indicating its potential utility in predicting disease outcomes (Bao2022Potential). 

While the specific mechanisms by which MRPS17 contributes to cancer are not fully understood, its altered expression patterns suggest a possible involvement in cancer pathology. The variations in expression may be influenced by factors such as age, ethnicity, and clinicopathological parameters, which necessitate validation with larger sample sizes (Gopisetty2016Mammalian). The potential of MRPS17 as a prognostic marker highlights the importance of further research to elucidate its role in cancer and explore its utility in clinical settings (Bao2022Potential). 

Overall, MRPS17's involvement in cancer underscores the need for additional studies to understand its biological functions and interactions in disease contexts.

## Interactions
MRPS17 is a component of the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (mtSSU) and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. It is involved in the assembly and stability of the mitochondrial ribosome. MRPS17 interacts with other proteins within the mitochondrial ribosome complex, contributing to the formation and function of the ribosomal machinery necessary for translating mitochondrial-encoded proteins (Dalla2014MPV17L2).

The interaction of MRPS17 with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the mtSSU. In the context of mitochondrial ribosome assembly, MRPS17 is affected by the knockdown of the MPV17L2 gene, which leads to a destabilization of the ribosomal complex and a reduction in the steady-state levels of ribosomal proteins, including MRPS17 (Dalla2014MPV17L2).

In cancer, MRPS17 is upregulated in several types, including bladder, breast, lung, gastric, head and neck, and liver cancers, suggesting its involvement in cancer pathology. However, specific protein-protein interactions involving MRPS17 in cancer have not been detailed, indicating a need for further research to elucidate its role in tumorigenic processes (Gopisetty2016Mammalian).
