# MRGPRD

## Overview
The MRGPRD gene encodes the MAS related GPR family member D, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is part of the Mas-related GPCR family. This receptor is predominantly expressed in sensory neurons, particularly nonpeptidergic C-fiber nociceptors, where it plays a crucial role in sensory transduction, including the perception of pain and itch (Solinski2014Pharmacology). The MRGPRD protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and features a unique ligand-binding pocket that is more exposed compared to other class A GPCRs (Suzuki2022Structural). Functionally, MRGPRD is activated by ligands such as β-alanine, which triggers calcium signaling pathways and modulates neuronal activity (Uno2012Identification; Solinski2014Pharmacology). Beyond its role in sensory neurons, MRGPRD is also expressed in various tissues, including the urinary bladder and vasculature, indicating its involvement in broader physiological processes (Solinski2014Pharmacology). The receptor's clinical significance is underscored by its association with pain-related conditions, such as painful diabetic neuropathy and inflammatory pain, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (George2022A; Lan2020Masrelated).

## Structure
The MRGPRD protein, a member of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, exhibits a canonical GPCR structure with seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which is typical of its secondary structure (Suzuki2022Structural). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a ligand-binding pocket that is notably shallow and exposed to extracellular solvents. This pocket is distinct from other class A GPCRs, where ligands are typically embedded in deeper pockets (Suzuki2022Structural).

Key residues involved in ligand binding include R103, D179, W241, Y245, and W246, which are crucial for the receptor's activation by β-alanine (Suzuki2022Structural). The protein also features a unique disulfide bond between C164 and C175, essential for proper folding and trafficking (Suzuki2022Structural). The quaternary structure involves the interaction of MRGPRD with the Gi protein, where the C-terminal half of the α5 helix of Gi inserts into the cytoplasmic region of MRGPRD, forming both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (Suzuki2022Structural).

MRGPRD lacks the conserved sodium-binding site found in some GPCRs, which may contribute to its high basal activity and unique activation mechanism (Suzuki2022Structural).

## Function
The MRGPRD gene encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that is primarily expressed in sensory neurons, particularly nonpeptidergic C-fiber nociceptors. These neurons are involved in the detection of mechanical, heat, and cold stimuli, contributing to sensory transduction and the perception of pain and itch (Solinski2014Pharmacology). MRGPRD is activated by ligands such as β-alanine, which induces calcium signaling and inhibits noninactivating potassium currents, enhancing neuronal activity (Uno2012Identification; Solinski2014Pharmacology). In humans, activation of MRGPRD by β-alanine can result in sensations of itch, pricking, stinging, and burning (Solinski2014Pharmacology).

MRGPRD is also expressed in other tissues, including the urinary bladder, testis, uterus, and arteries, suggesting roles beyond sensory neurons (Solinski2014Pharmacology). In the vasculature, MRGPRD activation by alamandine leads to vasorelaxation through endothelium-derived nitric oxide production (Solinski2014Pharmacology). The receptor's ability to undergo ligand-induced internalization and form multimeric complexes further modulates its signaling properties, impacting various physiological pathways (Solinski2014Pharmacology). These functions highlight MRGPRD's involvement in both sensory perception and broader physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the MRGPRD gene have been implicated in various pain-related conditions. In painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), increased expression of MRGPRD in a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons contributes to pain hypersensitivity. This receptor is involved in the hyper-excitability of these neurons, leading to mechanical allodynia, where non-painful stimuli are perceived as painful. Targeting MRGPRD has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach for alleviating neuropathic pain in PDN, as reducing its signaling can reverse mechanical allodynia in mouse models (George2022A).

MRGPRD is also associated with inflammatory pain. It is upregulated in DRG neurons during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, facilitating the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for inflammatory responses. This pathway's activation is linked to increased sensitivity to mechanical and cold stimuli, suggesting MRGPRD's role in mechanical and cold hyperalgesia. The receptor's involvement in inflammatory pain highlights its potential as a target for modulating neuroinflammation and pain (Lan2020Masrelated).

## Interactions
The MRGPRD protein, a member of the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor family, engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing several signaling pathways. It forms a complex with the heterotrimeric Gi protein, where the C-terminal half of the α5 helix of Gi inserts into the cytoplasmic cavity of MRGPRD. This interaction involves both hydrophobic and hydrophilic contacts, with key residues such as L344, L348, and L353 of Gi, and V127, L201, V205, L219, and V223 of MRGPRD playing crucial roles (Suzuki2022Structural).

MRGPRD also interacts with the Gαq protein, which is essential for the activation of the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway, leading to the hydrolysis of PIP2 into IP3 and DAG. This pathway is significant for the activation of the NF-κB signaling cascade, which is involved in inflammatory responses (Arora2021Constitutive).

In addition, MRGPRD is known to form heteromultimeric complexes with other MRGPR subtypes, such as MRGPRD and MRGPRX1, in HEK293 cells and peripheral nociceptive neurons. These interactions enhance the potency of β-alanine in phosphorylating ERK-1/2 and maintaining intracellular calcium levels (Solinski2014Pharmacology).
