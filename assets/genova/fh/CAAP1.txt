# CAAP1

## Overview
CAAP1, or caspase activity and apoptosis inhibitor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy, two critical cellular processes. The CAAP1 protein functions as an inhibitor of caspase activity, particularly affecting caspases-3, -8, -9, and -10, thereby modulating apoptotic pathways. It plays a significant role in various cellular contexts, including cancer and ischemic stroke, by influencing cell survival and death mechanisms. In cancer, CAAP1 is part of regulatory networks that include interactions with microRNAs and transcription factors, such as the MKL1/miR-5100/CAAP1 axis, which affects tumor growth and survival by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting autophagy (Zhang2020MKL1miR5100CAAP1). Additionally, CAAP1's involvement in the miR-184-5p/CAAP1 axis in ischemic stroke highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for modulating apoptosis in brain injuries (chen2020lncrna).

## Clinical Significance
CAAP1 (caspase activity and apoptosis inhibitor 1) plays a significant role in regulating apoptosis and autophagy, processes that are crucial in cancer progression. Alterations in CAAP1 expression have been implicated in gastric cancer, where it is known to inhibit apoptosis and promote autophagy, contributing to tumor survival and growth. In gastric cancer cells, CAAP1 expression is modulated by miR-5100, which inhibits CAAP1 to promote apoptosis and reduce autophagy, suggesting that dysregulation of this interaction can influence cancer progression (Zhang2020MKL1miR5100CAAP1).

The MKL1/miR-5100/CAAP1 regulatory loop is another critical pathway in gastric cancer, where MKL1 enhances CAAP1 expression, inhibiting apoptosis and promoting autophagy. This loop highlights the potential of CAAP1 as a therapeutic target, as its dysregulation can lead to enhanced tumorigenesis (Zhang2020MKL1miR5100CAAP1).

In ischemic stroke, CAAP1 is involved in the miR-184-5p/CAAP1 axis, where it is targeted by LncOGD-1006 to inhibit apoptosis in brain microvascular endothelial cells. Alterations in this pathway could impact the severity of ischemic brain injury, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for CAAP1 modulation in stroke treatment (chen2020lncrna).

## Interactions
CAAP1, also known as caspase activity and apoptosis inhibitor 1, is involved in various interactions that modulate apoptotic pathways. It is known to interact with caspases, particularly influencing the activation and processing of caspases-3, -8, -9, and -10. CAAP1 negatively regulates procaspase-10 expression, and its knockdown facilitates caspase-10 oligomerization, leading to apoptosis (Zhang2011Identification). The protein is implicated in a caspase-10 dependent mitochondrial caspase-3/9 feedback amplification loop, suggesting a complex interaction network that involves multiple caspases (Zhang2011Identification).

In gastric cancer cells, CAAP1 is part of a regulatory loop involving MKL1 and miR-5100. MKL1 enhances CAAP1 transcription by binding to its promoter, while miR-5100 inhibits CAAP1 expression by targeting its 3' UTR. This interaction affects apoptosis and autophagy, with CAAP1 inhibiting apoptosis and promoting autophagy (Zhang2020MKL1miR5100CAAP1). The MKL1/miR-5100/CAAP1 axis is proposed as a feedback loop that regulates these cellular processes (Zhang2020MKL1miR5100CAAP1).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, CAAP1 interacts with pathways regulating apoptosis and immune responses, potentially through mitochondrial pathways, and inhibits the activity of caspases 3, 8, 9, and 10 (Liu2024Panoramic).
