# RPS6KA3

## Overview
The RPS6KA3 gene encodes ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-3 (RSK2), a serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the RSK family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is integral to various cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. RSK2 is activated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and subsequently phosphorylates a range of substrates, influencing both cytosolic and nuclear functions. The gene is highly expressed in brain regions associated with cognitive function, such as the cerebellum and hippocampus, and is also involved in bone development through its interaction with transcription factors like ATF4. Mutations in RPS6KA3 are linked to Coffin-Lowry syndrome, an X-linked disorder characterized by intellectual disability and skeletal abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance (Yang2004ATF4; Fung2019Coffin–Lowry; Nishimoto2014The).

## Structure
The RPS6KA3 gene encodes the ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-3 (RSK2), which is a member of the RSK family of serine/threonine kinases. The RSK2 protein consists of 740 amino acids and features two non-identical kinase domains: the N-terminal kinase domain (KD1) and the C-terminal kinase domain (KD2) (Nishimoto2014The). These domains are connected by a linker region and each contains its own ATP-binding site, which is crucial for the protein's kinase activity (Labonne2016Concomitant).

RSK2 is involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity (Nishimoto2014The). The protein structure includes an extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) docking site, which facilitates its activation by ERK1/2 in response to various stimuli (Labonne2016Concomitant).

Mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene can lead to structural changes in the RSK2 protein, affecting its function. For instance, a missense mutation at the last base of exon 8 (c.631G>C) results in an amino acid substitution (p.D211H) in the N-terminal kinase domain, impacting protein stability and ATP binding (Labonne2016Concomitant). The RSK2 protein may have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in truncated proteins with altered functions (Labonne2016Concomitant).

## Function
The RPS6KA3 gene encodes ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-3, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It acts as a downstream effector in the MAPK/ERK pathway, where it is directly phosphorylated by ERK1/2 in response to stimuli such as growth factors, hormones, and neurotransmitters (Cong2022Case; Nishimoto2014The).

Upon activation, RPS6KA3 phosphorylates a range of cytosolic substrates, including pro-apoptotic proteins and translation factors, and can translocate into the nucleus to phosphorylate nuclear targets. This activity influences gene expression and cellular responses, contributing to normal cognitive and developmental processes (Cong2022Case; Nishimoto2014The). In the brain, RPS6KA3 is highly expressed in regions with high synaptic activity, such as Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, which are important for cognitive function and learning (Castelluccio2019An; Nishimoto2014The).

RPS6KA3 also interacts with activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a major regulator of osteoblast differentiation, indicating its role in bone development and maintenance (Yang2004ATF4; Nishimoto2014The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene are primarily associated with Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS), an X-linked disorder characterized by intellectual disability, growth retardation, and distinct facial and skeletal features. These mutations often result in a loss of function of the RPS6KA3 protein, which is crucial for normal cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation (Wang2006A; Fung2019Coffin–Lowry). The clinical manifestations of CLS can vary significantly, with males typically more severely affected than females due to the X-linked nature of the disorder (Fung2019Coffin–Lowry).

In addition to CLS, alterations in RPS6KA3 expression levels or interactions can lead to non-specific X-linked mental retardation, expanding the understanding of the gene's clinical significance (Bertini2015625). Some mutations, such as microduplications, can mimic loss-of-function effects by inhibiting gene expression, as seen in a case study involving a 12-year-old boy with mild intellectual disability and hearing loss (Bertini2015625).

The variability in clinical features among individuals with RPS6KA3 mutations underscores the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and potential genetic counseling, especially in familial cases (Cong2022Case; Fung2019Coffin–Lowry).

## Interactions
RPS6KA3, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase A3 or RSK2, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways. RSK2 is a downstream effector in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and is directly phosphorylated by ERK1/2 in response to various stimuli, such as growth factors and hormones (Nishimoto2014The). Upon activation, RSK2 phosphorylates a range of cytosolic substrates, including pro-apoptotic proteins and translation factors, and can translocate into the nucleus to phosphorylate nuclear targets (Nishimoto2014The).

RSK2 interacts with the transcription factor ATF4, which is significant for osteoblast differentiation. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of ATF4 by RSK2, which is essential for ATF4's function in osteoblasts and is linked to skeletal development (Yang2004ATF4). The phosphorylation of ATF4 by RSK2 is crucial for the synthesis of type I collagen, a major component of the bone matrix (Yang2004ATF4).

Additionally, RSK2 is affected by the knockdown of eIF3 subunits, which impacts the translation of components of the MAPK/ERK pathway, including RPS6KA3 itself (Herrmannová2023Perturbations). These interactions highlight the role of RSK2 in regulating diverse cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, and survival.
