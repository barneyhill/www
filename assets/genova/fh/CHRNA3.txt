# CHRNA3

## Overview
The CHRNA3 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 3 subunit, a critical component of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels involved in neurotransmission. These receptors are integral to the function of both the central and peripheral nervous systems, mediating synaptic transmission through the binding of acetylcholine or nicotine, which facilitates ion influx, particularly calcium, into neurons (Doyle2011In; Duga2001Characterization). The alpha 3 subunit is a transmembrane protein that forms heteropentameric complexes with other subunits, such as beta 4, to create functional nAChRs, which are expressed in various brain regions and play roles in processes like reward, emotion, and autonomic regulation (Barrie2016TheCHRNA5CHRNA3CHRNB4Nicotinic; LevLehman2001Characterization). The CHRNA3 gene is part of a gene cluster on chromosome 15, which includes CHRNA5 and CHRNB4, and is implicated in genetic predispositions to nicotine dependence and related disorders (Barrie2016TheCHRNA5CHRNA3CHRNB4Nicotinic).

## Structure
The CHRNA3 gene encodes the alpha 3 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are pentameric ion channel complexes involved in neurotransmission. The CHRNA3 protein contains characteristic adjacent cysteine residues typical of alpha-type subunits, which are crucial for its function (Chandramohan2015Identification). The primary structure of CHRNA3 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, with exon 1 containing the 5′-untranslated region, the ATG start codon, and parts of the sequence coding for the putative signal peptide (Rempel1998The).

The secondary structure of CHRNA3 includes hydrophobic transmembrane domains I-III located in the large exon 5, while exon 6 contains the transmembrane domain IV, the translation stop codon, and the 3′-untranslated region (Rempel1998The). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the alpha 3 subunit with other subunits to form functional nAChRs, such as α3β4 or α3α5β4 in the peripheral nervous system (Duga2001Characterization).

Mutational analysis has identified several nonsynonymous SNPs, with some predicted to be deleterious, potentially affecting the protein's structure and function. Notable mutations include phenylalanine to valine (Y43V) and lysine to asparagine (K216N), which may cause structural instability (Chandramohan2015Identification).

## Function
The CHRNA3 gene encodes the alpha3 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels involved in neurotransmission. These receptors are activated by acetylcholine or nicotine, allowing the influx of ions such as calcium into neurons, which is crucial for synaptic transmission in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (Doyle2011In; Duga2001Characterization). The alpha3 subunit, in combination with other subunits like alpha5 and beta4, forms heteropentameric structures that are expressed in various brain regions, including those associated with reward, emotion, learning, and memory, such as the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex (Barrie2016TheCHRNA5CHRNA3CHRNB4Nicotinic; Doyle2011In).

In the peripheral nervous system, nAChRs containing the alpha3 subunit are involved in muscle contraction and autonomic nervous system regulation, playing a role in processes like bladder contractility (LevLehman2001Characterization). The CHRNA3 gene is part of a gene cluster on chromosome 15, which includes CHRNA5 and CHRNB4, and is involved in the genetic predisposition to nicotine dependence (Barrie2016TheCHRNA5CHRNA3CHRNB4Nicotinic). The expression of CHRNA3 is regulated by promoter methylation, which can vary across different brain regions (Doyle2011In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CHRNA3 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly those related to nicotine dependence and respiratory conditions. Variants such as rs6495309T.C and rs1051730G.A are associated with increased risks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. In Chinese populations, the rs6495309CC genotype is linked to a 1.32-fold increased risk of COPD and a 1.66-fold increased risk of lung cancer, with these associations being more pronounced in smokers (Yang2012Functional). In Mexican populations, the rs1051730 polymorphism is associated with higher susceptibility to both COPD and lung cancer, with the G/A genotype showing significant odds ratios for these diseases (Pérez‐Morales2018CHRNA3).

CHRNA3 is also implicated in familial autonomic ganglionopathy, where rare genetic variants can lead to severe autonomic dysfunctions, including neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and impaired sympathetic activity (Shibao2021Familial). Additionally, CHRNA3 polymorphisms are associated with nicotine and alcohol dependence, suggesting a role in addiction pathways (Zuo2016Associations). These genetic variations may influence the efficacy of smoking cessation programs and contribute to the genetic predisposition to smoking-related diseases (Pérez‐Morales2018CHRNA3).

## Interactions
The CHRNA3 gene encodes the α3 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which can form functional receptor complexes by interacting with other subunits such as β2 and β4. These interactions are crucial for the formation of α3β2 and α3β4 nAChRs, which have distinct roles in neurotransmission and nicotine addiction (Improgo2010The; Elayouby2020α3*). The α3 subunit can also interact with the α5 subunit, which modulates the function of α3-containing receptors by increasing calcium permeability and affecting desensitization rates (Improgo2010The).

The CHRNA3 gene is part of a gene cluster with CHRNA5 and CHRNB4, and these genes are co-expressed in various tissues, suggesting shared regulatory elements and potential interactions at the transcriptional level (Barrie2016TheCHRNA5CHRNA3CHRNB4Nicotinic; Lee2019Nicotine). The expression of CHRNA3 is regulated by several transcription factors, including PHOX2A, which interacts with Sp1, and Brn-3 factors, which can either activate or repress the α3 promoter through protein-protein interactions (Improgo2010The). These regulatory interactions highlight the complex network of transcriptional control that influences CHRNA3 expression and its role in nicotine dependence and other physiological processes.
