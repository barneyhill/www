# CEP15

## Overview
CEP15 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 15, a crucial component of the centrosome, which is the primary microtubule-organizing center in animal cells. The protein plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis, by ensuring proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation. As a centrosomal protein, CEP15 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the centrosome, which is essential for accurate cell division and genomic stability. Mutations or dysregulation of CEP15 have been implicated in various disorders, including cancer, due to its critical role in cell proliferation and division (Qiu2020aarFDC).
