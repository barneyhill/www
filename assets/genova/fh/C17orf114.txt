# C17orf114

## Overview
C17orf114 is a gene located on chromosome 17 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 17 open reading frame 114. This protein is categorized as an uncharacterized protein, as its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes remain largely undefined. Despite the limited understanding of its precise function, studies have suggested potential involvement in various cellular pathways, although further research is necessary to elucidate its exact mechanisms and interactions. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential implications in human health and disease, warranting continued investigation to uncover their roles in biological systems (Qiu2020aarFDC).
