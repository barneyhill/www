# GTF3C1

## Overview
GTF3C1, or general transcription factor IIIC subunit 1, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) complex, which is integral to the transcription of RNA polymerase III-dependent genes. The protein encoded by GTF3C1 is involved in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, facilitating the transcription of small RNA molecules such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, which are essential for protein synthesis and ribosomal function. As a subunit of the TFIIIC complex, GTF3C1 plays a critical role in recognizing promoter elements and recruiting other transcription factors and RNA polymerase III to initiate transcription. Additionally, GTF3C1 exhibits histone acetyltransferase activity, contributing to chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular growth, homeostasis, and the regulation of gene expression, impacting various cellular processes and organismal development (Kundu1999Human; Basu2019The; Anuraga2021Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Function
GTF3C1, or general transcription factor IIIC subunit 1, is a component of the transcription factor IIIC complex, which plays a crucial role in the transcription of RNA polymerase III-dependent genes. This complex is essential for the transcription of small RNA molecules, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA, which are vital for protein synthesis and ribosomal function. GTF3C1 is involved in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex, facilitating the accurate initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase III. This process is critical for maintaining cellular growth and gene expression regulation.

In healthy human cells, GTF3C1 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression by ensuring the proper transcription of small RNA molecules. These molecules are necessary for the biogenesis of ribosomal subunits and the overall protein synthesis machinery, which are fundamental processes for cell growth and proliferation. The activity of GTF3C1 in the nucleus underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and the regulation of gene expression, impacting various cellular and organismal outcomes related to growth and development (Anuraga2021Comprehensive).

## Interactions
GTF3C1, a subunit of the TFIIIC complex, plays a crucial role in transcription by RNA polymerase III. It is involved in recognizing promoter elements, specifically the A and B boxes within tRNA genes, and facilitates the recruitment of TFIIIB and RNA polymerase III for transcription initiation (Moqtaderi2010Genomic; Kundu1999Human). GTF3C1 exhibits intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which is important for relieving chromatin-mediated repression by acetylating histones H3, H4, and H2A, thereby modifying chromatin structure to promote transcription (Basu2019The; Kundu1999Human).

GTF3C1 also interacts with Alu elements, contributing to chromatin looping and histone acetylation, particularly acetylating H3K18, which enhances chromatin accessibility and potentially influences gene expression (Ferrari2020TFIIIC; Ferrari2018TFIIIC). In neurons, GTF3C1 is recruited to enhancer SINEs (eSINEs) in response to neuronal depolarization, linking Pol III to Pol II transcription and coordinating activity-dependent transcription (Policarpi2017Enhancer).

The TFIIIC complex, including GTF3C1, can also act as a barrier or insulator, influencing adjacent RNA polymerase II transcription and maintaining acetylation homeostasis in cells (Basu2019The). These interactions highlight GTF3C1's multifaceted role in transcription regulation and chromatin modification.
