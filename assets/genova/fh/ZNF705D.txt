# ZNF705D

## Overview
ZNF705D is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 705D, a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein family. This family is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are crucial for DNA binding and gene regulation. The zinc finger protein 705D, like other proteins in this family, contains Cys2-His2 (C2H2) motifs that coordinate zinc ions, enabling the protein to interact with DNA's major groove (Bruno2019The; Thorball2020Ongoing). The gene is part of a larger group of KRAB-ZNF genes that have shown rapid sequence and expression divergence, suggesting an adaptive role in the regulation of primate-specific genes (Nowick2010Rapid). The protein's structure, rich in cysteine and histidine residues, supports its function in DNA binding and potential involvement in transcriptional regulation (Bruno2019The).

## Structure
ZNF705D is a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein family, characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains that facilitate DNA binding. These domains typically consist of Cys2-His2 (C2H2) motifs, which coordinate zinc ions to form a stable ββα fold, allowing interaction with DNA's major groove (Bruno2019The; Thorball2020Ongoing). The primary structure of ZNF705D is rich in cysteine and histidine residues, essential for the formation of zinc finger motifs (Bruno2019The).

The secondary structure of ZNF705D involves the formation of these zinc finger motifs, which contribute to its DNA-binding capability. The tertiary structure is compact and folded, facilitating specific interactions with DNA sequences. Although specific post-translational modifications for ZNF705D are not detailed, zinc finger proteins often undergo modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence their activity and function (Bruno2019The).

ZNF705D is noted for its high sequence similarity to ZNF705A, with differences in DNA-binding residues, suggesting potential functional divergence in DNA interaction (Nowick2010Rapid). The protein is part of a larger family of KRAB-ZNF genes that have undergone rapid sequence and expression divergence, indicating an adaptive role in primate-specific gene regulation (Nowick2010Rapid).
