# TMED8

## Overview
TMED8 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane p24 trafficking protein family member 8, which is part of the p24 family of proteins. These proteins are integral to the secretory pathway, primarily involved in vesicular trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. TMED8, as a transmembrane protein, plays a crucial role in forming heteromeric complexes with other p24 family members and interacting with coat protein complexes such as COPI and COPII, which are essential for vesicle formation and trafficking (Thavarajah2020The). The protein has been implicated in various cellular processes, including phagocytosis, cytoskeleton dynamics, and metabolic energy regulation, particularly in the context of sepsis and cancer (Xie2023Mechanism; Lee2020Genomic). TMED8's expression and regulatory interactions suggest its involvement in cancer-related pathways, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Gao2022TMED2910; Zhou2015HsamicroRNA181a).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMED8 has been implicated in various cancer-related processes. In neuroblastoma, TMED8 is significantly overexpressed in high-risk groups, suggesting its potential role in tumor progression and as a therapeutic target (Lee2020Genomic). The gene is also mentioned as a methylated regulator of energy metabolism in neuroblastoma, indicating its involvement in cancer metabolism (Gao2022TMED2910). Additionally, TMED8 is likely regulated by hsa-miR-181a-5p, a microRNA involved in cancer development, which suggests that TMED8 may be part of a broader network of genes influencing cancer-related pathways (Zhou2015HsamicroRNA181a).

While the primary focus of studies has been on other TMED family members, TMED8's role in cancer is highlighted through its expression patterns and regulatory interactions. The gene's altered expression or methylation status could contribute to the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma and potentially other cancers. However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from TMED8 mutations or expression changes are not extensively detailed in the available literature, indicating a need for further research to fully elucidate its clinical significance.

## Interactions
TMED8, a member of the p24 family, is involved in vesicular trafficking within the secretory pathway. It is known to form heteromeric complexes with other p24 family members, facilitating cargo transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. TMED8 may also interact with coat protein complexes such as COPI and COPII, which are crucial for vesicle formation and trafficking.

In the context of sepsis, TMED8 was identified as having significant differences in observation frequency between ICU-Sepsis patients and ICU Control groups. This suggests that TMED8 may be involved in a complex network of protein interactions related to functions such as phagocytosis, cytoskeleton dynamics, motility, and metabolic energy regulation (Thavarajah2020The).

During Legionella pneumophila infection, TMED8 is one of the host proteins targeted by SidE family proteins, which utilize PR-ubiquitination to modify endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi-related proteins. This interaction potentially affects the normal functions of these organelles, although specific interactions involving TMED8 are not detailed (Xie2023Mechanism).
