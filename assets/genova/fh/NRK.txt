# NRK

## Overview
The NRK gene encodes the Nik-related kinase, a serine/threonine protein kinase that is part of the Germinal Center Kinase (GCK) family subgroup IV. This kinase is characterized by its three-domain structure, which includes an N-terminal kinase domain, a middle disordered region, and a C-terminal citron homology (CNH) domain. The CNH domain is particularly significant for its role in binding phospholipids and localizing to the plasma membrane during apoptosis, thereby promoting cell death (Lestari2023The). NRK is predominantly expressed in placental tissues, where it plays a critical role in regulating cell proliferation and development by modulating the CK2-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway (Lestari2022Placental). The gene has undergone evolutionary adaptations in placental mammals, acquiring a placental-specific exon that enhances its regulatory functions (Liu2021New). Beyond its role in placental development, NRK is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and signal transduction, interacting with various proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis (Naito2020Nik‐related).

## Structure
The NRK (Nik-related kinase) protein is a serine/threonine kinase encoded by the NRK gene located on the X chromosome. It belongs to the Germinal Center Kinase (GCK) family subgroup IV and features a three-domain structure: an N-terminal kinase domain, a middle disordered region, and a C-terminal citron homology (CNH) domain (Lestari2023The). The CNH domain is crucial for NRK's function, particularly in promoting cell death, as it binds to phospholipids and localizes to the plasma membrane during apoptosis (Lestari2023The). This domain is characterized by a b-propeller structure, which is similar to the Rom2 CNH domain, and contains polybasic clusters essential for binding to phospholipids in the plasma membrane (Lestari2023The).

The NRK protein has undergone significant evolutionary changes, particularly in placental mammals, where it acquired a placental-specific exon that encodes a flexible loop potentially interacting with other regions to modulate enzymatic activity (Liu2021New). This exon is surrounded by regions of accelerated evolution, indicating its importance in placental development (Liu2021New). The CNH domain's evolution in placental mammals is linked to its function in cell death regulation, supporting proper placenta size by balancing cell proliferation and death (Lestari2023The).

## Function
The NRK (Nik-related kinase) gene encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation and development, particularly in placental tissues. NRK is predominantly expressed in the placenta, where it is involved in preventing placental hyperplasia by modulating the CK2-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for controlling cell proliferation, and NRK's inhibition of CK2 reduces PTEN phosphorylation, leading to decreased AKT signaling and cell proliferation (Lestari2022Placental).

NRK contains a citron homology (CNH) domain that binds to phospholipids, facilitating its localization to the plasma membrane. This domain is critical for NRK's function in inhibiting AKT signaling and promoting cell death during apoptosis. The CNH domain's ability to bind phospholipids is a feature that evolved specifically in placental mammals, highlighting its importance in placental development (Lestari2023The; Lestari2022Placental).

In addition to its role in the placenta, NRK is involved in cellular processes such as cytoskeletal remodeling and signal transduction. It interacts with molecular chaperones and is targeted for degradation by the chaperone-dependent ubiquitin ligase CHIP, which regulates its levels and activity (Denda2019Proteomic; Naito2020Nik‐related).

## Clinical Significance
The NRK gene, encoding Nik-related kinase, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes. Alterations in NRK expression or mutations can lead to significant clinical outcomes. In breast cancer, NRK deficiency during pregnancy in mice has been shown to trigger breast tumor development, particularly resembling the luminal B subtype of human breast cancer. This is linked to the gene's role in regulating estrogen-dependent proliferation of mammary epithelial cells, with its deficiency leading to increased tumor incidence (Yanagawa2016Deficiency).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), NRK is significantly upregulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor microenvironment. This upregulation is associated with poor survival outcomes, suggesting that NRK expression levels could serve as a prognostic marker. The gene's involvement in metabolism pathways, particularly glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, may influence tumorigenesis and progression in LUAD (Wei2021Identification).

Additionally, NRK plays a crucial role in placental development. Disruption of the NRK gene in mice leads to placental overgrowth and delayed labor, indicating its involvement in mediating delivery-inducing signals from the placenta. This suggests that NRK may function as a tumor suppressor gene, with its disruption potentially leading to breast tumors in female mice (Denda2011Nrk; Denda2019Proteomic).

## Interactions
NRK (Nik related kinase) is involved in several protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with the chaperone-dependent ubiquitin ligase CHIP, which targets NRK for proteasomal degradation. This interaction is mediated by the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain in CHIP and multiple regions in NRK, including the CNH and DCNH domains. The interaction with CHIP is crucial for maintaining NRK protein levels, as CHIP overexpression decreases NRK levels, while CHIP knockdown increases them (Naito2020Nik‐related).

NRK also plays a role in the CK2-PTEN-AKT signaling pathway, interacting with the CK2 complex by binding to the CK2b subunit. This interaction involves specific regions in NRK, particularly amino acids 565-868, which are crucial for binding to CK2b and for AKT suppression. The CNH domain of NRK is essential for its localization to the plasma membrane and its lipid-binding ability, which is necessary for inhibiting AKT signaling (Lestari2022Placental).

Additionally, NRK can phosphorylate cofilin, a protein involved in actin polymerization, at Ser-3, independently of LIMK1, highlighting its role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization (Nakano2003Cofilin).
