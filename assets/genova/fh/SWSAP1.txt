# SWSAP1

## Overview
SWSAP1 is a gene that encodes the SWIM-type zinc finger 7 associated protein 1, a protein integral to the human Shu complex, which is involved in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly homologous recombination. As a RAD51 paralog, the protein shares functional similarities with RAD51, a recombinase essential for DNA repair, and plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating the formation of RAD51 filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Liu2011hSWS1·SWSAP1; Hengel2024The). The protein's interactions with other components of the Shu complex, such as hSWS1, and its ability to modulate the activity of anti-recombinase FIGNL1, underscore its importance in cellular processes that prevent chromosome fragmentation and ensure accurate DNA repair (Liu2011hSWS1·SWSAP1; Matsuzaki2019Human). Mutations in the SWSAP1 gene have been linked to various cancers and fertility issues, highlighting its clinical significance in genomic stability and reproductive health (Matsuzaki2019Human; Hengel2024The).

## Function
SWSAP1 is a crucial component of the human Shu complex, which plays a significant role in DNA repair processes, particularly during homologous recombination and replication stress. As a RAD51 paralog, SWSAP1 shares functional similarities with RAD51, a key recombinase involved in DNA repair. The Shu complex, including SWSAP1, enhances the diffusion of replication protein A (RPA) on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), facilitating the dissociation of RPA from remodeled replication forks. This process is essential for the accumulation of RAD51-SWSAP1-SWS1 filaments, which enable template-switching and high-fidelity lesion bypass during DNA replication (Hengel2024The).

SWSAP1 is involved in maintaining the interaction between RAD51 and ssDNA, promoting RAD51 D-loop reactions on RPA-coated ssDNA substrates. This activity is crucial for the repair of DNA damage and the resolution of replication stress (Hengel2024The). The Shu complex, including SWSAP1, is also implicated in bypassing abasic sites during replication by promoting RAD51 filament formation and template switching, highlighting its importance in cellular survival under conditions of replication stress (Hengel2024The). SWSAP1 is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other proteins to ensure accurate DNA repair, contributing to cell cycle regulation and preventing genomic instability (Martino2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SWSAP1 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, particularly those related to genomic instability and cancer. SWSAP1 mutations are linked to several cancers, including breast, uterine, endometrial, and prostate cancers. These mutations often disrupt the interaction between SWSAP1 and other proteins, such as SWS1, leading to impaired homologous recombination, a critical DNA repair process (Hengel2024The). The disruption of this pathway can result in increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and may influence the effectiveness of cancer therapies, such as PARP inhibitors, which target homologous recombination-deficient tumors (Hengel2024The).

In addition to cancer, SWSAP1 mutations have implications for fertility. Studies in mice have shown that loss of SWSAP1 leads to infertility due to defects in gamete formation, with smaller testes and atrophic seminiferous tubules observed in knockout models (Matsuzaki2019Human). In humans, similar mutations may result in conditions like delayed puberty and ovarian dysgenesis, as evidenced by cases involving SPIDR truncation alleles (Prakash2021Distinct). These findings suggest that SWSAP1 plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and fertility, with mutations potentially contributing to infertility and cancer susceptibility.

## Interactions
SWSAP1 is a protein that plays a significant role in homologous recombination repair by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a stable complex with hSWS1, and their interaction is crucial for the stability of both proteins. This complex is involved in DNA repair processes, particularly in the formation of RAD51 filaments, which are essential for homologous recombination (Liu2011hSWS1·SWSAP1).

SWSAP1 interacts with RAD51 and several RAD51 paralogs, facilitating the assembly of RAD51 filaments on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This interaction is vital for promoting RAD51 foci formation and enhancing cellular resistance to DNA damage (Liu2011hSWS1·SWSAP1). SWSAP1 also interacts with the anti-recombinase FIGNL1, inhibiting its activity to stabilize RAD51 filaments. This interaction is crucial for maintaining chromosome stability and preventing chromosome fragmentation (Matsuzaki2019Human).

SWSAP1 is part of the human Shu complex, which includes hSWS1, and is essential for efficient homologous recombination repair. The complex's ATPase activity, stimulated by ssDNA, is necessary for its function in DNA repair (Liu2011hSWS1·SWSAP1).
