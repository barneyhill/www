# MSR1

## Overview
Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein known as macrophage scavenger receptor 1. This receptor is predominantly expressed in macrophages and plays a critical role in the immune system by mediating the binding and internalization of a diverse array of ligands, including modified low-density lipoproteins, apoptotic cells, and pathogens. As a scavenger receptor, MSR1 is integral to processes such as lipid metabolism, inflammation, and atherosclerosis, and it is involved in the activation of several signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, and MAPK (Zhao2020Macrophage; Onyishi2023Tolllike). The protein's interactions with toll-like receptors and its role in phagocytosis underscore its importance in the immune response and pathogen clearance (Onyishi2023Tolllike; Gudgeon2022The). Additionally, MSR1 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and inflammatory disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Xu2002Germline; Gudgeon2022The).

## Structure


## Function
Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) is a protein primarily expressed in macrophages, where it functions as a scavenger receptor involved in the binding and internalization of a wide range of ligands, including modified low-density lipoproteins (LDL), apoptotic cells, and pathogens. MSR1 plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and atherosclerosis by activating signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, NF-κB, and MAPK (Zhao2020Macrophage). It is also involved in the phagocytosis of pathogens, such as the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, where it forms a signaling complex with Fcγ receptors, activating kinases like SYK and PI3K to drive actin remodeling and pathogen internalization (Onyishi2023Tolllike).

MSR1 is active on the cell surface and is crucial for the immune response, including the clearance of apoptotic cells and bacterial components. It regulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 in response to inflammatory stimuli (Shirato2009Hypoxiainducible). In the context of bone fracture healing, MSR1 enhances the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stem cells and promotes M2-like macrophage polarization, which is associated with enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Zhao2020Macrophage).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MSR1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In prostate cancer, certain rare mutations in MSR1, such as Arg293X and Asp174Tyr, have been associated with increased risk, especially among individuals with hereditary prostate cancer (Xu2002Germline). These mutations may affect the protein's ligand-binding region, potentially influencing inflammation and oxidative stress in prostate tissues (Xu2002Germline). 

In the context of cancer, high expression levels of MSR1 in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are linked to poor prognosis and increased severity in various cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, and muscle-invasive bladder cancer. MSR1+ TAMs contribute to tumor growth and metastasis by promoting the accumulation and polarization of M2 macrophages (Gudgeon2022The). 

MSR1 is also involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where specific gene polymorphisms, such as SNP rs13306550, are associated with increased COPD risk, although they do not influence lung cancer pathogenesis in COPD patients (Xie2018Function). 

In inflammatory disorders, MSR1 plays a role in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, where it is linked to disease severity and inflammation (Gudgeon2022The).

## Interactions
Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) is involved in various interactions with proteins and signaling pathways. It interacts with toll-like receptors (TLRs), specifically TLR3 and TLR9, to stimulate proinflammatory pathways. MSR1 also interacts with TLR4, where it can modulate the inflammatory response by limiting ligand availability on the cell surface or acting as a co-receptor to enhance ligand interaction with TLRs (Sheng2022Role; Onyishi2023Tolllike; Gudgeon2022The).

MSR1 is involved in the formation of a signaling complex with FcγRII/III, which activates SYK and PI3K, leading to actin polymerization and phagocytosis. This interaction is crucial for the phagocytosis of pathogens like Cryptococcus neoformans (Onyishi2023Tolllike).

In the context of viral infections, MSR1 interacts with the ATG5-ATG12 complex, which is essential for its antiviral activity against the chikungunya virus. This interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of MSR1 and is crucial for autophagic processes (Yang2020Macrophage).

MSR1 can also become polyubiquitylated, serving as a scaffold for the recruitment of the TAK1/MKK7/JNK signaling complex, which is involved in a phenotype switch from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory states (Guo2019Triggering; Gudgeon2022The).
