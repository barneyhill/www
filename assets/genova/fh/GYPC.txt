# GYPC

## Overview
The GYPC gene encodes glycophorin C, a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the erythrocyte membrane. Glycophorin C plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and biconcave shape of red blood cells, which is essential for their function and mechanical resilience as they traverse the circulatory system (Hollox2022Genetic). Beyond its structural role, glycophorin C is involved in cell signaling and serves as a receptor for pathogens, notably the malaria-causing Plasmodium falciparum, which exploits this protein to invade erythrocytes (Maier2002Plasmodium). The interaction between glycophorin C and the parasite's erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 (EBA140) is a pivotal step in the malaria infection process (Maier2002Plasmodium). Variations in the GYPC gene, such as those leading to the Gerbich-negative phenotype, can confer resistance to malaria, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Wilder2009Molecular). Additionally, GYPC expression levels have been implicated in the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia, underscoring its potential as a biomarker in hematological malignancies (Zhu2017High).

## Function
Glycophorin C (GYPC) is a transmembrane protein primarily found on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs), where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the biconcave discoid shape of these cells, which is essential for their proper function (Hollox2022Genetic). GYPC interacts with the cytoskeleton of RBCs, contributing to cell shape and stability. This interaction is vital for the structural integrity of the cell membrane, allowing RBCs to withstand the mechanical stress they encounter as they circulate through the bloodstream (Hollox2022Genetic).

In addition to its structural role, GYPC is involved in cell signaling processes. It serves as a receptor for various pathogens, including the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite utilizes GYPC as a receptor to invade human erythrocytes, a process facilitated by the binding of the parasite's erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 (EBA140) to GYPC (Maier2002Plasmodium). This interaction is a critical step in the parasite's life cycle and contributes to the pathogenesis of malaria (Maier2002Plasmodium). The presence of GYPC on the cell surface and its involvement in pathogen interactions highlight its importance in both cellular and organismal contexts.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GYPC gene can lead to several clinical conditions. One notable condition is the Gerbich-negative (GeÀ) phenotype, which results from a deletion affecting the extracellular components of glycophorin C (GPC) and glycophorin D (GPD). This structural variant is common among Melanesians and provides resistance to malaria by preventing the binding of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite to red blood cells (Wilder2009Molecular). The deletion in exon 3 of the GYPC gene is specifically associated with this malaria resistance, suggesting a selective advantage in malaria-endemic regions (Wilder2009Molecular).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the expression level of GYPC has been identified as a potential prognostic marker. High expression of GYPC, along with other genes such as AHSP, EPB42, and HEMGN, is associated with a favorable prognosis in FLT3-ITD-negative AML patients. This suggests that GYPC expression levels could be utilized in diagnostic or therapeutic strategies for AML (Zhu2017High). However, the specific mechanisms by which GYPC expression influences AML prognosis remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
Glycophorin C (GYPC) is a key erythrocyte membrane protein that interacts with Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria. The interaction between GYPC and the parasite's erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 (EBA140) is crucial for the invasion of red blood cells by the parasite. This binding is specific to GYPC and is not observed in Ge-negative erythrocytes, which lack exon 3 in the GYPC gene, indicating the importance of this region for the interaction (Maier2002Plasmodium).

The interaction is mediated by the presence of sialic acid residues on GYPC, as neuraminidase treatment, which removes these residues, abolishes the binding of EBA140 to GYPC (Maier2002Plasmodium). This suggests that sialic acid is essential for the proper exposure of the ligand recognized by EBA140. The Gerbich-negative phenotype, common among certain populations, results in a deletion affecting the extracellular components of GYPC, rendering erythrocytes partially resistant to P. falciparum invasion due to the lack of EBA140 binding (Maier2002Plasmodium; Wilder2009Molecular).

GYPC also undergoes phosphorylation at a novel site, p-Y126, within its cytoplasmic C-terminal, which may play a role in modulating the erythroid cytoskeleton (Held2020Phosphoproteomic).
