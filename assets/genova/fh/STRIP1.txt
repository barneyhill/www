# STRIP1

## Overview
STRIP1, or striatin interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a crucial component of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex. This protein functions primarily as an adaptor, facilitating interactions within the complex that are essential for various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, and cell cycle regulation. STRIP1 is characterized by specific domains, such as the C-terminal tail and kinase-binding domain, which enable its interaction with other proteins like STRN3 and MST kinases, respectively (Tang2019Architecture). Through these interactions, STRIP1 plays a significant role in modulating pathways such as the Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin, impacting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cellular homeostasis (Li2023Cellular). Its involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including cancer and retinal disorders (Ahmed2022Strip1; Li2023Cellular).

## Structure
STRIP1, also known as FAM40A, is a component of the STRIPAK complex, which plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell signaling and cytoskeletal organization. The protein contains specific domains that facilitate its interactions within the complex. Notably, the C-terminal tail (CTT) of STRIP1, comprising residues 796-837, is crucial for binding to the coiled-coil domain of STRN3, a key interaction within the STRIPAK complex (Tang2019Architecture). This interaction is essential for STRIP1's function as an adaptor protein, linking STRN3 to other components of the complex (Tang2019Architecture).

STRIP1 also contains a kinase-binding domain (KBD) within residues 421-744, which is necessary for its interaction with MST2 and MST4 kinases in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Tang2019Architecture). This domain is critical for the regulation of kinase activities within the STRIPAK complex.

The protein's structure includes coiled-coil regions, which are common in proteins involved in complex assembly and protein-protein interactions (Kück2019STRIPAK). While specific details on the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of STRIP1 are not provided, its role in the STRIPAK complex and interactions with other proteins suggest a highly structured and functional architecture.

## Function
STRIP1 (striatin interacting protein 1) is a component of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cytoskeletal organization. STRIP1 is involved in regulating the G1 phase of the cell cycle by enhancing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, which suggests its role in cell cycle progression (Li2023Cellular). It also participates in cytoskeletal organization, influencing cell morphology and migration by interacting with proteins such as cortactin-binding protein 2 (CBP2) and the ERM family proteins (Kück2019STRIPAK; Li2023Cellular).

In the context of cellular signaling, STRIP1 is involved in the regulation of the Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, playing a crucial role in maintaining normal cell-cell adhesion and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Li2023Cellular). It also acts as a negative regulator of the JNK signaling pathway, which is necessary to prevent JNK-mediated apoptosis (Li2023Cellular). STRIP1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cellular homeostasis and development by influencing these signaling pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics (Kück2019STRIPAK; Li2023Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STRIP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, STRIP1 is involved in cell proliferation and cycle control. Its depletion can lead to cell cycle arrest and suppressed proliferation in breast cancer cells, suggesting a role in tumor progression and response to therapies (Li2023Cellular). STRIP1 is also linked to the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis (Tang2019Architecture). Alterations in STRIP1 expression or interactions can impact cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer (Li2023Cellular).

In retinal development, mutations in STRIP1 can lead to defects in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and retinal lamination, potentially contributing to retinal disorders. A specific missense mutation in STRIP1 has been shown to cause RGC death and disorganization in the retinal structure, highlighting its importance in retinal neural circuit formation (Ahmed2022Strip1).

Additionally, STRIP1 is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization, and its dysregulation may contribute to developmental disorders. Alterations in STRIP1 can affect cell polarity and migration, processes that are critical in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Kück2019STRIPAK).

## Interactions
STRIP1, also known as striatin interacting protein 1, is a key component of the STRIPAK (striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase) complex. It interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. STRIP1 directly binds to STRN3 through its C-terminal tail, which interacts with the coiled-coil domain of STRN3. This interaction is essential for the assembly of the STRIPAK complex and is confirmed by techniques such as MBP pulldown assay and isothermal titration calorimetry (Tang2019Architecture).

Within the STRIPAK complex, STRIP1 also interacts with MST kinases, acting as a scaffold that recruits these kinases in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. This interaction is facilitated by the kinase-binding domain (KBD) of STRIP1, which binds to the kinase domain of MST2 (Tang2019Architecture). STRIP1 is also associated with other components of the STRIPAK complex, including SIKE1, SLMAP, and CCM3, and interacts with PP2A subunits through its association with striatins (Kück2019STRIPAK; Goudreault2009A).

STRIP1's interactions extend to other proteins such as PP2Ac, PP2A A, Mob3, and members of the GCK-III subfamily of kinases, including STK24, STK25, and MST4, indicating its involvement in a larger protein network (Goudreault2009A). These interactions suggest that STRIP1 plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, including the Hippo signaling pathway, influencing processes like cell proliferation and apoptosis (Tang2019Architecture).
