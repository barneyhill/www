# ARIH2

## Overview
The ARIH2 gene encodes the ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, a member of the RBR (RING-between-RING) E3 ligase family, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitination process, a critical post-translational modification that regulates protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. The ARIH2 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes several domains such as RING1, IBR, and Rcat, essential for its function as an E3 ligase (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2). It is involved in various cellular processes, including immune regulation, muscle cell biology, and protein interactions, influencing pathways related to inflammation, muscle health, and cancer cell proliferation (Raz2014A; Kawashima2017ARIH2). Clinically, mutations in the ARIH2 gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, and its dysregulation is linked to cancer resistance and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Vinci2024A; Zeng2019Genomewide).

## Structure
The ARIH2 protein, encoded by the ARIH2 gene, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase characterized by a complex molecular structure. It contains several domains, including the RING1, RTI helix, in-between RING (IBR), and Rcat domains, which are interspersed with ARIH-specific UBA-like (UBAL) and Ariadne domains (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2). The Ariadne domain plays a crucial role in autoinhibition by masking the active site within the second RING-type zinc finger domain (Vinci2024A). The protein's structure is organized into two main parts: one forms a platform with E2~UB-binding surfaces, stabilized by the UBAL domain intercalating between RING1 and IBR domains, while the other involves autoinhibition (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2).

The ARIH2 protein undergoes conformational changes upon binding to neddylated CUL5, which relieves autoinhibition and stimulates the reactivity of the catalytic cysteine (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2). The N-terminal region, although not present in the crystal structure, is crucial for interactions with the remodeled CUL5 groove (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2). The protein's structure is influenced by electrostatic interactions, particularly hydrogen bonds, which are essential for maintaining its integrity and activity (Vinci2024A). The ARIH2 protein is expressed in several brain tissues and has been linked to neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability (Vinci2024A).

## Function
ARIH2, also known as ariadne RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation in healthy human cells. ARIH2 is involved in the ubiquitination of the NLRP3 protein, a component of the inflammasome complex in macrophages. By promoting the ubiquitination of NLRP3, ARIH2 negatively regulates the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, thereby controlling inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis (Kawashima2017ARIH2).

In addition to its role in immune regulation, ARIH2 is implicated in muscle cell biology. It regulates the turnover and aggregation of the PABPN1 protein, which is important for muscle cell fusion and myogenesis. ARIH2's interaction with PABPN1 influences protein stability and aggregation, impacting muscle health and function, particularly in the context of aging and muscle degeneration (Raz2014A).

ARIH2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular pathways, contributing to organismal development and immune system function. Its activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins and complexes, such as the CUL5-RBX2 complex, which is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARIH2 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. A de novo mutation in the ARIH2 gene, specifically c.1411-3C > T, has been identified in a patient with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). This mutation affects the splicing of the ARIH2 gene, potentially leading to a misfolded E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which may disrupt neuronal growth and function (Vinci2024A). The ARIH2 gene is expressed in brain regions associated with ASD, such as the amygdala and cerebral cortex, and its expression is downregulated in individuals with ASD compared to neurotypical controls (Vinci2024A).

In cancer, ARIH2 has been linked to resistance against EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Loss of ARIH2 in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells leads to increased protein synthesis rates and resistance to EGFR inhibitors, highlighting its role in drug resistance mechanisms (Zeng2019Genomewide). Additionally, ARIH2 is involved in regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases (Kawashima2017ARIH2). Dysregulation of ARIH2 is also associated with aging-associated muscle degeneration and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (Raz2014A).

## Interactions
ARIH2, a member of the RBR E3 ligase family, participates in several critical protein interactions. It interacts with the protein p21, regulating its expression through ubiquitination. This interaction is significant in gastric cancer cells, where ARIH2-mediated ubiquitination of p21 affects its stability, influencing cell cycle regulation and proliferation. The interaction between ARIH2 and p21 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, identifying specific amino acid residues involved in the ubiquitination process, such as the K48 residue of ubiquitin and the K161 residue of p21 (Geng2022ARIH2).

ARIH2 also interacts with neddylated Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), particularly within the CRL5 complex. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination process, where ARIH2, along with ARIH1, forms a specific E3-E3 ubiquitin ligase pairing with neddylated CRLs. The interaction with neddylated CUL5 promotes conformational changes that facilitate ARIH2's function in the ubiquitination cascade (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2).

In the context of HIV infection, ARIH2 is a Vif-dependent interactor within the CUL5 complex, involved in the degradation of APOBEC3G, a protein that restricts HIV replication. This interaction is essential for HIV infectivity, as ARIH2, in conjunction with the CRL5 Vif/CBFß complex, accelerates the polyubiquitination of APOBEC3 proteins (Hüttenhain2019ARIH2).
