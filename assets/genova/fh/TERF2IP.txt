# TERF2IP

## Overview
TERF2IP, also known as RAP1, is a gene located on chromosome 16q23.1 that encodes the TERF2 interacting protein, a critical component of the shelterin complex involved in telomere maintenance. The protein plays a pivotal role in protecting chromosome ends from degradation and inappropriate DNA repair activities, thereby maintaining genomic stability. TERF2IP interacts with telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) to regulate telomere length and prevent DNA damage responses at telomeres. Beyond its telomeric functions, TERF2IP also acts as a transcription factor in angiogenesis and pluripotency maintenance, and it regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is involved in inflammation and cellular stress responses (Deregowska2021RAP1TERF2IP—A; Thakar2023Regulation). Mutations and alterations in TERF2IP have been implicated in various diseases, including familial melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Speedy2016Germ; Aoude2014Nonsense).

## Structure
TERF2IP, also known as RAP1, is a protein involved in telomere maintenance and is part of the shelterin complex. The protein consists of 399 amino acid residues and includes three distinct domains: the N-terminal BRCT domain, the C-terminal TRF2 domain, and the Myb domain. The BRCT domain is responsible for recognizing phosphorylated peptides, while the TRF2 domain interacts with the TRF2 protein. The Myb domain in mammals does not bind directly to telomeric DNA, unlike in budding yeast, and instead relies on TRF2 for telomeric interaction. This is due to the lack of a distinct positive surface in the mammalian Myb domain, which explains its lack of DNA-binding property (Amir2020Structural).

The quaternary structure of TERF2IP involves its interaction with other proteins, such as forming complexes with TERF2, which is crucial for chromosome end protection. Disruption of these interactions, such as through mutations, can lead to telomere dysfunction and has been associated with familial melanoma (Aoude2014Nonsense). The protein's interaction with telomeric DNA is mediated through TRF2, and its deletion from telomeres can lead to DNA damage signaling and end-to-end fusions (Amir2020Structural).

## Function
TERF2IP, also known as RAP1, is a crucial component of the shelterin complex, which is responsible for maintaining telomere integrity and protecting chromosome ends from degradation and inappropriate DNA repair activities. In healthy human cells, TERF2IP interacts with telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) to regulate telomere length and prevent the activation of DNA damage responses at telomeres (Deregowska2021RAP1TERF2IP—A). This interaction is essential for repressing homologous recombination at telomeres, thereby preventing telomere recombination and sister chromatid exchanges (Deregowska2021RAP1TERF2IP—A).

TERF2IP is encoded by the TERF2IP gene located on chromosome 16q23.1 and can be translated into multiple isoforms. The protein contains several conserved domains, including the BRCT domain, which is involved in the DNA damage response, and the RCT domain, which facilitates interaction with TRF2 and other binding partners (Deregowska2021RAP1TERF2IP—A). These domains enable TERF2IP to interact with molecular partners beyond the shelterin complex, indicating its multifunctional role in cellular processes.

In addition to its telomeric functions, TERF2IP has non-telomeric roles, such as acting as a transcription factor in angiogenesis and maintaining pluripotency in stem cells (Thakar2023Regulation). It also plays a role in regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is involved in inflammation and cellular stress responses (Thakar2023Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TERF2IP gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In familial melanoma, nonsense mutations such as p.R364X in TERF2IP have been identified, leading to a truncated protein that disrupts its normal function and is associated with increased melanoma susceptibility (Aoude2014Nonsense). These mutations are statistically significant in melanoma probands compared to control individuals, suggesting a role in melanoma predisposition (Aoude2014Nonsense).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), germline mutations in TERF2IP, including the missense variant p.Arg133Gln, have been found in familial cases. This mutation is predicted to be damaging and affects protein stability, indicating a potential role in CLL susceptibility (Speedy2016Germ).

Alterations in TERF2IP expression have also been linked to endothelial senescence under hyperglycemic conditions, relevant to diabetes. Increased expression of TERF2IP contributes to cellular senescence by elevating levels of p53 and p21, markers of senescence, which may have implications for cardiovascular diseases (Thakar2023Regulation).

Overall, mutations and expression changes in TERF2IP are associated with telomere dysfunction, contributing to genomic instability and various disease states.

## Interactions
TERF2IP, also known as RAP1, is a component of the shelterin complex, which plays a crucial role in telomere protection and maintenance. It interacts with TERF2, a telomeric repeat-binding factor, forming a complex that is essential for maintaining telomere length and structure (Antoine2005Zinc; Aoude2014Nonsense). TERF2IP also interacts with other proteins such as TRF1 and TIN2, contributing to the regulation of telomere length and genomic stability (Malińska2020Constitutional).

In addition to its role in the shelterin complex, TERF2IP is involved in endothelial cell senescence and activation under disturbed blood flow conditions. It is phosphorylated by p90RSK at the S205 site, which is crucial for NF-κB activation, a key component of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (Kotla2019Endothelial). The interaction between TERF2IP and p90RSK affects the expression of genes involved in cellular senescence and apoptosis, such as p53, p21, and TERT (Kotla2019Endothelial).

TERF2IP also interacts with the zinc finger protein OZF, which is overexpressed in certain cancers. This interaction involves the C-terminal zinc fingers of OZF and a region of TERF2IP downstream of the coil domain, suggesting a role in telomere dynamics (Antoine2005Zinc).
