# GNL1

## Overview
GNL1 is a gene that encodes the G protein nucleolar 1 (putative), a nucleolar GTPase that belongs to the YawG/YIqF subfamily. This protein is evolutionarily conserved and plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. It functions as a molecular switch due to its GTP-binding motifs, shuttling between the nucleolus, nucleus, and cytoplasm. GNL1 is involved in the hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which is essential for the progression of the cell division cycle, particularly the G1/S phase transition (Krishnan2018Interplay). The protein also interacts with ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20), suggesting a role in ribosomal biogenesis and cell proliferation (Krishnan2018Interplay). Additionally, GNL1 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancers and neurological disorders, due to its regulatory functions and interactions with RNA G-quadruplex structures (Turcotte2020Guanine).

## Function
The GNL1 gene encodes a nucleolar GTPase that is part of the YawG/YIqF subfamily, which is evolutionarily conserved across species. In healthy human cells, GNL1 plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation, particularly through its interaction with ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20) (Krishnan2018Interplay). This interaction is crucial for the hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which modulates the G1/S phase of the cell division cycle (Krishnan2018Interplay). GNL1 shuttles between the nucleolus, nucleus, and cytoplasm, acting as a molecular switch due to its GTP-binding motifs (Krishnan2018Interplay).

GNL1 expression leads to a reduction in cell accumulation in the G1/S and G2/M phases, with an increase in the S phase, indicating its role in promoting cell cycle progression (Krishnan2018Interplay). It enhances the phosphorylation of Rb at serine 780, releasing E2F1 from the Rb-E2F1 complex, thereby activating the expression of target genes like cyclin A2, cyclin E1, and cyclin B1 (Krishnan2018Interplay). GNL1 also interacts with RPS20, suggesting a potential role in ribosomal biogenesis (Krishnan2018Interplay). These functions collectively indicate that GNL1 is crucial for cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation in human cells (Krishnan2018Interplay).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interaction of the GNL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurological disorders. In cancer, GNL1 is often upregulated, which is associated with increased cell proliferation and poor prognosis. This upregulation is observed in colorectal and gastric cancers, where high levels of GNL1 and its interaction with Ribosomal protein S20 (RPS20) correlate with decreased patient survival. The interaction between GNL1 and RPS20 is crucial for promoting cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, as it upregulates cyclin D1 and CDK4, leading to faster G1/S phase transition (Krishnan2018Interplay).

In neurological diseases, GNL1 has been identified as a protein that binds to RNA G-quadruplex structures in genes associated with Parkinson's disease, such as VPS35 and PRKN. This interaction suggests a role for GNL1 in the post-transcriptional regulation of these genes, potentially influencing the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (Turcotte2020Guanine).

Additionally, in the context of Hirschsprung disease, GNL1 does not independently cause enteric nervous system defects but may interact with other genetic factors, such as the ret gene, to influence disease penetrance (Kuil2021Size).

## Interactions
GNL1, a human nucleolar protein, interacts with the ribosomal protein RPS20, forming complexes in mammalian cells. This interaction is specific and has been demonstrated through immunoprecipitation experiments, with GNL1 modulating RPS20 levels at both transcriptional and translational levels. Conversely, RPS20 affects the stability of the GNL1 protein. The reciprocal regulatory relationship between GNL1 and RPS20 is crucial for modulating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, particularly influencing the G1/S phase transition by altering the phosphorylation status of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and affecting the expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Krishnan2018Interplay).

GNL1 also binds to RNA G-quadruplex (G4) structures in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the VPS35 and PRKN genes, which are associated with Parkinson's disease. This interaction was confirmed through electrophoretic mobility shift assays, showing a higher affinity for wild-type G4 structures compared to mutant versions. These findings suggest that GNL1 may play a role in regulating the folding and unfolding of RNA G4 structures, potentially influencing the expression of genes linked to Parkinson's disease (Turcotte2020Guanine).
