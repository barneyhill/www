# CFAP73

## Overview
CFAP73, or cilia and flagella associated protein 73, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cellular motility and fluid movement. The CFAP73 protein is a component of the ciliary connectome, a network of proteins that contribute to the assembly and stability of cilia. It plays a pivotal role in the later stages of cilia assembly by interacting with the CCDC39/40 complex, thereby anchoring ciliary axonemal regulatory proteins (CARPs) on the ciliary axoneme (Brody2024Loss). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and proper functioning of cilia, particularly in multi-ciliated epithelial cells such as those in the human fallopian tubes (Ulrich2021Cellular). The protein's involvement in regulating the normal waveform of cilia through its association with the two-headed inner dynein arm (IDA) underscores its importance in ciliary motility (Brody2024Loss).

## Function
CFAP73 (cilia and flagella associated protein 73) plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cell motility and fluid movement. In healthy human cells, CFAP73 is involved in regulating the normal waveform of cilia through its association with the two-headed inner dynein arm (IDA), a component critical for ciliary motility (Brody2024Loss). The protein is part of the ciliary connectome, a network of proteins that contribute to the assembly and stability of cilia. CFAP73 is particularly important during the later stages of cilia assembly, where it associates with the CCDC39/40 complex, helping to anchor ciliary axonemal regulatory proteins (CARPs) on the ciliary axoneme (Brody2024Loss).

CFAP73 is also expressed in mature, multi-ciliated epithelial cells, such as those found in the human fallopian tubes, where it contributes to the function of motile cilia and flagella (Ulrich2021Cellular). The presence of CFAP73 in these cells indicates its role in maintaining the structural integrity and proper functioning of cilia, which is essential for processes like fluid movement and sensory perception in various tissues.

## Interactions
CFAP73 is involved in the assembly and function of cilia, interacting with various proteins during this process. It is part of a complex assembly process in cilia formation, interacting with the CCDC39/40 heterodimer. During normal cilia assembly, CCDC39/40 helps anchor ciliary axonemal regulatory proteins (CARPs) on the ciliary axoneme. CFAP73 interacts with CCDC40 during cilia assembly, as evidenced by immunoprecipitation experiments where CCDC40 pulls down connectome proteins CFAP100 and CFAP73 more significantly at later stages of cilia growth (Brody2024Loss). 

In CCDC39/40 variants, connectome proteins, including CFAP73, remain within the apical domain and are eventually degraded if not properly assembled, indicating the importance of CFAP73 in the proper docking and assembly of ciliary proteins (Brody2024Loss). CFAP73 is also noted to regulate the normal waveform via the two-headed inner dynein arm (IDA) and is missing in the CCDC39 variant, which affects the structural integrity of cilia (Brody2024Loss). However, specific details on the physical interactions of CFAP73 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature.
