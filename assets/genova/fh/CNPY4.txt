# CNPY4

## Overview
CNPY4 is a gene that encodes the protein canopy FGF signaling regulator 4, which is a member of the Saposin-like protein (SAPLIP) family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator by modulating the lipid composition of cellular membranes, particularly affecting sterol levels such as cholesterol. Unlike other SAPLIP proteins, CNPY4 does not directly bind to cholesterol or oxysterols but influences their accessibility, thereby impacting the activation of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor, a critical component of the HH pathway. CNPY4 is also active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a role in the proper folding and function of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors, influencing cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and survival. Additionally, CNPY4 is involved in the regulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), affecting immune response mechanisms (Schildknegt2019Characterization; Lo2021CNPY4).

## Structure
CNPY4 is a protein characterized by its role as a Saposin-like protein (SAPLIP), which suggests it contains a saposin-like domain. This domain is typically involved in lipid interactions, although CNPY4 does not directly bind to cholesterol or oxysterols. Instead, it modulates the lipid composition of membranes, particularly affecting sterol levels such as cholesterol, which are crucial for Hedgehog (HH) signaling (Lo2021CNPY4).

The secondary structure of CNPY4 is predominantly alpha-helical, consistent with the structural characteristics of SAPLIP proteins. A recombinant construct of CNPY4, referred to as CNPY4ΔCt, has been shown to be well-folded and predominantly alpha-helical, indicating a stable secondary structure (Lo2021CNPY4).

Regarding its quaternary structure, CNPY4 is likely a monomer, which is notable as many SAPLIP proteins that interact with lipids tend to form dimers. This monomeric form may influence its functional interactions within the cell (Lo2021CNPY4).

The study does not provide specific details on the primary amino acid sequence, tertiary structure, or post-translational modifications of CNPY4. There is also no mention of splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
CNPY4, or canopy FGF signaling regulator 4, is a protein that functions as a negative regulator of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for development and tissue homeostasis. It modulates the levels of sterol lipids in the plasma membrane, influencing the activation of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor, a key component of the HH pathway. CNPY4 does not directly bind to cholesterol or oxysterols but regulates their accessibility in the membrane, thereby affecting SMO-dependent HH activation (Lo2021CNPY4). Knockdown of CNPY4 results in increased levels of accessible sterols, enhancing HH signaling even in the absence of SMO, suggesting that CNPY4 controls the lipid environment of the membrane and potentially affects the synthesis, maturation, and trafficking of sterols (Lo2021CNPY4).

CNPY4 is active in the endoplasmic reticulum and influences the proper folding and function of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors, impacting cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival. It plays a role in fine-tuning the initial steps of HH signal transduction by controlling membrane composition, which is essential for the proper trafficking and signal transduction of proteins involved in the HH pathway (Lo2021CNPY4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CNPY4 gene have been implicated in several developmental and pathological conditions. CNPY4 is a negative regulator of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, and its absence can lead to hyperactivation of this pathway. This hyperactivation is associated with developmental abnormalities such as preaxial polydactyly and neural tube closure defects, as observed in Cnpy4 mutant mice (Lo2021CNPY4). These phenotypes are similar to those seen in conditions with mutations in other HH pathway components, such as the Gli3 gene (Lo2021CNPY4).

CNPY4 also plays a role in immune response regulation, with its expression being downregulated in Rett syndrome (RTT) and upregulated in mitochondrial disease syndrome (MDS) (PascualAlonso2023Identification). In the context of cancer, CNPY4 has been identified as having non-silent somatic mutations in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, although its specific role in thyroid cancer remains unclear (Stenman2021PanGenomic). Additionally, CNPY4 is involved in the regulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), where it downregulates TLRs at the cell membrane, potentially impacting immune response-related conditions (Neben2019Feedback).

## Interactions
CNPY4 is involved in several protein interactions, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is part of a multiprotein complex associated with the Hsp70-type chaperone BiP, and includes other ER chaperones like Grp94 and ER protein 72, suggesting a role in ER protein folding (Schildknegt2019Characterization). CNPY4 interacts with newly synthesized Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and its knockdown decreases the surface expression of TLR4, indicating its role in the regulation of TLRs (Schildknegt2019Characterization). CNPY4 and CNPY3 act antagonistically on the cell surface expression of TLR1, with CNPY3 promoting trafficking and CNPY4 blocking it (Schildknegt2019Characterization).

CNPY4 is also implicated in the modulation of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway by influencing membrane sterol lipids, although it does not directly bind to cholesterol or oxysterols. This modulation affects the activation of the Smoothened (SMO) protein, a key component of the HH pathway (Lo2022CNPY4). While CNPY4's interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, its role in protein folding and signaling pathways highlights its importance in cellular processes (Schildknegt2019Characterization).
