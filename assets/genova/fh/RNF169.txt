# RNF169

## Overview
RNF169 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 169, a crucial component of the DNA damage response system. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and ubiquitin reader, playing a significant role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by recognizing and binding to ubiquitylated histones at damage sites (KitevskiLeBlanc2017The). By competing with the protein 53BP1, RNF169 influences the choice between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways, thereby promoting HR-mediated repair and maintaining genomic stability (R.2019DYRK1A; Deng2019An). The activity of RNF169 is modulated through phosphorylation by the kinase DYRK1A, which enhances its function in displacing 53BP1 from DSBs (Roewenstrunk2019A). RNF169's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, such as the long non-coding RNA PRLH1, further underscore its role in facilitating DNA repair processes and its potential implications in cancer biology (Deng2019An).

## Structure


## Function
RNF169 is a protein involved in the DNA damage response, specifically in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). It functions as a ubiquitin reader, recognizing and binding to ubiquitylated histones at DSB sites, which is crucial for the recruitment of downstream repair factors (KitevskiLeBlanc2017The). RNF169 competes with 53BP1 for binding to these sites, thereby influencing the choice between non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways (Deng2019An). By limiting 53BP1 accumulation, RNF169 promotes HR-mediated DNA repair, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability (R.2019DYRK1A).

RNF169's activity is regulated through its interaction with DYRK1A, a kinase that phosphorylates RNF169 at specific sites, enhancing its ability to displace 53BP1 from DSBs (R.2019DYRK1A; Roewenstrunk2019A). This phosphorylation is crucial for RNF169's function in the DNA damage response. RNF169 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with other proteins to facilitate DNA repair processes (Roewenstrunk2019A). Its role in DNA repair is vital for preventing genomic instability, which can lead to diseases such as cancer (KitevskiLeBlanc2017The).

## Clinical Significance
High expression of the RNF169 gene is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Studies have shown that elevated RNF169 levels correlate with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in PAAD patients, making it a potential prognostic biomarker for this cancer type (Wang2023High). RNF169 is also linked to immune infiltration in PAAD, influencing the infiltration of immune cells such as T and B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. This suggests a role in tumor immune escape mechanisms, which could impact disease progression and prognosis (Wang2023High).

In addition to PAAD, RNF169 expression is upregulated in several other cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, brain lower grade glioma, and stomach adenocarcinoma, while it is downregulated in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma (Wang2023High). The gene's involvement in DNA damage response and repair pathways, particularly its interaction with proteins like DYRK1A and lncRNA PRLH1, further underscores its significance in cancer biology. These interactions can influence homologous recombination repair and genomic stability, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis when dysregulated (Deng2019An; Roewenstrunk2019A).

## Interactions
RNF169 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the DNA damage response, interacting with several proteins and nucleic acids to facilitate DNA repair processes. It interacts with the kinase DYRK1A, forming a complex that plays a role in the DNA damage response. DYRK1A phosphorylates RNF169 at specific serine residues, S368 and S403, which are crucial for their interaction and for modulating RNF169's activity during DNA repair (R.2019DYRK1A; Roewenstrunk2019A). This interaction is significant for the recruitment of DYRK1A to DNA damage sites and affects the displacement of 53BP1, a key protein in DNA repair (R.2019DYRK1A; Roewenstrunk2019A).

RNF169 also interacts with the long non-coding RNA PRLH1, which is derived from LTR retrotransposons. This interaction is mediated through two GCUUCA motifs in PRLH1, which bind to the C terminus of RNF169. The PRLH1-RNF169 complex is crucial for promoting homologous recombination by displacing 53BP1 from double-strand break sites, thereby facilitating the recruitment of the MRN-CtIP-BRCA1 complex to these sites (Deng2019An). This interaction highlights RNF169's role in stabilizing PRLH1 and enhancing DNA repair processes (Deng2019An).
