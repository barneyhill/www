# PEX14

## Overview
PEX14 is a gene that encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 14, a crucial component of the peroxisomal membrane involved in the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes. This protein is integral to the peroxisomal protein translocation machinery, facilitating the docking and translocation of proteins by interacting with import receptors such as PEX5 and PEX7 (Bharti2011PEX14; Emmanouilidis2023A). As a peroxisomal membrane protein, PEX14 is characterized by its structural domains, including a defined N-terminal domain that interacts with import receptors and a flexible C-terminal region essential for protein import and receptor recycling (Neufeld2009Structural; Emmanouilidis2023A). PEX14 also plays a role in peroxisome motility by binding to tubulin, which is crucial for the spatial organization of peroxisomes within cells (Bharti2011PEX14). Mutations in the PEX14 gene are linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining peroxisomal function and cellular homeostasis (Shimozawa2004Identification).

## Structure
The PEX14 protein is a key component of the peroxisomal import machinery, characterized by distinct structural features. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) forms a three-helical bundle, which is crucial for its interactions with the import receptors PEX5 and PEX19. This domain contains two hydrophobic cavities that recognize aromatic side chains from motifs in PEX5 and PEX19, facilitating competitive binding interactions (Neufeld2009Structural; Gopalswamy2022Distinct). The PEX14 NTD also interacts with the SH3 domain of PEX13, indicating its role in peroxisomal membrane docking (Neufeld2009Structural).

The C-terminal region (CTR) of PEX14 is intrinsically disordered and highly flexible, containing a novel IPSWQI peptide motif that binds to the cargo-binding TPR domain of PEX5. This interaction is critical for peroxisomal protein import and receptor recycling (Emmanouilidis2023A). The PEX14 CTR is mostly unstructured, as indicated by NMR data, and interacts with the PEX5 TPR domain, distinct from the PTS1 binding site (Emmanouilidis2023A).

Overall, PEX14's structure, with its defined NTD and flexible CTR, plays a significant role in its function as a docking factor in peroxisomal biogenesis.

## Function
The PEX14 gene encodes a protein that is a central component of the peroxisomal protein translocation machinery in human cells. It plays a crucial role in the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes, essential organelles involved in various metabolic functions, including lipid metabolism and detoxification (Bharti2011PEX14; Emmanouilidis2023A). PEX14 is part of the docking complex at the peroxisomal membrane, where it interacts with import receptors such as PEX5 and PEX7 to facilitate the translocation of proteins into the peroxisome (Neufeld2009Structural; Emmanouilidis2023A).

PEX14 also plays a significant role in peroxisome motility within cells. It binds directly to tubulin, acting as a membrane anchor for microtubules, which are responsible for the movement of peroxisomes (Bharti2011PEX14). This interaction is crucial for the spatial organization of peroxisomes, as disruption of microtubules leads to peroxisome clustering and non-mobility (Bharti2011PEX14). The N-terminal region of PEX14 is responsible for tubulin binding, while the C-terminal region is necessary for peroxisomal protein import (Bharti2011PEX14). These functions highlight PEX14's importance in maintaining peroxisomal function and dynamics in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX14 gene are associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger syndrome, a severe condition characterized by impaired peroxisome function. These disorders are typically lethal and present with symptoms such as craniofacial dysmorphia, elevated very long chain fatty acids, and neurological abnormalities. A specific nonsense mutation in PEX14, identified as p.Q185X, results in a premature stop codon, leading to a lack of functional PEX14 protein. This mutation disrupts the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, which is crucial for peroxisome biogenesis, and can be rescued by introducing wild-type PEX14 (Shimozawa2004Identification).

PEX14 is a peroxisomal membrane protein that interacts with import receptors PEX5 and PEX7, playing a vital role in the peroxisomal import machinery. Mutations affecting PEX14's interactions with these receptors can lead to mislocalization and impaired peroxisomal function. Structural studies have shown that specific residues in PEX14 are critical for binding to PEX5 and PEX19, and mutations at these sites can decrease binding affinity, potentially leading to mitochondrial mislocalization of PEX14 (Neufeld2009Structural). These findings underscore the importance of PEX14 in maintaining peroxisome function and its role in the pathogenesis of PBDs.

## Interactions
PEX14 is a peroxisomal membrane protein that plays a crucial role in peroxisomal protein import by interacting with several other proteins. It primarily interacts with the peroxisome import receptor PEX5. This interaction involves multiple binding sites on PEX5, characterized by WXXX(F/Y) pentapeptide repeats, which are essential for high-affinity binding to PEX14 (Saidowsky2001The). These motifs form part of an amphipathic α-helix, with aromatic residues binding to hydrophobic regions on PEX14 (Saidowsky2001The).

PEX14 also interacts with PEX19, another peroxisomal import receptor. The binding orientation of PEX19 to PEX14 is almost opposite to that of PEX5, with specific aromatic residues playing a crucial role in the interaction (Neufeld2009Structural). The interactions with both PEX5 and PEX19 are characterized by charge complementarity and hydrophobic interactions, with PEX14's binding site formed by helices a1 and a2 (Neufeld2009Structural).

Additionally, PEX14 forms part of a docking complex with PEX13, which is essential for the translocation of proteins across the peroxisomal membrane (Emmanouilidis2023A). These interactions are vital for peroxisomal function and maintenance, facilitating the import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes.
