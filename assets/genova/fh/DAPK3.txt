# DAPK3

## Overview
DAPK3, or death-associated protein kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase known as ZIPK. This kinase is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The DAPK3 protein is characterized by its kinase domain, leucine zipper domain, and nuclear localization sequences, which facilitate its diverse functional roles within the cell (Farag2018Death‐associated; Elbadawy2018Novel). As a kinase, DAPK3 is integral to muscle function, cell motility, and vascular remodeling, and it interacts with several signaling pathways, including those involving STAT3 and mTOR (Mudry2016Insulin; Usui2014Deathassociated). Clinically, DAPK3 has been implicated in cancer, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context and specific mutations present (Brognard2011CancerAssociated; Li2020DAPK3).

## Structure
DAPK3, also known as ZIPK, is a serine/threonine kinase with a molecular structure that includes several key domains. The primary structure of DAPK3 consists of 454 amino acids, featuring an N-terminal kinase domain, a leucine zipper domain, and multiple nuclear localization sequences (NLS) (Farag2018Death‐associated; Elbadawy2018Novel). The kinase domain is highly conserved and shares 83% sequence homology with DAPK1, comprising 11 subdomains with a small N-terminal lobe and a larger C-terminal lobe (Farag2018Death‐associated).

The secondary structure of DAPK3 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of its kinase domain (Farag2018Death‐associated). The leucine zipper domain, located between residues 427-441, is crucial for dimerization and interaction with activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (Farag2018Death‐associated).

In terms of quaternary structure, DAPK3 can form heterodimers with DAPK1, which is important for its activation (Farag2018Death‐associated). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at multiple threonine residues, are critical for DAPK3's catalytic activity and function (Bialik2006The). Splice variants of DAPK3 have not been detailed in the provided context.

## Function
DAPK3, or death-associated protein kinase 3, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, and cytoskeletal dynamics. In healthy human cells, DAPK3 plays a significant role in regulating muscle function by phosphorylating myosin light chains, which is essential for muscle contraction and cell mobility (Mudry2016Insulin). It is also involved in the regulation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration, processes crucial for vascular structural remodeling (Usui2014Deathassociated).

DAPK3 is negatively regulated by Akt signaling and has an independent effect from ERK or Akt activation to negatively regulate mTOR-S6K-S6 signaling, implicating it in nutrient signaling pathways (Mudry2016Insulin). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell motility and proliferation (Farag2018Death‐associated). DAPK3 also interacts with various intracellular signaling molecules, such as STAT3, and is involved in ROS-dependent vascular inflammation, suggesting its role in hypertension development (Usui2014Deathassociated).

In the context of apoptosis, DAPK3 is implicated in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and regulates apoptosis and the cell cycle by phosphorylating specific proteins like STAT3 and HsCdc14A (Farag2018Death‐associated). It also plays a role in starvation-induced autophagy through the phosphorylation of beclin-1 (Farag2018Death‐associated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DAPK3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), DAPK3 has been shown to play a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter. Knockdown of DAPK3 in A549 NSCLC cells results in decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression through the ERK/c-Myc signaling pathway (Kake2017Deathassociated). In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in DAPK3, such as T112M, D161N, and P216S, have been associated with impaired tumor-suppressing functions, leading to increased cell proliferation and survival in cancers like colon, ovarian, and NSCLC (Brognard2011CancerAssociated).

In gastric cancer, DAPK3 acts as a tumor suppressor by promoting autophagy. Its downregulation is linked to tumor invasion, metastasis, and poor prognosis (Li2020DAPK3). In colon adenocarcinoma, DAPK3 expression is downregulated, and its high expression correlates with poor overall survival, suggesting a complex role in cancer progression (Chen2021Networka; Chen2021Network). These findings highlight the diverse roles of DAPK3 in cancer, influenced by its expression levels and mutations.

## Interactions
Death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3), also known as ZIPK, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate its function and cellular processes. DAPK3 interacts with Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), forming a kinase hierarchy where DAPK phosphorylates ZIPK at multiple sites, including threonine 299 and five serine residues. This phosphorylation enhances ZIPK's proapoptotic activity and is crucial for its role in cell death signaling (Shani2004DeathAssociated).

DAPK3 also interacts with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). This interaction involves the DNA-binding and C-terminal domains of STAT3 and the kinase domain of ZIPK, although ZIPK's kinase activity is not required for the interaction. ZIPK can phosphorylate STAT3 on serine 727, which is important for STAT3 activation (Sato2005Physical).

In the context of inflammatory gene expression, DAPK3 phosphorylates the ribosomal protein L13a as part of a kinase cascade involving DAPK. This interaction is essential for the activation of the GAIT complex and the regulation of inflammatory responses (Mukhopadhyay2008DAPKZIPKL13a).

DAPK3's interactions extend to its role in smooth muscle cell functions, where it phosphorylates myosin light chain 2 (MLC2), influencing cell migration and vascular remodeling (Usui2014Deathassociated).
