# TRIM36

## Overview
TRIM36 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 36, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. This family is characterized by a conserved domain structure that includes a RING finger, B-box, and coiled-coil domains, and TRIM36 functions primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The protein plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics, which is essential for processes such as cell division, embryonic development, and spermatogenesis. TRIM36 is particularly important in neural tube closure during embryogenesis, and mutations in the gene have been linked to severe developmental disorders like anencephaly (Mascaro2022Microtubular; Singh2017A). Additionally, TRIM36 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it interacts with signaling pathways to influence tumorigenesis and treatment responses, making it a potential biomarker for certain cancers (Liang2018TRIM36; Tong2022TRIM36).

## Structure
TRIM36 is a protein encoded by the TRIM36 gene, belonging to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, which is characterized by a specific domain architecture. The protein structure includes an N-terminal RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, collectively forming the tripartite motif (RBCC) (Mascaro2022Microtubular; Singh2017A). TRIM36 is part of the TRIM subgroup I, which also features a COS domain, a fibronectin type III repeat (FN3), and a PRY-SPRY domain, essential for its microtubule association and function in embryonic development and spermatogenesis (Mascaro2022Microtubular; Short2006Subclassification).

The COS box, a significant motif adjacent to the coiled-coil domain, is crucial for microtubule binding, and mutations in this motif can disrupt this function (Short2006Subclassification). The B30.2/SPRY domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and microtubule association, with mutations in this domain affecting protein stability and function (Singh2017A).

TRIM36 is 728 amino acids long in humans, and alternative splicing results in three transcript isoforms, two of which produce full-length proteins with slight differences at the N-terminus (Mascaro2022Microtubular). The protein's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is linked to its role in microtubule dynamics, impacting cell cycle progression and early developmental processes (Mascaro2022Microtubular).

## Function
TRIM36 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, characterized by a RING finger, B-box, and coiled-coil domains, functioning primarily as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In healthy human cells, TRIM36 is involved in the regulation of microtubule stability and function, which is crucial for maintaining proper cell division and viability. It interacts with microtubules through its B30.2/SPRY domain, and mutations in this domain can lead to disrupted microtubule structures, disorganized spindles, and abnormal cytokinesis, ultimately affecting cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis (Singh2017A).

TRIM36 is expressed in the cytoplasm and colocalizes with alpha-tubulin, a microtubule protein, indicating its role in maintaining microtubule organization (Singh2017A). It is also implicated in embryonic development, particularly in neural tube closure, as evidenced by its association with severe neural tube defects like anencephaly when mutated (Mascaro2022Microtubular). The protein's activity is essential for normal brain development, as it ensures the stability and proper function of microtubules, which are critical for neuronal cell proliferation and differentiation (Singh2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIM36 gene are associated with severe developmental disorders, most notably anencephaly, a neural tube defect characterized by the absence of major portions of the brain and skull. A specific homozygous missense mutation, c.1522C > A (p.Pro508Thr), has been identified as a causative factor for autosomal recessive anencephaly in an Indian family. This mutation affects the B30.2/SPRY domain of the TRIM36 protein, leading to reduced protein stability and disrupted microtubule organization, which are critical for normal neurogenesis and neural tube closure (Singh2017A). 

In addition to its role in developmental disorders, TRIM36 expression levels have clinical significance in cancer. In prostate cancer, TRIM36 is an androgen-responsive gene that enhances the efficacy of anti-androgen treatments by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK signaling pathways. Lower expression of TRIM36 is associated with more aggressive prostate cancer and poorer clinical outcomes (Liang2018TRIM36). In gastric cancer, high TRIM36 expression is linked to increased radiosensitivity and improved overall survival rates in patients receiving radiotherapy, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Man2019High).

## Interactions
TRIM36 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in cellular processes through these interactions. It is associated with microtubules and is involved in their organization, which is crucial for cellular structure and function, including chromosome segregation and cytokinesis (Mascaro2022Microtubular). TRIM36's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is essential for proper microtubule assembly, as demonstrated in experiments with Xenopus eggs, where its depletion leads to disorganized microtubule arrays (Mascaro2022Microtubular).

In the context of cancer, TRIM36 interacts with components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, influencing apoptosis-related proteins and inhibiting tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (Tong2022TRIM36). It affects β-catenin expression and the activity of GSK3β, with knockdown of TRIM36 resulting in increased β-catenin and c-JUN levels (Tong2022TRIM36).

TRIM36 also interacts with the kinetochore protein CENP-H, which is important for chromosome segregation, although the exact functional role of this interaction is not fully understood (Mascaro2022Microtubular). In prostate cancer, TRIM36 is involved in regulating apoptosis-related pathways and interacts with proteins such as AR, BAX, and TNFSF10 (Kimura2018Androgen‐responsive).
