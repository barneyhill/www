# NRDC

## Overview
The NRDC gene encodes the protein nardilysin convertase, a metalloendopeptidase that belongs to the M16 family of metalloendopeptidases. This enzyme is characterized by its ability to cleave peptide bonds adjacent to arginine or lysine residues, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. Nardilysin convertase is involved in the regulation of histone modifications, transcriptional regulation, and ectodomain shedding of growth factors, impacting cell cycle progression, signaling, and communication. It is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, where it contributes to neurodevelopment and peptide metabolism. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE), highlight its significance in membrane protein processing and potential therapeutic applications in diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's disease (Bernstein2007Histochemical; Morita2017Genomewide; Nishi2006Nardilysin).

## Structure
The NRDC (nardilysin convertase) protein is a metalloendopeptidase characterized by its ability to cleave substrates upstream of arginine or lysine in basic pairs. It belongs to the M16 family of metalloendopeptidases and features a unique 90 amino acid acidic domain (DAC) near its active site, which is not essential for catalytic activity but plays a role in regulating the enzyme's functions (HOSPITAL2002The). The primary structure of NRDC includes a zinc-binding motif, HXXEH, which is a conserved feature among zinc-metalloendopeptidases (Pierotti1994Narginine). 

The secondary structure of NRDC likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of metalloendopeptidases, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure forms a three-dimensional shape crucial for its enzymatic activity, with the DAC acting as a cis-activator to enhance catalytic efficiency or stability (HOSPITAL2002The). 

NRDC exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with NRD1 and NRD2 being notable variants. These isoforms differ by a 68-amino acid insertion in NRD2, which may confer specific functions, although no significant differences in enzymic properties were observed between them (HOSPITAL2000Narginine). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
The NRDC gene encodes nardilysin, a metalloendopeptidase involved in various molecular processes within healthy human cells. NRDC plays a significant role in epigenetic regulation and cell cycle progression by modulating histone acetylation and methylation, particularly influencing H3K9 acetylation and H3K4 methylation. It functions as a transcriptional coregulator, interacting with transcriptional modulator complexes and transcription factors, and is crucial for the expression of several cell cycle-related genes, such as Cdk1, Fbxo5, and Ccnf (Morita2017Genomewide).

NRDC is also involved in the ectodomain shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) through its interaction with tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE), enhancing TACE activity and influencing the shedding of multiple proteins, including other EGFR ligands (Nishi2006Nardilysin). This process is crucial for cellular signaling and communication, impacting various biological activities such as cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation (Nishi2006Nardilysin).

In the brain, NRDC is widely expressed in neurons and is implicated in neurodevelopment and peptide metabolism, suggesting roles in brain development and neuronal functioning (Bernstein2007Histochemical).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NRDC gene have been implicated in several diseases. In gastric cancer, upregulated NRDC expression is associated with tumor growth, as it enhances the activity of ADAM proteases, particularly ADAM17, which is crucial for cell proliferation (Kanda2012Nardilysin). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), NRDC expression is typically decreased, and its absence is linked to accelerated tumorigenesis, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role. The loss of NRDC in pancreatic tissues leads to increased inflammation and chronic pancreatitis, which are risk factors for PDAC (Ikuta2018Nardilysin; Xu2022Serum).

In Alzheimer's disease, NRDC plays a protective role by enhancing α-secretase activity, which reduces amyloid-β deposition, a hallmark of the disease. Overexpression of NRDC in mouse models has been shown to decrease amyloid plaque formation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ohno2014Nardilysin).

NRDC is also involved in the ectodomain shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) through its interaction with TACE, implicating it in diseases where EGFR signaling is disrupted, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Nishi2006Nardilysin).

## Interactions
NRDc (nardilysin convertase) is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It is primarily localized in the nucleus of HeLa and NIH3T3 cells, where it binds preferentially to dimethylated histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2). This binding activity is located in the N-terminal region of NRDc and does not require its acidic stretch or peptidase activity (Li2012Identification). NRDc associates with the NCoR/SMRT corepressor complexes, interacting directly with HDAC3 but not with NCoR or TBL1, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation through these complexes (Li2012Identification).

NRDc also enhances the ectodomain shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) by interacting with tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE). This interaction does not require NRDc's enzymatic activity, as even an inactive mutant can enhance TACE's activity. NRDc and TACE form a complex, and their interaction is potentiated by phorbol esters, which increase NRDc expression on plasma membranes where it co-localizes with TACE (Nishi2006Nardilysin). These interactions suggest NRDc's involvement in membrane protein processing and its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases involving EGFR signaling pathways.
