# OR14L1

## Overview
The OR14L1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 14 subfamily L member 1, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in detecting odor molecules. The olfactory receptors, including the protein encoded by OR14L1, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by initiating a neuronal response upon binding specific odorants. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a common feature among many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors (Qiu2020aarFDC).
