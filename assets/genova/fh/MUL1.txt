# MUL1

## Overview
MUL1, or mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to mitochondrial dynamics and quality control. The protein, categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial fusion and fission by modifying key proteins such as mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) (Peng2016Mitochondrial). Beyond its role in mitochondrial dynamics, MUL1 is implicated in mitophagy, the selective degradation of mitochondria, and acts as a SUMO E3 ligase, influencing protein stability and function (Peng2016Mitochondrial). Additionally, MUL1 is involved in cellular signaling pathways, including the activation of NF-κB and the regulation of metabolic processes through the modulation of transcription factors like HIF-1α (Cilenti2022Regulation). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, where mutations in MUL1 can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress (Taximaimaiti2019MUL1; Puri2019Mul1).

## Structure
MUL1, also known as mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is a multifunctional protein embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane. It features two transmembrane domains and a C-terminal RING finger domain exposed to the cytoplasm, which is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Peng2016Mitochondrial; Lee2019Solution). The RING domain adopts a bbab fold, consisting of three anti-parallel beta-strands and one alpha-helix, and contains a canonical cross-brace motif for zinc ion ligation (Lee2019Solution). This domain is involved in the polyubiquitylation of mitochondrial p53, leading to its proteasomal degradation (Lee2019Solution).

MUL1 can perform both ubiquitination and SUMOylation, modifying proteins such as Mfn2 and Drp1, which are involved in mitochondrial dynamics (Peng2016Mitochondrial). The protein's structure includes transmembrane sequences with moderate hydrophobicity and a net positive charge, influencing its mitochondrial targeting (Peng2016Mitochondrial). The intact RING finger domain is essential for its enzymatic activity, and proper subcellular localization is necessary for its function (Peng2016Mitochondrial). Splice variants of MUL1 can result in different isoforms, potentially with distinct functions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
MUL1, also known as mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is a multifunctional protein embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane. It plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, including processes of fusion and fission, by modifying proteins such as mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). MUL1 promotes the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Mfn2, which is critical for mitochondrial fusion, and enhances the activity of Drp1 through SUMOylation, promoting mitochondrial fission (Peng2016Mitochondrial).

MUL1 is also involved in mitophagy, a process for the selective clearance of mitochondria, by poly-ubiquitinating Mfn2, which is necessary for mitophagy in muscle atrophy (Peng2016Mitochondrial). It acts as a SUMO E3 ligase, stabilizing proteins like Drp1 through sumoylation, which is crucial for regulating protein stabilization, activity, localization, and interaction (Peng2016Mitochondrial).

MUL1 has been identified as an activator of NF-κB, a transcription factor involved in regulating genes encoding antiapoptotic proteins and proinflammatory cytokines. This activation is dependent on TRAF2 and occurs in response to stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion (Peng2016Mitochondrial). Additionally, MUL1 regulates metabolic processes by modulating the levels of transcription factors such as HIF-1α and serine/threonine kinase Akt2 through K48-specific polyubiquitination, affecting glycolysis and lipid metabolism (Cilenti2022Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MUL1 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have shown that specific polymorphisms in the MUL1 gene, such as the T allele of the rs529974 SNP, are significantly associated with an increased risk of PD. This allele is located in the 3'-untranslated region of the MUL1 gene and is thought to affect its expression, potentially altering mitochondrial function and contributing to PD pathogenesis (Taximaimaiti2019MUL1).

MUL1 is also involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, and its deficiency can lead to enhanced mitophagy and altered mitochondrial dynamics. This is particularly relevant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, where MUL1 mutations can result in mitochondrial dysfunction, increased oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy, contributing to the symptoms observed in PD (Doktór2019Effects; Puri2019Mul1).

In Drosophila models of PD, mutations in MUL1 lead to increased reactive oxygen species levels and decreased antioxidant enzyme levels, affecting circadian rhythms and resulting in behavioral changes consistent with PD symptoms (Doktór2019Effects). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MUL1 in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
MUL1, also known as mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is involved in several protein interactions that regulate various cellular processes. MUL1 interacts with the UBXN7 protein, a cofactor of the CRL2 VHL ligase complex, targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for regulating hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) levels, as UBXN7 acts as a scaffold for the CRL2 VHL complex, which controls HIF-1α degradation (Cilenti2020Mitochondrial).

MUL1 also interacts with mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, modulating antiviral responses. This interaction is specific, as MUL1 does not interact with other components like RIG-I, MDA5, or NLRX1, indicating a targeted role in the RLR-MAVS signaling axis (Jenkins2013Mitochondrially).

In neurons, MUL1 interacts with mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), regulating mitochondrial dynamics and maintaining ER-mitochondrial contacts. This interaction is part of a pathway that restrains Parkin-mediated mitophagy, acting as an early checkpoint to preserve mitochondrial integrity under stress conditions (Puri2019Mul1). These interactions highlight MUL1's role in cellular metabolism, antiviral signaling, and mitochondrial quality control.
