# CETP

## Overview
The CETP gene encodes the cholesteryl ester transfer protein, a crucial component in lipid metabolism. This protein is a hydrophobic glycoprotein that belongs to the lipid-transfer protein family and is primarily involved in the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between lipoproteins. CETP is predominantly expressed in the liver and adipose tissues and circulates in the bloodstream bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL). It facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), thereby playing a significant role in the regulation of plasma HDL cholesterol levels and reverse cholesterol transport (Weber2010Cholesteryl; Yamashita2000Molecular). The protein's structure, characterized by a banana-shaped molecule with a central hydrophobic cavity, is essential for its function in lipid transfer (Zhao2023Dissecting; Zhang2012Structural). Variations in CETP activity and genetic mutations can influence cardiovascular health, highlighting its importance as a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhong1996Increased; Hirano1995Atherosclerotic).

## Structure
The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a hydrophobic glycoprotein composed of 476 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 53 kDa before post-translational modification (Xue2023Structurebased; Zhang2012Structural). The primary structure of CETP includes a high content of non-polar residues, accounting for 45% of its composition (Yamashita2000Molecular).

CETP's secondary structure features N- and C-terminal β-barrel domains and a central β-sheet (Zhao2023Dissecting; Zhang2012Structural). The tertiary structure of CETP is characterized by a banana-shaped molecule with a hydrophobic central cavity approximately 60 Å in length, which can accommodate two cholesteryl ester molecules (Xue2023Structurebased; Zhang2012Structural). This structure is crucial for its function in lipid transfer, forming a tunnel-like shape that facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl esters between lipoproteins (Zhao2023Dissecting).

CETP is glycosylated, a common post-translational modification, and is part of the lipid-transfer protein family (Xue2023Structurebased). The protein's structural flexibility, particularly in the distal portions of the N- and C-terminal β-barrel domains, is essential for its function in lipid transfer (Lei2012Structural; Zhang2012Structural). The presence of splice variant isoforms may affect CETP's function and regulation, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by facilitating the transfer of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between lipoproteins. In healthy human cells, CETP is primarily secreted from the liver and is also expressed in adipose tissues. It is often bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the bloodstream, where it mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (Weber2010Cholesteryl; Yamashita2000Molecular).

CETP's activity is essential for the regulation of plasma HDL cholesterol levels and the remodeling of HDL particles, which are important for reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a process that returns cholesterol to the liver for excretion (Weber2010Cholesteryl; Yamashita2000Molecular). The protein's function involves a 60-Å-long tunnel structure that binds neutral lipids and phospholipids, facilitating their transfer between lipoproteins (Weber2010Cholesteryl).

CETP activity influences the balance between antiatherogenic HDL and proatherogenic LDL and VLDL, impacting cardiovascular health. High CETP activity is associated with increased triglyceride content in HDL particles, which can lead to a reduction in their atheroprotective functions (Weber2010Cholesteryl; Barter2003Cholesteryl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CETP gene can lead to various cardiovascular conditions, primarily due to their impact on lipid metabolism. CETP deficiency, often resulting from genetic mutations, is associated with increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Despite the elevated HDL-C levels, individuals with CETP mutations may experience an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) due to impaired reverse cholesterol transport (Zhong1996Increased). 

In Japanese populations, common CETP mutations include the intron 14 splicing defect and the D442G missense mutation. These mutations are linked to hyperalphalipoproteinemia (HALP) and are prevalent in individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACD) (Hirano1995Atherosclerotic; Ohtani2012Novel). The presence of these mutations can lead to lipoprotein abnormalities, such as small, polydisperse LDL particles with reduced receptor affinity and large HDL particles that fail to prevent cholesterol accumulation in macrophages, potentially accelerating atherosclerosis (Hirano1995Atherosclerotic).

Additionally, reduced CETP activity, particularly when combined with low hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL) activity, has been associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (de2004A). These findings highlight the complex role of CETP in cardiovascular health, where both genetic and environmental factors influence disease risk.

## Interactions
The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) engages in various interactions with lipoproteins and other proteins, influencing lipid metabolism. CETP primarily interacts with high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) through its N-terminal and C-terminal b-barrel domains, respectively. The N-terminal domain binds to HDL via hydrophobic interactions, while the C-terminal domain interacts with LDL, potentially through protein-protein interactions (Zhang2015HDL). CETP forms complexes with lipoproteins, where electrostatic interactions play a crucial role. Positively charged lysine residues on CETP form salt-bridges with negatively charged phosphate groups on lipoproteins, stabilizing the CETP-lipoprotein complex (Koivuniemi2012Lipid).

CETP also interacts with apolipoproteins, such as apoA-I, which can influence its activity. In transgenic mice, CETP expression leads to a significant reduction in HDL cholesterol levels, particularly in the presence of human apoA-I, suggesting a strong interaction between CETP and human-like HDL particles (Hayek1992An). Additionally, CETP's interaction with apoA-I-containing particles is necessary for its lipid transfer function, as demonstrated in studies involving chimeric proteins combining CETP and BPI sequences (Lloyd2006Protein). These interactions highlight CETP's role in lipid transfer and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
