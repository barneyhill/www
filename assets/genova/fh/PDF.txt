## Overview
The PDF gene encodes the human mitochondrial peptide deformylase (HsPDF), a metalloprotease that plays a critical role in the maturation of mitochondrial proteins. This enzyme is involved in the N-terminal methionine excision (NME) pathway, where it removes the formyl group from the N-terminal methionine of nascent mitochondrial proteins, a process essential for the proper function of mitochondrial-encoded proteins (PereiraCastro2012Transcriptional). HsPDF is characterized by a conserved αβ fold and functions as a dimer, with a metal-binding site that is crucial for its catalytic activity (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure). Despite its lower catalytic activity compared to bacterial PDFs, HsPDF is vital for mitochondrial energy production, as it supports the assembly and function of oxidative phosphorylation complexes (EscobarAlvarez2010Inhibition; Lee2004Human). The enzyme's inhibition can lead to significant disruptions in mitochondrial function, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions, particularly in cancer treatment (EscobarAlvarez2010Inhibition; Sheth2014Inhibition).

## Structure
Human mitochondrial peptide deformylase (HsPDF) is characterized by a conserved αβ fold, despite having only 30% sequence identity with non-mammalian PDFs (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure). The enzyme crystallizes as a dimer, with a metal-binding site near the dimer interface, suggesting that dimerization is not due to crystal packing (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure). The dimer interface is formed through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, with a hydrophobic core zippered by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure).

HsPDF's tertiary structure includes a unique β hairpin loop anchored at three points, contributing to the specific shape of the active site entrance (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure). The enzyme's active site is characterized by a narrower S1' pocket compared to bacterial PDFs, and it lacks true S2' and S3' pockets (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure). The metal coordination in HsPDF is close to tetrahedral, with Co2+ as the catalytic metal ion (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure).

The structure of HsPDF bound to the inhibitor actinonin reveals a defined S1' pocket, with the inhibitor binding in a linear conformation stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure). These structural insights are crucial for understanding the enzyme's function and its potential as a cancer target.

## Function
The human mitochondrial peptide deformylase (HsPDF) is a metalloprotease involved in the removal of the formyl group from the N-terminal methionine of nascent mitochondrial proteins. This process is part of the N-terminal methionine excision (NME) pathway, which is crucial for the maturation and proper function of mitochondrial-encoded proteins (PereiraCastro2012Transcriptional). HsPDF is localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a role in the assembly and function of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes, essential for mitochondrial energy production (EscobarAlvarez2010Inhibition; Lee2004Human).

Inhibition of HsPDF disrupts mitochondrial protein synthesis, leading to impaired assembly of respiratory complexes and decreased ATP production. This results in a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis for energy production, highlighting the enzyme's role in maintaining mitochondrial energy homeostasis (EscobarAlvarez2010Inhibition). Although HsPDF is catalytically active, its activity is significantly lower than that of bacterial PDF, suggesting it may be an evolutionary remnant with a specialized function in mitochondria (Nguyen2003Characterization). Despite its reduced activity, HsPDF is necessary for the proper synthesis and accumulation of mitochondrial proteins, underscoring its importance in mitochondrial function (EscobarAlvarez2010Inhibition).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Human mitochondrial peptide deformylase (HsPDF) is involved in the removal of formyl groups from nascent proteins in mitochondria. While specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, HsPDF is known to play a role in mitochondrial protein synthesis and may interact with mitochondrial ribosomes and nascent polypeptides during this process (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the proper maturation and function of mitochondrial proteins, suggesting potential interactions within multiprotein complexes in the mitochondrial matrix (EscobarAlvarez2009Structure).

HsPDF's inhibition by actinonin leads to a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR), characterized by the upregulation of stress response proteins such as CHOP and CEB/P, indicating a possible interaction with pathways involved in protein folding and stress responses (Sheth2014Inhibition). The inhibition also results in mitochondrial membrane depolarization and reduced mitochondrial protein translation, which suggests that HsPDF may interact with components of the mitochondrial translation machinery (Sheth2014Inhibition). These interactions highlight HsPDF's role in maintaining mitochondrial function and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
