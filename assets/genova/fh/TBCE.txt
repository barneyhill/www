# TBCE

## Overview
The TBCE gene encodes the tubulin folding cofactor E, a crucial protein involved in the proper folding and assembly of α-tubulin into α/β-tubulin heterodimers, which are essential components of microtubules. As a tubulin-specific chaperone, TBCE plays a significant role in maintaining microtubule dynamics, which are vital for various cellular processes, including cell shape maintenance, intracellular transport, and cell division (Courtens2006Hypoparathyroidism‐retardation‐dysmorphism). The protein is characterized by a complex domain structure, including a CAP-Gly domain, a leucine-rich region, and an ubiquitin-like domain, which facilitate its interactions with microtubules and the proteasome, indicating its involvement in both microtubule dynamics and protein degradation pathways (Voloshin2010Tubulin). Mutations in the TBCE gene are linked to several neurodegenerative and developmental disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular and developmental processes (Nolasco2021Colchicine).

## Structure
The TBCE protein, also known as tubulin chaperone E, has a complex domain structure that includes a CAP-Gly domain, a leucine-rich region (LRR), and an ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain. The CAP-Gly domain is responsible for binding α-tubulin and microtubules, playing a crucial role in microtubule interactions (Voloshin2010Tubulin). The LRR domain is involved in binding to the Rpn1 subunit of the proteasome, while the UbL domain interacts with the Rpn10 subunit and the Skp1-Cdc53-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex, indicating a role in protein degradation pathways (Voloshin2010Tubulin).

TBCE is involved in the dissociation and recycling of tubulin heterodimers, forming a ternary complex with TBCB and α-tubulin. This complex is crucial for the dissociation process, which can be hindered by colchicine binding (Nolasco2021Colchicine). The protein's structure is essential for maintaining microtubule dynamics and cellular functions, with its domains suggesting potential interactions with the proteasome (Nolasco2021Colchicine).

Mutations in TBCE can lead to various syndromes, highlighting its importance in cellular and developmental processes (Nolasco2021Colchicine). The protein is conserved across species, from yeast to mammals, indicating its fundamental role in cellular biology (Voloshin2010Tubulin).

## Function
The TBCE gene encodes a tubulin-specific chaperone that plays a critical role in the folding of α-tubulin and the formation of α/β-tubulin heterodimers, which are essential components of microtubules. In healthy human cells, TBCE is involved in the proper folding and assembly of tubulin, ensuring the correct formation and stability of microtubules, which are crucial for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division (Courtens2006Hypoparathyroidism‐retardation‐dysmorphism).

TBCE is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the routing of newly synthesized tubulin from the cell body to the distal axon, particularly in motor neurons. This process is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of axons, especially in neurons with long axons and extensive arborizations (Schaefer2007Progressive). TBCE's function is dependent on an intact Golgi apparatus, and it is related to other Golgi proteins that control microtubule formation or dynamics (Schaefer2007Progressive).

TBCE also plays a role in the dissociation and recycling of tubulin heterodimers, which is crucial for maintaining the dynamic instability of microtubules, a process essential for various cellular functions (Nolasco2021Colchicine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TBCE gene are associated with several neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. One of the primary conditions linked to TBCE mutations is hypoparathyroidism-retardation-dysmorphism syndrome (HRDS), also known as Sanjad-Sakati syndrome. This autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by congenital hypoparathyroidism, severe growth failure, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features (Touati2019Additional). Another related condition is Kenny-Caffey syndrome type 1 (KCS1), which shares features with HRDS but also includes osteosclerosis and recurrent bacterial infections (Battini2021Broadening; BaduraStronka2024Expanding).

TBCE mutations can also lead to progressive motor neuronopathy, a condition marked by axonal degeneration due to impaired microtubule polymerization and axonal tubulin routing. This is particularly evident in mouse models with TBCE mutations, where axonal 'dying back' is observed, leading to motor neuron disease symptoms (Schaefer2007Progressive).

Additionally, novel TBCE variants have been identified, expanding the clinical phenotype to include symptoms such as rigid spine, eosinophilia, neutropenia, and nocturnal hypoxemia. These findings suggest a broader spectrum of TBCE-related disorders, with varying degrees of severity and clinical manifestations depending on the specific mutation (BaduraStronka2024Expanding).

## Interactions
TBCE, or tubulin folding cofactor E, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins that are essential for microtubule dynamics and stability. TBCE interacts with α-tubulin, stabilizing it and facilitating its assembly into tubulin heterodimers (Tian2013TubulinSpecific). It forms a complex with TBCB to dissociate tubulin dimers, although this process is inhibited by colchicine, which stabilizes the α/β-tubulin interface (Nolasco2021Colchicine). TBCE also binds to the TBCD-ARL2-β-tubulin trimer, a complex crucial for maintaining the microtubule network, and this interaction does not require α-tubulin (Francis2017A).

TBCE's CAP-Gly domain specifically interacts with α-tubulin, while its LRR domain is involved in binding to the proteasome subunit Rpn1 (Voloshin2010Tubulin). The UbL domain of TBCE binds to Rpn10, which is important for protein turnover (Voloshin2010Tubulin). These interactions highlight TBCE's role in both microtubule dynamics and protein degradation pathways.

In the context of axonal transport, TBCE is associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in routing newly synthesized tubulin to distal axons, a process critical for maintaining axonal integrity (Schaefer2007Progressive). This function is particularly important in preventing axonal degeneration in motor neuron diseases (Schaefer2007Progressive).
