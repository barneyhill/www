# TRPC6

## Overview
The TRPC6 gene encodes the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 6, a non-selective cation channel that plays a pivotal role in calcium ion transport across cell membranes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane channel and is integral to various physiological processes, including vascular function, cell motility, and immune response. TRPC6 is activated by diacylglycerol and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and is involved in signaling pathways mediated by Gαq-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinases (Talbot2019Transmembrane). The gene is located on chromosome 11q21-q22 and is expressed in diverse tissues such as smooth muscle, epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells (Jardin2020TRPC6). Mutations in TRPC6 are linked to several diseases, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension, highlighting its clinical significance (Pousada2015Molecular; Hall2019TRPC).

## Structure
The TRPC6 protein is a non-selective cation channel that forms a tetrameric structure, with each subunit contributing to the overall architecture. The primary structure of TRPC6 consists of 931 amino acids, encoded by the TRPC6 gene located on chromosome 11q21-q22 (Jardin2020TRPC6). The secondary structure includes six transmembrane domains, with a pore region situated between the fifth and sixth domains (Jardin2020TRPC6). The tertiary structure features a two-layer architecture comprising an intracellular cytoplasmic domain (ICD) and a transmembrane domain (TMD). The ICD has an inverted bell shape and includes ankyrin repeats and linker helices, which are crucial for tetramer assembly (Tang2018Structurea; Tang2018Structure).

The quaternary structure of TRPC6 is a homotetramer, with each subunit interacting tightly with adjacent ones, forming the ion channel pore (Jardin2020TRPC6). The TMD features voltage sensor-like domains (VSLDs) and an ion channel pore in a domain-swapped arrangement (Tang2018Structurea). The TRP helix, positioned between cytosolic loops and the TMD, plays a critical role in channel activation and interaction with other proteins (Jardin2020TRPC6; Tang2018Structurea). The structure also includes a unique knot-like structure formed by CH1-CH2 connection linkers, essential for tetramer assembly (Li2019The).

## Function
TRPC6 is a non-selective cation channel that plays a crucial role in calcium ion transport across cell membranes, primarily facilitating calcium influx in response to receptor stimulation. It is activated by diacylglycerol and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) and is involved in various signaling pathways, including those mediated by Gαq-coupled receptors, tyrosine kinases, and reactive oxygen species (Talbot2019Transmembrane). TRPC6 is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including smooth muscle, epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells, and is involved in processes such as differentiation, activation, and proliferation of myofibroblasts, modulation of organ fibrosis, and promotion of cardiac hypertrophy and pulmonary edema (Talbot2019Transmembrane).

In the context of cell motility, TRPC6 is associated with promoting a contractile cell phenotype by inhibiting Rac1 activity and promoting stress fiber formation through the activation of the TRPC6-RhoA complex. This function contrasts with TRPC5, which promotes cell motility by inhibiting RhoA (Tian2010Antagonistic). TRPC6 also plays a role in maintaining vascular function, contributing to processes such as the Bayliss effect and endothelial-mediated vasodilatation (Abdinghoff2022Evaluation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRPC6 gene are associated with several kidney diseases, most notably focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by scarring in the kidney's filtering units. These mutations can lead to either gain or loss of function, affecting calcium channel activity and contributing to disease pathogenesis (Batool2023An; Hall2019TRPC). Gain-of-function mutations often result in increased intracellular calcium levels, which can exacerbate podocyte injury and lead to a more aggressive disease phenotype, sometimes manifesting in early childhood (Heeringa2009A; Zhu2009Identification). Conversely, loss-of-function mutations, such as the G757D mutation, act as dominant negatives and are associated with early childhood presentation of non-familial steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (Hall2019TRPC).

TRPC6 mutations have also been linked to other conditions, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), where certain polymorphisms in the gene are associated with more severe disease phenotypes (Pousada2015Molecular). The variability in disease onset and severity suggests that additional genetic or environmental factors may influence the clinical outcomes of TRPC6-related diseases (Wang2020Two; Hall2019TRPC).

## Interactions
TRPC6 interacts with various proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis. In cancer, TRPC6 is highly expressed in proliferating cells and interacts with proteins such as large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels, Fyn and Src tyrosine kinases, and the human myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MxA), which are associated with increased cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer (Saqib2023Transient). In glial cancer, TRPC6 interacts with the KCa1.1 channel, influencing tumor growth and response to ionizing radiation (Saqib2023Transient).

TRPC6 also plays a role in cardiovascular diseases by interacting with Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) channels, where Na+ influx through TRPC6 can drive Ca2+ influx through NCX in reverse mode. This interaction is significant in hypertensive phenotypes and is observed in vascular smooth muscle cells (Chen2020Transient). TRPC6 further interacts with Orai1 and CaV1.2 channels in vascular smooth muscle cells to induce Ca2+ influx, contributing to vascular tone regulation and potentially to hypertension (Chen2020Transient).

In the immune system, TRPC6 modulates calcium currents in immune cells, influencing functions such as transendothelial migration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and cytokine release (Ramirez2018Ion). These interactions highlight TRPC6's involvement in both physiological and pathological processes.
