# UCHL1

## Overview
UCHL1 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, which is a member of the cysteine protease family. The protein product of UCHL1 plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical pathway for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. UCHL1 is highly expressed in neurons, where it is essential for maintaining axonal integrity and synaptic function, and is involved in various cellular processes, including stress response and signal transduction (Matuszczak2020Ubiquitin; Bishop2016Ubiquitin). The protein's structure is characterized by a complex α/β hydrolase fold, featuring a catalytic triad typical of cysteine proteases, and is subject to various post-translational modifications that influence its function (Das2006Structural; Lee2017Familial). UCHL1's interactions with other proteins, such as amyloid precursor protein and tubulin, underscore its involvement in diverse cellular pathways. Clinically, mutations and dysregulation of UCHL1 are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, highlighting its significance in neuronal health and disease (Jara2013Could; Graham2017Life).

## Structure
UCHL1 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1) is a protein with a complex molecular structure, primarily characterized by its α/β hydrolase fold. The protein consists of a single domain with 223 amino acids, forming a structure that includes a central five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices, creating a hydrophobic core (Lee2017Familial; Puri2021Crossover). The tertiary structure of UCHL1 is notable for its '5 2' or 'Gordian' knot, which is considered one of the most intricate eukaryotic protein structures, providing stability against proteasomal degradation (Bishop2016Ubiquitin).

The active site of UCHL1 features a catalytic triad composed of cysteine, histidine, and aspartate residues, typical of cysteine proteases. This site is located in a cleft between two lobes of the protein, with the right lobe containing five α-helices and the left lobe comprising two helices and six β-strands (Das2006Structural). The active site is covered by loop L8, which forms a tunnel and restricts access, requiring conformational changes for substrate entry (Das2006Structural).

Post-translational modifications of UCHL1 include O-glycosylation, farnesylation, monoubiquitination, and nitroxylation, which can influence its function and aggregation propensity (Lee2017Familial). These modifications, along with the presence of splice variant isoforms, may affect the protein's activity and localization.

## Function
UCHL1 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis within cells. It is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is essential for protein degradation and various cellular processes such as stress response, cell differentiation, and signal transduction (Matuszczak2020Ubiquitin). UCHL1 functions by hydrolyzing small C-terminal extensions from ubiquitin, thereby maintaining a pool of available monomeric ubiquitin in the cytosol, which is critical for recycling ubiquitin after it has been used to tag proteins for degradation (Bishop2016Ubiquitin).

In neurons, UCHL1 is highly abundant, constituting 1-5% of total neuronal protein, and is crucial for maintaining axonal integrity and synaptic function (Bishop2016Ubiquitin). It is involved in the processing of monomeric ubiquitin from polyubiquitin precursors, potentially acting co-translationally in neurons (Bishop2016Ubiquitin). UCHL1 also interacts with proteins such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tubulin, indicating its involvement in various cellular pathways (Bishop2016Ubiquitin).

In pancreatic beta cells, UCHL1 is important for cell survival and function, particularly under lipotoxic conditions. It regulates apoptosis and proliferation of beta cells and affects insulin secretion by influencing the ubiquitination of SNARE proteins, which are critical for exocytosis (Chu2011Ubiquitin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the UCHL1 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), UCHL1 is a major component of Lewy bodies, and its levels are often down-regulated. The familial mutation I93M is associated with PD, leading to structural changes and increased insolubility of the protein, which inhibits chaperone-mediated autophagy and increases α-synuclein, contributing to neurotoxicity (Jara2013Could; Graham2017Life). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), UCHL1 is involved in β-secretase degradation and Aβ deposition. UCHL1 null mice show increased brain Aβ levels, while overexpression slows Aβ deposition and cognitive decline (Graham2017Life).

The UCHL1 GLU7ALA mutation is linked to early-onset progressive neurodegeneration, affecting the optic system, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord, with symptoms like myokymia and ataxia (Bilguvar2013Recessive). UCHL1 expression is also decreased in spinal muscular atrophy, affecting motor neurons (Graham2017Life). In cerebral ischemia, UCHL1 is modified by reactive lipids, reducing its activity and leading to protein aggregation, exacerbating ischemic injury (Graham2017Life). These findings highlight the critical role of UCHL1 in maintaining neuronal health and its involvement in neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
UCHL1 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular functions. It interacts with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), specifically the NCAM140 and NCAM180 isoforms, regulating their ubiquitination and intracellular trafficking. UCHL1 decreases the ubiquitination of these NCAM isoforms, promoting their recycling to the cell surface and preventing lysosomal degradation (Wobst2012UCHL1).

In prostate cancer cells, UCHL1 interacts with p27Kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, leading to the accumulation of p27Kip1 and suppression of Cyclin A expression, which results in cell cycle arrest and senescence (Ummanni2011Ubiquitin). UCHL1 also interacts with p53, stabilizing it through deubiquitination, which affects the MDM2 protein levels and contributes to tumor suppression (Ummanni2011Ubiquitin).

In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, UCHL1 interacts with cortactin (CTTN), increasing its ubiquitination and promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This interaction is crucial for suppressing cell migration and invasion (Zhao2020Hypermethylation). UCHL1's interactions with these proteins highlight its role in regulating protein stability and cellular pathways, impacting processes such as cell cycle regulation, tumor suppression, and neural cell function.
