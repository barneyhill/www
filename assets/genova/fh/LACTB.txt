# LACTB

## Overview
The LACTB gene encodes a mitochondrial serine protease known as lactamase beta, which plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function. This protein is categorized as a serine β-lactamase-like protein and is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial respiratory complex I activity and phospholipid metabolism, essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and cellular energy homeostasis (Bennett2022The). LACTB assembles into filamentous polymers within the mitochondrial intermembrane space, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and interaction with lipid membranes, contributing to mitochondrial membrane organization (Bennett2022The). The protein's widespread expression in tissues such as skeletal muscle, heart, and liver underscores its importance in normal cellular functions and metabolic homeostasis (Liang2017High). Additionally, LACTB has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression affects tumor growth and progression, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Zeng2018LACTB; Zhang2018Upregulation).

## Structure
The LACTB protein is a serine β-lactamase-like protein with a primary structure consisting of 551 amino acids. It features a predicted amino-terminal transmembrane domain spanning residues 32 to 54, but lacks a signal peptide (Smith2001Identification). The protein contains an active site motif related to C-class β-lactamases and shares sequence similarity with penicillin-binding proteins and β-lactamases, indicating conserved molecular mechanisms across species (Bennett2022The).

In terms of secondary structure, LACTB forms filamentous polymers within the mitochondrial intermembrane space. These filaments are crucial for its catalytic activity and mitochondrial membrane organization (Bennett2022The). The tertiary structure of LACTB involves a helical filament assembly, with antiparallel dimers as the basic building blocks. These dimers interact through charge-charge and polar interactions, leading to helical stacking and elongation of the filaments (Bennett2022The).

The quaternary structure of LACTB is characterized by its polymerization into stable filaments, which are essential for its enzymatic function. These filaments interact with lipid membranes, suggesting a role in mitochondrial membrane organization and lipid metabolism regulation (Li2022LACTB). The protein's structure is further stabilized by specific sequences that facilitate direct membrane interaction (Bennett2022The).

## Function
The LACTB gene encodes a mitochondrial serine protease that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function. In healthy human cells, LACTB is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial respiratory complex I activity and phospholipid metabolism, which are essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and cellular energy homeostasis (Bennett2022The). LACTB assembles into filamentous polymers within the mitochondrial intermembrane space, a process necessary for its catalytic activity. These filaments interact with lipid membranes, contributing to mitochondrial membrane organization and morphogenesis (Bennett2022The).

LACTB's role in lipid metabolism includes the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a phospholipid critical for mitochondrial structure and function (Bennett2022The). The protein's interaction with cardiolipin-containing lipid bilayers suggests it acts as a molecular zipper, regulating the distance between mitochondrial membranes (Bennett2022The). LACTB is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, indicating its widespread importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and metabolic homeostasis (MicroRNA1276; p&gt; Wang2020&lt; Liang2017High).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LACTB gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), breast cancer (BRCA), glioma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In CRC, LACTB is frequently downregulated due to promoter methylation and histone deacetylation, which correlates with advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis. Its downregulation leads to increased tumor growth and metastasis by destabilizing the p53 protein, a crucial tumor suppressor (Zeng2018LACTB). In BRCA, LACTB is targeted by miR-374a, resulting in its downregulation and contributing to cancer progression and poor survival outcomes (Zhang2018Upregulation). 

In glioma, decreased LACTB expression is associated with higher tumor grades and poor overall survival, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Li2019Overexpression). In NPC, LACTB promotes metastasis through the ERBB3/EGFR-ERK signaling pathway, with its expression regulated by promoter methylation (Peng2021LACTB). These findings indicate that LACTB's expression levels and interactions are critical in cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
The LACTB protein is known to interact with the p53 protein, a crucial tumor suppressor, in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). This interaction is significant as LACTB binds to the C-terminal domain of p53, stabilizing it by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation mediated by MDM2, a regulator of p53 stability. This interaction has been confirmed in cell lines such as HCT116 and HCT8, which possess wild-type TP53, but not in cell lines like HT29 and SW480 that harbor mutant TP53 (Zeng2018LACTB). LACTB's role in stabilizing p53 is crucial for its tumor-suppressive function, as it leads to increased expression of p53 and its downstream anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic genes (Zeng2018LACTB).

In addition to its interaction with p53, LACTB is functionally connected with phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PISD), influencing the phospholipid composition of mitochondrial membranes and affecting cellular proliferation and cancer stem cell marker expression (Li2022LACTB). LACTB also interacts with lipid membranes, particularly cardiolipin-containing lipid bilayers, through its filamentous structure, which may play a role in mitochondrial membrane organization (Bennett2022The).
