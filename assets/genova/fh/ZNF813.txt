# ZNF813

## Overview
ZNF813 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 813, a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins. Zinc finger proteins are often involved in transcriptional regulation, and ZNF813 is no exception, playing a role in various cellular processes. The protein encoded by ZNF813 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression and has been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer and genetic disorders. Its expression and mutation patterns have been studied in the context of lung and colorectal cancers, as well as in chromosomal abnormalities linked to congenital conditions (Yu2019Identification; Bai2019Circulating; von2016CNV).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF813 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations and alterations in its expression levels. In lung cancer, ZNF813 is consistently over-expressed in tumor tissues, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression. The exact function of ZNF813 in lung cancer is not fully understood, but it may operate similarly to other zinc finger proteins that inhibit metastasis in different cancer types (Bai2019Circulating).

In colorectal cancer, ZNF813 expression is significantly reduced in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cases compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) cases. This altered expression is associated with the MSI status, a key molecular marker in colorectal cancer, although the specific implications of this change are not fully detailed (Yu2019Identification).

ZNF813 has also been identified in a chromosomal deletion in a patient with bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC), although the direct impact of this deletion on the condition is not specified (von2016CNV).

In the context of chronic myeloid leukemia, ZNF813 mutations were found in patients after tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, indicating a potential role in disease progression (Kim2017Exome).
