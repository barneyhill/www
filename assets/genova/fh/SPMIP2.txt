# SPMIP2

## Overview
SPMIP2 is a gene that encodes the protein sperm microtubule inner protein 2, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of sperm cells. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, involved in the organization and stabilization of microtubules within the sperm flagellum. The proper functioning of SPMIP2 is essential for sperm motility, which is a critical factor in male fertility. Mutations or dysregulation of this gene may lead to impaired sperm function and contribute to infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
