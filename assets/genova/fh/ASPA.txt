# ASPA

## Overview
The ASPA gene encodes the enzyme aspartoacylase, which plays a critical role in the central nervous system by catalyzing the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) into acetate and aspartate. Aspartoacylase is categorized as a hydrolase enzyme and is predominantly expressed in oligodendrocytes, where it contributes to the synthesis of myelin-associated lipids necessary for proper myelination during postnatal development (MOFFETT2007NAcetylaspartate; Madhavarao2005Defective). The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining neuronal health and function, as it facilitates the transfer of acetate from neurons to oligodendrocytes, supporting myelin sheath formation and energy metabolism (Madhavarao2005Defective). Mutations in the ASPA gene are linked to Canavan disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of NAA, leading to severe neurological impairments (Neissi2021A; Gersing2021Mapping). The ASPA gene is located on chromosome 17 and has been the subject of extensive research due to its clinical significance and potential therapeutic targets (Bijarnia2012Molecular; Mendes2017Clinically).

## Structure
The ASPA protein is a 313-amino acid enzyme with a molecular mass of approximately 35.7 kDa. It is composed of two distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1-212) and the C-terminal domain (residues 213-313) (Wijayasinghe2014Aspartoacylase; Grønbæk-Thygesen2024Cellular). The N-terminal domain features a central six-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by eight α-helices, adopting an αβ-class protein fold with a three-layer αβα-sandwich architecture (Bitto2007Structure). The C-terminal domain is mainly composed of β-sheet and coil structures that wrap around the N-terminal domain, forming a channel leading to the active site (Wijayasinghe2014Aspartoacylase; Bitto2007Structure).

ASPA functions as a homodimer, with the dimer interface involving 12 hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges, covering approximately 1200 Å² of solvent-accessible area (Bitto2007Structure; Grønbæk-Thygesen2024Cellular). The active site is located primarily in the N-terminal domain and includes conserved residues such as His-21, Glu-24, and His-116, which coordinate a zinc ion essential for catalytic activity (Wijayasinghe2014Aspartoacylase; Bitto2007Structure). The enzyme's quaternary structure is crucial for its catalytic function, with mutations near the dimer interface affecting its stability and activity (Wijayasinghe2014Aspartoacylase).

## Function
The ASPA gene encodes the enzyme aspartoacylase, which is crucial for the metabolism of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the central nervous system (CNS). In healthy human cells, particularly in oligodendrocytes, ASPA is responsible for hydrolyzing NAA into acetate and aspartate. This process is essential for providing acetate, a key substrate for the synthesis of myelin-associated lipids during postnatal CNS myelination (MOFFETT2007NAcetylaspartate; Madhavarao2005Defective). The acetate derived from NAA is used in the production of acetyl CoA, which is necessary for lipid synthesis, supporting the formation and maintenance of myelin sheaths around neurons (MOFFETT2007NAcetylaspartate; Francis2016Nacetylaspartate).

ASPA activity is predominantly localized in oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for myelinating axons in the CNS, and is not significantly expressed in the peripheral nervous system (MOFFETT2007NAcetylaspartate). The enzyme's function is critical for maintaining proper myelination and motor function, as it channels NAA-associated acetate from neurons to oligodendrocytes, supporting myelin sheath formation and neuronal energy metabolism (Madhavarao2005Defective). Deficiency in ASPA activity leads to the accumulation of NAA, which is associated with Canavan disease, a disorder characterized by dysmyelination and neurological damage (MOFFETT2007NAcetylaspartate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ASPA gene are primarily associated with Canavan disease, a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spongy degeneration of the brain's white matter. This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme aspartoacylase, which leads to the accumulation of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the brain, resulting in developmental delays, macrocephaly, hypotonia, and seizures (Neissi2021A; Mendes2017Clinically; Gersing2021Mapping). Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, with a higher prevalence among Ashkenazi Jews, where specific mutations like E285A are common (Hershfield2007Mutational; Pleasure2018Pathophysiology).

The ASPA gene is located on chromosome 17 and consists of six exons. More than 100 mutations have been identified, including single nucleotide substitutions, deletions, and missense mutations (Bijarnia2012Molecular; Mendes2017Clinically). These mutations disrupt the normal function of aspartoacylase, leading to the clinical manifestations of Canavan disease. The disease is diagnosed through elevated NAA levels detected by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and characteristic brain abnormalities observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Neissi2021A).

Currently, there is no approved therapy for Canavan disease, though gene therapy and enzyme replacement have shown promise in reducing brain NAA levels in experimental models (Leone2012LongTerm; Gersing2021Mapping).

## Interactions
Aspartoacylase (ASPA) interacts with several proteins involved in its degradation pathway, particularly in the context of its disease-linked variant, C152W. The degradation of ASPA C152W is facilitated by molecular chaperones and E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases. Hsp70 chaperones, specifically Ssa1 and Ssa2 in yeast, recognize and promote the degradation of misfolded ASPA proteins. Hsp110, encoded by the SSE1 and SSE2 genes, acts as a nucleotide exchange factor that aids in the release of substrates to the proteasome for degradation (Gersing2021Mapping). The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Ubr1 is crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ASPA C152W, with other ligases like Doa10 and Hrd1 also contributing to this process (Gersing2021Mapping).

Hsp104, a yeast disaggregase, plays a role in promoting the solubilization and maintaining the steady-state levels of ASPA. It is involved in the disaggregation of insoluble protein inclusions, allowing aggregated proteins to refold. The absence of Hsp104 results in reduced solubility and levels of ASPA C152W, indicating that ASPA is a substrate of Hsp104 (Gersing2021Mapping). Additionally, the segregase Cdc48 is involved in disaggregating ubiquitinated protein aggregates for proteasomal degradation (Gersing2021Mapping).
