# ARHGAP32

## Overview
ARHGAP32 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 32, also known as RICS or p250GAP. This protein is categorized as a Rho GTPase-activating protein and plays a crucial role in neuronal development and signaling. It is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is essential for maintaining proper neuronal morphology and function. The protein contains several functional domains, including a RhoGAP domain, a phox homology (PX) domain, a PDZ domain, and a C2 domain, which collectively contribute to its role in modulating dendritic spine morphology and synaptic signaling pathways (mccormack2013regulation; Nakazawa2016Emerging; Joensuu2018Dendritic). ARHGAP32 is highly expressed in the brain and is implicated in various cellular processes, including intracellular protein trafficking and synaptic structure maintenance. Mutations in the ARHGAP32 gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2016De).

## Structure
ARHGAP32, also known as RICS or p250GAP, is a Rho GTPase-activating protein involved in neuronal development and signaling. The protein contains several functional domains, including a RhoGAP domain, which is responsible for inactivating Rho GTPases, and a phox homology (PX) domain located at its N-terminal (mccormack2013regulation; Nakazawa2016Emerging). ARHGAP32 also features a PDZ domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and a C2 domain, which is involved in calcium-dependent phospholipid binding. These domains contribute to the protein's role in regulating dendritic spine morphology and complexity (Joensuu2018Dendritic).

ARHGAP32 interacts with the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor and activates RhoA in response to NMDA activation, highlighting its involvement in synaptic signaling pathways (Joensuu2018Dendritic). The protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. ARHGAP32 also has multiple splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity and allow it to participate in various cellular processes (Joensuu2018Dendritic). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ARHGAP32 are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
ARHGAP32, also known as RICS, is a Rho GTPase-activating protein that plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is crucial for neuronal development and morphology. It is highly expressed in the brain and is involved in beta-catenin-N-cadherin and NMDA receptor signaling pathways. ARHGAP32 modulates the activity of Rho GTPases, particularly Cdc42, which is essential for controlling neurite outgrowth. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of ARHGAP32 leads to longer neurites with increased Cdc42 activity, indicating its role in inhibiting excessive neurite extension (mccormack2013regulation).

In addition to its role in neuronal development, ARHGAP32 is involved in intracellular protein trafficking processes. It regulates the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport of the N-cadherin/b-catenin complex in fibroblasts, which is important for maintaining proper cell-cell adhesion and signaling (Nakazawa2016Emerging). The protein's activity in these pathways suggests its involvement in maintaining synaptic structure and function, which is critical for normal cognitive processes and may have implications in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Nakazawa2016Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARHGAP32 gene have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study identified a de novo likely gene-disruptive (LGD) mutation in ARHGAP32 in a Chinese cohort of ASD patients, marking the first such discovery in this gene for ASD, although a de novo missense variant had been previously reported (Wang2016De). The study highlights the significance of de novo mutations in understanding the etiology of ASD and suggests that candidate risk genes identified in European cohorts are also relevant in other populations, such as the Chinese cohort (Wang2016De). ARHGAP32 has also been noted as a candidate gene for ASD features associated with Jacobsen syndrome, based on overlapping deletions that narrowed the critical region to include this locus (Wang2016De).

The research underscores the importance of de novo mutations in ASD and suggests that these mutations do not significantly differ between global populations, contributing to the understanding of the genetic basis of ASD (Wang2016De). Larger autism cohorts could help establish the pathogenicity of autism disease genes across different populations (Wang2016De).

## Interactions
ARHGAP32, also known as RICS, is a Rho GTPase-activating protein that interacts with G-actin through its RPEL motif, forming a 1:1 complex that inhibits its GAP activity towards Rac1 and Cdc42. This interaction involves canonical binding with the RPEL motif and additional contacts with the GAP domain through a hydrophobic niche, which is crucial for the repressive effect on GAP activity (Diring2019RPELfamily). The RPEL motif in ARHGAP32 links its activity to G-actin availability, suggesting a feedback mechanism with actin dynamics (Diring2019RPELfamily).

ARHGAP32's RPEL-GAP domain (amino acids 339-569) has been expressed in bacteria as a GST fusion protein, and its interaction with actin has been studied using analytical size exclusion chromatography and in vitro pulldown assays. These studies indicate a physical interaction between ARHGAP32 and actin (Diring2019RPELfamily). However, specific interactions of ARHGAP32 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its interaction with G-actin are not detailed in the provided context. The focus is primarily on the methods used to study these interactions rather than detailed interaction partners of ARHGAP32 (Diring2019RPELfamily).
