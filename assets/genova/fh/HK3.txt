# HK3

## Overview
Hexokinase 3 (HK3) is a gene that encodes the enzyme hexokinase 3, a member of the hexokinase family, which plays a pivotal role in glucose metabolism. This enzyme is involved in the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, marking the first step in the glycolytic pathway (Xu2021Hexokinase). Unlike other hexokinase isoforms, hexokinase 3 is uniquely inhibited by physiological concentrations of glucose, indicating a specialized regulatory function in glucose homeostasis (Xu2019A). Predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, such as macrophages and granulocytes, HK3 is significantly upregulated during myeloid differentiation, particularly in neutrophils and macrophages (Seiler2022Hexokinase). Beyond its metabolic role, hexokinase 3 is implicated in non-glycolytic functions, including DNA protection and apoptosis regulation, which are crucial for myeloid cell survival and stress response (Seiler2022Hexokinase). The gene's expression and function are also relevant in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it influences cell survival, differentiation, and immune response (Federzoni2012PU.1; Yang2023Exploring).

## Function
Hexokinase 3 (HK3) is an enzyme involved in the initial step of glucose metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, a critical step in glycolysis (Xu2021Hexokinase). Unlike other hexokinase isoforms, HK3 is inhibited by physiological concentrations of glucose, suggesting a regulatory role in glucose metabolism (Xu2019A). HK3 is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, such as macrophages and granulocytes, and its expression is significantly induced during myeloid differentiation, particularly in neutrophils and macrophages (Seiler2022Hexokinase).

HK3 is primarily active in the cytoplasm but also localizes in the nucleus, where it may play a role in DNA protection independent of its glycolytic function (Seiler2022Hexokinase). The enzyme is involved in non-glycolytic functions that enhance myeloid cell survival, potentially through mechanisms related to DNA integrity and apoptosis regulation (Seiler2022Hexokinase). HK3 interacts with proapoptotic proteins, such as BIM, indicating a role in regulating apoptosis and maintaining cell homeostasis (Seiler2022Hexokinase). These functions suggest that HK3 contributes to cellular stress responses and survival pathways in myeloid cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HK3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), HK3 expression is significantly reduced compared to normal granulocytes. This downregulation is associated with the PML-RARA fusion protein, which represses HK3 expression. However, treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can restore HK3 levels, promoting neutrophil differentiation and cell survival (Federzoni2012PU.1). 

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), HK3 expression is upregulated and correlates with poor overall survival. High HK3 levels are linked to immune response activation and immune cell infiltration, particularly macrophages, which may contribute to the tumor's immunosuppressive environment (Li2023HK3; Yang2023Exploring). 

In colorectal cancer (CRC), HK3 is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis. HK3 is upregulated in CRC and correlates with EMT-related genes, suggesting its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Pudova2018HK3). 

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), HK3 is linked to tumor progression and poor prognosis, influencing immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint regulation, which are critical for immune escape (Xu2021Hexokinase).

## Interactions
Hexokinase 3 (HK3) is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in myeloid cell survival and differentiation. HK3 directly interacts with the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BIM, as identified through mass spectrometry and confirmed by proximity ligation assays, which demonstrated colocalization of HK3 and BIM in HL60 cells (Seiler2022Hexokinase). This interaction suggests a role for HK3 in cytoprotective mechanisms during ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemic cells (Seiler2022Hexokinase).

Unlike Hexokinase 2 (HK2), HK3 does not colocalize with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), indicating a distinct interaction profile that does not involve the typical cytoprotective association seen with HK2 and VDAC (Seiler2022Hexokinase). In the context of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), HK3 expression is regulated by the transcription factor PU.1, which directly activates the HK3 promoter, while the oncogenic fusion protein PML-RARA inhibits this activation (Federzoni2012PU.1). These interactions highlight HK3's involvement in transcriptional regulation and its functional role in cell survival and differentiation pathways.
