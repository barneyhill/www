# GALNT14

## Overview
GALNT14 is a gene that encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 14, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the initiation of mucin-type O-glycosylation, a critical posttranslational modification process that occurs in the Golgi apparatus. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues on target proteins, influencing their folding, stability, and function. This modification is essential for various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and cell-cell interactions. GALNT14's activity is particularly significant in the context of epithelial cell protection, as it contributes to the structural integrity and function of mucins, which serve as protective barriers. The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several cancers, where it plays a role in tumor progression, metastasis, and response to therapy (Czyrnik2023Stromalepithelial; Chu2022GALNT14mediated; WANG2013The).

## Function
GALNT14 encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 14, which plays a crucial role in the initiation of mucin-type O-glycosylation. This process involves the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues on proteins, a modification that occurs in the Golgi apparatus. This glycosylation is essential for the proper folding, stability, and function of glycoproteins, impacting cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and cell-cell interactions (Czyrnik2023Stromalepithelial; WANG2013The).

In healthy human cells, GALNT14 is involved in the posttranslational modification of mucins, which are glycoproteins that serve as protective barriers for epithelial cells. These mucins include MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC7, and MUC13, although GALNT14 does not increase their expression levels (Czyrnik2023Stromalepithelial). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of these mucins, which protect epithelial surfaces from inflammation and cellular stress (Czyrnik2023Stromalepithelial).

GALNT14's role in glycosylation also influences cellular signaling pathways and interactions, contributing to the regulation of cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, which are vital for normal cellular function and organismal homeostasis (Czyrnik2023Stromalepithelial).

## Clinical Significance
The GALNT14 gene is implicated in various cancers due to mutations and alterations in its expression levels. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), the GALNT14 'GG' genotype is associated with better overall survival, suggesting a potential tumor suppressor role (Chiang2019The). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the 'TT' genotype is linked to favorable treatment responses, indicating a complex role in cancer progression (Chiang2019The; Lin2019A).

GALNT14 overexpression is observed in approximately 30% of various human malignancies, affecting the O-glycosylation of death receptors and modulating sensitivity to cancer therapy (Lin2022Association). In breast cancer, GALNT14 contributes to invasion by altering cell proliferation and motility, affecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, and stimulating MMP-2 activity (Ryu2020Genomic). In ovarian cancer, downregulation of GALNT14 inhibits apoptosis and ferroptosis, highlighting its role in chemoresistance (Lin2022Association).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), GALNT14 expression varies across different sites and is influenced by factors like HPV infection. High expression levels are associated with chemoresistance and poorer survival outcomes, particularly in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) (Lin2022Association). These findings underscore the gene's significance in cancer prognosis and treatment response.

## Interactions
GALNT14, a polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, is involved in various protein interactions through its role in O-glycosylation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, GALNT14 mediates the O-glycosylation of PHB2 at serine-161, which is crucial for the interaction between PHB2 and IGFBP6. This interaction promotes the activation of the IGF1R signaling cascade, enhancing cell growth, migration, and drug resistance (Chu2022GALNT14mediated). GALNT14's interaction with PHB2 is facilitated by its translocation from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it directly interacts with PHB2 (Chu2022GALNT14mediated).

In breast cancer, GALNT14 influences the self-renewal of cancer cells by modulating the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. It achieves this by increasing the O-GalNAcylation of the BMPR 1A receptor, thereby suppressing BMP signaling (Song2016GALNT14). GALNT14 also interacts with FGFR1 through glycosylation, which primes breast cancer cells for FGF signaling activation, promoting metastasis in the lung microenvironment (Song2016GALNT14).

In ovarian cancer, GALNT14 is involved in the glycosylation of MUC13, which is associated with increased cell migration and metastasis. This interaction is significant for understanding tumor metastasis and could aid in developing new anticancer drugs (WANG2013The).
