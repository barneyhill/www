# FCRLB

## Overview
FCRLB is a gene that encodes the Fc receptor-like B protein, a member of the Fc receptor-like (FCRL) family, which is primarily involved in immune system regulation. Unlike classical Fc receptors, the Fc receptor-like B protein does not bind immunoglobulins, and it is characterized by its unique structural features, including a conserved split signal peptide and three tandem immunoglobulin (Ig) domains. The protein also contains a carboxy-terminal mucin-like leucine-rich region, which may facilitate covalent interactions with other proteins. Notably, FCRLB lacks a transmembrane region, suggesting it may be secreted, although it has been observed in the cytoplasm (Davis2007Fc). The gene is expressed at low levels across various tissues, with a notable presence in B cell subsets, and is implicated in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Daëron2016Fc). Alterations in FCRLB expression have been associated with diseases such as colorectal cancer and autoimmune conditions, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2022High; Koral2023Silencing).

## Structure
The FCRLB gene encodes a protein that is part of the Fc receptor-like (FCRL) family, characterized by its immunoglobulin (Ig) domain composition. The FCRLB protein contains a conserved split signal peptide and three distinctive Ig domains arranged in tandem, similar to the FCGR1/CD64, with which it shares 29% Ig domain amino acid identity in humans and 35% in mice (Davis2007Fc). The protein also features a carboxy-terminal mucin-like leucine-rich region, which includes potential dileucine motifs that may form an α-helical coiled-coil structure. This region contains an unpaired cysteine residue, suggesting the possibility of covalent homodimeric or heterodimeric pairing with another protein partner (Davis2007Fc).

FCRLB lacks a transmembrane region, indicating it may be secreted, although it has been reported to localize in the cytoplasm (Davis2007Fc). The protein has two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, which are common post-translational modifications that could influence its stability and function (Davis2007Fc). Despite these structural features, FCRLB does not bind immunoglobulins like classical Fc receptors (Davis2007Fc).

## Function
FCRLB is a gene that encodes a protein involved in immune system regulation, primarily expressed in B cells. The protein shares structural features with other Fc receptor-like family members, including a conserved split signal peptide and three distinctive immunoglobulin (Ig) domains. It also contains a carboxy-terminal mucin-like leucine-rich region, which may facilitate covalent homodimeric or heterodimeric pairing with another protein partner (Davis2007Fc). Despite these structural similarities, FCRLB does not have a transmembrane region, suggesting it may be secreted, although it is reported to localize in the cytoplasm (Davis2007Fc).

FCRLB is expressed at very low levels in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, making its evaluation challenging through traditional methods. Its expression is mainly defined by RT-PCR, with transcripts identified in human tissues such as placenta, kidney, spleen, lung, and tonsils. It is amplified from pre-germinal center (GC), GC, and plasma cell B lineage subsets but is not appreciably expressed by naive or memory B cells (Davis2007Fc). The protein's role in healthy human cells remains largely undefined, but it is suggested to be involved in modulating immune responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Daëron2016Fc).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FCRLB gene have been associated with various diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and autoimmune conditions. In CRC, FCRLB is significantly overexpressed in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression correlates with adverse clinicopathological features such as elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, advanced tumor stages, and lymphatic invasion. High FCRLB expression is linked to poorer overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals in CRC patients, making it an unfavorable prognostic factor (Wang2022High).

In autoimmune diseases, FCRLB has been implicated in the pathogenesis of conditions like myasthenia gravis (MG). Silencing FCRLB in a mouse model of MuSK-induced experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) resulted in improved clinical outcomes, suggesting that FCRLB plays a role in the disease's progression. This indicates potential therapeutic implications for targeting FCRLB in antibody-mediated disorders (Koral2023Silencing).

Overall, FCRLB's role in modulating immune responses and its expression alterations in various diseases highlight its clinical significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target.
