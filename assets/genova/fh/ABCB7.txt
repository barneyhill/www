# ABCB7

## Overview
The ABCB7 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 7 (ABCB7) protein, a mitochondrial transporter that is integral to cellular iron homeostasis. As a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, ABCB7 is involved in the transport of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters from the mitochondria to the cytosol, a process essential for the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins. These proteins are crucial for various cellular functions, including respiration, DNA repair, and protein synthesis (Cavadini2006RNA; GonzálezCabo2011Disruption). Structurally, ABCB7 is a half transporter that forms homodimers, a characteristic feature of mitochondrial ABC transporters, and interacts with other proteins such as ferrochelatase (FECH) and ABCB10 to facilitate heme biosynthesis (Maio2019Dimeric; Schaedler2015Structures). Mutations in the ABCB7 gene are linked to X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A), underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining mitochondrial iron balance and preventing oxidative stress (Allikmets1999Mutation; Pondarre2006Abcb7).

## Structure
The ABCB7 protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, characterized by its involvement in transporting molecules across cellular membranes. Structurally, ABCB7 is a half transporter that forms homodimers, a common feature among mitochondrial ABC transporters (Schaedler2015Structures). The primary structure of ABCB7 includes nucleotide-binding domains and transmembrane domains, which are typical of ABC transporters (Schaedler2015Structures). 

The secondary structure of ABCB7 likely consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, as is common in ABC transporters, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, facilitating its function as a transporter. The quaternary structure of ABCB7 involves dimerization, which is essential for its function in exporting sulfur species necessary for cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis (Maio2019Dimeric).

ABCB7 interacts with other proteins, such as ferrochelatase (FECH) and ABCB10, forming a complex crucial for heme biosynthesis. This interaction is mediated by specific sequences in the C-terminal domain of ABCB7, particularly residues V450-L463 and G527-D538, which are essential for binding with FECH (Maio2019Dimeric). The protein's role in mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis is underscored by its involvement in this complex (Maio2019Dimeric).

## Function
The ABCB7 gene encodes a mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein that plays a crucial role in iron homeostasis within human cells. This protein is involved in the transport of iron-sulfur (Fe/S) clusters from the mitochondria to the cytosol, which is essential for the maturation of cytosolic Fe/S proteins. These proteins are vital for various cellular processes, including respiration, DNA repair, and protein synthesis (Cavadini2006RNA; GonzálezCabo2011Disruption).

ABCB7 is the human ortholog of the yeast Atm1p and functions similarly by facilitating iron efflux from the mitochondria, thereby preventing iron overload within the organelle. This process is critical for maintaining cellular iron balance and ensuring the availability of iron for heme synthesis and other cellular functions (Cavadini2006RNA; Boultwood2008The).

In healthy cells, ABCB7 is essential for the proper functioning of mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S proteins. Its activity is crucial for preventing mitochondrial iron accumulation, which can lead to oxidative stress and cellular dysfunction. Deficiency in ABCB7 can result in mitochondrial iron overload and cytosolic iron deficiency, contributing to conditions such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (XLSA/A) (Cavadini2006RNA; GonzálezCabo2011Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABCB7 gene are associated with X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (XLSA/A), a rare genetic disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and mild anemia. This condition results from disruptions in mitochondrial iron transport and heme synthesis due to ABCB7 mutations, leading to mitochondrial iron overload and impaired maturation of cytosolic iron-sulfur (Fe/S) cluster proteins (Allikmets1999Mutation; Bekri2000Human; Pondarre2006Abcb7). 

A specific mutation, I400M, has been identified in patients with XLSA/A, which causes a partial loss of function in the ABCB7 protein, similar to the effects seen in yeast models lacking the ATM1 gene (Allikmets1999Mutation). Another mutation, E433K, disrupts the transport of [2Fe-2S] clusters, affecting the communication between the substrate binding site and ATPase domains, leading to a loss of function (Pearson2021Evolution). 

In a Buryat family, a novel ABCB7 mutation was linked to cerebellar hypoplasia and nonprogressive ataxia without the classic symptoms of sideroblastic anemia, suggesting a unique mutation location affecting the clinical phenotype (Protasova2015Wholegenome). These mutations highlight the critical role of ABCB7 in maintaining mitochondrial iron homeostasis and its impact on neurological and hematological health.

## Interactions
ABCB7 is known to form a multimeric complex with ferrochelatase (FECH) and ABCB10, crucial for heme biosynthesis. This complex has a 2:2:2 stoichiometry, indicating that each protein forms dimers within the complex. The interaction between ABCB7 and FECH is mediated by specific amino acid sequences in the C-terminal domain of ABCB7, particularly residues V450-L463 and G527-D538. These regions are essential for binding to FECH, which in turn mediates an indirect interaction between ABCB7 and ABCB10, as no direct crosslinks were detected between ABCB7 and ABCB10 (Maio2019Dimeric).

In cardiac cells, ABCB7 interacts with mitochondrial complex proteins, specifically COXIV from complex IV and ATP5a from complex V, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. This interaction is significant for maintaining mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis, particularly under conditions of cardiac hypertrophy (Kumar2019Chronic).

In Toxoplasma gondii, the ABCB7 homolog is involved in cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and protein translation, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not directly addressed (Maclean2024TheToxoplasma).
