# NDUFB3

## Overview
The NDUFB3 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit B3, a transmembrane protein that is an integral component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Haack2012Molecular; Alston2016A). As a single transmembrane domain subunit located in the Q module of complex I, NDUFB3 is crucial for the assembly, stability, and regulation of the complex's catalytic core (Haack2012Molecular). Mutations in the NDUFB3 gene can lead to complex I deficiency, resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and energy production, which are associated with various mitochondrial diseases (Alston2016A).

## Structure
The NDUFB3 protein is a transmembrane subunit of Complex I (CI) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It is located at the tip of the toe of the CI membrane arm and interacts with several other subunits, including NDUFAB1-β, NDUFB9, NDUFB2, and ND5 (Padavannil2022The). The N-terminus of NDUFB3's transmembrane helix (TMH) binds in a pocket on ND5 formed by TMH12, TMH13, and TMH15. This configuration allows NDUFB3 to pin NDUFB2 to the surface of ND5, creating a lipid binding site on the surface of ND5, which indicates a thinning of the membrane in this region (Padavannil2022The).

A point mutation in NDUFB3, specifically W22R, is associated with CI deficiency and affects its interaction with NDUFB2, highlighting the importance of these interactions for CI activity (Padavannil2022The). This mutation, c.64T>C, p.Trp22Arg, affects an evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue, leading to decreased steady-state levels of Complex I subunit proteins NDUFB8 and NDUFA9, while other complexes remain normal (Alston2016A). The mutation is associated with a distinctive clinical phenotype, including short stature and facial features (Alston2016A).

## Function
The NDUFB3 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is a crucial component of the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This complex, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, facilitates the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, contributing to ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation, which is essential for cellular energy metabolism (Haack2012Molecular; Alston2016A).

NDUFB3 is a single transmembrane domain subunit located in the Q module of the complex I membrane arm. It plays a significant role in the regulation, assembly, and stability of the complex I catalytic core. The presence of NDUFB3 is essential for maintaining normal complex I function, protecting it from damage, and ensuring proper mitochondrial respiration (Haack2012Molecular). In healthy cells, NDUFB3 is involved in the proper assembly and function of complex I, which is crucial for mitochondrial energy production (Haack2012Molecular).

Mutations in NDUFB3 can lead to complex I deficiency, affecting mitochondrial function and energy production. However, in healthy human cells, NDUFB3 contributes to the integrity and function of complex I, supporting efficient oxidative phosphorylation and energy production (Alston2016A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFB3 gene are associated with complex I deficiency, a condition that affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain and can lead to severe mitochondrial diseases. One notable case involved a patient with a homozygous c.64T>C (p.W22R) mutation in the NDUFB3 gene, resulting in complex I deficiency and lethal infantile mitochondrial disease. This mutation was highly conserved and located near a critical lysine residue, indicating its potential impact on protein function. Complementation experiments demonstrated that introducing wild-type NDUFB3 cDNA into the patient's fibroblasts restored complex I activity, confirming the mutation's pathogenicity (Calvo2012Molecular).

Clinical manifestations associated with NDUFB3 mutations include intrauterine growth retardation, encephalopathy, myopathy, hypotonia, and lactic acidosis. These symptoms reflect the broad spectrum of disorders caused by defects in complex I, which can affect multiple organs and lead to severe outcomes (Correia2021Severe). Although few mutations in NDUFB3 have been reported, they are linked to conditions such as fatal infantile lactic acidosis (Fassone2012Complex). The presence of nemaline rods in muscle histology has also been observed in some patients with NDUFB3 mutations, indicating a potential link to specific muscle pathologies (Fassone2012Complex).

## Interactions
NDUFB3 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a critical role in the electron transport chain. It is involved in the assembly and function of complex I, interacting with other subunits to facilitate electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Mckenzie2010Assembly).

NDUFB3 is part of the membrane arm of complex I and can be methylated at three different histidine residues, suggesting potential interactions with assembly factors such as C20orf7. This interaction may be crucial for the proper assembly and function of complex I (Mckenzie2010Assembly). Additionally, NDUFB3 is identified as a hub protein in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, interacting with other subunits like Ndufb5 and Ndufv1, which are part of the protein-protein interaction network within complex I (Xu2022Effect).

In the context of recurrent pregnancy loss, NDUFB3 is up-regulated in decidual cells, where its overexpression affects mitochondrial membrane potential and oxidative stress responses, indicating its involvement in mitochondrial respiratory chain function and potential interactions affecting cell apoptosis and proliferation (Yin2021Proteomic).
