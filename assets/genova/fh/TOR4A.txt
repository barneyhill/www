# TOR4A

## Overview
The TOR4A gene encodes the protein torsin family 4 member A, commonly referred to as torsinA, which is a member of the AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) protein family. TorsinA is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein folding. It is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the cytoskeleton, protein trafficking, and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Mutations in the TOR4A gene, particularly the DYT1 mutation, are linked to the development of dystonia, a neurological movement disorder. This mutation results in a defective torsinA protein that disrupts normal cellular functions, contributing to the pathophysiology of dystonia (Hewett2006Dystoniacausing; Gordon2008Consequences; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOR4A gene, also known as torsinA, are implicated in the development of dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. The DYT1 mutation, a common form of inherited dystonia, involves a deletion of a glutamic acid residue in the torsinA protein. This mutation leads to the production of a defective torsinA protein that misfolds, disrupting normal cellular processes and contributing to early-onset dystonia (Gordon2008Consequences; GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). The mutant torsinA protein interferes with cell adhesion and neurite extension, critical processes for cellular and neuronal function, by altering its association with cytoskeletal proteins such as vimentin (Hewett2006Dystoniacausing).

The DYT1 mutation also affects the processing and trafficking of proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is linked to dysregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response related to the ER (GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). Additionally, torsinA dysfunction is associated with altered lipid metabolism and calcium homeostasis, which may impact synaptic physiology and contribute to the pathophysiology of dystonia (GonzalezAlegre2019Advances). These molecular disruptions highlight the clinical significance of TOR4A mutations in dystonia and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways.
