# SORBS2

## Overview
SORBS2, or sorbin and SH3 domain-containing protein 2, is a gene that encodes a scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. The protein, characterized by an N-terminal sorbin homology domain (SoHo) and three C-terminal SH3 domains, plays a crucial role in protein-protein interactions, particularly in epithelial and muscle cells (FredrikssonLidman2017Sorbin). SORBS2 is implicated in muscle differentiation and maturation, as well as in maintaining the structural integrity of cardiac intercalated discs, which is vital for heart function (Ding2020Knockout; Robin2015SORBS2transcription). Additionally, SORBS2 functions as an RNA-binding protein, influencing mRNA stability and thereby affecting tumorigenesis and metastasis in certain cancers (Lv2020RNAbinding; Han2019The). Mutations and altered expression of SORBS2 have been associated with cardiac conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, as well as with cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2021NOVA1Mediated; McLendon2022Knockout).

## Structure
SORBS2, or sorbin and SH3 domain-containing protein 2, is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes an N-terminal sorbin homology domain (SoHo) and three C-terminal SH3 domains. These domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions and are shared with other proteins in the SORBS family, such as SORBS1 and SORBS3 (FredrikssonLidman2017Sorbin). The SH3 domains are involved in interactions with flotillin and other proteins, contributing to its role in cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction (FredrikssonLidman2017Sorbin).

SORBS2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. In human SKco15 cells, isoforms 3, 4, 9, and 12 have been identified, while in canine MDCKII cells, the isoform X23 is expressed (FredrikssonLidman2017Sorbin). These isoforms share the canonical SoHo domain and the three SH3 domains, which are integral to the protein's function in epithelial cells (FredrikssonLidman2017Sorbin).

SORBS2 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its function in pathways associated with Abl/Arg non-receptor tyrosine kinases (FredrikssonLidman2017Sorbin). These modifications and structural features enable SORBS2 to participate in cell adhesion, actin/cytoskeletal organization, and tumor cell migration (FredrikssonLidman2017Sorbin).

## Function
SORBS2, or sorbin and SH3 domain-containing protein 2, is a scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and signal transduction. In epithelial cells, SORBS2 is a component of the acto-myosin ring at the apical junctional complex, where it interacts with actin and other cytoskeletal proteins such as alpha-actinin and vinculin. Despite its presence at cell junctions, SORBS2 is not essential for the assembly or function of tight or adherens junctions, nor does its knockout affect the localization of junctional proteins or barrier function (FredrikssonLidman2017Sorbin).

In muscle cells, SORBS2 is localized at the Z-line of skeletal muscle fibers and the intercalated disk of cardiac cells, suggesting a role in muscle differentiation and maturation. Its expression is up-regulated during the differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, indicating its involvement in muscle development (Robin2015SORBS2transcription).

SORBS2 also plays a role in cellular senescence, particularly in primary human fibroblasts and keratinocytes, where it can induce senescence characterized by increased expression of senescence markers (Liesenfeld2013SORBS2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SORBS2 gene have been linked to several cardiac conditions. In cardiomyocytes, knockout of SORBS2 leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in mice, characterized by conduction defects and progressive heart failure (McLendon2022Knockout). SORBS2 is also associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), with specific splicing variants identified as pathogenic in patients (Ding2019SORBS2is). These mutations disrupt the structural integrity of intercalated discs, leading to cardiac dysfunction (Ding2020Knockout).

SORBS2 expression is upregulated in various myocardial diseases, including left ventricular non-compaction and diabetic cardiomyopathy, suggesting a compensatory response to declining heart function (McLendon2022Knockout). Genetic variations in SORBS2 are linked to clinical phenotypes such as serum cardiac troponin T levels and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (McLendon2022Knockout).

In addition to cardiac implications, SORBS2 is involved in colorectal cancer progression. Alternative splicing events of SORBS2, regulated by the splicing factor NOVA1, promote cancer cell migration by activating the Notch signaling pathway (Zhang2021NOVA1Mediated). These findings highlight the gene's role in both cardiac and cancer pathologies.

## Interactions
SORBS2, also known as sorbin and SH3 domain containing 2, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with actin and other cytoskeletal proteins, forming part of the apical junction complex in epithelial cells. SORBS2 is associated with the acto-myosin ring and interacts with proteins such as alpha-actinin, vinculin, and N-WASP, although its knockout does not affect the localization or function of these proteins (FredrikssonLidman2017Sorbin).

In the context of inflammation, SORBS2 binds to NMT1 in osteoblasts upon TNF-α stimulation, suggesting a role in the regulation of protein myristoylation (KUTSUNA2023TNFαinduced). In cardiomyocytes, SORBS2 colocalizes with β-catenin at adherens junctions and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of intercalated discs, which is crucial for cardiac function (Ding2020Knockout).

SORBS2 also functions as an RNA-binding protein, stabilizing mRNAs such as MTUS1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and RORA in hepatocellular carcinoma, thereby suppressing metastasis and tumorigenesis (Lv2020RNAbinding; Han2019The). These interactions highlight SORBS2's role in both structural and regulatory cellular functions.
