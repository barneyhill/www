# CPSF3

## Overview
CPSF3, or Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor 3, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a crucial component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. This protein is categorized as a metallo-β-lactamase family member and functions as an endonuclease, playing a pivotal role in the 3' end processing of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) by cleaving them downstream of the AAUAAA site, a necessary step for polyadenylation. The CPSF3 protein is characterized by its metallo-β-lactamase and β-CASP domains, which are essential for its RNA processing activity, requiring zinc ions for its enzymatic function. Beyond its fundamental role in mRNA processing, CPSF3 is involved in histone pre-mRNA processing, alternative splicing, and polyadenylation, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular differentiation. Its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers and developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Huang2023CPSF3a; Arnadottir2022Populationlevel; Liu2024Modulation).

## Structure
CPSF3, also known as Cleavage And Polyadenylation Specificity Factor 3, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. The protein is composed of 684 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 73 kDa (Arnadottir2022Populationlevel). CPSF3 is characterized by the presence of two metallo-β-lactamase domains and a conserved β-CASP domain, which are typical of the metallo-β-lactamase family of zinc-dependent hydrolases (Arnadottir2022Populationlevel). The active site of CPSF3 is located at the interface of the metallo-β-lactamase and β-CASP domains, containing two zinc ions essential for its endonuclease activity (Ross2019CPSF3dependent).

The β-CASP domain is involved in controlling access to the active site, and mutations within this domain can significantly impact the protein's function (Arnadottir2022Populationlevel). Structural studies have shown that the binding of certain compounds can induce conformational changes in CPSF3, such as a rotation of the β-CASP domain relative to the metallo-β-lactamase domain, which affects RNA access to the active site (Ross2019CPSF3dependent). CPSF3 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
CPSF3, also known as cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 3, is a critical component of the CPSF complex, which is essential for the 3' end processing of precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) in human cells. This protein functions as an endonuclease, cleaving pre-mRNA just downstream of the AAUAAA site, a key step required for subsequent polyadenylation. This process is vital for mRNA stability, export from the nucleus, and translation into proteins (Arnadottir2022Populationlevel; Liu2024Modulation).

CPSF3 is part of the metallo-β-lactamase family and contains two metallo-β-lactamase domains and a conserved β-CASP domain, which are crucial for its RNA processing activity. The protein requires the presence of zinc ions at its active site to perform its endonuclease function effectively (Arnadottir2022Populationlevel; Liu2024Modulation).

In addition to its role in mRNA processing, CPSF3 is involved in histone pre-mRNA processing, acting as both an endonuclease and a 5′-3′ exonuclease. It also plays a role in alternative splicing and polyadenylation, influencing gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation processes (Chen2021Epidermal; Vivori2021Dynamics).

## Clinical Significance
CPSF3 is implicated in several diseases, particularly various cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CPSF3 expression is significantly higher in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its elevated levels are associated with poor prognosis, including shorter overall survival. CPSF3 promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis by modulating the balance between circular RNAs (circRNAs) and linear mRNAs, affecting downstream pathways crucial for cancer progression (Huang2023CPSF3a).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), CPSF3 is upregulated and correlates with poor patient outcomes. Its knockdown has been shown to block cell proliferation and tumor growth, highlighting its essential role in highly proliferative cells (Alahmari2024CPSF3).

CPSF3 is also overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where it serves as a prognostic biomarker linked to decreased survival times and shorter recurrence-free survival (Ning2019CPSF3).

Beyond cancer, CPSF3 mutations have been associated with a severe intellectual disability syndrome when certain missense variants are present in a homozygous state, indicating its critical role in development (Arnadottir2022Populationlevel).

## Interactions
CPSF3, a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to interact with the long non-coding RNA CASC9 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. This interaction is significant for regulating TGF-β signaling, as demonstrated by RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA-protein pull-down assays, which confirmed that CPSF3 is specifically pulled down by CASC9 affinity complexes (Luo2019LncRNA).

CPSF3 also plays a role in mRNA cleavage and the biogenesis of pro-miRNAs, including those in the miR-17-92 cluster, which is implicated in tumor angiogenesis. It binds to TGFβ2 mRNA, and its silencing results in faster decay of TGFβ2 mRNA, indicating that CPSF3 interferes with TGFβ2 mRNA turnover (Luo2019LncRNA).

In the context of alternative splicing, CPSF3 is involved in regulating exon inclusion and alternative polyadenylation sites. It has overlapping regulatory programs with hnRNP UL1, affecting exon inclusion and influencing splicing of internal exons independently of cleavage and polyadenylation (Vivori2021Dynamics).
