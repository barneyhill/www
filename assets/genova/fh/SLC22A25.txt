# SLC22A25

## Overview
SLC22A25 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 25, which is part of the organic anion transporter family. This protein is characterized by its 12 transmembrane α-helices, a structural feature that facilitates the transport of organic ions across cell membranes, a hallmark of the SLC22 family (Engelhart2020Systems; Jacobsson2007Identification). The protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is involved in the transport of conjugated sex hormones, indicating a specific substrate preference (Engelhart2020Systems). SLC22A25 has been implicated in genetic susceptibility to atrial fibrillation, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Yamada2017Identification). Further research is needed to explore its role in drug metabolism and other physiological processes (Nigam2018The; Yee2021Emerging).

## Structure
SLC22A25 is a member of the solute carrier family 22, characterized by its role as an organic anion transporter. The protein is predicted to have 12 transmembrane α-helices, a common feature among SLC22 family members, which facilitates its function in transporting organic ions across cell membranes (Engelhart2020Systems; Jacobsson2007Identification). The structure includes a large extracellular loop between the first and second transmembrane regions and a large intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane regions, which are typical of this family (Koepsell2013The). These loops may be involved in post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect the protein's function and regulation (Koepsell2013The).

SLC22A25 has a complex genomic structure with at least one additional splice variant, as suggested by the presence of an alternative exon between exons 8 and 9 (Jacobsson2007Identification). This indicates potential diversity in its isoforms, which could influence its molecular structure and function. The protein is part of the OATS4 subgroup, associated with the transport of conjugated sex hormones, suggesting a specific substrate preference (Engelhart2020Systems).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC22A25 gene has been identified as a novel susceptibility locus for atrial fibrillation (AF) in a Japanese population. An exome-wide association study (EWAS) found that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11231397 in SLC22A25 is significantly associated with AF, with the minor C allele being a risk factor for the condition. This SNP was associated with an odds ratio of 1.77, indicating a substantial increase in risk for individuals carrying this allele (Yamada2017Identification). The study suggests that genetic variations in SLC22A25 may contribute to the development of AF, highlighting the importance of genetic factors in the disease's etiology (Yamada2017Identification).

While the SLC22A25 gene is part of the larger solute carrier family involved in the transport of organic ions, specific diseases or conditions beyond AF associated with mutations or expression alterations in SLC22A25 have not been extensively documented. The gene's role in drug metabolism and disposition suggests potential implications for pharmacokinetics and drug resistance, but these aspects require further research to fully understand their clinical significance (Nigam2018The; Yee2021Emerging).
