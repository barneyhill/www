# EPDR1

## Overview
EPDR1, or ependymin related 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the ependymin-related protein family, which is involved in lipid metabolism and transport. The EPDR1 protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including a LolA-type fold and a deep hydrophobic groove, which facilitate its role in lipid binding and transport, particularly within lysosomes (Wei2019Crystal). It is primarily expressed in the brain and nervous system, suggesting a significant function in neuronal lipid catabolism (Wei2019Crystal). EPDR1 has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the modulation of lysosomal enzyme activity and the regulation of signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, where it acts as a tumor suppressor (Wei2019Crystal; Zhao2021EPDR1). Clinically, EPDR1 is associated with several diseases, including cancer and Dupuytren's disease, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Chu2018Prognostic; Dębniak2013Common).

## Structure
The EPDR1 protein, encoded by the human EPDR1 gene, exhibits a complex molecular structure characterized by several distinct features. The primary structure includes conserved sequence motifs such as QWEGR, EYIxL, and STRFFDL, which are crucial for its structural integrity (Wei2019Crystal). The secondary structure is dominated by an extended and twisted 11-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, divided into two subsheets connected by antiparallel hydrogen bonding (Wei2019Crystal).

The tertiary structure of EPDR1 is defined by a highly curved β-sheet fold, forming a shape reminiscent of a partially opened baseball glove. This structure includes a deep hydrophobic groove lined with hydrophobic residues and a single glycosylation site at Asn130, which is a common post-translational modification (Wei2019Crystal). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to an elongated, surface-exposed hydrophobic binding groove. The dimerization interface is primarily polar, consisting of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, and is unique within its superfamily (Wei2019Crystal).

EPDR1 is homologous to the LolA fold superfamily, sharing structural features with bacterial proteins like LolA and LolB, despite low sequence similarity (Wei2019Crystal). The protein's structure suggests a role in lipid metabolism or transport, particularly in neuronal tissues (Wei2019Crystal).

## Function
EPDR1 (ependymin related 1) is a protein that plays a significant role in lipid binding and transport within human cells. It is primarily localized in lysosomes and is involved in membrane binding, particularly in the presence of anionic lipids at acidic pH. This suggests a role in lipid degradation or transport, potentially functioning as a lysosomal activator protein or lipid transporter (Wei2019Crystal). EPDR1 is highly expressed in the brain and nervous system, indicating its importance in neuronal lipid catabolism, possibly acting as a sphingolipid activator protein similar to saposins (Wei2019Crystal).

The protein adopts a LolA-type fold, which is associated with lipid binding and transport, and features a long and deep ligand-binding groove. This structure allows EPDR1 to interact with lipid bilayers and potentially extract and solubilize target lipids (Wei2019Crystal). EPDR1 also modulates the activity of lysosomal enzymes, stimulating neuraminidase-3 (NEU3) and inhibiting neuraminidase-4 (NEU4), which are involved in the hydrolysis of sialic acids from gangliosides (Wei2019Crystal). These activities suggest a regulatory role in ganglioside and sulfatide processing, crucial for cellular recognition and neurotransmission (Wei2019Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
EPDR1 (ependymin related 1) has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), EPDR1 hypermethylation is associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and a better prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. This hypermethylation correlates with node negativity and lower tumor stage, indicating a role in inhibiting tumor invasion and progression (Chu2018Prognostic). Conversely, EPDR1 up-regulation in CRC is linked to tumor progression and metastasis, with higher expression levels correlating with advanced tumor stages and increased cell proliferation and invasiveness (GimenoValiente2020EPDR1).

In bladder carcinoma, EPDR1 expression is associated with tumor budding and advanced tumor stages, serving as a potential prognostic factor (Yang2022EPDR1). In epithelial ovarian cancer, EPDR1 is negatively regulated by miR-429 and suppresses cancer progression via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2021EPDR1).

EPDR1 is also linked to Dupuytren's disease, where certain genetic variants are associated with disease susceptibility, potentially through interactions with the WNT signaling pathway (Dębniak2013Common). These findings underscore the clinical significance of EPDR1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
EPDR1, a member of the ependymin-related protein family, primarily forms homodimers through extensive hydrophilic contacts, involving hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, as confirmed by structural studies (Wei2019Crystal). This dimerization is unique to the EPDR1 subfamily and has not been observed in other members of the LolA superfamily (Wei2019Crystal). EPDR1 interacts with membranes containing negatively charged lipids, such as BMP, under acidic conditions, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism or transport (Wei2019Crystal). 

In the context of cancer, EPDR1 has been shown to influence signaling pathways. In epithelial ovarian cancer, EPDR1 is negatively regulated by miR-429, which binds to its 3′-untranslated region, leading to decreased expression. This interaction affects the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, where EPDR1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting this pathway, thereby reducing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhao2021EPDR1). Although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, EPDR1's regulatory role in these pathways suggests potential interactions with components of these signaling networks.
