# ADK

## Overview
The ADK gene encodes the enzyme adenosine kinase, a critical component in cellular metabolism and regulation. Adenosine kinase is a kinase enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of adenosine to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), playing a pivotal role in the purine salvage pathway and maintaining intracellular adenosine levels. This regulation is essential for cellular energy balance and various physiological processes, including DNA methylation and transmethylation reactions. The enzyme exists in two isoforms, a cytoplasmic form (ADK-S) and a nuclear form (ADK-L), each with distinct functions related to adenosine metabolism and epigenetic modulation, respectively. Dysregulation of ADK expression or function is implicated in several neurological and hepatic disorders, as well as in cancer, highlighting its importance as a potential therapeutic target (Boison2013Adenosine; Zhulai2022Adenosine-Metabolizing; Murugan2021Adenosine).

## Structure
Adenosine kinase (ADK) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating adenosine levels by catalyzing the phosphorylation of adenosine to adenosine monophosphate. The primary structure of ADK consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of ADK is a compact, globular form, often featuring a Rossmann fold, which is common in nucleotide-binding proteins (Boison2021Adenosine).

ADK exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, producing a cytoplasmic isoform (ADK-S) and a nuclear isoform (ADK-L). These isoforms have distinct functions, with the nuclear isoform being linked to epigenetic modulation via transmethylation pathways (Boison2021Adenosine). The enzyme can exist as a monomer or dimer, indicating its quaternary structure.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect ADK's activity and stability. The enzyme's active site is characterized by specific interactions with inhibitors, such as π-π stacking interactions with Phe170 and hydrogen bonds with residues like Asn14 and Ser65, which are crucial for its function (Toti2016South).

## Function
Adenosine kinase (ADK) is a critical enzyme in human cells, primarily involved in the phosphorylation of adenosine to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), a key step in the purine salvage pathway. This process is essential for maintaining low intracellular adenosine levels, which is crucial for cellular energy balance and metabolic function (Boison2013Adenosine; Park2012Adenosine). ADK exists in two isoforms: a cytoplasmic form (ADK-S) and a nuclear form (ADK-L), each playing distinct roles in cellular metabolism. The cytoplasmic isoform is primarily involved in regulating adenosine levels and purine metabolism, while the nuclear isoform is associated with epigenetic regulation through DNA methylation processes (Boison2021Adenosine; Murugan2021Adenosine).

ADK's activity influences various physiological processes by modulating adenosine receptor activation and maintaining the balance of adenine nucleotides. It also plays a role in the regulation of transmethylation reactions by preventing the accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), a potent inhibitor of these reactions (Boison2013Adenosine; Xu2017Regulation). This regulation is vital for DNA methylation and other methylation-dependent processes, impacting cellular growth, development, and homeostasis (Boison2013Adenosine; Murugan2021Adenosine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADK gene are linked to several neurological and hepatic conditions. In humans, mutations in the ADK gene can disrupt the methionine cycle, leading to hypermethioninemia, severe liver pathology, developmental delays, encephalopathy, and epileptic seizures (Boison2013Adenosine; Zhulai2022Adenosine-Metabolizing). ADK deficiency is associated with epilepsy, cognitive impairments, and liver dysfunction, including conditions such as microvesicular steatosis and steatohepatitis (Staufner2015Adenosine; ElKharrag2019Adenosine).

Overexpression of ADK is linked to increased seizure susceptibility and is associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and astrocytic tumors (Boison2013Adenosine). In the context of cancer, ADK expression is dysregulated, with increased expression observed in glioma and colorectal cancer, while reduced expression is noted in hepatocellular carcinoma, correlating with cancer recurrence (Zhulai2022Adenosine-Metabolizing; Murugan2021Adenosine). ADK's role in cancer is linked to its influence on DNA methylation and adenosine metabolism, affecting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis (Murugan2021Adenosine). These findings highlight ADK's significant role in various diseases, making it a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Adenosine kinase (ADK) is known to participate in various protein-protein interactions that influence its activity and function. In the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani, ADK forms inactive aggregates at high concentrations, which can be disaggregated and reactivated by a cyclophilin from L. donovani. This interaction is mediated by a noncatalytic, isomerase-independent chaperone function of the cyclophilin, which facilitates the disaggregation of ADK even in the presence of cyclosporine A and macromolecular crowding agents (Boison2013Adenosine; Mukherjee2013Cyclophilinmediated).

In plants, ADK interacts with viral proteins such as AL2 and L2 from geminiviruses, which inhibit its activity. These proteins physically interact with ADK, leading to its inactivation both in vitro and in vivo, thereby affecting the host's antiviral defenses (Wang2003Adenosine). In wheat, the fungal effector PEC6 from stripe rust interacts with ADK, potentially suppressing plant defense mechanisms by inactivating ADK (Liu2016The).

These interactions highlight the role of ADK in various biological processes and its regulation by different proteins, which can modulate its activity in response to cellular and environmental changes.
