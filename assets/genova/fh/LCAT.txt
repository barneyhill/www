# LCAT

## Overview
The LCAT gene encodes the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, a critical component in lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as an α/β-hydrolase and is primarily responsible for the esterification of cholesterol in plasma, a process essential for the maturation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and the facilitation of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) (Manthei2018Molecular; Rousset2010Effect). Synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma, LCAT interacts predominantly with HDL, where it is activated by apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) (Mehta2021LCAT; Zhao2004Apolipoprotein). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and preventing cardiovascular diseases. Mutations in the LCAT gene can lead to disorders such as familial LCAT deficiency and fish-eye disease, which are characterized by altered lipid metabolism and associated clinical symptoms (Holleboom2011High; Fountoulakis2019The).

## Structure
The human lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) enzyme is composed of 416 amino acids, with a primary structure featuring a phenylalanine at the N-terminus and a glutamic acid at the C-terminus (Yang1987Lecithin:cholesterol). The secondary structure of LCAT includes approximately 21% alpha-helix and 24% beta-pleated sheet, with the remaining structure consisting of other forms such as beta-turns and random structures (Yang1987Lecithin:cholesterol). LCAT belongs to the α/β-hydrolase fold family, characterized by a central seven-strand beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices (Sensi2014Distant; Lima2004Lecithincholesterol).

The enzyme's tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, specifically between cysteine residues C50-C74 and C313-C356 (Segrest2015A). LCAT contains a catalytic triad composed of Ser181, Asp345, and His377, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Sensi2014Distant; Peelman1998A). The enzyme also features a lid domain, which is important for substrate interaction and is thought to open upon binding to a hydrophobic substrate (Sensi2014Distant).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation at asparagine residues, with identified sites at N20, N84, N272, and N384 (Yang1987Lecithin:cholesterol). These modifications are significant for LCAT's function, affecting protein folding, secretion, and activity (Lima2004Lecithincholesterol). The enzyme interacts with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, binding at the ApoA-I delimited boundary, which is crucial for its role in cholesterol metabolism (Manthei2020Structural).

## Function
The LCAT gene encodes the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, which plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the esterification of cholesterol in plasma. This process is essential for the maturation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, transforming them from discoidal pre-beta HDL to spherical alpha-HDL, which is critical for reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) (Manthei2018Molecular; Rousset2010Effect). LCAT transfers an acyl group from phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) to free cholesterol, forming cholesteryl esters that are sequestered in the hydrophobic core of HDL particles (Lima2004Lecithincholesterol; Manthei2020Structural).

LCAT is primarily synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma, where it associates with HDL and, to a lesser extent, with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (Mehta2021LCAT; Zhao2004Apolipoprotein). The enzyme's activity is activated by apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), which is the principal activator of LCAT on HDL particles (Lima2004Lecithincholesterol; Manthei2020Structural). LCAT's function is vital for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of cholesterol in tissues, which can lead to cardiovascular diseases (Vaisman2018LCAT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LCAT gene can lead to two primary clinical syndromes: familial LCAT deficiency (FLD) and fish-eye disease (FED). FLD is characterized by a complete loss of both α and β activity of the enzyme, resulting in symptoms such as corneal opacities, hemolytic anemia, and chronic kidney disease, which can progress to end-stage kidney disease (Fountoulakis2019The). FED involves corneal opacification and loss of α activity, but with preserved β activity (Fountoulakis2019The).

LCAT mutations are associated with low HDL cholesterol levels, contributing to conditions like atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and corneal opacification due to impaired LCAT activity and altered lipid metabolism (Holleboom2011High). The p.T147I mutation, prevalent in the Dutch population, is known to cause Fish Eye Disease in homozygotes (Holleboom2011High). The p274S mutation is linked to familial LCAT deficiency, with clinical manifestations including kidney function deterioration and increased cardiovascular events in homozygous individuals (Fountoulakis2019The).

LCAT deficiency can also lead to the accumulation of an abnormal lipoprotein called lipoprotein X (LpX), which is believed to cause characteristic kidney injury (Fountoulakis2019The). The Val309Met mutation in the LCAT gene results in familial LCAT deficiency, characterized by low HDL-cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels, with most plasma cholesterol present in the free form (IdziorWaluś2006Familial).

## Interactions
Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism by interacting with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. LCAT is activated by apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), which forms a double belt around HDL. This interaction is essential for LCAT's function in cholesterol esterification. LCAT binds preferentially to the edge of discoidal HDL near the boundary between helix 5 and 6 of ApoA-I, facilitating a pathway from the lipid bilayer to the active site of LCAT (Manthei2020Structural).

The interaction between LCAT and ApoA-I involves specific regions of ApoA-I, particularly helices 5, 6, and 7, which contain conserved charged amino acids that may form electrostatic interactions with LCAT. These interactions are crucial for LCAT binding and activation (SorciThomas2009Activation). The binding of LCAT to ApoA-I is influenced by the net negative charge of helix 6, which can attenuate LCAT activation (Alexander2005Apolipoprotein).

LCAT also interacts with lipid surfaces, and its binding is enhanced by specific ApoA-I derived peptides. These peptides, particularly those from the LCAT-activation region of ApoA-I, increase LCAT's affinity for lipid bilayers, suggesting a role in facilitating LCAT's interaction with lipid surfaces (Casteleijn2017Interaction).
