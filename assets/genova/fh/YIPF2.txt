# YIPF2

## Overview
YIPF2 is a gene that encodes the protein Yip1 domain family member 2, a transmembrane protein primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is integral to maintaining Golgi structure and function, particularly in the reassembly of the Golgi apparatus following disassembly. Yip1 domain family member 2 is involved in glycosylation processes and vesicular trafficking, interacting with various Rab GTPases to facilitate endomembrane trafficking and protein recycling. The protein's interactions with other YIPF family members, such as YIPF1 and YIPF6, are crucial for its stable expression and function within the Golgi apparatus. YIPF2 has clinical significance in cancer biology, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, where it influences cancer cell behavior and response to chemotherapy (Wang2020YIPF2; Qi2019YIPF2; Soonthornsit2017YIPF1).

## Structure
YIPF2 is a protein characterized by a specific molecular structure that includes a long soluble N-terminal region oriented towards the cytosol, followed by five closely stacked transmembrane domains (TMDs), and a C-terminus oriented towards the lumen of the Golgi (Kranjc2016Functional). The transmembrane domains are linked by short soluble linkers, which likely bring all the TMDs close together in the membrane (Kranjc2016Functional). The molecular size of YIPF2 was predicted to be 34 kDa based on its amino acid sequence, but it was estimated to be 43 kDa using western blotting, indicating post-translational modification, likely due to O-glycosylation (Soonthornsit2017YIPF1). YIPF2 is predicted to have five putative O-glycosylation sites in its cytoplasmic segment (Soonthornsit2017YIPF1).

YIPF2 forms complexes with other YIPF proteins, such as YIPF6, and these complexes are necessary for the stable expression of each other (Soonthornsit2017YIPF1). YIPF2 is part of a complex with YIPFα3 (YIPF6) in the late Golgi compartment, which may travel to endosomes (Shaik2019Characteristics). The protein's structure and interactions suggest it plays a role in vesicular trafficking and Golgi reassembly.

## Function
YIPF2 is a transmembrane protein primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), playing a crucial role in maintaining Golgi structure and function. It is involved in the reassembly of the Golgi apparatus after disassembly, as knockdown of YIPF2 delays this process (Soonthornsit2017YIPF1). YIPF2 is also implicated in glycan synthesis, with its knockdown leading to reduced intracellular glycans, highlighting its role in glycosylation processes (Soonthornsit2017YIPF1).

YIPF2 forms stable complexes with other YIPF proteins, such as YIPF1 and YIPF6, which are essential for its stable expression and localization within the Golgi apparatus (Soonthornsit2017YIPF1). It is associated with the trans-Golgi network and is involved in post-Golgi membrane trafficking, potentially affecting cargo transit through its interaction with endosomal Rab GTPases like Rab7A and Rab9A (Kranjc2016Functional).

YIPF2 also acts as a Rab-GDF (GDI-displacement factor), recruiting and activating Rab5 and Rab22a GTPases, which are crucial for endomembrane trafficking and the endocytic recycling of proteins such as CD147 (Qi2019YIPF2). This function is vital for the proper processing and transport of proteins within the cell, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
YIPF2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in vesicular trafficking and protein recycling. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), YIPF2 is highly expressed and is associated with the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells. It facilitates the endocytic recycling of CD147, a glycoprotein involved in cancer progression, by interacting with Rab GTPases such as Rab5 and Rab22a. Knockdown of YIPF2 leads to increased CD147 on the cell surface, promoting cancer cell invasion and migration, which are critical for HCC progression (Qi2019YIPF2). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), YIPF2 expression is linked to improved survival outcomes in patients undergoing chemotherapy. It enhances the recycling of TNFRSF10B, a receptor involved in apoptosis, to the plasma membrane, thereby promoting apoptosis in cancer cells. This process is crucial for the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents, as YIPF2 prevents the removal of TNFRSF10B from the plasma membrane, maintaining its apoptotic function (Wang2020YIPF2).

Alterations in YIPF2 expression or function can significantly impact cancer progression and treatment outcomes, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these cancers.

## Interactions
YIPF2 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in intracellular trafficking and membrane dynamics. It interacts with CD147, a glycoprotein involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis, primarily in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. This interaction is essential for the glycosylation and trafficking of CD147, with YIPF2 acting as a Rab-GDF (GDI-displacement factor) to regulate the recruitment and activation of Rab5 and Rab22a GTPases, which are involved in endomembrane trafficking (Qi2019YIPF2).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, YIPF2 interacts with TNFRSF10B, enhancing its recycling to the plasma membrane and promoting apoptosis. YIPF2 inhibits the interaction between TNFRSF10B and RAB8, preventing the removal of TNFRSF10B from the plasma membrane, which is crucial for its apoptotic function (Wang2020YIPF2).

YIPF2 also forms complexes with other YIPF family members, such as YIPF1 and YIPF6, within the Golgi apparatus. These interactions are important for Golgi reassembly and glycan synthesis, with YIPF6 being necessary for the stable expression of YIPF1 and YIPF2 (Soonthornsit2017YIPF1). Additionally, YIPF2 interacts with Rab proteins, including Rab5, Rab22a, and Rab8, influencing their membrane recruitment and activation (Angelotti2022Exploring).
