# YWHAE

## Overview
The YWHAE gene encodes the 14-3-3 epsilon protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in signal transduction. This protein is characterized by its ability to form dimers and bind to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins, thereby influencing their activity, localization, and stability. The 14-3-3 epsilon protein plays a pivotal role in neuronal development, where it is essential for proper neuronal migration and brain development, interacting with proteins such as NUDEL and LIS1. These interactions are crucial for maintaining normal neuronal structure and function, as evidenced by developmental defects observed in the absence of 14-3-3 epsilon. Beyond its role in neurodevelopment, YWHAE is implicated in various signaling pathways, including the RAF/MEK/MAPK and Hippo pathways, and is associated with oncogenic processes in cancers such as high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma and ovarian cancer. Clinically, mutations and alterations in YWHAE are linked to neurological disorders, including Miller-Dieker syndrome and 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome, underscoring its significance in both developmental and pathological contexts (Li2021YWHAE; Ou2021YWHAENUTM2; Toyooka20031433ε).

## Structure
The YWHAE gene encodes the 14-3-3 epsilon protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family involved in signal transduction. The protein typically forms dimers, which is a characteristic of its quaternary structure, allowing it to interact with a variety of target proteins (Covington2021Binding). The secondary structure of 14-3-3 epsilon includes alpha-helices, which contribute to its overall structural stability and function (Covington2021Binding). 

The protein features a conserved amphipathic groove that is crucial for binding phosphorylated serine/threonine residues, a common feature among 14-3-3 proteins that facilitates their role in cellular signaling pathways (Covington2021Binding). This groove allows the protein to interact with a wide range of phosphorylated peptides, highlighting its regulatory role in various cellular processes (Xu2019YWHA1433).

Post-translational modifications of the 14-3-3 epsilon protein include phosphorylation, which can influence its interaction with other proteins and its functional activity within the cell (Covington2021Binding). Despite the detailed understanding of its binding capabilities and interactions, specific information on the primary, tertiary structures, or splice variant isoforms of YWHAE is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The YWHAE gene encodes the 14-3-3ε protein, which is a member of the 14-3-3 protein family. These proteins are highly conserved and play crucial roles in various cellular processes by binding to phosphoserine/phosphothreonine motifs on target proteins. This binding influences the activity, localization, and stability of these proteins, impacting processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and stress responses (Toyooka20031433ε).

In the context of neuronal development, 14-3-3ε is essential for proper neuronal migration and brain development. It interacts with proteins like NUDEL, LIS1, and β-COP, which are involved in neuronal migration. The protein stabilizes phosphorylated NUDEL, protecting it from dephosphorylation, which is crucial for the dynein motor function and the LIS1 pathway that regulates nuclear movement and neuronal migration (Toyooka20031433ε).

The absence of 14-3-3ε leads to significant developmental defects, particularly in the hippocampus and cortex, as seen in mouse models. These defects are associated with disorganized pyramidal cell layers and cortical thinning, highlighting the protein's role in maintaining normal neuronal structure and function (Toyooka20031433ε).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the YWHAE gene, which encodes the 14-3-3ε protein, are associated with several neurological disorders. The gene is implicated in Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a condition characterized by severe lissencephaly, facial anomalies, and other malformations, often fatal in early childhood. Deletions in the 17p13.3 region, including YWHAE, contribute to the severity of the lissencephaly phenotype observed in MDS (Toyooka20031433ε). 

YWHAE is also involved in 17p13.3 microduplication syndrome, which is associated with developmental defects such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, and physical malformations. Overexpression of YWHAE is linked to defects in neuronal morphogenesis, including neurite and spine formation, which are associated with ASD (Blazejewski2018Neurodevelopmental; Liu2021Responsible). 

In addition, alterations in YWHAE expression have been observed in schizophrenia cases, suggesting a broader role in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (Liu2021Responsible). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its critical role in neuronal migration and cortical development, with disruptions leading to significant clinical manifestations.

## Interactions
YWHAE, also known as 14-3-3 epsilon, is a protein that participates in various interactions influencing cellular processes. It is part of the 14-3-3 protein family, which is known for its role in signal transduction by binding to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins. YWHAE interacts with several key proteins, including RAF1 and BRAF, as part of the RAF/MEK/MAPK signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation, particularly in high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS) (Ou2021YWHAENUTM2).

YWHAE also interacts with YAP and TAZ, components of the Hippo signaling pathway, contributing to the regulation of cell proliferation and viability. These interactions are significant in the context of oncogenic mechanisms, as they lead to the dysregulation of pathways that promote cancer cell growth (Ou2021YWHAENUTM2).

In ovarian cancer, YWHAE interacts with HE4, influencing cancer cell behavior through the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. This interaction enhances cell invasion, migration, and proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Li2021YWHAE).
