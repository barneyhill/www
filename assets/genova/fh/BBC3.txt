# BBC3

## Overview
BBC3, also known as BCL2 binding component 3 or PUMA (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis), is a gene that encodes a pro-apoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2 protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, primarily by promoting mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which is a critical step in the apoptotic process. The BBC3 protein functions as a BH3-only protein, interacting with anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family to facilitate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, thereby activating the caspase cascade essential for cell death (Vo2010BH3Only; Nakano2001PUMA). BBC3 is a key mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis, responding to cellular stress signals such as DNA damage and oncogene activation, and is tightly regulated by transcription factors, including p53 (Bekampytė2021The; Liu2017BBC3). Its dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Tajnik2012BBC3; Fiori2018miR663).

## Function
The BBC3 gene, also known as BCL2 binding component 3 or PUMA, encodes a pro-apoptotic protein that plays a critical role in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. This protein is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it promotes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, leading to the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspases, which are crucial steps in the execution of apoptosis (Bekampytė2021The; Liu2017BBC3).

BBC3/PUMA is a significant mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis, responding to various cellular stress signals, including DNA damage and oncogene activation. It is involved in the regulation of BAX activation, a process that is essential for the apoptotic response to oxidative stress and other apoptotic stimuli (Belle2016Repression; Liu2017BBC3). In healthy cells, BBC3/PUMA helps maintain cellular homeostasis by ensuring the removal of damaged or stressed cells, thus preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful cells that could lead to diseases such as cancer (Belle2016Repression).

The protein's activity is tightly regulated by transcription factors, including p53, which upregulates BBC3 expression in response to stress signals, ensuring that apoptosis is appropriately triggered when necessary (Bekampytė2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BBC3 gene, also known as PUMA, have been implicated in various cancers. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), BBC3 expression is down-regulated with increased tumor size, particularly in larger tumors classified as T3 and T4. This down-regulation occurs independently of p53 expression, suggesting that BBC3 could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in HNSCC (Tajnik2012BBC3). The gene is located in the 19q region, which is frequently deleted in HNSCC tumors, and loss of heterozygosity has been observed in a significant percentage of HNSCC cell lines (Tajnik2012BBC3).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), miR-663 has been identified as a potential oncogene that negatively regulates BBC3, leading to reduced apoptosis. The depletion of miR-663 results in the upregulation of BBC3, promoting mitochondrial cell death even in p53-null cell lines. This suggests that targeting miR-663 could be a therapeutic approach in NSCLC by restoring BBC3-mediated apoptosis (Fiori2018miR663).

In hematopoiesis, BBC3 is a critical mediator of p53-driven apoptosis. Its expression is repressed by MYSM1, an epigenetic regulator essential for the survival of hematopoietic multipotent progenitors. In the absence of MYSM1, increased BBC3 expression leads to apoptosis and hematopoietic dysfunction (Belle2016Repression).

## Interactions
BBC3, also known as PUMA, is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family that plays a crucial role in apoptosis through its interactions with other proteins. It interacts with anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by binding to their BH3 domains, which promotes apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria (Vo2010BH3Only; Nakano2001PUMA). This interaction is central to the regulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as it facilitates the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK, leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and the activation of the caspase cascade (Roufayel2016Regulation; Chen2020MiR2223p).

BBC3 is also a target of the p53 tumor-suppressor protein, which induces its expression. This induction is crucial for mediating p53-induced apoptosis through the cytochrome c/Apaf-1-dependent pathway (Nakano2001PUMA). Additionally, BBC3 can interact with other BH3-only proteins, such as Bim and Bid, to directly activate BAX and BAK, further promoting apoptosis (Roufayel2016Regulation). These interactions highlight BBC3's significant role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Vo2010BH3Only).
