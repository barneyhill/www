# BPIFA3

## Overview
BPIFA3 is a gene that encodes the protein BPI fold containing family A member 3, which is part of the BPI fold-containing family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their structural motif known as the BPI fold, which is involved in lipid binding and antimicrobial activity. The BPIFA3 protein is implicated in various biological processes, including host defense mechanisms and inflammation. It is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, where it may play a role in the innate immune response by interacting with microbial components. The precise functions and mechanisms of BPIFA3 remain an active area of research, with ongoing studies aiming to elucidate its role in health and disease.
