# SPRR5

## Overview
SPRR5, or small proline-rich protein 5, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of epidermal differentiation and homeostasis. The protein is categorized as a structural component of the epidermis, playing a pivotal role in keratinocyte differentiation, which is crucial for maintaining the skin's protective barrier. SPRR5 is part of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) and is involved in the expression of gene clusters related to skin differentiation, such as the small proline-rich region (SPRR) and late cornified envelope (LCE) genes (Ziegler2019The). The expression of SPRR5 is tightly regulated, with minimal levels in non-differentiated keratinocytes and significant upregulation during the late stages of epidermal differentiation (Ziegler2019The). The gene is regulated by the transcription factor p63 and is influenced by the long non-coding RNA LINC00941, which modulates its expression to prevent premature differentiation (Ziegler2019The).

## Function
SPRR5 (small proline-rich protein 5) plays a crucial role in human epidermal differentiation and homeostasis. It is a key regulator of keratinocyte differentiation, a process essential for maintaining the skin's protective barrier. SPRR5 expression is minimal in non-differentiated keratinocytes but increases significantly during epidermal differentiation, reaching its peak at the late stages (Ziegler2019The). The protein is involved in the regulation of both early and late differentiation genes, and its depletion leads to decreased expression of these markers, indicating its essential role in promoting proper keratinocyte differentiation (Ziegler2019The).

SPRR5 is located within the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) and is involved in controlling the expression of the small proline-rich region (SPRR) and late cornified envelope (LCE) differentiation gene clusters (Ziegler2019The). It operates downstream of the long non-coding RNA LINC00941, which represses premature differentiation by inhibiting SPRR5 (Ziegler2019The). The transcription factor p63 is a strong regulator of SPRR5 expression, and its knockdown results in a significant reduction of SPRR5 transcript abundance, highlighting the gene's regulation by p63 (Ziegler2019The).
