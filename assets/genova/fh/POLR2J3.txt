# POLR2J3

## Overview
POLR2J3 is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase II subunit J3, a component of the RNA polymerase II enzyme complex, which is essential for the transcription of DNA into messenger RNA in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by POLR2J3 is categorized as a subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex, playing a critical role in the transcription machinery by interacting with other subunits and transcription factors to facilitate gene expression. The gene's expression and its protein product have been implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, cell cycle regulation, and metabolism, and have been identified as significant in the context of certain cancers, such as laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and testicular germ cell tumors (Shematorova2013Novel; Zheng2023Identification). The clinical significance of POLR2J3, particularly its potential as a prognostic biomarker, underscores the importance of further research to elucidate its role in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target (Yao2021RNABinding; Glodzik2020Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
POLR2J3 has been identified as a significant prognostic biomarker in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). High expression levels of POLR2J3 are associated with a lower survival rate in LSCC patients, and its expression is notably higher in metastatic tissues compared to non-metastatic ones. This suggests that POLR2J3 may play a role in LSCC development through pathways related to DNA replication, cell cycle, and metabolism (Zheng2023Identification). 

In testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), POLR2J3 is part of a prognostic model that predicts disease-free survival. Alterations in its expression are associated with the prognosis of TGCT, indicating its potential role in the disease's progression (Yao2021RNABinding).

POLR2J3 has also been identified as one of the differentially expressed genes in the context of BRCA1 hypermethylated and BRCA1-null triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). However, the specific clinical implications of this finding require further investigation (Glodzik2020Comprehensive).

Overall, POLR2J3's involvement in various cancers highlights its potential as a molecular marker and therapeutic target, although more research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.

## Interactions
POLR2J3, a subunit of RNA polymerase II, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in transcription. The isoforms of the hRPB11 subunit, which include POLR2J3, have been shown to interact with several nuclear RNA polymerase subunits such as hRPB3, hRPB6, and hRPC40, as well as transcription factors like ATF4, ART 27, and BTF3. These interactions suggest a role in forming distinct transcription complexes and coordinating transcription with subsequent steps of gene expression (Shematorova2013Novel).

In the context of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), POLR2J3 has been identified as a significant prognostic marker, with its expression being higher in metastatic tissues. Although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed, POLR2J3 is implicated in pathways related to DNA replication, cell cycle, and metabolism, indicating its involvement in complex regulatory networks (Zheng2023Identification).

Despite its potential interactions, the specific binding of POLR2J3 with other proteins or nucleic acids has not been extensively detailed in the available literature. The gene's role in transcription and its association with various cellular processes highlight its importance in gene expression regulation (Shematorova2020Current).
