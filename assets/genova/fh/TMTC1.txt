# TMTC1

## Overview
TMTC1 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane O-mannosyltransferase targeting cadherins 1, which is a member of the GT-C/PMT clan of transmembrane proteins. This protein is primarily involved in the O-mannosylation pathway, a crucial post-translational modification process that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). TMTC1 is characterized by its 11 transmembrane regions and a C-terminal TPR domain, which facilitate its role as an O-mannosyltransferase targeting cadherins and integrins (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). The protein's enzymatic activity is essential for cellular processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and invasion, particularly in the context of cancer, where it influences the glycosylation of integrins β1 and β4 (Yeh2023TMTC1). TMTC1's function is further modulated by its interaction with dolichyl-phosphate-mannose and divalent metal ions, which are critical for its catalytic activity (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). The gene's expression and mutations have been implicated in various diseases, including schizophrenia and ovarian cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Yeh2023TMTC1; Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

## Structure
TMTC1 is a protein characterized by its involvement in O-mannosylation, a type of glycosylation. The protein is part of the GT-C/PMT clan and is homologous to membrane-bound sugar transferases, sharing structural similarities with arabinosyl-, oligosaccharyl-, or mannosyltransferases (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). TMTC1 contains 11 transmembrane regions in its N-terminal segment, with the C-terminal TPR domain located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

The protein's structure includes conserved sequence motifs that are crucial for its function. These motifs are involved in ligand binding and metal ion coordination, with specific motifs such as M4 and M5 coordinating metal ions, and M2 and M3 interacting with mannose (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). The presence of a divalent metal ion, likely zinc, is essential for catalysis (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

TMTC1 is also associated with post-translational modifications, particularly O-mannosylation, which affects its interaction with protein substrates like integrins β1 and β4, influencing cell migration and invasion in ovarian cancer (Yeh2023TMTC1). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by its evolutionary conserved sequence motifs, which are rationalized as ligand binding sites (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

## Function
TMTC1 is a transmembrane protein involved in the O-mannosylation pathway, a critical post-translational modification process that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is part of the TMTC family, which includes TMTC2, TMTC3, and TMTC4, and is characterized by its role as an O-mannosyltransferase, specifically targeting cadherins and integrins (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). TMTC1 is involved in the glycosylation of integrins β1 and β4, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling pathways. This modification enhances cell-laminin adhesion, influencing cell migration and invasion, particularly in the context of cancer (Yeh2023TMTC1).

In healthy human cells, TMTC1's activity is essential for maintaining cellular communication and structural organization. It plays a significant role in intracellular calcium homeostasis and the ER stress response, contributing to the unfolded protein response (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). The protein's function is facilitated by its location in the ER, where it interacts with dolichyl-phosphate-mannose (DPM) and divalent metal ions, essential for its enzymatic activity (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). These interactions are crucial for the stability and function of proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion, impacting tissue integrity and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the TMTC1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. TMTC1 is associated with schizophrenia through genome-wide association studies, indicating its potential role in neurological disorders (Eisenhaber2021Conserved). Additionally, TMTC1 is differentially expressed in inflammatory bowel disease-linked arthritis, suggesting its involvement in inflammatory conditions (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).

In the context of cancer, TMTC1 is significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer, particularly in serous type ovarian adenocarcinomas, and is associated with poorer prognosis. High TMTC1 expression correlates with poor survival outcomes, making it an independent prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. TMTC1 promotes cell viability, migration, and invasion, contributing to the aggressiveness of the disease (Yeh2023TMTC1). The gene enhances the O-mannosylation of integrins β1 and β4, which are crucial for cell adhesion and migration, further promoting invasiveness and metastasis in ovarian cancer (Yeh2023TMTC1).

TMTC1's role in modifying integrin activity through glycosylation, specifically O-mannosylation, is critical for the invasive properties of ovarian cancer cells, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yeh2023TMTC1). The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its clinical significance in both neurological and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
TMTC1 is involved in interactions with integrins β1 and β4, which are crucial for cell adhesion and migration. These interactions are significant in the context of ovarian cancer, where TMTC1 promotes the invasiveness of cancer cells. TMTC1 modifies the O-mannosylation of integrins β1 and β4, enhancing their activity and leading to increased cell-ECM adhesion. This modification is specific to integrins β1 and β4, as TMTC1 does not significantly affect the O-mannosylation of integrins α3 and α6 (Yeh2023TMTC1).

The study by Yeh et al. demonstrated that TMTC1 overexpression increases the association of integrin α6 and β1, while its knockdown decreases this association. This suggests that TMTC1 plays a role in modulating integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration, contributing to the aggressive behavior of ovarian cancer cells (Yeh2023TMTC1).

TMTC1 is also identified as an O-mannosyltransferase that interacts with dolichyl-phosphate-mannose (DPM) and divalent metal ions, as part of its enzymatic activity. The structural modeling of TMTC1 suggests that it shares conserved sequence motifs with other sugar transferases, which are crucial for binding interactions with ligands such as DPM (Eisenhaber2021Conserved).
