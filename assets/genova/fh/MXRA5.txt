# MXRA5

## Overview
MXRA5 is a gene that encodes the matrix remodeling-associated protein 5, which is a key component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, and plays a significant role in tissue repair and homeostasis. MXRA5 is particularly noted for its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, which contribute to maintaining tissue integrity and normal cellular function. It is highly expressed in the kidney and is implicated in the regulation of inflammation and fibrosis. In the context of cancer, MXRA5 is associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the activation of signaling pathways such as PI3K-Akt-mTOR, which are crucial for cancer progression. The protein's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker in various diseases, including non-small cell lung carcinoma and pancreatic cancer (Yoshida2023Public; Peng2023Identification; Poveda2016MXRA5).

## Structure


## Function
The MXRA5 gene encodes a protein known as matrix remodeling-associated protein 5, which plays a significant role in various cellular and molecular processes. In healthy human cells, MXRA5 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and migration, particularly in dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). It is crucial for maintaining the proliferative and migratory abilities of these cells by influencing the expression of cell cycle-related genes and activating MAPK pathways, such as ERK1/2 and JNK, which are essential for cell signaling and proliferation (Yoshida2023Public).

MXRA5 is also associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. It is up-regulated in response to TGF-β1, a fibrogenic cytokine, suggesting a role in limiting fibrogenic responses and maintaining normal cellular function by modulating inflammatory and fibrotic responses (Poveda2016MXRA5). The protein is highly expressed in the kidney and is involved in the regulation of inflammation and fibrosis, contributing to the protection of tissue integrity (Poveda2016MXRA5).

Overall, MXRA5 is a key extracellular matrix protein that contributes to tissue repair and homeostasis by regulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation, as well as modulating inflammatory responses in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The MXRA5 gene is implicated in various diseases, primarily through its role in extracellular matrix remodeling. In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), MXRA5 is frequently mutated, particularly among Chinese patients, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor. These mutations are often found in highly conserved protein domains and may contribute to tumor migration and metastasis (He2015Matrixremodeling; Xiong2012Exome). High MXRA5 expression in NSCLC is associated with poor prognosis and is considered an independent prognostic marker (He2015Matrixremodeling).

In kidney diseases, MXRA5 expression is up-regulated in conditions such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy, and lupus nephritis. This up-regulation is linked to its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties, suggesting a protective role against kidney inflammation and fibrosis (Poveda2016MXRA5).

MXRA5 is also involved in pancreatic cancer, where its overexpression promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activates the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, contributing to cancer progression (Peng2023Identification). In breast cancer, MXRA5 is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to tumor metastasis, serving as a potential marker for disease progression (Deng2024Singlecell). These findings highlight MXRA5's significant role in cancer development and progression across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
MXRA5 is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer and tissue remodeling. In pancreatic cancer, MXRA5 is implicated in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. It promotes EMT by modulating the expression of transcription factors such as Zeb1, Zeb2, Twist, and Slug, and affects EMT markers by downregulating E-Cadherin and upregulating N-Cadherin and vimentin. MXRA5 also enhances the phosphorylation of Akt and S6, which are key components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, crucial for cancer progression. This activation may occur through focal adhesion kinase (FAK), as MXRA5 silencing inhibits FAK phosphorylation, and FAK inhibition reduces Akt-S6 phosphorylation (Peng2023Identification).

In dental pulp stem cells, MXRA5 is involved in activating MAPK pathways, specifically ERK1/2 and JNK, which are essential for cell proliferation. Suppression of MXRA5 leads to decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38, indicating its role in these signaling pathways. MXRA5 contains Ig-like domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, potentially acting as ligands for unknown receptors or competing with other ligands (Yoshida2023Public).
