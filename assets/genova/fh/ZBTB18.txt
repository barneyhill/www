# ZBTB18

## Overview
ZBTB18 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 18, a transcriptional repressor involved in critical biological processes, particularly in the development of the mammalian brain and immune system. The protein is characterized by a BTB domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and multiple C2H2 zinc finger domains that enable specific DNA binding. ZBTB18 plays a pivotal role in neuronal differentiation and migration, as well as in B-cell activation and plasma cell differentiation. It acts as a tumor suppressor, notably in glioblastoma and colorectal cancer, by interacting with various proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes to regulate gene expression. Mutations in the ZBTB18 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and developmental delays, highlighting its significance in both normal development and disease (Depienne2017Genetic; Ferrarese2020ZBTB18; Cohen2016Further).

## Structure
ZBTB18 is a transcription factor characterized by a BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain at the N-terminus and multiple C2H2 zinc finger domains towards the C-terminus. The BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, facilitating homodimerization and interactions with corepressors, which are crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor (Mance2024Dynamic). The zinc finger domains are responsible for binding specific DNA sequences, with ZBTB18 optimally binding to the sequence 5′-[A/C]ACANCTG[G/T][A/C]-3′ (Blake2021StructureBased).

The BTB domain of ZBTB18 has been crystallized, revealing a structure in the I41 space group at 4.15 Å resolution. This structure includes eight BTB molecules forming two tetramers, which further interact to form a helical filament (Mance2024Dynamic). The filamentation of the BTB domain is concentration-dependent and resembles the topology of ZBTB8A-like filaments (Mance2024Dynamic). A serine residue at position 103 is crucial for filamentation, and its substitution with arginine disrupts this process, highlighting its importance in the protein's structural integrity (Mance2024Dynamic).

The linker region between the BTB and zinc finger domains is intrinsically disordered and contains potential sites for posttranslational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which may contribute to gene repression (Mance2024Dynamic).

## Function
The ZBTB18 gene encodes a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor, playing a crucial role in various biological processes, particularly in the development of the mammalian brain and immune system. In the brain, ZBTB18 is involved in neuronal differentiation, migration, and positioning, essential for proper brain development and function. It regulates the expression of genes necessary for the transition of neurons from multipolar to bipolar states, which is critical for neuronal migration and cortical organization (hemming2020understanding). ZBTB18 acts as a repressor of the RND2 gene, influencing the radial migration of cortical neurons and maintaining the balance of neurogenesis pathways (hemming2020understanding).

In the immune system, ZBTB18 functions as a transcriptional repressor during B-cell activation and plasma cell differentiation, interacting with DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) to repress target genes (hemming2020understanding). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA through its zinc finger domains, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression patterns necessary for proper tissue development and neural circuit formation (hemming2020understanding; Blake2021StructureBased).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZBTB18 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, primarily intellectual disability (ID) and developmental delays. Patients with ZBTB18 mutations often exhibit global developmental delay, microcephaly, and craniofacial dysmorphism. Neuroimaging frequently reveals structural brain abnormalities, such as hypoplasia or agenesis of the corpus callosum (Cohen2016Further; Ehmke2017A). ZBTB18 is a critical gene in the 1q43q44 microdeletion syndrome, where its haploinsufficiency contributes to the syndrome's neurodevelopmental phenotype (Depienne2017Genetic).

De novo missense and truncating variants in ZBTB18 can lead to loss of function, often resulting in intellectual disability with variable features. These mutations can disrupt DNA binding and transcriptional repression, potentially having dominant-negative effects (Hemming2020General; Cohen2016Further). In some cases, ZBTB18 mutations are associated with epilepsy and other neurological symptoms, although the severity and specific manifestations can vary (Depienne2017Genetic).

In addition to its role in neurodevelopmental disorders, ZBTB18 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer. Its expression is often silenced through promoter hypermethylation, and reintroduction of ZBTB18 can suppress tumor growth by inducing apoptosis and reducing cell invasion (Bazzocco2021Identification).

## Interactions
ZBTB18, also known as ZNF238, is a transcriptional repressor that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in glioblastoma. It interacts with CTBP1 and CTBP2 through a specific VLDLS motif, which is crucial for its function in repressing target genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration (Ferrarese2020ZBTB18; Ferrarese2022ZBTB18). ZBTB18's interaction with CTBP2 is particularly important in regulating the expression of SREBP genes, which are involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. This interaction affects the dynamics of the CTBP2 complex, promoting the recruitment of other proteins such as ZNF217 and LSD1 to SREBP gene promoters, thereby inhibiting LSD1's demethylase activity (Ferrarese2022ZBTB18).

ZBTB18 also interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences or recruiting co-repressors. It has been shown to recruit a repressive CTBP-LSD1-ZNF217 complex to SREBP gene promoters, inhibiting fatty acid synthesis (Ferrarese2020ZBTB18). These interactions highlight ZBTB18's role as a tumor suppressor, counteracting the oncogenic effects of CTBP2 in glioblastoma (Chen2020CtBP2).
