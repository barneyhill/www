# HRH4

## Overview
The HRH4 gene encodes the histamine receptor H4 (H4R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is primarily expressed in immune cells such as eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils. As a transmembrane receptor, H4R plays a crucial role in mediating immune responses, particularly in allergic reactions and inflammation. The receptor is involved in processes such as eosinophil chemotaxis and cytokine production, which are essential for the recruitment and activation of immune cells at sites of inflammation (Jemima2014Functional; Ling2004Histamine). The HRH4 gene's expression and function have been linked to various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, including asthma and Meniere's disease, as well as certain cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Nicoud2019Pathophysiological; Simon2012Asthma).

## Structure
The HRH4 gene encodes the histamine H4 receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by seven transmembrane alpha-helices connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops. The N-terminal tail is located extracellularly, while the C-terminal tail is intracellular (Nijmeijer2012Molecular). The HRH4 receptor shares several conserved structural motifs typical of class A (rhodopsin-like) GPCRs, including specific conserved residues such as Asn 1.50, Asp 2.50, Arg 3.50, Trp 4.50, Pro 5.50, Pro 6.50, and Pro 7.50 (Nijmeijer2012Molecular).

A disulfide bridge is presumed to connect transmembrane helix 3 and the extracellular loop 2. The N-terminal tail contains asparagines involved in post-translational glycosylation, and the C-terminal tail may be anchored to the cell membrane through palmitoylation (Nijmeijer2012Molecular). The HRH4 receptor also features an intracellular helix 8 that does not span the cell membrane (Nijmeijer2012Molecular).

In terms of quaternary structure, HRH4 forms higher-order assemblies, including dimers and oligomers, which are constitutively formed and not modulated by agonists or antagonists. These oligomers do not require post-translational N-glycosylation for formation, although glycosylation may stabilize the complex (Nijmeijer2012Molecular). HRH4 can form both homo- and heteromeric complexes, and its oligomers are localized at the cell surface (Nijmeijer2012Molecular).

## Function
The HRH4 gene encodes the histamine H4 receptor (H4R), a G-protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in immune cells such as eosinophils, mast cells, and basophils. This receptor plays a significant role in mediating immune responses, particularly in the context of allergic reactions and inflammation. The H4 receptor is involved in eosinophil chemotaxis, a process where eosinophils migrate towards higher concentrations of histamine, which is crucial for their recruitment to sites of inflammation (Ling2004Histamine; O’Reilly2002IDENTIFICATION).

Histamine binding to the H4 receptor induces eosinophil shape change and upregulation of adhesion molecules like CD11b/CD18 and CD54, facilitating their movement and adhesion during immune responses (Ling2004Histamine). The receptor also mediates calcium responses and cytokine production in mast cells, contributing to the release of inflammatory mediators such as cysteinyl leukotrienes and various cytokines, which are important in the pathogenesis of conditions like asthma (Jemima2014Functional).

The H4 receptor's activity is primarily localized to the cell membrane, where it interacts with histamine to trigger downstream signaling pathways that modulate immune cell behavior and inflammatory responses (Thurmond2015The).

## Clinical Significance
The HRH4 gene, encoding the histamine receptor H4, is implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Alterations in HRH4 expression or function have been associated with asthma, particularly in its endophenotypes such as infection-induced asthma and allergic rhinitis. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HRH4 gene, like rs487202 and rs527790, have shown significant associations with these conditions, suggesting a role in asthma pathogenesis (Simon2012Asthma).

In addition to asthma, HRH4 gene polymorphisms have been linked to Meniere's disease, a vestibular disorder. The rs77485247 polymorphism is associated with increased risk and severity of symptoms, potentially through its influence on cytokine levels (Qin2019Histamine).

HRH4 expression is also relevant in cancer. Reduced expression levels have been observed in various cancers, including breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. In these contexts, HRH4 may influence tumor growth and immune response, making it a potential therapeutic target (Nicoud2019Pathophysiological). The receptor's involvement in modulating immune functions highlights its significance in both inflammatory diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
The histamine H4 receptor (HRH4) is known to engage in various interactions with other proteins, influencing its function and stability. HRH4 can form higher-order structures such as dimers and oligomers in both native and transfected cells. These complexes can be homo- or heteromeric, and their formation is not influenced by agonists or antagonists (Nijmeijer2012Molecular). HRH4 also interacts with G-proteins, specifically coupling to pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi proteins in mammalian cells, which is crucial for its role in mediating histamine-induced chemotaxis (Ma2021Identification; Schneider2009High). 

The receptor's interaction with GRi2 and Gβ1γ2 proteins affects its stability and activity, with GRi2 having a stabilizing effect on HRH4 (Schneider2009High). HRH4 also recruits β-arrestin 2 upon agonist binding, which initiates MAPK cascade activation and receptor desensitization (Schirmer2021The). Additionally, HRH4 can form heteromeric complexes with other histamine receptors, such as H1R, although these are typically observed at high expression levels and may result from random interactions (Nijmeijer2012Molecular). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing HRH4 function and its role in immune responses.
