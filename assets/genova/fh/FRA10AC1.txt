# FRA10AC1

## Overview
FRA10AC1 is a gene that encodes the FRA10A associated CGG repeat 1 protein, which is a nuclear protein involved in the spliceosome, a complex essential for RNA processing. This protein plays a critical role in pre-mRNA splicing, a process vital for proper gene expression, and is implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases when mutated (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). The FRA10AC1 protein interacts with several spliceosomal components, such as ESS2 and CWC27, indicating its involvement in spliceosome assembly and function (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). It is part of the catalytically active spliceosomal B-activated and C complexes, as well as the post-catalytic complex P, suggesting its participation in various stages of the splicing process (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). The gene is widely expressed in human tissues, including the brain, where it is co-expressed with other spliceosomal proteins, highlighting its potential role in neural tissue function (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction).

## Function
The FRA10AC1 gene encodes a nuclear protein that is a peripheral component of the spliceosome, a complex essential for RNA processing. This protein is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process for proper gene expression, and is linked to neurodevelopmental diseases when mutated (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). FRA10AC1 interacts with several spliceosomal proteins, including ESS2, CWC27, and ZNF830, indicating its role in spliceosome assembly and function (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). 

The protein is part of the catalytically active spliceosomal B-activated and C complexes, as well as the post-catalytic complex P, suggesting its involvement in various stages of the splicing process (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). FRA10AC1 is also implicated in the interconnection of splicing with transcription mechanisms and mRNA export, indicating broader roles in cell pathophysiology (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). The gene is widely expressed in human tissues, including the brain, where it is co-expressed with other spliceosomal proteins, suggesting functional cooperation in neural tissues (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). The protein's proper function is crucial for maintaining normal cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FRA10AC1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Biallelic pathogenic variants in FRA10AC1 have been linked to severe neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, craniofacial abnormalities, and corpus callosum defects, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction). The gene's expression is affected by the expansion of a polymorphic (CGG) repeat, leading to hypermethylation and gene silencing, which is associated with intellectual disability and developmental delay (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction).

FRA10AC1 is also implicated in Alzheimer's disease, with genetic variations in the gene influencing cerebrospinal fluid Aβ 1-42 levels, a biomarker for the disease. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs10509663 and rs116953792 have been identified as significantly associated with these biomarker levels, suggesting a role in disease susceptibility (Li2015Variations).

In glioma, FRA10AC1 is part of an m6A methylation-related prognostic signature, indicating its potential role in cancer prognosis. However, its precise function in glioma and its involvement in RNA methylation remain unclear (Dong2022Identification).

## Interactions
The FRA10AC1 protein is involved in various interactions within the spliceosome, a complex crucial for RNA processing. It interacts with several spliceosomal proteins, including SF3B2, a core spliceosomal subunit, and ESS2, a non-core spliceosomal protein. These interactions were initially suggested by large-scale yeast two-hybrid matrix screening and further validated through GST pull-down assays, which demonstrated that a full-length FRA10AC1-GST-fused protein could pull down in vitro translated ESS2 or SF3B2, indicating direct interaction (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction).

In HeLa cells, endogenous FRA10AC1 was shown to co-precipitate with ESS2, confirming their in vivo interaction. However, the interaction between endogenous FRA10AC1 and SF3B2 was not detected, suggesting that FRA10AC1 may not participate in the recognition of the intron branch point through the SF3b multiprotein complex, or that the interaction was weak or not detectable under the experimental conditions (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction).

FRA10AC1 is part of the catalytically active spliceosomal B-activated and C complexes, as well as the post-catalytic complex P. It shares expression profiles with proteins like ESS2, CWC27, and ZNF830, suggesting co-regulation and functional associations. These interactions indicate that FRA10AC1 plays a role in splice site recognition and splicing regulation (Sarafidou2023Reconstruction).
