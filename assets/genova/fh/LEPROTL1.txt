# LEPROTL1

## Overview
LEPROTL1, or leptin receptor overlapping transcript like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of leptin signaling, a critical pathway for energy homeostasis and body weight management. The LEPROTL1 protein is categorized as a regulatory protein that primarily functions within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it influences the trafficking and degradation of the leptin receptor. This modulation is vital for maintaining leptin sensitivity and proper metabolic function. The protein's role extends to cellular trafficking processes, as it interacts with small G-proteins such as Rab13 and Rab8, indicating its involvement in endosomal trafficking and receptor surface expression. LEPROTL1's interactions with other proteins, such as Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), further suggest its participation in broader cellular signaling pathways, impacting processes like follicular growth and development (Ndiaye2016Differential; Londraville2017On).

## Function
LEPROTL1, also known as leptin receptor overlapping transcript like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of leptin signaling, which is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and body weight control. The LEPROTL1 protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in influencing the trafficking and degradation of the leptin receptor. This regulation is essential for modulating leptin sensitivity and metabolic processes in healthy human cells (Londraville2017On).

LEPROTL1, along with its paralog LEPROT, is homologous to the yeast vesicle trafficking gene VPS55, suggesting a conserved role in cellular trafficking processes. These proteins are proposed to regulate endosomal trafficking and the surface expression of the leptin receptor. In knockout studies, the absence of LEPROT, which is closely related to LEPROTL1, leads to increased leptin receptor expression on the cell surface, resulting in heightened leptin sensitivity and resistance to diet-induced obesity in mice. This indicates that LEPROTL1 may similarly influence leptin receptor expression and function in humans (Londraville2017On).

The interaction of endospanins, including LEPROTL1, with Rab13 and Rab8 further suggests a broader role in cellular trafficking beyond just leptin receptor regulation, highlighting its importance in various cellular processes (Londraville2017On).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
LEPROTL1 (leptin receptor overlapping transcript like 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular signaling pathways. It has been identified as a significant interacting partner of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) in bovine granulosa cells. This interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting a role in follicular growth and development. LEPROTL1's interaction with JAK3 may influence growth hormone signaling and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) availability, potentially affecting cell viability and kinase activity (Ndiaye2016Differential).

LEPROTL1 also interacts with Rab13 and Rab8, small G-proteins involved in vesicle trafficking, indicating its role in regulating endosomal trafficking and surface expression of receptors such as the leptin receptor (Londraville2017On). In the context of heart failure, LEPROTL1 has been identified as a downregulated hypermethylated gene, suggesting its involvement in epigenetic regulation, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Zhang2024Regulatory). These interactions highlight LEPROTL1's potential role in various physiological processes, including metabolic regulation and immune response.
