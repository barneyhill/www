# CAMK1D

## Overview
CAMK1D is a gene that encodes the protein calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID (CaMK1D), a member of the serine/threonine kinase family. This kinase is involved in a variety of cellular processes, primarily through its role in calcium signaling pathways. CaMK1D is activated by the binding of calcium and calmodulin, which facilitates its phosphorylation by calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK), leading to its involvement in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Takemoto‐Kimura2017Calmodulin). The protein is expressed in multiple tissues and can translocate between the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing diverse cellular functions and contributing to physiological processes such as neuronal signaling and immune responses (Tong2020Backbone). CAMK1D has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, where it may function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the cellular context (Bergamaschi2008CAMK1D; Jin2022CAMK1D).

## Structure
The CaMK1D protein, also known as CaMKIδ or CKLiK, is a member of the CaMK subfamily of serine/threonine kinases. Its structure includes a canonical bi-lobed kinase fold, consisting of a smaller β-sheet lobe that binds ATP and a larger α-helical lobe where substrates are recognized. The β-sheet lobe features the P-loop and mobile αC helix, while the α-helical lobe presents the catalytic and activation loops. The kinase domain is negatively regulated by an adjacent C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain (AID), a helix-loop-helix motif that occludes the substrate and ATP binding sites. The overlapping calmodulin binding domain (CBD) is recognized by calmodulin, which disengages the AID to activate the kinase (Tong2020Backbone).

Phosphorylation of Thr180 in the activation loop increases CaMK1D activity and is mediated by calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) (Tong2020Backbone). CaMK1D is expressed in various tissues and is predominantly cytoplasmic but can translocate to the nucleus once activated. The protein's levels are amplified in basal-like breast tumors, indicating an oncogenic role (Tong2020Backbone). The study of its backbone resonance assignments aids in the design of small molecule inhibitors and therapeutic interventions (Tong2020Backbone).

## Function
CAMK1D, or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in calcium signaling pathways. It is involved in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. CAMK1D operates as part of the CaMKK-CaMKI pathway, which is a Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation cascade. Activation of CAMK1D requires the binding of calcium and calmodulin, which releases auto-inhibition and allows for CaMKK-dependent phosphorylation of a threonine residue in the activation loop (Takemoto‐Kimura2017Calmodulin).

In trophoblast cells, CAMK1D is regulated by eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). Inhibition of eIF5A leads to decreased expression of CAMK1D, resulting in reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while increasing apoptosis. This suggests that CAMK1D, in cooperation with eIF5A, enhances cell progression and survival in these cells (Qin2018Eukaryotic). CAMK1D is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting various cellular functions and contributing to organismal outcomes such as neuronal signaling, immune responses, and metabolic regulation (Takemoto‐Kimura2017Calmodulin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAMK1D gene have been implicated in various diseases, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and glioma. In the context of hypertension, variants in the CAMK1D gene have been associated with the blood pressure response to losartan, an antihypertensive medication. Specifically, the SNP rs10752271 in the CAMK1D gene was found to significantly influence the efficacy of losartan, suggesting a role in personalized hypertension treatment (Frau2014GenomeWide).

In type 2 diabetes, the CAMK1D gene, along with CDC123, affects pancreatic β-cell function. The rs12779790 variant in this locus is associated with altered insulin secretion, impacting the disease's pathophysiology (SimonisBik2009Gene).

CAMK1D is also implicated in cancer. In breast cancer, particularly the basal-like subtype, CAMK1D amplification is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting cell proliferation and invasion, which are key features of cancer progression (Bergamaschi2008CAMK1D). Conversely, in glioma, CAMK1D appears to play a tumor-suppressive role by inhibiting cell proliferation and migration through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Jin2022CAMK1D). These findings highlight the complex role of CAMK1D in different diseases, where it may act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the context.
