# SDC1

## Overview
The SDC1 gene encodes syndecan-1, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a pivotal role in cellular communication and structural integrity. Syndecan-1 is characterized by its core protein, which features glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment sites essential for its interaction with various proteins and extracellular matrix components. This proteoglycan is predominantly expressed on epithelial cells and mature plasma cells, where it functions as a co-receptor for growth factors and participates in processes such as cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. Syndecan-1's involvement in signaling pathways and its ability to modulate the immune response underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases (Yang2016Syndecan1Induced; Couchman2021Syndecan1; Kouwenberg2020Role).

## Structure
Syndecan-1 (SDC1) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan characterized by a core protein with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment sites. The primary structure of SDC1 includes an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain (KumarSingh2020Mapping; Teixeira2020Involvement). The extracellular domain is crucial for its function, containing five GAG attachment sites, with three near the N-terminus and two close to the cell membrane. These sites can attach heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains, which are essential for SDC1's interactions with various proteins (Gondelaud2019Structures; Teixeira2020Involvement).

The secondary structure of SDC1 includes regions of alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its functional conformation. The ectodomain is enriched in glycine, alanine, glutamic acid, and proline residues, which contribute to its structural plasticity and intrinsic disorder (Gondelaud2019Structures). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are significant for SDC1's function, influencing its interaction capabilities (Kouwenberg2020Role).

SDC1 can form heterodimers with other syndecans like SDC2 and SDC3, but not with SDC4, indicating a specific quaternary structure in its interactions (Teixeira2020Involvement). The presence of splice variants may alter the extracellular domain, affecting its binding properties and functional roles.

## Function
Syndecan-1 (SDC1) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed on epithelial cells and mature plasma cells, and is involved in cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and cytoskeletal organization (Yang2016Syndecan1Induced). SDC1 functions as a co-receptor for growth factors and interacts with extracellular matrix (ECM) components through its heparan sulfate chains, influencing ECM architecture and alignment (Yang2016Syndecan1Induced).

In human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), SDC1 is crucial for maintaining the balance between osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. It regulates cell proliferation and lineage commitment, impacting bone and fat tissue homeostasis (Yu2020Syndecan1). SDC1's involvement in the osteo-adipogenic balance is mediated through its interactions with signaling pathways such as BMP2 and SHH, which are important for osteogenic differentiation (Yu2020Syndecan1).

SDC1 also modulates the immune response by binding cytokines and chemokines through its heparan sulfate side chains, suggesting an immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory role (Kouwenberg2020Role). Its expression on dendritic cells and T cells indicates a potential role in immune cell interactions, although this is not fully understood (Kouwenberg2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SDC1 gene are associated with various diseases, particularly cancers and inflammatory conditions. In cancer, SDC1 plays a dual role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context. High levels of SDC1 expression are linked to reduced migration and invasiveness in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, while its loss enhances motility and invasion (Teng2012Molecular). In breast cancer, SDC1 facilitates metastasis to the brain by promoting cell adhesion and transmigration across the blood-brain barrier, with high expression correlating with worse disease-free survival, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (Sayyad2019Syndecan1). In colorectal adenocarcinoma, reduced SDC1 levels correlate with higher TNM stage and lymph node metastasis (Czarnowski2021Syndecans).

SDC1 is also implicated in inflammatory diseases. Its deficiency in mice models leads to increased leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, as seen in conditions like colitis and delayed-type hypersensitivity (Teng2012Molecular). In ulcerative colitis, SDC1 knockout mice exhibit increased mortality and impaired mucosal healing (Teixeira2020Involvement). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SDC1 in modulating disease progression and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Syndecan-1 (SDC1) is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cell signaling and communication. SDC1 interacts with 74 proteins, primarily membrane and extracellular proteins, and is unique among syndecans for its interaction with fibrillar collagens I, III, and V. It also binds to more pathogens and pathogen proteins than other syndecans (Gondelaud2019Structures).

SDC1 forms complexes with integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases, such as HER2 and IGF1R, facilitating cell motility and survival. It captures HER2 via a specific site in its ectodomain, which is crucial for HER2-mediated cell motility in breast carcinoma cells (Wang2015Syndecan1). SDC1 also interacts with VEGFR2 and integrins like αvβ3 and α4β1, influencing angiogenesis and cell invasion (Couchman2021Syndecan1; Jung2016Heparanaseinduced).

In the context of cancer, SDC1's interactions with the extracellular matrix can signal a quiescent state in breast carcinoma cells, independent of integrins, through interactions with a PAR1/PAR6γ/atypical protein kinase C complex (Couchman2021Syndecan1). SDC1 also plays a role in the alignment of extracellular matrix fibers, promoting an invasion-permissive microenvironment in breast carcinomas (Yang2016Syndecan1Induced).
