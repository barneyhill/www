# FAM90A13

## Overview
FAM90A13 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 90, specifically member A13. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological role remains to be fully elucidated. The FAM90A13 gene is located on chromosome 8 and is thought to be involved in various cellular processes, potentially through interactions with other proteins or pathways. While the precise function of the FAM90A13-encoded protein is not yet well-defined, it is hypothesized to play a role in cellular signaling or structural integrity, given its sequence similarity to other proteins with known functions (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to clarify its role in health and disease.
