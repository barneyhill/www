# PRSS35

## Overview
PRSS35 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 35, which is categorized as a serine protease. Although initially considered an inactive pseudo serine protease due to a threonine substitution at the canonical serine active site, recent research has demonstrated that PRSS35 can function as an active protease. It is involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the reproductive system, where it plays a role in ovarian functions such as follicular growth and ovulation. PRSS35 is also implicated in modulating the tumor microenvironment, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, by interacting with chemokines like CXCL2 to influence immune cell recruitment and tumor progression. Its expression and activity have been linked to several clinical conditions, including cancer and craniofacial development disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Miyakoshi2006The; Wang2023Secreted; Letra2010Novel).

## Function
PRSS35, or serine protease 35, is a gene encoding a protein that is part of the serine protease family, traditionally annotated as an inactive pseudo serine protease due to a threonine at the canonical serine active site. However, recent studies have suggested that PRSS35 may function similarly to an active serine protease. It has been shown to cleave β-casein, a substrate for many serine proteases, indicating its active protease function (Wang2023Secreted). The activation of PRSS35 involves cleavage by proprotein convertases, specifically FURIN, which processes it into its active form. This active form functions as a trypsin-like serine protease, capable of cleaving substrates at di-basic KK residues (Wang2023Secreted).

PRSS35 is expressed in the ovary and is involved in ovarian functions, particularly in processes such as follicular growth, ovulation, and luteal formation, which involve extensive tissue remodeling (Miyakoshi2006The). Its expression in cumulus cells is associated with oocyte fertilization potential, as higher PRSS35 mRNA levels have been observed in cumulus cells of fertilized oocytes compared to unfertilized ones (Li2015Correlation). Despite its expression in reproductive tissues, PRSS35 is dispensable for fertility in mice, as knockout studies have shown no significant impact on fertility-related parameters (Diao2013Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
PRSS35 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PRSS35 expression is significantly reduced in cancerous tissues compared to noncancerous tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer patient survival, suggesting that PRSS35 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for HCC. The protein functions as a tumor suppressor by degrading CXCL2, a chemokine involved in neutrophil recruitment, thereby reducing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation and inhibiting tumor progression (Wang2023Secreted).

PRSS35 has also been linked to craniofacial development disorders. A study found significant associations between an intronic marker in PRSS35 and cleft lip/palate in both Chinese and Caucasian families. Gene expression analyses in mice showed that PRSS35 is expressed during critical periods of craniofacial development, suggesting that alterations in its expression may contribute to cleft formation (Letra2010Novel).

Despite these associations, PRSS35 appears to be dispensable for fertility in mice, as knockout models do not exhibit reproductive defects or cleft lip/palate, indicating a complex role in human disease (Diao2013Distinct).

## Interactions
PRSS35, a secreted protease, interacts with the chemokine CXCL2, playing a significant role in modulating the tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PRSS35 cleaves CXCL2, reducing its extracellular levels and thereby decreasing neutrophil recruitment to tumors. This interaction is crucial as it affects the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are involved in tumor progression (Wang2023Secreted). The cleavage of CXCL2 by PRSS35 was confirmed through experiments that demonstrated PRSS35's ability to cleave CXCL2 at a specific site, highlighting a direct substrate-protease relationship (Wang2023Secreted).

PRSS35's interaction with CXCL2 also impacts neutrophil migration and NETs formation, which are associated with tumor growth. By degrading CXCL2, PRSS35 suppresses neutrophil migration and NETs formation, thereby exerting tumor-suppressive effects (Wang2023Secreted). This protease activity of PRSS35 is dependent on its activation through cleavage by proprotein convertases, such as FURIN, which produce its active form capable of interacting with substrates like CXCL2 (Wang2023Secreted). These interactions suggest that PRSS35 could be a potential therapeutic target in HCC by modulating immune responses and tumor growth through its effects on CXCL2 and neutrophil activity (Wang2023Secreted).
