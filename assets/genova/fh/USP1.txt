# USP1

## Overview
USP1 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 1) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of DNA repair and genomic stability. The protein product of USP1 is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme, specifically involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, including the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway and translesion synthesis (TLS). It functions by removing ubiquitin moieties from specific protein substrates, such as FANCD2, FANCI, and PCNA, thereby modulating their activity and stability (GarcíaSantisteban2013USP1). USP1's enzymatic activity is enhanced through its interaction with USP1-associated factor 1 (UAF1), which is crucial for its role in maintaining genome integrity (Villamil2012A). The gene's expression and activity are tightly regulated, and its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Antonenko2023The; Zhao2020Comprehensive).

## Structure
USP1 is a deubiquitinating enzyme composed of 785 amino acids with a molecular weight of 88.2 kDa. It features a conserved ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain, characterized by a catalytic triad consisting of Cys90, His593, and Asp751, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Antonenko2023The; GarcíaSantisteban2013USP1). The catalytic domain of USP1 is large due to the presence of additional inserts: L1 (residues 227-433), L2 (residues 602-744), and L3 (residues 465-483). L1 contains phosphorylation sites, nuclear localization signals, and a degradation motif, while L2 includes an autocleavage site (Antonenko2023The).

USP1 forms a complex with USP1-associated factor 1 (UAF1), a WD40 repeat protein, which enhances its catalytic activity by modulating the active site conformation (Villamil2012A). The interaction with UAF1 is mediated by the 420-520 fragment of USP1, which is necessary and sufficient for UAF1 binding (OlazabalHerrero2015Structurefunction). Phosphorylation at Ser313 is involved in the regulation of USP1, although it is not essential for UAF1 binding or PCNA deubiquitination (OlazabalHerrero2015Structurefunction). The Fingers subdomain of USP1 is crucial for ubiquitin binding and interaction with UAF1, playing a significant role in its function (Olazabal‐Herrero2016Mutations).

## Function
USP1 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating DNA repair processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, particularly the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway and translesion synthesis (TLS). In the FA pathway, USP1, in complex with its cofactor UAF1, deubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI, which are essential for repairing DNA interstrand crosslink lesions (GarcíaSantisteban2013USP1). In the TLS process, USP1 deubiquitinates PCNA, preventing the unscheduled recruitment of low-fidelity TLS polymerases, thereby maintaining genome stability (GarcíaSantisteban2013USP1).

USP1's activity is regulated through various mechanisms, including its interaction with UAF1, which enhances its activity and facilitates access to nuclear substrates like ub-FANCD2 and ub-PCNA (GarcíaSantisteban2013USP1). The USP1/UAF1 complex is imported into the nucleus via nuclear localization signals in USP1, and UAF1's SUMO-like domain targets the complex to specific substrates (GarcíaSantisteban2013USP1). USP1 also plays a role in regulating the PI3K-Akt-FoxO signaling pathway by deubiquitinating Akt, which is crucial for controlling growth and metabolism in cells, particularly during prolonged starvation (Goldbraikh2020USP).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the USP1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. USP1 is frequently overexpressed in various cancers, including cervical squamous cell carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Antonenko2023The; Zhao2020Comprehensive). In HCC, USP1 is significantly upregulated, correlating with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Zhao2020Comprehensive). Overexpression of USP1 is also linked to the development of metastatic phenotypes and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Antonenko2023The).

In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), USP1 forms a complex with PHLPP1, affecting Akt1 phosphorylation and disease progression (Antonenko2023The). In ovarian cancer, USP1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, and its inhibition can suppress cancer progression (Song2022ML323). USP1's role in DNA damage response pathways, such as the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, is crucial, as its disruption leads to increased sensitivity to DNA crosslinkers and genomic instability (Villamil2013The; Kim2009Inactivation). Pharmacological inhibitors targeting USP1, like ML323, show potential in enhancing cancer treatment efficacy by reversing chemoresistance (Song2022ML323; Chen2011Selective).

## Interactions
USP1 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 1) interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. A significant interaction is with UAF1 (USP1-associated factor 1), which enhances USP1's deubiquitinating activity. This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of USP1 at Ser313, which is essential for the formation of the USP1-UAF1 complex. The phosphorylation is mediated by CDK1, and a phosphomimetic mutation at Ser313 can mimic this effect, promoting complex formation (Villamil2012Serine).

USP1 also interacts with PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), where it plays a role in the translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway by deubiquitinating monoubiquitinated PCNA. This action prevents the unscheduled recruitment of low-fidelity TLS polymerases, thereby maintaining genome stability (GarcíaSantisteban2013USP1). In the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, USP1, in complex with UAF1, deubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI, which are crucial for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslink lesions (Liang2014A; GarcíaSantisteban2013USP1).

USP1's interaction with ID1 is implicated in centrosome duplication. Overexpression of USP1 leads to centrosome amplification, partly through the induction of ID1 expression, which is stabilized by USP1's deubiquitinating activity (Jung2016A).
