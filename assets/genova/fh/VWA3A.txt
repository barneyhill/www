# VWA3A

## Overview
VWA3A (von Willebrand factor A domain containing 3A) is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, which is integral to protein-protein interactions and cellular adhesion processes. The VWA3A protein is implicated in several cellular functions, particularly those related to cilium organization and movement, suggesting its role in maintaining ciliary structure and function. Additionally, the protein is involved in mRNA splicing and regulation, indicating its importance in post-transcriptional modification and gene expression. The VWA3A gene has been associated with various neurological and developmental disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and West Syndrome, highlighting its potential clinical significance (He2022Gene; Grunin2020Association; Pyatnitskiy2024TranscriptLevel). Despite its recognized roles, further research is needed to elucidate the detailed mechanisms by which VWA3A influences cellular and physiological processes.

## Structure
The VWA3A gene encodes a protein that includes a von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. This domain typically features a Rossmann fold, characterized by a central β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Grunin2020Association). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and stability (Grunin2020Association). 

The VWA3A protein may produce multiple splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Peng2018Novel). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the VWA3A gene results in a missense mutation, changing cysteine to tyrosine at position 546. Despite this mutation, modeling using Phyre2 indicated no significant alteration in the beta helix structure of the protein (Grunin2020Association). The variant was classified as a regulatory or nonsynonymous feature, with computational tools suggesting it is tolerated and benign (Grunin2020Association). 

The VWA3A protein is also noted for its role as a precursor of the multimeric von Willebrand factor, which plays a role in blood coagulation (Grunin2020Association).

## Function
VWA3A (von Willebrand factor A domain containing 3A) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly those related to cilium organization, assembly, and movement. The protein is significantly enriched in biological processes associated with cilium-related functions, indicating its potential role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cilia in healthy human cells (Pyatnitskiy2024TranscriptLevel). Cilia are important for modulating signaling pathways and are involved in various cellular activities, including cell signaling and movement.

The VWA3A gene is also associated with mRNA splicing and regulation, suggesting a role in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, which is crucial for proper gene expression and cellular function (Pyatnitskiy2024TranscriptLevel). The protein encoded by VWA3A contains a von Willebrand factor A domain, which is typically involved in cellular adhesion and interactions with the extracellular matrix. This domain suggests that VWA3A may play a role in maintaining tissue architecture and facilitating cell communication, contributing to the structural and functional integrity of tissues (Kasavi2022Gene). However, specific details about the protein's activity in healthy human cells remain limited in the current literature.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VWA3A gene have been implicated in several neurological and developmental disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, VWA3A was identified as one of the three genes with significant differential expression, suggesting its potential role in the disease's pathology (He2022Gene). The gene has also been associated with West Syndrome, a form of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, where a splice junction variant of VWA3A was identified in a Chinese cohort, indicating its possible contribution to the genetic heterogeneity of the syndrome (Peng2018Novel).

In the context of congenital heart defects, VWA3A was mentioned in a study on transposition of the great arteries (TGA), where it was part of a gain copy number variation (CNV) in a subject, although the clinical significance of this finding was not detailed (Costain2016Genomewide). Additionally, VWA3A was included in a deletion on chromosome 16p12.2 in fetuses with isolated brain malformations, suggesting a potential link to neurodevelopmental disorders (Schumann2016Arraybased).

These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various conditions, although the precise mechanisms and clinical implications require further investigation.
