# DCLRE1B

## Overview
DCLRE1B is a human gene that encodes the protein DNA cross-link repair 1B, also known as SNM1B or Apollo. This protein is a crucial component of the DNA repair machinery, particularly involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks and the maintenance of telomere integrity. SNM1B/Apollo is characterized by a metallo-β-lactamase fold and a β-CASP domain, which are essential for its exonuclease activity, allowing it to process DNA at stalled replication forks and telomeres. The protein interacts with various components of the DNA damage response, including the MRN complex and the shelterin complex protein TRF2, underscoring its role in genomic stability and telomere protection (Wu2010Apollo; Allerston2015The). Mutations in DCLRE1B have been linked to telomere biology disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in both hereditary conditions and oncogenesis (Revy2022Genetics; Li2023DCLRE1B).

## Structure
The DCLRE1B gene encodes the SNM1B/Apollo protein, which is involved in DNA repair processes. The protein is characterized by a metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) fold, which includes a β-CASP domain. This domain is inserted between strands 10 and 11 of the MBL domain, forming a structural motif essential for its exonuclease activity (Allerston2015The). The MBL fold is composed of a sandwich of two mixed β sheets (α/β-β/α), contributing to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures (Allerston2015The).

SNM1B/Apollo contains a positively charged surface, which is crucial for its interaction with DNA. Specific residues such as K705, K706, K743, and K906 contribute to this charge distribution, influencing the protein's DNA processing capabilities (Allerston2015The). The protein also includes two zinc ions at its active site, which are vital for its catalytic function (Allerston2015The).

The protein's structure allows it to interact with telomeric proteins, such as TRF2, which is essential for maintaining telomere integrity. This interaction is facilitated by a C-terminal region that binds to TRF2, highlighting the protein's role in telomere maintenance (Herwest2018The). The DCLRE1B protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, which may influence its activity and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The human gene DCLRE1B, also known as SNM1B or Apollo, encodes a protein that plays a critical role in DNA repair and telomere maintenance. In healthy human cells, SNM1B/Apollo is involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), functioning within the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. It facilitates the recruitment of key repair proteins such as FANCD2, BRCA1, and RAD51 to sites of DNA damage, promoting homologous recombination and maintaining genomic stability (Mason2011Snm1B/Apollo; Schmiester2017SNM1B/Apollo).

SNM1B/Apollo also plays a significant role in telomere protection. It interacts with the shelterin complex protein TRF2 to maintain telomeric overhangs, which are crucial for preventing chromosome end fusions and ensuring proper telomere function. This interaction helps generate the 3' overhang at leading-end telomeres, facilitating T-loop formation and protecting against inappropriate DNA repair responses (Wu2010Apollo; Allerston2015The).

The protein's nuclease activity is essential for processing DNA at stalled replication forks and telomeres, reducing topological stress and preventing DNA damage response activation at telomeric sequences (Schmiester2017SNM1B/Apollo). Its activity is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing chromosomal instability (Schmiester2017SNM1B/Apollo).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DCLRE1B gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Biallelic variants in DCLRE1B have been linked to dyskeratosis congenita and Høyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, both of which are telomere biology disorders. These variants, such as Leu142Phe and Leu142Ser, impair the gene's nuclease activity and its interaction with TRF2, leading to telomere defects like sudden telomere loss and fusions, although they do not cause a global reduction in telomere length (Revy2022Genetics). DCLRE1B is also implicated in DKCB8, an autosomal recessive form of dyskeratosis congenita, characterized by mutations in the gene that affect telomere maintenance (Lin2023Inherited).

In cancer, DCLRE1B expression is linked to poorer prognosis in several types, including pancreatic, liver, and renal cancers. Its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Li2023DCLRE1B). Additionally, DCLRE1B is involved in the regulation of alternative splicing in breast cancer, with specific SNPs affecting its transcript isoform expression, which may contribute to cancer risk (Caswell2015Multiple). These findings highlight the gene's role in both hereditary disorders and cancer progression.

## Interactions
DCLRE1B, also known as SNM1B or Apollo, participates in several critical protein interactions that are essential for DNA repair and telomere maintenance. It interacts with the MRN complex, composed of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1, which is involved in DNA damage response and replication fork collapse. This interaction is direct and not mediated by DNA, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Bae2008Snm1B/Apollo). DCLRE1B also interacts with the Mus81-Eme1 endonuclease, which is necessary for double-strand break formation at stalled replication forks (Bae2008Snm1B/Apollo).

In the context of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway, DCLRE1B interacts with FANCD2 and FANCP/SLX4, playing a role in the assembly of DNA repair foci and facilitating homologous recombination-mediated repair (Schmiester2017SNM1B/Apollo). The interaction with FANCD2 is likely indirect, as FANCD2 monoubiquitination is not affected by DCLRE1B depletion (Schmiester2017SNM1B/Apollo).

DCLRE1B also binds to the telomeric protein TRF2, a component of the shelterin complex, which is crucial for telomere protection and maintenance. This interaction helps prevent non-homologous end joining-mediated repair at telomeres, maintaining telomere integrity (Lenain2006The; Lam2010SNMIB/Apollo).
