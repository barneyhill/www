# SMIM8

## Overview
SMIM8 is a gene that encodes the small integral membrane protein 8, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is implicated in various biological processes, including metabolic regulation and epigenetic modifications. While the precise functions of SMIM8 are still under investigation, it has been associated with insulin sensitivity and potential metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (Timmons2018A). Additionally, environmental factors, such as exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, have been shown to affect the methylation patterns of the SMIM8 gene, suggesting a role in epigenetic regulation (Prados2015Prenatal). Although its direct involvement in specific human diseases is not yet fully understood, SMIM8 has been linked to growth traits in animal studies, indicating its broader biological significance (Macharia2024Identification).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the SMIM8 gene, which encodes a small integral membrane protein, is still being explored. Research has identified SMIM8 as a gene that tracks positively with changes in insulin sensitivity, suggesting its potential involvement in metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (Timmons2018A). However, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations or alterations in SMIM8 expression have not been conclusively identified.

In studies involving prenatal exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), SMIM8 showed differential methylation patterns in mouse strains, indicating that environmental factors might influence its expression. In C57BL/6J mice, DEHP exposure led to hyper-methylation of the SMIM8 promoter, while in FVB/N mice, it resulted in hypo-methylation (Prados2015Prenatal). These methylation changes suggest a potential role in epigenetic regulation, although the specific impact on diseases or conditions remains unclear.

Additionally, SMIM8 has been mentioned in the context of growth traits in animals, such as myofiber formation in pigs and growth in cattle, but its direct association with human diseases is not well-documented (Macharia2024Identification). Further research is needed to elucidate the clinical implications of SMIM8 in human health.
