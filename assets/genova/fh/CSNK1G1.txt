# CSNK1G1

## Overview
The CSNK1G1 gene encodes the protein casein kinase 1 gamma 1 (CK1 γ1), a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This protein is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell division, and apoptosis. CK1 γ1 is characterized by its kinase activity, which allows it to phosphorylate target proteins, thereby modulating their function. The protein exists in two isoforms, hCK1 γ1S and hCK1 γ1L, which differ in their C-terminal sequences and potentially in their interaction with other cellular components (Kusuda2000Cloning). CK1 γ1 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, with significant roles in the brain, where it influences synaptic transmission and neuronal development (Gold2020Heterozygous). The gene's intolerance to loss-of-function mutations underscores its critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Gold2020Heterozygous). Additionally, alterations in the expression of its circular RNA form, circCSNK1G1, have been linked to cancer progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Huang2020<p>CircCSNK1G1; Zan2022CircCSNK1G1).

## Structure
The CSNK1G1 gene encodes the protein casein kinase 1 gamma 1 (CK1 γ1), which is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in various cellular processes. The protein exists in two splice variant isoforms, hCK1 γ1S and hCK1 γ1L, which differ in their carboxy-terminal sequences. The hCK1 γ1S isoform consists of 393 amino acids, while hCK1 γ1L is 422 amino acids long, featuring an additional 50 amino acid motif at the C-terminal end that is absent in hCK1 γ1S (Kusuda2000Cloning).

Both isoforms share a highly homologous kinase domain, which is crucial for their enzymatic activity. This domain is responsible for phosphorylating acidic proteins using ATP. The kinase domain is identical in both isoforms, but the C-terminal region varies, affecting the protein's interaction with heparin, a glycosaminoglycan (Kusuda2000Cloning).

The CK1 γ1 protein is part of the CK1 family, which is characterized by a common fold consisting of an N-terminal domain with beta strands and a C-helix, and a C-terminal domain that is largely helical. This structure is essential for binding ATP, magnesium, and substrates, facilitating its role in phosphorylation (Faezov2023AlphaFold2). The protein's structure and function are further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are typical for kinases in this family.

## Function
The CSNK1G1 gene encodes the gamma-1 isoform of casein kinase 1, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase involved in several critical cellular processes. This protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissue types, including the brain, where it plays a significant role in synaptic transmission by regulating the phosphorylation of NMDA receptors (Gold2020Heterozygous). CSNK1G1 is also involved in the transduction of Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 6 (LRP6), which is crucial for activating the cytoplasmic signal transduction apparatus. This function is essential for normal cellular processes, and impairments in WNT signaling, which involves LRP6, can affect prenatal neuronal migration, potentially leading to developmental delays and impaired social behavior (Gold2020Heterozygous).

The protein's activity is not limited to the brain; it is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cell division, differentiation, and apoptosis. The gene is notably intolerant to loss-of-function mutations, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular function (Gold2020Heterozygous). The CSNK1G1 protein's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its critical role in cell biology and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CSNK1G1 gene, particularly in its circular RNA form circCSNK1G1, have been implicated in the progression of certain cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), circCSNK1G1 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and cells compared to normal tissues. This upregulation contributes to cancer progression by modulating the miR-455-3p/MYO6 axis. CircCSNK1G1 acts as a miRNA sponge, sequestering miR-455-3p, which leads to increased expression of MYO6, a gene involved in CRC progression. Silencing circCSNK1G1 in CRC cell lines has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Huang2020<p>CircCSNK1G1).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), circ-CSNK1G1 is also overexpressed and is associated with lower overall survival in patients. It promotes cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and glycolysis metabolism by modulating the miR-28-5p/LDHA pathway. Knockdown of circ-CSNK1G1 in TNBC cells results in decreased tumor volume and weight, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zan2022CircCSNK1G1). These findings suggest that circCSNK1G1 plays a significant role in cancer progression by altering normal gene interactions and expression levels.

## Interactions
CSNK1G1, also known as casein kinase 1 gamma 1, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It is a component of the necrosome complex, which includes RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL, and is recruited into this complex upon necroptotic stimuli. CSNK1G1 enhances the interaction between RIPK3 and MLKL, although its direct interaction with MLKL is relatively weak. It is autophosphorylated and can phosphorylate RIPK3, which activates MLKL, crucial for forming MLKL oligomers that create pores in the plasma membrane during necroptosis (Lee2019Casein).

CSNK1G1 also interacts with active caspase-8 but not with caspase-3 in apoptotic cells, indicating a specific interaction with caspase-8 during apoptosis (Lee2019Casein). In addition, CSNK1G1 is involved in the phosphorylation of the Lyn protein at serine 13, a process dependent on N-myristoylation and facilitated by its S-palmitoylation, which allows membrane anchoring (KinoshitaKikuta2020ProteinNmyristoylationdependent).

In C. elegans, CSNK1G1 interacts with the NADPH dual oxidase complex, including DOXA-1, suggesting a role in regulating oxidative stress response. This interaction is supported by co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Hu2023Casein).
