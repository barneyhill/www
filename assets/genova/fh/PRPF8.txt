# PRPF8

## Overview
The PRPF8 gene encodes the pre-mRNA processing factor 8 protein, a pivotal component of the spliceosome, which is essential for the splicing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells. As a core element of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), the PRPF8 protein plays a crucial role in the catalytic core of the spliceosome, facilitating the precise excision and ligation of exons (GRAINGER2005Prp8; Malinová2017Assembly). The protein is characterized by its large size and complex structure, featuring several distinct domains, including the MPN domain, RNase H domain, and a bromodomain, which contribute to its multifaceted interactions with RNA and other spliceosomal components (wu2012structural). PRPF8's function is critical for accurate mRNA processing, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa and certain cancers, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and gene expression (LópezCánovas2023PRPF8; Yang2021Pre-mRNA).

## Structure
The PRPF8 protein is a core component of the spliceosome, characterized by its large size and complex structure. It contains several distinct domains, including the MPN domain, RNase H domain, and a bromodomain. The MPN domain of PRPF8 is unique in that it does not coordinate a Zn2+ ion due to specific amino acid replacements in the JAMM motif, and it features a consensus sequence QXnHXQX7SXXD (wu2012structural). The RNase H domain, also known as domain IV, has a bipartite structure with an RNase H fold and a C-terminal cluster of helices, interacting with RNA and favoring duplex RNAs (wu2012structural). The bromodomain, despite low sequence identity with other bromodomains, shares conserved residues important for substrate recognition (wu2012structural).

PRPF8 also includes a central region known as PROCN and an RT-like domain, which lacks several conserved residues necessary for metal coordination (wu2012structural). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as acetylation, particularly in the U6 interaction domain (U6i) (wu2012structural). The Jab1/MPN domain in PRPF8 binds ubiquitin with modest affinity, playing a role in spliceosome regulation (BELLARE2006Ubiquitin).

## Function
The PRPF8 gene encodes a protein that is a central component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA during splicing in eukaryotic cells. PRPF8 is part of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) and plays a critical role in the catalytic core of the spliceosome, facilitating the precise excision and ligation of exons (GRAINGER2005Prp8; Malinová2017Assembly). The protein is involved in several key molecular rearrangements during the splicing process and interacts with various spliceosomal components, including the 5' splice site, branchpoint, and 3' splice site of the pre-mRNA, as well as U5 and U6 snRNAs (GRAINGER2005Prp8).

PRPF8 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it ensures accurate mRNA processing, essential for proper gene expression and cellular function (GRAINGER2005Prp8). The assembly of PRPF8 into the U5 snRNP is controlled by the HSP90/R2TP chaperone system, which stabilizes unassembled U5 proteins in the cytoplasm and promotes their formation into the U5 snRNP (Malinová2017Assembly). This chaperone system also ensures quality control of PRPF8, distinguishing between wildtype and assembly-defective mutants (Malinová2017Assembly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRPF8 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). This degenerative eye disease is characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors, leading to vision impairment and eventual blindness. PRPF8 mutations disrupt RNA splicing, particularly affecting genes involved in phototransduction and cilium assembly, which are crucial for photoreceptor function (ArzalluzLuque2021Mutant; Yang2021Pre-mRNA). Specific mutations, such as H2309R, have been identified in families with retinitis pigmentosa, causing severe retinal degeneration and visual field loss (Walia2008Phenotypic).

PRPF8 is also implicated in myeloid neoplasms, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In these conditions, somatic mutations in PRPF8 are associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes and altered splicing patterns, affecting genes involved in mitochondrial function and hematopoietic differentiation (Wood2021The). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PRPF8 is overexpressed, correlating with poor patient survival and aggressive tumor characteristics. Silencing PRPF8 in HCC models reduces tumor growth and proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (LópezCánovas2023PRPF8).

These findings highlight the critical role of PRPF8 in maintaining normal cellular functions and its involvement in various diseases through splicing dysregulation.

## Interactions
PRPF8 is a central component of the spliceosome, engaging in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It forms stable complexes with U5 snRNP proteins, including h116K, a GTPase homologous to elongation factor EF-2, and h200K (Brr2p in yeast), an ATP-dependent RNA unwindase (GRAINGER2005Prp8). PRPF8 also interacts with SNRNP200 and EFTUD2, crucial for spliceosome function, and these interactions are disrupted by mutations in the C-terminal region of PRPF8, affecting splicing efficiency (Escher2017Variability; ArzalluzLuque2021Mutant).

PRPF8's interaction with U6 snRNA is significant, particularly over nucleotides 25-47, which includes the ACAGA box crucial for 5'-splice site recognition (Atkinson2024PRPF8mediated). It also forms complexes with RUVBL1-RUVBL2, ZNHIT2, ECD, AAR2, and RPAP3-PIH1D1, with ZNHIT2 regulating the structure and activity of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2 ATPases, crucial for PRPF8 biogenesis (Serna2021CryoEM). These interactions highlight PRPF8's role as a scaffold within the spliceosome, facilitating the assembly and function of this complex molecular machine (GRAINGER2005Prp8).
