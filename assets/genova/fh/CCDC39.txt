# CCDC39

## Overview
The CCDC39 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 39 protein, which is integral to the structural and functional integrity of motile cilia. This protein is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in the assembly and stabilization of ciliary components. CCDC39 is localized to the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, where it is crucial for the attachment of inner dynein arms and nexin-dynein regulatory complexes, essential for ciliary motility. The protein's structure includes multiple coiled-coil domains and Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) conserved domains, which facilitate its interactions and functional roles in ciliary transport processes. Mutations in the CCDC39 gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by impaired ciliary function, leading to respiratory complications and, in some cases, infertility due to defects in sperm flagella (Cannarella2020Ultrastructural; Antony2013Mutations).

## Structure
The CCDC39 protein is composed of 941 amino acid residues and features 10 predicted coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (Antony2013Mutations). These coiled-coil domains contribute to the protein's solubility and interaction properties, playing a crucial role in the stability and function of the protein (Antony2013Mutations). The protein also contains two large Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) conserved domains, which are likely involved in microtubule-based ciliary transport processes (Antony2013Mutations).

A novel homozygous missense mutation (c.983 T>C, p. Leu328Pro) in the CCDC39 gene has been shown to alter the protein's secondary structure, changing an alpha-helix to a random coil, which significantly affects the protein's spatial structure and expression (Chen2021A). This structural alteration leads to down-regulation of CCDC39 protein expression, impacting its function in ciliary growth and motility (Chen2021A).

The CCDC39 protein is essential for the proper assembly of the inner dynein arm (IDA) complexes, the dynein regulatory complex (DRC), and radial spokes, which are critical for ciliary function (Cannarella2020Ultrastructural). However, specific details on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of CCDC39 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The CCDC39 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the proper function and structural integrity of motile cilia in human cells. The CCDC39 protein is localized to the axoneme, a core structure of motile cilia and flagella, where it plays a critical role in the attachment of inner dynein arms (IDAs) and nexin-dynein regulatory complexes (N-DRCs) to the axoneme. These components are crucial for ciliary movement, as they facilitate the attachment and regulation of dynein motor proteins, which drive the motility of cilia (Antony2013Mutations).

In healthy cells, CCDC39 is necessary for the formation of inner dynein arms and nexin links, which are essential for the motility of cilia. This motility is critical for various physiological processes, including the movement of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain and respiratory function (Abdelhamed2018A). The protein is involved in maintaining the structural organization of the axoneme by influencing the assembly or attachment of N-DRC components to microtubules, which is vital for the proper function of cilia (Antony2013Mutations).

The proper function of CCDC39 is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and motility of cilia, which are necessary for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and embryonic development (Antony2013Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC39 gene are a major cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by structural and functional abnormalities of motile cilia. These mutations lead to axonemal disorganization and the absence of inner dynein arms, resulting in impaired ciliary motility. Clinically, PCD manifests as chronic respiratory issues, including sinusitis, bronchiectasis, rhinitis, and chronic cough, due to defective mucociliary clearance. Approximately half of the patients with PCD also exhibit situs inversus, a condition known as Kartagener syndrome, which is associated with organ laterality defects (Cannarella2020Ultrastructural; Antony2013Mutations).

In males, CCDC39 mutations can lead to infertility due to sperm flagella abnormalities, resulting in conditions such as asthenozoospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility. This is attributed to ultrastructural defects in the sperm flagellum, similar to those observed in ciliary cells (Cannarella2020Ultrastructural). The mutations in CCDC39 are often frameshift, nonsense, or splice site mutations, leading to premature protein truncation and null alleles, which disrupt the normal function of cilia and flagella (Antony2013Mutations).

## Interactions
CCDC39 is a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of motile cilia by participating in various protein interactions. It forms a complex with CCDC40, known as the '96nm ruler,' which is essential for setting the repeat length of axonemal dyneins. This complex interacts with the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) and doublet microtubules, contributing to the structural organization of the axoneme (Wilken2024Primary; McCafferty2023An).

CCDC39 also interacts with proteins such as CCDC146 and CFAP58, which are crucial for cilia beating. These proteins form a stable complex and localize to motile cilia, although their exact functions within the axoneme were previously unknown (McCafferty2023An). Additionally, CCDC39 interacts with CFAP91, a protein essential for cilia beating and associated with human motile ciliopathy. CFAP91 forms the base of the RS2 radial spoke and interacts with CCDC96, which connects RS3 to the N-DRC (McCafferty2023An).

Mutations in CCDC39 can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), characterized by axonemal disorganization and absent inner dynein arms, highlighting the importance of its interactions in maintaining ciliary structure and function (Antony2013Mutations).
