# CXCL3

## Overview
CXCL3 is a gene that encodes the protein C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3, a member of the CXC chemokine family. This protein functions primarily as a chemokine, a type of signaling molecule involved in the immune response, inflammation, and tissue remodeling. CXCL3 is known for its role in mediating cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, particularly through its interaction with the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) (Wang2018Effects; Kusuyama2016CXCL3). The protein's structure includes a unique hydrophobic pocket that facilitates binding with small molecules, making it a potential target for drug development (Gulati2019An). Clinically, CXCL3 has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression may influence tumor progression and serve as a prognostic biomarker (Lv2021Expression; Zhao2019Gene).

## Structure
The CXCL3 protein, a member of the CXC chemokine family, exhibits a well-defined molecular structure characterized by its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. The primary structure of CXCL3 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific residues such as F20, I61, I62, and I63 playing a crucial role in forming a hydrophobic pocket on the helical surface (Gulati2019An). 

The secondary structure of CXCL3 includes three antiparallel β-strands, a 3_10-helix, and a C-terminal helix, contributing to its canonical chemokine monomeric fold (Gulati2019An). The tertiary structure is characterized by a positively charged surface on the α-helix face and a neutral/negative charge on the β-sheet face, as revealed by electrostatic surface analysis (Gulati2019An). 

In terms of quaternary structure, CXCL3 forms a typical CXC dimeric architecture, confirmed by intermolecular NOEs observed at the dimer interface, similar to CXCL2 (Gulati2019An). The protein's ability to bind small molecules like ANS is facilitated by a unique hydrophobic pocket, which is formed due to an inter-switch between charged and hydrophobic amino acids (Gulati2019An). This structural feature offers potential for drug targeting.

## Function
CXCL3, also known as growth-regulated oncogene-gamma (GRO-γ), is a small cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine subfamily. It plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. In healthy human cells, CXCL3 is involved in the regulation of adipogenic differentiation, where it promotes the expression of adipogenic markers such as fabp4, pparg2, and c/ebpa. This function is mediated through its receptor, CXCR2, and involves signaling pathways like ERK and JNK, which are crucial for the expression of transcription factors C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, essential for adipogenesis (Kusuyama2016CXCL3).

CXCL3 is also expressed in trophoblast cells, where it influences migration, invasion, proliferation, and tube formation, processes critical for normal placental development. It acts through the ERK/MAPK pathway, enhancing trophoblast function and potentially impacting placental health (Wang2018Effects; Liao2022The). The protein is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it binds to specific receptors on target cells to mediate its effects, contributing to immune responses and tissue remodeling (Wang2018Effects).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly rectal adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma. In rectal adenocarcinoma, CXCL3 is upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to noncancerous tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor overall survival. This suggests that CXCL3 may promote cancer progression by influencing immune cell behavior, such as macrophages and neutrophils, and could serve as a prognostic biomarker (Lv2021Expression). 

In colon adenocarcinoma, CXCL3 is identified as a hypomethylation-high-expression gene, with its expression significantly altered between cancerous and normal tissues. Although high expression of CXCL3 was associated with a survival advantage in some studies, the overall impact on survival remains inconclusive, indicating the need for further research to validate its clinical significance (Zhao2019Gene).

The role of CXCL3 in cancer progression is linked to its involvement in chemokine signaling pathways and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, which may contribute to tumor growth and metastasis by mobilizing immune cells (Lv2021Expression).

## Interactions
CXCL3, a chemokine involved in immune responses, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to interact with the CXC-chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), facilitating signal transduction pathways crucial for tumor progression, such as the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways (Cheng2023Elevated). Protein-protein interaction analysis has identified several proteins closely related to CXCL3, including cyclin B1 (CCNB1), mitotic arrest deficient 2 like 1 (MAD2L1), H2A family member Z (H2AFZ), and CXCL2, which may contribute to its role in tumor biology (Cheng2023Elevated).

In the context of structural interactions, CXCL3 forms a CXC type dimer, similar to CXCL2, and has a unique hydrophobic naphthalene binding pocket that can bind small molecules like ANS. This binding involves various interactions, including ionic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding, with specific residues such as phenylalanine (F20) and isoleucine (I61, I62) playing key roles (Gulati2019An). These interactions suggest potential for designing small molecule inhibitors targeting CXCL3, which could regulate chemokine-GAG interactions and address chemokine-specific diseases (Gulati2019An).
