# RUNX1T1

## Overview
RUNX1T1, also known as ETO, is a gene that encodes the protein RUNX1 partner transcriptional co-repressor 1, which plays a pivotal role in transcriptional regulation. This protein functions primarily as a transcriptional co-repressor, interacting with various transcription factors and corepressors to modulate gene expression. It is characterized by several conserved domains, including Nervy Homology Regions (NHRs) and zinc finger motifs, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in chromatin remodeling. RUNX1T1 is involved in critical biological processes such as hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, and adipogenesis, and its dysregulation is implicated in various diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Liao2017Endothelial; Swart2021The; Hu2022RUNX1T1).

## Structure
RUNX1T1, also known as ETO, is a transcriptional co-repressor with a complex molecular structure that plays a significant role in hematopoiesis. The protein is characterized by several distinct domains that facilitate its function. Among these are the Nervy Homology Region (NHR) domains, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions. These domains contribute to the protein's ability to form complexes with other transcriptional regulators, thereby modulating gene expression.

The structure of RUNX1T1 includes zinc finger motifs, which are typically involved in binding to DNA or RNA, and a TAFH domain, which is important for mediating interactions with other transcription factors. These structural features enable RUNX1T1 to act as a scaffold for assembling multi-protein complexes that regulate transcription.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation are known to regulate the function of RUNX1T1. These modifications can influence the protein's activity, stability, and interactions with other molecules, thereby affecting its role in transcriptional repression.

RUNX1T1 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which may alter its activity and interactions. These variants can lead to differences in the protein's functional capabilities, potentially impacting its role in cellular processes related to hematopoiesis.

## Function
The RUNX1T1 gene, also known as ETO, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in transcriptional repression by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs), which leads to chromatin deacetylation and transcriptional silencing. This activity affects the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors, neuronal differentiation, and microglial activation following injury (Hu2022RUNX1T1). RUNX1T1 is expressed in many normal tissues, with the highest levels in the brain and heart, and is involved in the regulation of cell fate by interacting with signaling pathways such as Notch (Hu2022RUNX1T1).

In the context of angiogenesis, RUNX1T1 regulates the expression of key factors like VEGFA, BMP4, and TGF-β2, which are essential for blood vessel formation and maintenance. It influences the survival, motility, and tube-forming capability of endothelial cells, playing a significant role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis (Liao2017Endothelial). RUNX1T1 also contributes to adipogenesis by modulating the differentiation of mesenchymal precursors into adipocytes through its isoforms, which are influenced by alternative splicing (Hu2022RUNX1T1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RUNX1T1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion gene, resulting from the t(8;21) translocation, is a common chromosomal rearrangement in AML, particularly in pediatric cases. This fusion gene disrupts normal hematopoiesis by affecting chromatin accessibility and transcription factor occupation, leading to changes in gene expression that promote leukemic self-renewal and proliferation (Kanellou2023Deregulated; Swart2021The). The RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion is also implicated in blocking differentiation and promoting proliferation by controlling growth factor and cell cycle genes (Swart2021The).

In addition to its role in AML, RUNX1T1 mutations can lead to other hematological disorders. Chromosomal anomalies affecting RUNX1T1 have been linked to bone marrow failure syndromes and severe aplastic anemia, where deregulated expression contributes to hypo-expression in bone marrow (Valli2018Bone). RUNX1T1 is also involved in neurogenesis and intestinal development, with mutations potentially causing intellectual disabilities and significant intestinal defects due to impaired stem cell differentiation (Hu2022RUNX1T1). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance and its potential as a therapeutic target in various conditions.

## Interactions
The RUNX1T1 gene, also known as ETO, encodes a transcriptional co-repressor that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function. RUNX1T1 contains several conserved domains, including Nervy homology regions (NHR1-4), which facilitate interactions with multiple proteins. NHR1 interacts with E-proteins, while NHR2 assists in forming dimers with MTG family members and interacts with mSin3a to recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) (Hu2022RUNX1T1). RUNX1T1 also binds to nuclear receptor corepressors (N-CoR) and SMRT through its zinc finger region, recruiting HDACs to mediate transcriptional repression (Gelmetti1998Aberrant).

The RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion protein, resulting from the t(8;21) translocation, retains the ability to interact with corepressors and HDACs, forming complexes that repress transcription (Lutterbach1998ETO). This fusion protein also interacts with several transcription factors, including CBFβ, GATA1, CEBPA, and PU.1, and forms complexes with E proteins TCF3 and TCF12, LYL1, and bridging factors LMO2 and LDB1 (Swart2021The). These interactions are mediated through the NHR1 and NHR2 domains, which prevent the recruitment of p300/CBF co-activators, although p300 can modulate RUNX1/RUNX1T1 activity by acetylating its N-terminal lysine residues (Swart2021The).
