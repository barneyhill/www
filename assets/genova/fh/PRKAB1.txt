# PRKAB1

## Overview
The PRKAB1 gene encodes the protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit beta 1, which is a regulatory component of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex. AMPK is a critical enzyme in cellular energy homeostasis, acting as a sensor and regulator of energy balance within the cell. The protein encoded by PRKAB1, categorized as a kinase regulatory subunit, plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity and localization of the AMPK complex. It contains a carbohydrate-binding module that interacts with glycogen and is involved in the binding of synthetic AMPK activators, influencing the enzyme's activity in response to cellular energy levels (Polekhina2003AMPK; Ross2016AMP‐activated). The PRKAB1 gene and its encoded protein are integral to various metabolic processes, including mitochondrial biogenesis and insulin sensitivity, and have been implicated in the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes (Sun2006Haplotype; Ziegler2020AMPKβ1). Despite its significant role in energy regulation, variations in PRKAB1 have not been conclusively linked to specific metabolic disorders, although they may influence body mass index and cardiac development (Sun2006Haplotype; Ziegler2020AMPKβ1).

## Structure
The PRKAB1 gene encodes the beta 1 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is a crucial component of the heterotrimeric AMPK complex. This subunit includes a conserved MGNXXS sequence at the N-terminus, which is a consensus site for N-myristoylation, a post-translational modification important for the protein's function, affecting its localization and activity in response to cellular energy changes (Ross2016AMP‐activated). The beta 1 subunit also contains a central carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), part of the CBM48 family, which binds polyglucans such as glycogen. This module is involved in the binding of synthetic allosteric AMPK activators and is stabilized by autophosphorylation of Ser108 (Ross2016AMP‐activated).

The glycogen-binding domain (GBD) within the beta 1 subunit is crucial for its interaction with glycogen, and specific residues such as W100, K126, W133, and G147 are essential for this binding (Polekhina2003AMPK). The beta subunit acts as a scaffold, facilitating the assembly of the AMPK complex by bridging the alpha and gamma subunits (Hardie2007AMPactivatedSNF1). The PRKAB1 protein's structure and interactions are vital for its role in cellular energy sensing and regulation.

## Function
The PRKAB1 gene encodes the β1 regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is a heterotrimeric enzyme complex composed of an α catalytic subunit and β and γ regulatory subunits. The β1 subunit, encoded by PRKAB1, plays a crucial role in modulating AMPK activity and its distribution within the cell. It is involved in the regulation of energy balance by interacting with glycogen or glycogen-debranching enzymes, which influences the overall activity of the AMPK complex (Sun2006Haplotype).

AMPK is activated in response to cellular energy depletion, leading to various metabolic effects, including mitochondrial biogenesis and improved insulin sensitivity. This activation is also stimulated by antidiabetic medications such as metformin and thiazolidinediones (Sun2006Haplotype). In human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), the presence of AMPKβ1 is important for proper cardiac differentiation, as its absence impairs the maturation of cardiomyocytes, affecting the expression of key cardiac transcription factors and proteins essential for cardiac contractility (Ziegler2020AMPKβ1). Despite its significant role in cellular energy regulation, the knockout of PRKAB1 in hiPSCs does not drastically alter basal AMPK activity or major downstream pathways, indicating a unique physiological role for AMPKβ1-containing trimers (Ziegler2020AMPKβ1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PRKAB1 gene, which encodes the β1 regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), have been studied in the context of various metabolic disorders. Although PRKAB1 is located under a type 2 diabetes linkage peak on chromosome 12q24.1, studies have not found a significant association between common variants in PRKAB1 and type 2 diabetes, fasting plasma glucose, or insulin sensitivity (Sun2006Haplotype). However, some nominal associations with body mass index (BMI) have been observed, though these may be due to statistical noise (Sun2006Haplotype).

In the context of cardiac development, PRKAB1 plays a role in the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes. Deficiency in PRKAB1 impairs this differentiation process, affecting the expression of genes and proteins associated with cardiac differentiation, such as TNNT2 and SIRPA (Ziegler2020AMPKβ1). This suggests that alterations in PRKAB1 expression could potentially impact cardiac development and function, although the specific clinical implications require further investigation (Ziegler2020AMPKβ1). Despite its involvement in these processes, no direct link between PRKAB1 mutations and specific diseases has been conclusively established (Ziegler2020AMPKβ1).

## Interactions
PRKAB1, a regulatory subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), plays a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis by forming a heterotrimeric complex with the catalytic alpha subunit (PRKAA) and the gamma subunit (PRKAG). This complex is involved in various protein interactions that influence metabolic pathways. The beta subunit, including PRKAB1, contains a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) that interacts with glycogen and forms part of the binding site for synthetic AMPK activators. This site is stabilized by autophosphorylation of Ser108 on the CBM, which interacts with conserved lysines on the alpha subunit, suggesting a role in AMPK's regulation and interaction with other cellular components (Ross2016AMP‐activated).

PRKAB1 is also involved in the relocalization of AMPK to lysosomes in response to glucose starvation, potentially increasing Thr172 phosphorylation and AMPK activation. This process is facilitated by N-myristoylation of the beta subunits, which may assist in binding AMPK to mitochondrial membranes, playing a role in autophagy (Ross2016AMP‐activated). Additionally, PRKAB1 interacts with the kinase domain (KD) of AMPK, and its activity is influenced by the binding of nucleotides like AMP and ADP to the gamma subunit, promoting phosphorylation and protecting against dephosphorylation of Thr172 (Garcia2017AMPK:).
