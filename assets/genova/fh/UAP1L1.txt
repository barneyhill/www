# UAP1L1

## Overview
UAP1L1 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the biosynthesis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, a crucial substrate for glycosylation processes. The protein, categorized as a nucleotide sugar pyrophosphorylase, plays a significant role in cellular metabolism by contributing to the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are vital for cell signaling and structural integrity (Wu2022Identification). UAP1L1 shares sequence similarity with UAP1, another enzyme involved in the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Wu2022Identification). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as CDCA8 and O-GlcNAc transferase, further highlight its role in modulating cell cycle regulation and glycosylation, processes that are particularly relevant in the context of cancer progression (Wu2022Identification; Sun2021OGlcNAcylation).

## Function
UAP1L1 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1 like 1) is a gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, a key substrate in glycosylation processes. Glycosylation is a critical post-translational modification that affects various cellular functions, including protein folding, stability, and cell signaling. UAP1L1 shares significant sequence identity with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase-1 (UAP1), which is directly involved in the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, a sugar donor essential for protein glycosylation (Wu2022Identification).

In healthy human cells, UAP1L1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids. These molecules are essential for maintaining cell signaling and structural integrity. The protein's involvement in glycosylation processes underscores its importance in cellular metabolism and the maintenance of normal cellular functions. Changes in glycosylation patterns can have significant implications for cell biology, influencing cell growth, differentiation, and communication. The activity of UAP1L1 in these processes highlights its role in ensuring proper cellular function and organismal homeostasis (Xiao2021Silencing).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
UAP1L1, a protein involved in nucleotide sugar metabolism, participates in several significant protein interactions. It has been shown to interact with CDCA8, a protein involved in cell cycle regulation. This interaction is crucial for promoting cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of UAP1L1 results in decreased CDCA8 expression, which inhibits cancer cell proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis (Wu2022Identification).

UAP1L1 also interacts with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), enhancing its activity despite having little UAP1 activity itself. This interaction increases cellular O-GlcNAcylation, which is significant in the context of liver cancer, where UAP1L1 is upregulated. The interaction with OGT is essential for maintaining OGT activity through direct binding, as demonstrated in HepG2 cells (Sun2021OGlcNAcylation; King2019Molecular).

These interactions highlight UAP1L1's role in modulating key cellular processes, such as cell cycle regulation and glycosylation, which are critical in cancer progression. The protein's ability to influence these pathways through its interactions underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer.
