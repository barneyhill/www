# ANKMY2

## Overview
ANKMY2 is a human gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and MYND domain containing 2, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and a MYND domain. These structural motifs are integral to the protein's function, facilitating protein-protein interactions and transcriptional regulation. The ankyrin repeats are known for their role in mediating interactions with other proteins, while the MYND domain is a zinc-binding motif that contributes to transcriptional regulation. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular signaling pathways, and plays a role in the transport of cilia-targeted proteins, impacting phototransduction and ciliary function. ANKMY2's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases related to ciliary dysfunction and neurological disorders (Lin2020Circular; Jensen2010Localization).

## Structure
ANKMY2 is a human gene encoding a protein that features ankyrin repeat and MYND domains. The ankyrin repeats are structural motifs known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for the protein's functional role in cellular processes. The MYND domain is a zinc-binding motif that plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation, suggesting that ANKMY2 may be involved in modulating gene expression through its interactions with other proteins.

The protein's structure is likely influenced by these domains, which contribute to its ability to interact with various molecular partners. The presence of ankyrin repeats and MYND domains suggests a complex tertiary structure that allows for specific binding and regulatory functions. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination, could further modulate the protein's activity, stability, and localization within the cell. Additionally, splice variants of ANKMY2 may exist, potentially leading to isoforms with distinct functional properties or cellular localizations, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The combination of these structural features underscores the protein's potential versatility and importance in cellular signaling and regulation.

## Function
ANKMY2 (ankyrin repeat and MYND domain containing 2) encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through its involvement in intracellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and a MYND domain, both of which are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions. These structural features enable ANKMY2 to participate in complex cellular networks, influencing gene expression and cellular responses.

In healthy human cells, ANKMY2 is active in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Its activity in these cellular compartments suggests a role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. By modulating intracellular signaling pathways, ANKMY2 contributes to cellular differentiation and development, processes essential for the proper functioning and maintenance of tissues and organs.

The protein's ability to influence cellular responses and gene expression highlights its potential involvement in critical biological processes. Understanding the function of ANKMY2 can provide insights into its role in maintaining cellular equilibrium and its implications in disease mechanisms, should its normal function be disrupted.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the ANKMY2 gene have been implicated in several human diseases, particularly those related to ciliary function. ANKMY2 is suggested to play a role in the transport of cilia-targeted guanylyl cyclases, such as GC1, in mammals. Disruptions in this process may contribute to phototransduction defects and are associated with retinopathies and other ciliopathies, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome, obesity, situs inversus, and polycystic kidney disease (Jensen2010Localization). The gene's involvement in cyclic GMP signaling, crucial for vision, hints at its potential role in human retinal diseases (Jensen2010Localization).

In the context of neurological disorders, the circular RNA form of ANKMY2, known as circ_ANKMY2, has been studied in relation to temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). It is downregulated in TLE tissues, and its overexpression has been shown to decrease seizure activity, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for epilepsy (Lin2020Circular). Circ_ANKMY2 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-106b-5p, influencing the expression of FOXP1, which is involved in the modulation of TLE progression (Lin2020Circular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ANKMY2 in both ciliary and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
ANKMY2, a protein containing ankyrin repeat and MYND domains, is involved in several protein-protein interactions. It has been shown to interact with the retinal-specific guanylyl cyclase GC1, a mammalian homolog of the C. elegans guanylyl cyclase DAF-11, indicating a conserved functional interaction in ciliated sensory cells (Jensen2010Localization). This interaction suggests that ANKMY2 may play a role in the transport of cilia-targeted proteins in mammals, potentially impacting phototransduction and being associated with retinopathies and other ciliopathies (Jensen2010Localization).

ANKMY2 also interacts with the 4×PXLE peptide, a motif involved in protein interactions, although this interaction is not inhibited by certain small-molecule inhibitors that target similar domains in other proteins, indicating specificity in its binding properties (Arsenault2016Identification). The MYND domain of ANKMY2 is implicated in these interactions, as MYND domains are known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Jensen2010Localization).

ANKMY2's role in ciliary regulation extends to its involvement in the hedgehog signaling pathway, where it influences cAMP-protein kinase A signaling, crucial for GLI-R generation, affecting tissue morphogenesis (Hwang2023Contextdependent).
