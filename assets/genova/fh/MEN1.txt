# MEN1

## Overview
The MEN1 gene is a critical component of human genetics, encoding the protein menin, which functions primarily as a tumor suppressor. Menin is a nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle control. It is characterized by its interaction with multiple proteins, such as those in the histone methyltransferase complex, influencing gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. Menin's role as a scaffold protein in histone methylation processes underscores its importance in epigenetic regulation. Mutations in the MEN1 gene are linked to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1 syndrome), an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes individuals to tumors in endocrine glands and other tissues. The gene's function and its associated clinical implications highlight its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Thakker2014Multiple; Balogh2006Menin; Lemos2008Multiple).

## Structure
The MEN1 gene encodes the protein menin, which is composed of 610 amino acids and functions as a tumor suppressor. Menin's molecular structure is characterized by several distinct domains, including an N-terminal domain, a transglutaminase-like domain, a helical palm domain, and a C-terminal fingers domain. These domains contribute to its rectangular shape, which resembles a curved left hand, with a deep pocket formed by the thumb and palm domains. This pocket is crucial for binding interactions with other proteins, such as MLL1 and JunD, which are involved in transcription regulation (Huang2012The).

The secondary structure of menin includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its globular tertiary structure. Menin does not typically form quaternary structures. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common and play a role in its function (Balogh2006Menin).

Mutations in menin, particularly missense mutations, can disrupt its interactions with other proteins, leading to a loss of function. These mutations are often located in solvent-inaccessible regions, which are critical for maintaining protein stability and function (Caswell2019Using). The structural integrity of menin is essential for its role in transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression.

## Function
The MEN1 gene encodes the protein menin, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and cell cycle control. Menin acts as a tumor suppressor and is primarily located in the nucleus of cells, where it interacts with multiple proteins to maintain genomic stability and regulate cell proliferation (Thakker2014Multiple; Balogh2006Menin).

Menin interacts with the activator of S-phase kinase (ASK), a component of the Cdc7/ASK kinase complex, which is essential for DNA replication and cell proliferation. This interaction is mediated by the COOH terminus of menin and is crucial for repressing ASK-induced cell proliferation, thereby preventing tumorigenesis (Schnepp2004Functional).

Menin also plays a role in epigenetic regulation by serving as a scaffold protein in histone methylation processes. It is part of histone methyltransferase complexes, such as those involving mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) proteins, which methylate histone H3K4, a modification linked to transcriptional activation. This regulation influences the expression of genes like Hox homeobox genes and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as p27 and p18, which are important for cell cycle control (Thakker2014Multiple; Balogh2006Menin).

In addition, menin interacts with transcription factors such as JunD, repressing their transcriptional activation, which is part of its tumor suppressor function (Agarwal1999Menin). These interactions and functions highlight menin's integral role in maintaining normal cell cycle progression and genomic stability in healthy human cells (Balogh2006Menin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MEN1 gene, which encodes the protein menin, are primarily associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1 syndrome). This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by the development of tumors in various endocrine glands, including the parathyroid, pancreas, and anterior pituitary (Lemos2008Multiple; Kamilaris2019Multiple). The most common manifestation is primary hyperparathyroidism, occurring in over 90% of patients, often leading to hypercalcemia (SchernthanerReiter2015MEN1). Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) and pituitary adenomas are also prevalent, with PNETs occurring in up to 75% of patients (SchernthanerReiter2015MEN1).

MEN1 mutations can also lead to non-endocrine tumors, such as lipomas, angiofibromas, and collagenomas (Kamilaris2019Multiple). The syndrome is associated with a high degree of penetrance, with most patients showing symptoms by the fifth decade of life (Lemos2008Multiple). The MEN1 gene acts as a tumor suppressor, and tumorigenesis often follows Knudson's two-hit hypothesis, where loss of heterozygosity or other mutations lead to tumor development (Lemos2008Multiple). Despite the identification of numerous mutations, there is no clear phenotype-genotype correlation, complicating clinical management (Lemos2008Multiple).

## Interactions
The MEN1 gene encodes the protein menin, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression. Menin is a component of the histone methyltransferase complex, interacting with trithorax family proteins such as MLL1, MLL2, Ash2L, and Rbbp5. This complex is responsible for methylating histone H3 on lysine 4, a modification associated with transcriptional activation (Hughes2004Menin; Milne2005Menin). Menin also interacts with the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, specifically its carboxyl-terminal domain phosphorylated on Ser 5, indicating a role in transcriptional regulation (Hughes2004Menin).

Menin binds to transcription factors such as JunD, NF-kB, and Smad3, influencing gene expression. Its interaction with Smad3 is significant in the context of TGF-β signaling, where it modulates transcriptional responses (Kaji2001Inactivation). Menin also acts as a molecular adaptor linking MLL proteins with LEDGF, a chromatin-associated protein, which is crucial for MLL-dependent transcription and leukemic transformation (Yokoyama2008Menin). These interactions highlight menin's role in both tumor suppression and oncogenic processes.
