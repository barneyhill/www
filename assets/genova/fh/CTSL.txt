# CTSL

## Overview
Cathepsin L (CTSL) is a gene that encodes the lysosomal cysteine protease known as cathepsin L, a member of the papain-like protease family. This enzyme is involved in various physiological processes, including protein degradation, antigen presentation, and tissue remodeling. Cathepsin L is characterized by its ability to cleave a wide range of substrates, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating immune responses (Turk2012Cysteine; Reiser2010Specialized). The gene is highly conserved across species, reflecting its essential role in biological systems (Chen2020Characterization). Dysregulation of CTSL expression or activity is associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer progression and viral infections, highlighting its clinical significance (ZHANG2014Overexpression; Li2020Genomic).

## Structure
Cathepsin L (CTSL) is a lysosomal cysteine protease characterized by a polypeptide chain that includes a signal peptide and a propeptide, which are essential for its proper localization and activation. The primary structure of CTSL is highly conserved across species, as evidenced by the high homology observed in comparative studies with other species such as humans, zebrafish, and channel catfish (Chen2020Characterization).

The secondary structure of CTSL includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a papain-like fold typical of cysteine proteases. This structural motif is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing the protein to interact with substrates effectively (Cheng2006Cystatin). The tertiary structure of CTSL is further stabilized by conserved domains such as the signal peptide, inhibitor_I29, and Pept_C1 domains, which are critical for its function and regulation (Chen2020Characterization).

CTSL can exist in different forms, including one-chain and two-chain mature forms, both of which are inhibited by cystatin M/E, highlighting its regulatory mechanisms (Cheng2006Cystatin). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in CTSL, influencing its stability and activity. These modifications are essential for its role in various physiological processes, including tissue degradation and extracellular matrix remodeling.

## Function
Cathepsin L (CTSL) is a cysteine protease that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily located in the lysosomal compartment, where it is involved in protein degradation and turnover, contributing to cellular homeostasis (Reiser2010Specialized). CTSL is crucial for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-mediated antigen presentation, where it degrades the invariant chain to generate antigenic peptides for recognition by CD4+ T cells, a process essential for adaptive immunity (Turk2012Cysteine; Müller2012Specific).

CTSL also plays a role in the regulation of cell-cycle progression and chromatin remodeling by processing histones in the nucleus, particularly during embryonic stem cell differentiation (Turk2012Cysteine; Reiser2010Specialized). In the extracellular matrix, CTSL is involved in remodeling by cleaving proteins such as fibronectin and collagen, which is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity (Reiser2010Specialized).

In the heart, CTSL regulates myocardial remodeling and is essential for normal cardiac function. Its deficiency can lead to conditions resembling human dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its role in maintaining cardiac structure and function (Luft2009From; Reiser2010Specialized). Overall, CTSL is vital for maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis through its diverse proteolytic activities.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the CTSL gene have significant clinical implications. In mice, a deficiency in CTSL leads to the furless phenotype, characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and disruption of hair follicle cycling. This is due to a G-to-A transition mutation in exon 5 of the CTSL gene, resulting in an arginine for glycine substitution at position 149, which inactivates the enzyme's activity (Roth2000Cathepsin). Although no human disorder with similar characteristics has been identified, the mutation's impact on skin and hair follicle physiology in mice suggests potential relevance to human conditions (Roth2000Cathepsin).

In cancer, CTSL is often overexpressed and is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. In ovarian cancer, CTSL expression is significantly higher in malignant tumors compared to benign ones and is linked to advanced clinical stages and lymph node metastasis. It serves as an independent prognostic factor, with higher expression correlating with poorer survival outcomes (ZHANG2014Overexpression). CTSL also plays a role in non-small cell lung cancer, where it is activated by mutant p53, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and potentially contributing to cancer progression (Wang2019Cathepsin).

CTSL is also implicated in viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, where it facilitates viral entry into host cells. Its expression is upregulated in several cancers, which may increase susceptibility to infection (Li2020Genomic).

## Interactions
Cathepsin L (CTSL) is known to participate in several protein interactions that are significant in various biological processes. In the context of breast cancer, CTSL has been shown to physically interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 2-associated protein 1 (CDK2-AP1), a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. This interaction was confirmed using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, which demonstrated a direct binding between CTSL and CDK2-AP1. The study found that high CTSL expression is inversely associated with CDK2-AP1 expression, suggesting a regulatory balance between these proteins in tumorigenesis (Wang2019Cathepsin�L).

In addition to its role in cancer, CTSL is involved in immune responses. In turbot, CTSL genes have been shown to interact with proteins involved in apoptosis regulation and caspase activation, such as survivin, birc2, and bcl2l1. These interactions suggest that CTSL may play a role in signal transduction pathways associated with immunity (Chen2020Characterization). The protein-protein interaction network analysis supports the involvement of CTSL in these processes, highlighting its potential regulatory functions in immune defense (Chen2020Characterization).
