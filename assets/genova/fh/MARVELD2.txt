# MARVELD2

## Overview
The MARVELD2 gene encodes the protein tricellulin, which is a critical component of the tight junction-associated MARVEL-domain proteins (TAMPs) family. Tricellulin is characterized by its MARVEL domain, which includes four transmembrane α-helices, and is primarily localized at tricellular tight junctions where three cells converge. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers by regulating the paracellular flux of ions and solutes, which is essential for the proper function of various tissues, including the inner ear (Heymans2021Spatiotemporal; Mašindová2015MARVELD2). Mutations in the MARVELD2 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, highlighting its significance in auditory function (Nayak2015Molecular). Tricellulin's interactions with other tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and MarvelD3, further underscore its role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and cellular organization (Vellanki2016The).

## Structure
The MARVELD2 gene encodes the protein tricellulin, which is a member of the Tight Junction Associated MARVEL Proteins (TAMP) family. Tricellulin is characterized by the presence of a MARVEL domain, which includes four transmembrane α-helices that span the lipid bilayer in an M-shape (Heymans2021Spatiotemporal). This domain is involved in tight junction function and membrane fusion events. Tricellulin shares 32% homology with occludin, another TAMP family member, and can compensate for the lack of occludin by relocating to bicellular tight junctions (Goncalves2022Transgenic).

The protein is specifically localized at tricellular tight junctions, where three cells meet, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of these junctions. A novel deletion in the MARVELD2 gene, resulting in the loss of exons 4 and 5, leads to an in-frame deletion of 107 amino acids (p.Cys395-Gln501del) in the protein, affecting the occludin-ELL domain at the carboxy-end of tricellulin. This deletion impairs the protein's proper localization to tricellular tight junctions, highlighting the importance of this region for its function (Nayak2015Molecular). Tricellulin may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which can affect its function in epithelial barrier integrity (Wendrich2024Discovery).

## Function
The MARVELD2 gene encodes tricellulin, a protein integral to the formation and function of tricellular tight junctions (tTJs) in epithelial cells. Tricellulin is primarily located at these junctions, where three cells meet, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the epithelial barrier's integrity. This protein is essential for regulating the paracellular flux of ions and solutes, which is vital for maintaining the ion composition of inner ear fluids, thereby supporting proper hearing function (Mašindová2015MARVELD2; Nayak2015Molecular).

Tricellulin is part of the MARVEL protein family, characterized by four transmembrane domains, and is involved in maintaining cellular organization and signaling. It binds directly to other tight junction proteins like ZO-1 and MarvelD3, although it does not physically interact with occludin. When occludin is silenced, tricellulin relocates to bicellular tight junctions, indicating occludin's role in maintaining tricellular junctions (Vellanki2016The).

In healthy cells, tricellulin's proper localization to the basolateral membrane and enrichment at tricellular junctions is crucial for its function. Mutations in MARVELD2 can lead to mislocalization of tricellulin, disrupting its ability to maintain the barrier function of epithelial layers (Nayak2015Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MARVELD2 gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, specifically linked to the DFNB49 locus. This condition is characterized by bilateral, prelingual, moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss. The gene encodes tricellulin, a protein crucial for maintaining the integrity of tricellular tight junctions in epithelial cells, including those in the inner ear (Mašindová2015MARVELD2; Nayak2015Molecular).

Several specific mutations in MARVELD2 have been identified in different populations. The c.1331+1G>A mutation has been reported in Iranian and Pakistani families, leading to hearing loss with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern (A; p&gt; Sadeghi2020&lt). Another mutation, c.1331+2T>C, has been found in the Czech Roma population and is associated with congenital, profound sensorineural hearing loss (Šafka2011DFNB49). This mutation is prevalent among the Roma population in Central Europe, suggesting a common ancestral origin (Mašindová2015MARVELD2).

In addition to hearing loss, alterations in MARVELD2 expression or interactions may impact epithelial barrier function, although no other clinical manifestations have been observed in human subjects (Nayak2015Molecular). The gene's role in maintaining epithelial barriers underscores its importance in auditory function and potentially other conditions.

## Interactions
Tricellulin, encoded by the MARVELD2 gene, is a crucial component of tricellular tight junctions and interacts with several other tight junction proteins. It is part of the tight junction-associated MARVEL-domain proteins (TAMPs) family, which includes occludin and marvelD3. Tricellulin interacts with the plaque protein ZO-1 and marvelD3, but it does not directly interact with occludin. However, the localization of tricellulin is affected by occludin silencing, indicating an indirect relationship between these proteins (Raleigh2010Tight; Vellanki2016The).

The interactions of tricellulin are significant for maintaining the integrity of epithelial barriers. The carboxy-terminal tail of tricellulin does not bind to the VSVG-ZO-1-GuK domain, suggesting it may interact with ZO-1 at another site (Raleigh2010Tight). This interaction is crucial for the assembly and function of tight junctions, as ZO-1 links transmembrane proteins to the cytoskeleton and helps form multiprotein complexes at the cytoplasmic side of tight junctions (Heinemann2019Structural).

These interactions highlight the nonredundant roles of TAMPs in tight junction formation and function, with tricellulin playing a distinct role in epithelial barrier maintenance (Raleigh2010Tight).
