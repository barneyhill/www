# SKI

## Overview
The SKI gene encodes the SKI proto-oncogene, a nuclear protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional co-repressor. This protein is integral to the regulation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, where it modulates gene expression by interacting with Smad proteins and recruiting corepressors and histone deacetylases. The SKI protein is characterized by its ability to form dimers and higher-order oligomers, facilitated by structural motifs such as a leucine zipper and tandem repeats in its carboxyl-terminal region. These structural features are essential for its role in transcriptional repression and cellular signaling. SKI is involved in various physiological processes, including embryonic development and metabolism, and its dysregulation is associated with conditions such as Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome and several cancers. The dual role of SKI as both a proto-oncogene and a tumor suppressor underscores its complex involvement in cellular homeostasis and disease (Heyman1994A; TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional; Liao2021Ski:).

## Structure
The SKI proto-oncogene encodes a nuclear protein that functions as a transcription factor and is involved in cellular transformation and myogenesis. The primary structure of the SKI protein includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific structural motifs essential for its function. The carboxyl-terminal region of SKI is crucial for its dimerization capabilities, containing a helical motif with five tandem repeats of 25 amino acids necessary for dimerization, and a leucine zipper motif that enhances dimer formation (Heyman1994A).

The secondary structure of SKI includes alpha-helical regions, particularly in the carboxyl-terminal domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions. This region is responsible for forming homodimers and heterodimers with the related protein SnoN (Heyman1994A). The leucine zipper-like structure in this region facilitates these interactions (Heyman1994A).

The tertiary structure of SKI is characterized by an extended alpha helix with tandem repeats and a leucine zipper, which are crucial for its dimerization and biological activity (Heyman1994A). The quaternary structure involves the formation of dimers and potentially higher-order oligomers, such as trimers, through interactions with other proteins like SnoN (Nagase1993Complex). The ability to form these complexes is essential for SKI's function as a transcription factor.

## Function
The SKI proto-oncogene encodes a protein that functions as a transcriptional co-repressor, primarily involved in the regulation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, SKI interacts with Smad proteins to inhibit the formation of R-Smad/Smad4 complexes, thereby preventing the transcription of TGF-β target genes. This action is facilitated by the recruitment of corepressors and histone deacetylases, which repress gene transcription (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional; Schepers2014The).

SKI is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. It is involved in various physiological processes, including the development of the central nervous system, skeletal muscle, and limbs during embryogenesis. SKI also influences myelination in the peripheral nervous system by regulating Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional).

In addition to its role in development, SKI affects metabolism by decreasing body fat mass and enhancing the oxidative metabolism of fatty acids. It also modulates the expression of genes involved in myeloid differentiation and inhibits erythroid differentiation (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional). SKI's regulatory functions are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper organismal development (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SKI proto-oncogene are associated with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS), a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by craniofacial, skeletal, and cardiovascular abnormalities. These mutations primarily occur in the R-SMAD binding domain of SKI, which is crucial for TGF-β signaling. The mutations lead to the stabilization of SKI, resulting in attenuated TGF-β responses, contrary to the enhanced signaling seen in related syndromes like Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes (Gori2020Mutations; Schepers2014The). 

In addition to SGS, SKI dysregulation is implicated in various cancers. SKI acts as both a proto-oncogene and a tumor suppressor, with its expression levels influencing cancer progression and prognosis. In cancers such as esophageal, liver, and colorectal cancer, SKI is often upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Liao2021Ski:). 

SKI's role in cancer is complex, as it can promote tumor growth by enhancing stem cell properties and inhibiting apoptosis, while its downregulation can increase the antiproliferative activity of cancer cells through the TGF-β signaling pathway (TecalcoCruz2018Transcriptional; Liao2021Ski:).

## Interactions
The SKI proto-oncogene protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional repression and cellular signaling. SKI is a component of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex and interacts with nuclear hormone receptor corepressors such as N-CoR and SMRT, as well as the mammalian Sin3 ortholog mSin3A. These interactions are crucial for transcriptional repression mediated by the HDAC complex, particularly in the context of Mad and thyroid hormone receptor signaling (Nomura1999Ski).

SKI also interacts with Smad proteins, specifically Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, which are key components of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This interaction represses the transcriptional activation abilities of Smad proteins by recruiting N-CoR and possibly its associated HDAC complex, thereby inhibiting TGF-β-induced gene transcription (Luo1999The).

In addition to these interactions, SKI binds to the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and thyroid hormone receptor (TR), mediating transcriptional inhibition by interacting with their ligand-binding regions. This suggests a role for SKI in inhibiting nuclear hormone receptor signaling (Liao2021Ski:). These interactions highlight SKI's multifaceted role in regulating gene transcription and expression.
