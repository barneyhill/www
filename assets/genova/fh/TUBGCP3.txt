# TUBGCP3

## Overview
TUBGCP3 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin gamma complex component 3, a critical element of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation and organization within cells. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the γ-TuRC, playing a pivotal role in the formation and stabilization of microtubules at microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) such as the centrosome. TUBGCP3, through its interactions with other gamma-tubulin complex proteins, contributes to the assembly of the γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC) and the larger γ-TuRC, facilitating processes like mitotic spindle formation and chromosome segregation during cell division (Rafi2020The; TeixidóTravesa2012The). The protein's involvement in these fundamental cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular structure and function, with implications for cell cycle progression and centrosome integrity (Ramesh2023Prediction).

## Structure
TUBGCP3, a component of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), plays a crucial role in microtubule nucleation. The protein is characterized by the presence of GRIP domains, specifically the GRIP1 and GRIP2 motifs, which are involved in γ-tubulin binding and lateral interactions within the complex (Kollman2011Microtubule). The GRIP2 domain, in particular, is noted for its role in γ-tubulin interaction, distinguishing TUBGCP3 from other GCPs (Consolati2020Microtubule).

Structurally, TUBGCP3 forms a stable heterodimer with GCP2, contributing to the V-shaped structure of the γ-tubulin small complex (γTuSC) (Kollman2011Microtubule). This dimerization is facilitated by interactions at their amino-terminal domains, while the carboxy-terminal domains interact with γ-tubulin (Kollman2011Microtubule). TUBGCP3 also exhibits a unique α-helical extension in its C-terminal region, which is crucial for its function within the γ-TuRC (Consolati2020Microtubule).

The protein's flexibility, particularly a hinge-like motion, is essential for the conformational changes required for microtubule nucleation (Kollman2011Microtubule). TUBGCP3 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the γ-TuRC (Kollman2011Microtubule).

## Function
TUBGCP3 encodes a protein that is a critical component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which plays a vital role in microtubule nucleation at microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), such as the centrosome. This protein is involved in the structural integrity of the γ-TuRC, which is essential for the nucleation and organization of microtubules, a process crucial for cell division and intracellular transport (TeixidóTravesa2012The). TUBGCP3, along with other gamma-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs), forms part of the gamma-tubulin small complexes (γ-TuSCs), which are necessary for the assembly and function of the γ-TuRC (TeixidóTravesa2012The).

The protein is active in the centrosome, where it contributes to the formation of the mitotic spindle, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Rafi2020The). TUBGCP3 is also involved in the regulation of microtubule nucleation through interactions with other proteins, such as CDK5RAP2, which can activate γ-TuRC nucleation activity (TeixidóTravesa2012The). The protein's role in microtubule organization is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function, impacting processes like cell cycle progression and centrosome function (Ramesh2023Prediction).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TUBGCP3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, the circular RNA circTUBGCP3 is up-regulated and promotes cell proliferation, migration, and survivability by acting as a sponge for miR-30b. This interaction affects the expression of proteins like Vimentin, which are associated with cell motility and cancer metastasis, suggesting that circTUBGCP3 serves as a tumor promoter in osteosarcoma (Circular; Xu2020&lt; p&gt).

In mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), TUBGCP3 is more highly expressed in tetraploid samples compared to diploid ones. This overexpression is linked to centrosome aberrations, which can lead to aneuploidy and contribute to the aggressive nature of certain MCL subtypes. The study suggests that the high expression levels of TUBGCP3 and related proteins are associated with genetic instability and tumor progression in MCL (Neben2007Expression).

While the specific roles of TUBGCP3 mutations in human diseases are not fully detailed, its involvement in centrosome function and cell cycle regulation indicates potential implications in conditions associated with centrosome dysfunction (Li2019Tubgcp3).

## Interactions
TUBGCP3, a component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), plays a crucial role in microtubule nucleation and organization. It interacts with other gamma-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs) such as TUBGCP2, TUBGCP4, TUBGCP5, and TUBGCP6 to form the γ-TuRC, which is essential for mitotic spindle formation and cell cycle progression (Li2019Tubgcp3; Würtz2022Modular). TUBGCP3 is part of the γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC), which includes γ-tubulin and TUBGCP2, and is involved in the assembly of the larger γ-TuRC (Li2019Tubgcp3).

The MZT1-GCP3 module, which includes TUBGCP3, is involved in forming the lumenal bridge of the γ-TuRC, indicating specific binding sites for these modules (Würtz2022Modular). TUBGCP3 also interacts with γ-tubulin through its C-terminal domain, a critical interaction for the correct distribution of γ-tubulin and centrioles during mitosis (Li2019Tubgcp3).

In the context of viral interactions, the SARS-CoV-2 M protein has been shown to interact with TUBGCP3, potentially inhibiting microtubule nucleation and affecting cell cycle progression (Barh2021Potential). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of TUBGCP3 in cellular processes and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
