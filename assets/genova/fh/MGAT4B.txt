# MGAT4B

## Overview
MGAT4B is a gene that encodes the enzyme alpha-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 4-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase B, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the N-glycosylation pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to mannose residues on glycoproteins within the Golgi apparatus, playing a critical role in the branching and processing of N-glycans. The activity of this enzyme is essential for the structural and functional integrity of glycoproteins and glycolipids, impacting various cellular processes such as protein folding, transport, and cell-cell interactions (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). MGAT4B forms specific sub-complexes with other glycosyltransferases, facilitating the efficient synthesis of complex N-glycans, although it does not interact with MGAT5, indicating distinct functional pathways (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Abbott2008Focused; Tang2023Transcriptomic).

## Structure


## Function
MGAT4B encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the N-glycosylation pathway, specifically in the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to mannose residues on glycoproteins. This enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the branching and processing of N-glycans, which are essential for converting high mannose N-glycans to complex N-glycans (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are important for various cellular functions, including protein folding, transport, and cell-cell interactions (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases).

MGAT4B interacts with other glycosyltransferases, such as MGAT1 and MAN2A2, forming specific sub-complexes that facilitate the efficient synthesis of complex N-glycans (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). However, it does not interact with MGAT5, indicating that MGAT5 functions independently (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). The enzyme's role in glycosylation is crucial for proper protein folding and stability, impacting cellular functions like growth and immune response (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). In mice, MGAT4B is involved in the formation of the β(1,4)GlcNAc branch on N-glycans, although its distribution is more restricted compared to MGAT4A, and it does not compensate for MGAT4A loss in the pancreas (Stanley2016What).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MGAT4B gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of cancer, MGAT4B expression is elevated in certain types of tumors, such as endometrioid ovarian carcinoma, where it contributes to the formation of more branched complex N-linked glycans, potentially affecting tumor progression and metastasis (Abbott2008Focused). Similarly, MGAT4B is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Takamatsu2009Physiological).

In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), MGAT4B is identified as a prognostic marker, with higher expression levels associated with a better prognosis. This suggests that MGAT4B may play a protective role in COAD (Ma2022Identification).

A specific mutation in MGAT4B, p.Arg373Trp, has been identified in the Danish population and is predicted to affect the enzyme's function, potentially linking it to diseases of glycosylation (Hansen2014A).

Alterations in MGAT4B expression have also been observed in Alzheimer's disease, where changes in glycosylation patterns may contribute to the disease's pathogenesis (Tang2023Transcriptomic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MGAT4B in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
MGAT4B is involved in specific interactions within the Golgi apparatus, forming part of multi-enzyme complexes essential for N-glycan processing. It interacts with MGAT1 and MAN2A2, forming complexes such as MGAT1, MGAT4B, and MAN2A2, although it does not interact with MGAT2 or MGAT5 (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). These interactions suggest that MGAT4B may participate in specific sub-complexes that compete for binding with MAN2A2, which acts as a central hub for MGAT interactions (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases).

MGAT4B does not show significant interactions with nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) investigated in the study, indicating it may interact with an unidentified transporter for its donor substrate (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). The study also suggests that MGAT4B, MGAT1, and MGAT2 may form a trimeric complex, although the interaction of MGAT4B with MAN2A2 implies that this complex cannot exist in its entirety (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases). These findings highlight the role of MGAT4B in the formation of multi-enzyme assemblies in the Golgi membranes, which are crucial for the efficient synthesis of complex N-glycans (KhoderAgha2019Nacetylglucosaminyltransferases).
