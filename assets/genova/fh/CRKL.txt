# CRKL

## Overview
CRKL is a gene located on chromosome 22q11.2 that encodes the Crk-like protein, an adaptor protein involved in intracellular signal transduction. The Crk-like protein is characterized by its modular structure, which includes an SH2 domain and two SH3 domains, enabling it to mediate interactions with various signaling molecules. As an adaptor protein, CrkL plays a pivotal role in several cellular processes, including cell migration, neuronal development, and immune response regulation. It is particularly significant in the context of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), where it acts as a major substrate of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein, linking it to downstream signaling pathways. Additionally, CRKL is implicated in several genetic disorders and cancers, such as DiGeorge syndrome and non-small cell lung cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Birge2009Crk; Guris2001Mice; Cheung2011Amplification).

## Structure
The CRKL protein is an adaptor protein involved in signal transduction, characterized by its modular structure comprising an SH2 domain and two SH3 domains (SH3 N and SH3 C) (Jankowski2012Domain; Harkiolaki2006The). The SH2 domain binds to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs, while the SH3 domains interact with proline-rich sequences (Birge2009Crk; Sattler1998Role). The SH3 C domain is unique in its ability to form dimers, which is crucial for its role in nuclear export (Harkiolaki2006The).

Structurally, CRKL differs from its homolog CrkII, despite high sequence identity. The SH2 domain's pTyr-binding site in CRKL is partially masked, and the SH3 N domain's PPII-binding site is accessible, unlike in CrkII (Jankowski2012Domain). The SH3 C domain in CRKL is mobile and does not interact with other domains, contrasting with CrkII where it stabilizes the structure (Jankowski2012Domain). Phosphorylation of Tyr207 in CRKL induces intramolecular interactions that inhibit pTyr-ligand binding (Birge2009Crk).

CRKL can exist as a monomer or dimer, with the SH3 C domain playing a role in dimerization (Harkiolaki2006The). The protein's quaternary structure is dynamic, with potential for higher-order assemblies (Harkiolaki2006The).

## Function
The CRKL gene encodes the Crk-like protein, an adaptor protein involved in various intracellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, CrkL plays a crucial role in integrin-induced cell migration by translocating to focal adhesions, where it activates small G proteins such as Rac1 and Cdc42. This activation is essential for cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility, particularly in response to integrin signaling (Li2003Translocation). CrkL interacts with proteins like p130 Cas and Dock1, facilitating a network of interactions that promote cell migration and cytoskeletal changes (Li2003Translocation).

CrkL is also involved in the Reelin signaling pathway, which is critical for neuronal positioning during brain development. It functions downstream of the Disabled-1 (Dab1) protein, where it is necessary for the activation of downstream signaling events such as Akt and C3G phosphorylation. This pathway is vital for proper brain development, as evidenced by defects in neuronal migration and positioning in the absence of CrkL (Cheerathodi2011Identification; Park2008Crk).

In T-cells, CrkL regulates adhesion and migration by interacting with integrins and other signaling molecules, contributing to immune responses. It forms complexes with proteins like C3G and CasL, which are essential for integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration (Braiman2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CRKL gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. CRKL is located on chromosome 22q11.2, a region commonly deleted in DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). These syndromes are characterized by defects in neural crest cell development, leading to craniofacial, cardiac, and thymic abnormalities (Guris2001Mice). CRKL haploinsufficiency is a significant determinant of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in patients with 22q11.2 microdeletions (SannaCherchi2018Genetic). 

In cancer, CRKL amplification is implicated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it contributes to increased cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. This resistance is mediated through the activation of MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways (Cheung2011Amplification; Kim2009Genomic). CRKL is also located in a region commonly amplified in various cancers, including melanoma, ovarian, and colorectal cancers, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Cheung2011Amplification). Targeting CRKL, particularly its SH3N domain, is proposed as a therapeutic strategy for cancers with CRKL amplifications (Cheung2011Amplification).

## Interactions
CRKL is an adaptor protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling by interacting with various proteins through its SH2 and SH3 domains. In the context of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), CRKL is a major substrate of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein and forms complexes with proteins such as c-ABL, C3G, and SOS. These interactions are facilitated by the SH3 domains of CRKL, which bind to proline-rich motifs in these proteins (Uemura1997The; Sattler1998Role).

CRKL's SH2 domain binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins like CBL, HEF1, CAS, and paxillin, linking BCR/ABL to cellular signaling pathways (Sattler1998Role; Senechal1998Structural). The SH3 N domain of CRKL can interact with guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as DOCK1 and C3G, maintaining its binding affinity even after phosphorylation (Jankowski2012Domain).

In BCR/ABL-transformed cells, CRKL forms stable complexes with proteins like CBL and PI3-K, which can activate downstream signaling pathways, including the AKT pathway, influencing cell survival and apoptosis (Sattler1998Role). CRKL also interacts with the focal adhesion protein paxillin, an interaction specifically induced by the BCR/ABL oncogene (Uemura1997The). These interactions highlight CRKL's role in linking BCR/ABL to various cellular proteins, contributing to its oncogenic potential.
