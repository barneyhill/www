# KRBOX5

## Overview
KRBOX5 is a gene that encodes the protein known as KRAB box domain containing 5. This protein is characterized by the presence of a KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domain, which is a transcriptional repression domain commonly found in zinc finger proteins. The KRAB domain is involved in mediating protein-protein interactions that lead to transcriptional silencing, making KRBOX5 a key player in gene regulation. The protein encoded by KRBOX5 is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodeling. Although the specific biological functions and pathways involving KRBOX5 are still under investigation, its role in transcriptional repression suggests it may be significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and could have implications in disease states where gene expression is dysregulated.
