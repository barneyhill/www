# AHNAK

## Overview
AHNAK is a gene located on human chromosome 11q12 that encodes the AHNAK nucleoprotein, a large structural scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes. The AHNAK nucleoprotein, characterized by its substantial size of approximately 700 kDa, comprises three distinct structural domains and is known for its role in cell architecture, intracellular trafficking, and membrane repair. It interacts with several proteins, including calcium channel proteins, and is implicated in signal transduction and calcium homeostasis. AHNAK's involvement in the regulation of the p53 response and its interactions with proteins such as 53BP1 highlight its significance in cell cycle control and apoptosis, particularly in cancer cells. The protein's clinical relevance is underscored by its association with various diseases, including breast cancer, melanoma, cardiac arrhythmias, and muscular dystrophies, where it may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Haase2005Ahnak; Ghodke2021AHNAK; Lee2014Ahnak).

## Structure
The AHNAK nucleoprotein is a large protein with a molecular weight of approximately 700 kDa, encoded by a gene on human chromosome 11q12. It consists of three structural domains: an amino-terminal domain containing 251 amino acids, a central domain with multiple repeating units totaling 4,392 amino acids, and a carboxyl-terminal domain with 1,002 amino acids (Zhang2023AHNAKs). The central domain is composed of highly conserved repeated elements, each approximately 128 amino acids long, featuring a heptad repeat motif with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues (Shtivelman1992A).

AHNAK proteins are characterized by their propeller-like structures, with the central domain's repeat segments predicted to form β-strands that create a disk-like structure stabilized by hydrophobic forces (Komuro2004The). The protein is known to interact with calcium channel proteins and is involved in signal transduction mechanisms (Komuro2004The).

AHNAK undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase A, and interacts with other proteins like phospholipase C-γ and S100B, indicating its role in calcium homeostasis and cellular signaling (Komuro2004The). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and localization (Han2014Periaxin).

## Function
AHNAK nucleoprotein functions as a structural scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell architecture, intracellular trafficking, and membrane repair. In healthy human cells, AHNAK plays a crucial role in regulating the p53 response by interacting with 53BP1, a mediator of p53 activity. It restrains 53BP1 oligomerization and phase separation, fine-tuning the G1-S checkpoint under unstressed conditions, which helps control cell proliferation rates (Ghodke2021AHNAK). AHNAK is enriched in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle, with its protein levels and chromatin binding decreasing in the S/G2 phases. It interacts robustly with 53BP1 during the G1 phase on chromatin, controlling 53BP1 self-assembly and condensation-associated p53 activation (Ghodke2021AHNAK).

AHNAK also influences the cellular decision between apoptosis and senescence. In transformed cells, its depletion increases cell death, particularly in cancer cells, indicating its role in triggering apoptosis. The interaction between AHNAK and p53 occurs independently of 53BP1, and AHNAK modulates the 53BP1-p53 interaction without reciprocal effects (Ghodke2021AHNAK). AHNAK's role in regulating the 53BP1-p53 axis may offer potential therapeutic approaches in cancer treatment (Ghodke2021AHNAK).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the AHNAK gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, AHNAK functions as a tumor suppressor by modulating the TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway. Its loss is linked to hormone receptor-negative breast cancers, including aggressive triple-negative breast cancers, where its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor development (Lee2014Ahnak; Zhang2023AHNAKs). In melanoma, AHNAK is downregulated, correlating with poor patient survival and early relapse, suggesting its role in maintaining cell adhesion and preventing metastasis (Sheppard2016AHNAK).

In cardiac function, the AHNAK gene is critical for the regulation of L-type Ca2+ channels. The Ile5236Thr mutation affects the β-adrenergic regulation of these channels, potentially leading to arrhythmias due to altered calcium channel activity (Haase2005Ahnak). In muscular dystrophies, AHNAK1 shows abnormal localization in limb girdle muscular dystrophy types 2B and 2A, contributing to disease pathology through its presence in muscle connective tissue (Zacharias2011Ahnak1). AHNAK's involvement in various cancers and cardiac and muscular disorders highlights its clinical significance in disease progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
AHNAK nucleoprotein is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the annexin 2/S100A10 complex at the plasma membrane, a relationship that is independent of calcium ions. This interaction is specific to annexin 2, as other annexin family members do not bind with AHNAK (Benaud2003AHNAK). AHNAK also interacts with 53BP1, a mediator of p53 activity, particularly during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This interaction modulates p53 activation by restraining 53BP1 oligomerization and phase separation, which is crucial for maintaining cell proliferation and viability, especially in cancer cells (Ghodke2021AHNAK).

AHNAK is a component of the dysferlin protein complex, interacting with the C2A domain of dysferlin in a calcium-independent manner. This interaction is important for muscle regeneration and function (Huang2006AHNAK). In cardiac cells, AHNAK links the actin cytoskeleton to the L-type Ca2+ channels through its carboxyl-terminal region, interacting with the β2 subunit of these channels. This association is crucial for the structural organization of cardiac muscle cells (Hohaus2002The).
