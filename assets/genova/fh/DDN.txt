# DDN

## Overview
The DDN gene encodes the protein dendrin, which is predominantly expressed in the brain and kidneys. Dendrin is categorized as a synaptic protein due to its involvement in synaptic signaling and plasticity, where it interacts with various synaptic proteins to form and regulate multiprotein complexes essential for neuronal communication. This protein plays a critical role in processes such as learning and memory by facilitating neuronal interactions. In the kidneys, dendrin is implicated in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of kidney cells, potentially through its participation in protein complexes involved in kidney filtration. The DDN gene has garnered attention in clinical research as a potential prognostic biomarker for glioblastoma multiforme and other cancers, given its significantly reduced expression in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues (Li2022Gene). This differential expression underscores its potential utility in cancer diagnostics and patient prognosis.

## Clinical Significance
The DDN (dendrin) gene has been identified as a potential prognostic biomarker for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) due to its significantly reduced expression levels in GBM tissues compared to normal brain tissues. This reduction in expression is also observed in other cancer types, including pheochromocytoma paraganglioma (PCPG), head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), and rectal adenocarcinoma (READ) (Li2022Gene). Despite the lower survival rates associated with DDN expression in GBM, it remains a putative diagnostic marker due to the marked drop in expression levels compared to normal brain tissues (Li2022Gene).

The role of DDN in cancer diagnostics is underscored by its distinct expression patterns in cancerous versus normal tissues, suggesting its potential utility in understanding disease progression and patient prognosis (Li2022Gene). While the context does not provide specific information on mutations in the DDN gene leading to diseases, its altered expression levels in various cancers highlight its clinical significance as a biomarker. The findings emphasize the importance of DDN in the context of cancer diagnostics, particularly in GBM (Li2022Gene).

## Interactions
Dendrin (DDN) is a protein encoded by the DDN gene in humans, primarily expressed in the brain and kidneys. It is known to interact with various synaptic proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic signaling and plasticity. These interactions suggest that dendrin is involved in the formation and regulation of multiprotein complexes that are crucial for neuronal function. In the brain, dendrin's interactions with synaptic proteins facilitate communication between neurons, which is essential for processes such as learning and memory. In the kidneys, dendrin may participate in protein complexes that are important for kidney filtration, although the specific proteins involved in these interactions are not detailed in the available context. The involvement of dendrin in these complexes indicates its potential role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of synapses and kidney cells. The precise mechanisms and partners in these interactions remain an area of active research, highlighting the importance of dendrin in both neurological and renal functions.
