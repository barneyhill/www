# CROT

## Overview
The CROT gene encodes the enzyme carnitine O-octanoyltransferase, which is a crucial component of the peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism pathway. This enzyme is classified as a transferase, specifically involved in the β-oxidation process, where it facilitates the transfer of medium-chain fatty acids from acyl-CoA to carnitine, forming acyl-carnitine. This reaction is essential for the transport of fatty acids from peroxisomes to mitochondria, enabling their complete oxidation and energy production (Okui2024Carnitine; Zhang2022Acox2). The activity of carnitine O-octanoyltransferase is vital for maintaining lipid homeostasis and energy balance within cells, and its interactions with various signaling pathways suggest a broader role in cellular regulation and disease processes, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions (Zhao2019miR‑126a‑5p‑Dbp; Li2022The).

## Function
Carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (CROT) is a peroxisomal enzyme that plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism, particularly in the β-oxidation pathway. It catalyzes the reversible transfer of medium-chain fatty acids from acyl-CoA to carnitine, forming acyl-carnitine and CoASH. This reaction facilitates the transport of medium-chain fatty acids from peroxisomes to mitochondria, where they undergo complete oxidation for energy production (Okui2024Carnitine; Zhang2022Acox2). CROT is involved in the carnitinylation of octanoyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA, forming octanoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine, which are essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis and energy balance in cells (Okui2024Carnitine).

In healthy human cells, CROT's activity is vital for the breakdown of very long-chain fatty acids, which are initially oxidized in peroxisomes before being transferred to mitochondria for further oxidation. This process is essential for efficient energy production and lipid metabolism (Okui2024Carnitine). CROT's function in facilitating the transport of fatty acids across cellular membranes underscores its importance in cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation (Chen2014Engineering).

## Clinical Significance
The CROT gene, encoding carnitine O-octanoyltransferase, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in fatty acid metabolism. Alterations in CROT expression have been linked to ovarian cancer, where its downregulation is associated with increased chemoresistance and poor prognosis. Overexpression of CROT in ovarian cancer cells inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2022The).

In coronary artery disease (CAD), the CROT rs2214930 polymorphism has been studied for its impact on lipid profiles. The CC genotype of this polymorphism is associated with decreased HDL-C levels in healthy controls, although no direct association with CAD risk was observed (Demircan2019Role).

CROT is also implicated in hypertension and stroke. Its downregulation may impair fatty acid oxidation, contributing to fat accumulation and obesity, which are risk factors for these conditions. The gene's interaction with miR-31 and its potential anti-inflammatory role through EPHX2 suggest a complex involvement in the pathogenesis of hypertension and stroke (Zhao2019miR‑126a‑5p‑Dbp).

## Interactions
Carnitine O-octanoyltransferase (CROT) is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. In ovarian cancer cells, CROT interacts with the TGF-β signaling pathway by decreasing the phosphorylation of Smad2 and the expression of Smad4, which are key transducer proteins in this pathway. This interaction suggests that CROT acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating the TGF-β signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoting apoptosis (Li2022The).

CROT is also involved in protein-protein interactions within the context of hypertension and stroke. It interacts with epoxide hydrolase 2 (EPHX2), a member of the epoxide hydrolase family involved in the inflammatory response. This interaction may contribute to CROT's potential anti-inflammatory effects (Zhao2019miR‑126a‑5p‑Dbp).

In terms of regulatory interactions, CROT expression is modulated by microRNAs. Specifically, miR-33a-5p binds to the 3'UTR of CROT mRNA, leading to its downregulation in ovarian cancer cells. This interaction highlights a regulatory mechanism where miR-33a-5p influences CROT levels, impacting cell survival and apoptosis (Li2022The). Additionally, miR-31 is identified as a potential regulator of CROT expression in the context of hypertension and stroke (Zhao2019miR‑126a‑5p‑Dbp).
