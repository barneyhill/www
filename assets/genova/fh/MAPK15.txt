# MAPK15

## Overview
MAPK15, also known as ERK8, is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase 15, a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. This protein kinase is characterized by its conserved kinase domain and unique C-terminal extension, which includes motifs essential for its enzymatic activity and cellular localization (Abe1999Extracellular; Abe2002ERK8). MAPK15 is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including ciliogenesis, stress response, and autophagy, and plays a significant role in regulating signaling pathways such as the Hedgehog pathway (Flax2024Illumination; Pietrobono2021MAPK15). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the c-Src SH3 domain and LC3-family proteins, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity (Zhong2023MitogenActivated). Clinically, MAPK15 has been implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels can influence tumor progression and patient prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Su2020Metastasis‑associated; Zhong2023MitogenActivated).

## Structure
MAPK15, also known as ERK8, is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family and is characterized by a conserved protein kinase domain essential for its enzymatic activity. The primary structure of MAPK15 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with specific motifs such as the TEY activation domain, which is crucial for its kinase activity (Abe2002ERK8). The protein also contains a unique C-terminal extension, which includes proline-rich segments for SH3 domain binding and a nuclear localization signal (Abe1999Extracellular).

The secondary structure of MAPK15 likely involves typical elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure refers to the overall 3D shape of the protein, which is influenced by its C-terminal domain, playing a role in regulating its activity and cellular localization (Abe1999Extracellular). MAPK15 can undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and methylation, which affect its activity and interactions (Lau2018Regulation).

MAPK15 has different isoforms, with isoform 1 being the canonical sequence. Isoforms 2 and 3 are smaller and have variations in their amino acid sequences, contributing to the complexity of MAPK15 signaling and functions (Lau2018Regulation).

## Function
MAPK15, also known as ERK7 or ERK8, is a protein kinase involved in several critical cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in ciliogenesis, the formation of cilia, which are essential for cellular signaling and structure. MAPK15 regulates the localization of ciliary proteins, influencing cilium structure, transport, and signaling, and is crucial for maintaining the number and length of cilia (Flax2024Illumination). It is localized to the basal bodies of motile and primary cilia, where it is essential for their formation and function (Pietrobono2021MAPK15).

MAPK15 is also involved in regulating the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, which is vital for developmental processes and cellular communication. It modulates HH signaling by influencing primary ciliogenesis, thereby affecting the activation of downstream signaling components like GLI1 (Pietrobono2021MAPK15). In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, MAPK15 is involved in managing cell stress, DNA damage responses, autophagy, and protein secretion, contributing to cellular homeostasis and genomic integrity (Pietrobono2021MAPK15). These functions highlight MAPK15's importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
MAPK15, also known as ERK8, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In ovarian cancer, MAPK15 serves as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target. High expression of MAPK15 is associated with increased sensitivity to cisplatin chemotherapy and favorable patient prognosis, while low expression correlates with advanced-stage cancer and poor survival outcomes (Zhong2023MitogenActivated). 

In osteosarcoma, MAPK15 is highly expressed in metastatic tissues and promotes cell migration and invasion through the c-Jun/MMPs pathway. Knockdown of MAPK15 reduces metastasis, suggesting its role in the aggressive behavior of osteosarcoma cells (Su2020Metastasis‑associated). 

MAPK15 also plays a role in medulloblastoma, where it is crucial for primary ciliogenesis and Hedgehog signaling. Its expression is higher in cancer stem cells, and its inhibition reduces tumor cell proliferation, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in tumors with deregulated Hedgehog signaling (Pietrobono2021MAPK15). 

Overall, MAPK15's involvement in cancer progression and metastasis highlights its clinical significance and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
MAPK15, also known as ERK8, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the c-Src SH3 domain, indicating its role in the Src-dependent signaling pathway, which is crucial for processes like cell proliferation and migration (Zhong2023MitogenActivated). MAPK15 also interacts with LC3-family proteins and the ULK1 complex, playing a significant role in the early phases of autophagy (Zhong2023MitogenActivated). 

In osteosarcoma cells, MAPK15 is involved in the c-Jun/MMPs pathway, where it regulates the phosphorylation of c-Jun and the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, proteins associated with cell migration and invasion (Su2020Metastasis‑associated). The interaction with c-Jun is significant, as the use of a c-Jun inhibitor can reverse the effects of MAPK15 overexpression on cell migration and invasion (Su2020Metastasis‑associated).

MAPK15 is also known to interact with proteins involved in DNA repair and genomic integrity, such as PCNA, which it protects from degradation (Zhong2023MitogenActivated). These interactions highlight MAPK15's role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating cellular stress responses.
