# AK5

## Overview
The AK5 gene encodes adenylate kinase 5, a member of the adenylate kinase family, which is a group of enzymes involved in cellular energy homeostasis. Adenylate kinase 5 is primarily expressed in the brain and plays a pivotal role in the regulation of adenine nucleotide concentrations, crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance and facilitating metabolic signaling. This kinase catalyzes the reversible transfer of phosphate groups among adenine nucleotides, impacting ATP, ADP, and AMP levels, which are essential for neuronal energy metabolism and signal transduction (Panayiotou2014The; Klepinin2020Adenylate). Beyond its metabolic functions, adenylate kinase 5 is involved in the phosphorylation of nucleoside analogues, contributing to the activation of certain chemotherapeutic agents (Panayiotou2014The). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders, underscoring its clinical relevance (Fujisawa2023Regulation; Ahn2021Identification).

## Structure


## Function
Adenylate kinase 5 (AK5) is an enzyme primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic signaling. AK5 catalyzes the reversible transfer of phosphate groups among adenine nucleotides, specifically phosphorylating AMP, dAMP, CMP, and dCMP using ATP or GTP as phosphate donors (Panayiotou2014The). This activity is essential for maintaining the balance of ATP, ADP, and AMP within cells, which is vital for energy metabolism and signal transduction in neurons (Klepinin2020Adenylate).

AK5 exists in two main variants, differing in their N-terminal sequences, which influence their subcellular localization. Depending on the variant, AK5 can be found in the cytosol or both the cytosol and nucleus (Panayiotou2014The). The enzyme's activity is not limited to energy metabolism; it also participates in the phosphorylation of nucleoside analogues, converting them to their diphosphate forms, which is important for the activation of certain anti-cancer drugs (Panayiotou2014The).

In addition to its metabolic functions, AK5 is implicated in the regulation of the K-ATP channel in pancreatic beta-cells, highlighting its role in cellular signaling pathways (Dzeja2009Adenylate).

## Clinical Significance
The AK5 gene is clinically significant in several diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), AK5 is frequently hypermethylated, leading to decreased expression. This downregulation is associated with increased cell migration and invasion through the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis (Ahn2021Identification). High AK5 expression in CRC is linked to longer survival, while low expression correlates with poor differentiation and a more aggressive cancer phenotype (Fujisawa2023Regulation; Ahn2021Identification).

In gastric cancer, AK5 expression has a contrasting role. High expression is associated with shorter survival, and AK5 acts as an independent prognostic factor. Knockdown of AK5 in certain gastric cancer cell lines inhibits growth and increases apoptosis, suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell survival (Fujisawa2023Regulation).

AK5 is also implicated in limbic encephalitis, an autoimmune disease characterized by severe amnesia and mood disturbances. The presence of antibodies against AK5 is noted, although the cause of these antibodies remains unclear (Fujisawa2023Regulation). These findings highlight the complex role of AK5 in various diseases, influenced by its expression levels and interactions.
