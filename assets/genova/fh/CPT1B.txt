# CPT1B

## Overview
CPT1B, or carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B, is a gene that encodes a key enzyme involved in the mitochondrial transport of long-chain fatty acids, facilitating their subsequent β-oxidation. The CPT1B protein is a transmembrane enzyme located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, playing a critical role in energy metabolism, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as skeletal muscle and the heart (Virmani2015The; BONNEFONT2004Carnitine). The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated by malonyl-CoA, which serves as an inhibitor, thus modulating the rate of fatty acid oxidation (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine). Variations in the CPT1B gene have been linked to metabolic conditions, including type 2 diabetes and obesity, highlighting its clinical significance in metabolic health (Ricci2021The; Miljkovic2009Association).

## Structure
The CPT1B protein is primarily expressed in muscle tissues and is integral to the mitochondrial outer membrane, facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids for β-oxidation. The protein consists of 772 amino acids and has a theoretical molecular weight of approximately 88 kDa (Virmani2015The). Its structure includes a large N-terminal region with two hydrophobic transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its integration into the mitochondrial membrane (Virmani2015The; BONNEFONT2004Carnitine). These transmembrane segments are essential for the enzyme's activity and its sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine).

The CPT1B protein does not possess a cleavable matrix-targeting signal, which is typical for proteins embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate its activity, although specific sites are not detailed in the context provided. The presence of splice variant isoforms is suggested, which could lead to functional diversity in different tissues or under varying physiological conditions (Boukouvala2010Molecular). The conservation of key residues important for catalytic activity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity across species indicates a shared functional role (Boukouvala2010Molecular).

## Function
Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B) is a crucial enzyme involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they undergo β-oxidation to produce energy. This process is essential for energy production, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as skeletal muscle, heart, and brown adipose tissue (He2012Carnitine; BONNEFONT2004Carnitine). CPT1B is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and facilitates the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into acyl-carnitine, which can then be transported into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine).

In the heart, CPT1B is the predominant isoform, accounting for about 98% of total cardiac CPT1 activity, and plays a significant role in energy production by enabling fatty acid oxidation, which provides up to 70% of the heart's energy under normal conditions (He2012Carnitine). In skeletal muscle, CPT1B expression is associated with increased lipid oxidation and is linked to metabolic health, particularly in older individuals, suggesting its role in promoting healthy metabolic aging (Bétry2019High). The enzyme's activity is regulated by malonyl-CoA, which inhibits CPT1B, thereby controlling the rate of fatty acid entry into the mitochondria (BONNEFONT2004Carnitine).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CPT1B gene have been associated with several metabolic and health conditions. Variants in CPT1B, such as the I66V and G531L polymorphisms, have been linked to differences in skeletal muscle fat infiltration and a lower prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Afro-Caribbean men, suggesting a protective role against insulin resistance (Miljkovic2009Association). The E531K polymorphism is associated with traits of the metabolic syndrome, including lower levels of certain liver enzymes and LDL-cholesterol in K531K homozygotes, indicating a potential protective effect against metabolic syndrome (Auinger2012A).

In the context of obesity, the rs470117 SNP in CPT1B has been identified as having a protective role, with the T allele being less frequent in obese individuals, suggesting a reduced risk of obesity (Ricci2021The). Additionally, lower expression of CPT1B in placental tissue has been associated with complications in pregnancies of older and overweight women, potentially leading to gestational diabetes and stillbirth (Yong2023Increasing). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CPT1B in various metabolic and health conditions.

## Interactions
CPT1B, or carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B, is involved in the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation. It interacts with malonyl-CoA, which acts as an inhibitor of its activity, thereby regulating fatty acid metabolism (He2021The). CPT1B is part of larger protein complexes that regulate energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. In the context of prostate cancer, CPT1B expression is associated with the G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway and molecular transducer activity, as revealed by gene set enrichment analysis (Abudurexiti2020Targeting). 

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CPT1B's role in fatty acid metabolism is significant, with its expression linked to pathways promoting AML development. The study by Ling et al. identified a network of up-regulated and down-regulated genes associated with high CPT1B expression, suggesting its involvement in complex regulatory interactions (Ling2023CPT1B). 

In bladder cancer, CPT1B is involved in fatty acid transport and acts as a rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid oxidation, influencing cancer cell fate. Its expression levels correlate with hallmark cancer pathways, including inflammation and immune system pathways, indicating its role in broader metabolic and oncogenic processes (Vantaku2019Multiomics).
