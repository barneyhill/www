# PLK2

## Overview
PLK2 (polo like kinase 2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine-protein kinase, which is a member of the polo-like kinase family. The protein product, polo-like kinase 2, is characterized by a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a unique C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD), which is essential for substrate binding and interaction with phosphorylated motifs (Shan2015Crystal). As a kinase, PLK2 plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly during the G1/S transition, and is crucial for processes such as centriole duplication and centrosome reproduction (Cizmecioglu2008Plk2). Beyond its role in cell cycle regulation, PLK2 is involved in neural development and synaptic plasticity, influencing pathways critical for memory formation and synaptic homeostasis (Zhang2022Polo-Like). The gene's expression and activity are modulated by various factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ERK signaling, which are important for dendritic growth and synaptic modulation (Zhang2022Polo-Like). PLK2 is also implicated in cellular stress responses and has been associated with various cancers and hematologic malignancies, where its expression and epigenetic modifications can influence disease progression and patient prognosis (Benetatos2011Pololike; Cao2021Knocking).

## Structure
PLK2 (polo like kinase 2) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase characterized by a conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a unique C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD) (Shan2015Crystal). The PBD is crucial for substrate binding and mediates interactions by recognizing phosphorylated Ser-pSer/pThr motifs (Shan2015Crystal). The primary structure of PLK2 includes residues 468-685, which form the PBD (Kim2015Structural).

The secondary structure of the PLK2 PBD consists of 4 alpha-helices and 12 beta-strands, forming two subdomains: PB1 (residues 505-582) and PB2 (residues 603-681) (Kim2015Structural). Each subdomain adopts a canonical PB fold, characterized by a six-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with an alpha-helix packed against one side (Kim2015Structural). The N-terminal extension, known as the 'Polo-cap,' supports the tethering of PB1 and PB2 (Kim2015Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, the PLK2 PBD forms a 12-stranded beta sandwich domain, with the interface between the two polo boxes creating a binding cleft for phosphorylated motifs (Shan2015Crystal). Despite appearing to form a homodimeric structure in the crystal, PLK2 PBD exists as a monomer in solution (Kim2015Structural). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which is essential for its function in cell cycle regulation (Salvi2012Investigation).

## Function
Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the G1/S transition, where it is essential for centriole duplication and centrosome reproduction. PLK2 localizes to the centrosome, associating with the mother centriole in early G1 phase and later with both mother and daughter centrioles at the onset of S phase. This localization is dependent on a functional polo-box domain, which is crucial for its role in centriole duplication (Cizmecioglu2008Plk2).

PLK2 also plays a significant role in neural development and synaptic plasticity. It is involved in maintaining synaptic homeostasis and memory formation by regulating pathways such as Ras and Rap, which are crucial for long-term potentiation and depression, respectively. PLK2's expression is influenced by factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ERK signaling, which promote dendritic growth and synaptic modulation (Zhang2022Polo-Like).

In addition to its roles in cell cycle and neural functions, PLK2 is implicated in responding to cellular stress, such as oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, where it can promote either cell survival or apoptosis depending on the context (Zhang2022Polo-Like).

## Clinical Significance
PLK2 (polo-like kinase 2) is implicated in various cancers and hematologic malignancies due to alterations in its expression and epigenetic modifications. In gliomas, PLK2 acts as an oncogene, with increased expression correlating with higher tumor grades and poorer survival outcomes. Knockdown of PLK2 in glioma cells reduces cell viability and increases apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cao2021Knocking). In contrast, PLK2 is frequently silenced in B-cell malignancies, such as Burkitt lymphoma, through aberrant CpG methylation, indicating a tumor suppressor role. This methylation-dependent silencing is specific to malignant B cells and can be reversed with demethylating agents, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in these cancers (Syed2005Transcriptional).

In myeloid malignancies like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), PLK2 is often hypermethylated, which may contribute to disease progression and affect survival outcomes. The methylation status of PLK2 in these conditions is associated with genetic polymorphisms and mutations, such as FLT3-ITD, influencing patient prognosis (Benetatos2011Pololike). PLK2's role in gastric cancer is also noted, where specific single nucleotide variants may alter its expression and affect cancer risk and progression (Dominkuš2022PLK2).

## Interactions
PLK2 (polo-like kinase 2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In glioblastoma cells, PLK2 interacts with DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A), which phosphorylates PLK2 at Ser358. This phosphorylation enhances PLK2 protein stability and kinase activity, playing a significant role in regulating glioblastoma cell proliferation and invasion (Tan2023DYRK1Amediated).

In neurons, PLK2 interacts with NSF (n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein) in an ATP-dependent manner. This interaction disrupts the binding of NSF to GluA2, a subunit of AMPA receptors, leading to the removal of GluA2 from synapses and its association with other proteins like PICK1 and GRIP1. This process is crucial for the homeostatic regulation of synaptic activity (Evers2010Plk2).

PLK2 also plays a role in synaptic plasticity by interacting with proteins involved in Ras and Rap signaling pathways. It phosphorylates and regulates proteins such as RasGRF1, SPAR, SynGAP, and PDZGEF1, which are essential for maintaining synaptic structure and function. These interactions help modulate dendritic spine density and AMPA receptor expression in response to neuronal activity (Lee2011Requirement).
