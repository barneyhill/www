# OR8B2

## Overview
The OR8B2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily B member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it is integral to the plasma membrane and is involved in the sensory perception of chemical stimuli, contributing to the neurological processes underlying the sense of smell (Gandhi2015An). Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR8B2 and other olfactory receptors are expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, suggesting potential roles in broader physiological processes, including epidermal homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Function
OR8B2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. In healthy human cells, OR8B2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants. This binding initiates a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in the perception of smell (Gandhi2015An).

Olfactory receptors like OR8B2 are integral to the membrane and are associated with the plasma membrane cellular components. They are involved in sensory perception, particularly in the sensory perception of chemical stimuli and neurological system processes (Gandhi2015An). The function of OR8B2 in healthy cells is not extensively detailed, but it is generally understood that olfactory receptors are part of complex signaling pathways that contribute to the diversity of olfactory detection (Gandhi2015An).

In addition to their role in the olfactory system, olfactory receptors, including OR8B2, are expressed in various tissues and may have roles beyond smell, such as in epidermal homeostasis and potentially in other physiological processes (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).
