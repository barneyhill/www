# CLDN18

## Overview
The CLDN18 gene encodes claudin 18, a tetraspan-transmembrane protein that is integral to the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial cells. These junctions are crucial for maintaining the paracellular barrier and regulating permeability in tissues such as the lungs and stomach. Claudin 18 exists in two main isoforms, CLDN18.1 and CLDN18.2, which are differentially expressed in pulmonary and gastric tissues, respectively, due to alternative splicing (Katoh2024Claudin; Coati2019Claudin18). The protein's structure, characterized by four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops, facilitates its interaction with other tight junction proteins, such as zona occludens 1 (ZO-1), thereby linking it to the actin cytoskeleton and influencing cell-cell adhesion and polarity (Katoh2024Claudin; Coati2019Claudin18). Claudin 18 plays a significant role in maintaining epithelial integrity and has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and bone resorption (Linares2012Claudin; LaFemina2014Claudin18).

## Structure
Claudin 18 (CLDN18) is a tetraspan-transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in tight junctions, contributing to paracellular barrier and permeability functions. The protein structure includes four transmembrane domains, an N-terminal cytoplasmic region, two extracellular loops (ECL1 and ECL2), an intracellular loop, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic region (Katoh2024Claudin; Coati2019Claudin18). The first extracellular loop (ECL1) contains a WWcc motif that folds into β-strand structures, which are essential for stabilizing the paracellular interface of claudins (Katoh2024Claudin). The C-terminal region interacts with the zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) scaffold protein, linking claudins to actin filaments and recruiting other tight junction proteins (Katoh2024Claudin; Coati2019Claudin18).

CLDN18 has two main isoforms, CLDN18.1 and CLDN18.2, which are expressed in pulmonary and gastric tissues, respectively, due to alternative splicing (Katoh2024Claudin; Coati2019Claudin18). These isoforms are subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence their function and localization. The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion, cell polarity, and selective paracellular permeability (Coati2019Claudin18).

## Function
The CLDN18 gene encodes the claudin-18 protein, a critical component of tight junctions in epithelial cells, particularly in the lungs and stomach. Claudin-18 plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity and function of the alveolar epithelial barrier in the lungs by regulating paracellular transport, which is the movement of substances between cells (LaFemina2014Claudin18). The lung-specific isoform, CLDN18.1, is highly expressed in alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) cells, which cover a large surface area of the lung and are essential for gas exchange (LaFemina2014Claudin18). 

In the stomach, claudin-18 is involved in forming tight junctions that maintain the barrier function of the gastric epithelium, preventing the leakage of gastric contents (Niimi2001claudin18). The gene produces two tissue-specific isoforms through alternative splicing: Cldn-18a1 in the lung and Cldn-18a2 in the stomach (Linares2012Claudin). Claudin-18 is also a negative regulator of bone resorption and osteoclast differentiation, interacting with proteins like zonula occludens-2 to modulate signaling pathways crucial for osteoclast activity (Linares2012Claudin). This regulation is vital for maintaining bone mass and preventing excessive bone degradation (Linares2012Claudin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLDN18 gene, particularly its isoform CLDN18.2, have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In gastric cancer (GC), CLDN18 expression is often downregulated, which is associated with increased cancer proliferation, invasion, and poorer prognosis. This downregulation is linked to peritoneal metastasis and shorter overall survival (Hashimoto2022Claudins). Conversely, higher CLDN18 expression in GC is associated with bone metastasis and lymph node involvement (Hashimoto2022Claudins). The CLDN18-ARHGAP26 fusion gene, found in diffuse-type gastric cancers, is associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance (Chen2023Targeting).

In lung adenocarcinoma, the lung-specific isoform CLDN18.1 is decreased, and its restoration can reduce malignancy (Chen2023Targeting). In pancreatic cancer, CLDN18 is overexpressed, particularly in advanced stages, and is being explored as a target for antibody-mediated therapies (Li2020Identification). CLDN18 deficiency in mice leads to alveolar barrier dysfunction and impaired lung development, suggesting its role in conditions like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (LaFemina2014Claudin18). These findings underscore the potential of CLDN18 as a therapeutic target in various cancers and lung diseases.

## Interactions
Claudin-18 (CLDN18) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cancer progression and suppression. CLDN18.2, a splice variant of CLDN18, interacts with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in gastric cancer. This interaction is mediated by the protein S100A4, which is secreted by CAFs and enhances the migratory capacity of gastric cancer cells. The interaction between CLDN18.2 and S100A4 was confirmed through western blot analysis, indicating that S100A4 interacts with CLDN18.2 or its complexes on the cell membrane (Liu2024Claudin18.2).

In lung adenocarcinoma, CLDN18.1, another isoform of CLDN18, acts as a tumor suppressor by interacting with signaling pathways. It downregulates the YAP/TAZ-AKT signaling axis, leading to decreased proliferation and migration of cancer cells. CLDN18.1 also interacts with the IGF-1R/AKT signaling pathway, where its expression results in decreased phosphorylation of IGF-1R and AKT, indicating suppression of this pathway (Luo2018CLDN18.1). Additionally, CLDN18.1 co-localizes with zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) at tight junctions, although this interaction does not affect the intracellular distribution of junctional proteins (Luo2018CLDN18.1).
