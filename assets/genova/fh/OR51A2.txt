# OR51A2

## Overview
OR51A2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily A member 2, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a critical role in the detection of odor molecules and the initiation of olfactory signal transduction pathways, which ultimately lead to the perception of smell. OR51A2 is predominantly expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants and activates neuronal responses. Interestingly, OR51A2 is also expressed at low levels in human blood leukocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction, possibly in immune response or cellular signaling (Malki2015Class). The receptor's structure is characterized by conserved motifs in its transmembrane regions, which are essential for ligand recognition and binding (Bushdid2019Mammalian). Despite its established role in olfaction, the full spectrum of OR51A2's functions in human physiology remains to be fully understood.

## Function
OR51A2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR51A2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it contributes to the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and activating neuronal responses. 

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR51A2 is ectopically expressed in human blood leukocytes, including NK cells, although its expression in these cells is of low abundance (Malki2015Class). The presence of OR51A2 in leukocytes suggests potential roles beyond olfaction, possibly in immune response or cellular signaling, although these functions are not yet fully understood. 

The structural characteristics of class I odorant receptors, such as OR51A2, include conserved motifs in transmembrane regions that form a vestibular site, which is important for ligand recognition and binding (Bushdid2019Mammalian). These structural features are crucial for the receptor's ability to interact with specific agonists, influencing its activation and function. However, the specific function of OR51A2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.
