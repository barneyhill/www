# MTMR10

## Overview
MTMR10 is a gene that encodes the protein myotubularin-related protein 10, which is part of the myotubularin family of proteins. This family is characterized by its involvement in phosphoinositide metabolism, although MTMR10 itself is categorized as a 'dead phosphatase' due to its lack of catalytic activity (Amoasii2012Myotubularin). Despite this, MTMR10 plays a role in modulating the function of other active myotubularins through protein-protein interactions, potentially influencing their localization and activity (Zhang2005Myotubularin). The protein is distinguished by the absence of a coiled-coil domain, which may affect its interaction dynamics within the myotubularin family (Lorenzo2006Systematic). While the precise biological functions and clinical implications of MTMR10 are not fully understood, its interactions suggest a regulatory role in cellular processes involving phosphoinositide signaling (gegenschatz2012structural).

## Interactions
MTMR10, a member of the myotubularin family, is known to interact with other proteins within this family. It has been identified to potentially interact with MTM1 and MTMR2, as suggested by yeast two-hybrid screening experiments. However, these interactions were not confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that the interactions might be weak or context-dependent (Lorenzo2006Systematic). 

MTMR10 lacks the coiled-coil domain present in other myotubularins, which may influence its interaction capabilities (Zhang2005Myotubularin). Despite this, MTMR10 is part of a subgroup of myotubularins that includes inactive homologs, often referred to as 'dead phosphatases'. These inactive members can form heterodimers with active homologs, potentially affecting their localization or catalytic activity (Amoasii2012Myotubularin). 

The interactions of MTMR10 with active myotubularins like MTM1 or MTMR2 can lead to increased catalytic activity, relocalization, and modified substrate specificity, suggesting a regulated function based on tissue-specific complex formation (gegenschatz2012structural). However, specific details about these interactions and their biological implications remain limited.
