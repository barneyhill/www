# ZNF605

## Overview
ZNF605 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 605, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 605 is categorized as a transcription factor, which implies its involvement in regulating the expression of other genes. The specific biological functions and pathways influenced by ZNF605 remain under investigation, but its structural features suggest it may play a role in gene expression modulation and cellular processes related to development and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
