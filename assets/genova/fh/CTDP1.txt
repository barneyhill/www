# CTDP1

## Overview
The CTDP1 gene encodes the CTD phosphatase subunit 1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of transcription by dephosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. This protein is categorized as a phosphatase due to its enzymatic activity in removing phosphate groups, which is essential for the transition of RNA polymerase II from transcription initiation to elongation. The CTDP1 protein contains a FCP1 homology domain crucial for its phosphatase function, as well as a BRCT domain involved in DNA damage response and repair pathways. It is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular processes, including transcription regulation and mitotic progression. Mutations in the CTDP1 gene are linked to Congenital Cataracts, Facial Dysmorphism, and Neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Vaneynde2022The; Hu2019CTDP1).

## Structure
CTDP1 encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The protein structure includes the FCP1 homology domain, which is essential for its phosphatase activity. This domain is a key feature that facilitates the protein's function in regulating transcription by removing phosphate groups from the RNA polymerase II complex. 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to regulate the activity of the CTDP1 protein. These modifications can influence the protein's function and interactions, potentially affecting its role in transcription regulation. The protein may also exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in variations in its structure and function. These isoforms may have distinct roles or regulatory mechanisms within the cell, contributing to the complexity of its function in gene expression regulation. 

The precise details of the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CTDP1 are not provided in the available context, but the presence of specific domains like the FCP1 homology domain suggests a structured and functional conformation necessary for its enzymatic activity.

## Function
The CTDP1 gene encodes the CTD phosphatase subunit 1, also known as FCP1, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II activity in healthy human cells. This protein functions by dephosphorylating serine residues in the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, specifically targeting serine 2 and serine 5 within the heptapeptide repeats. This dephosphorylation is essential for recycling the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II, facilitating the transition from transcription initiation to elongation, and is critical for proper gene expression (Vaneynde2022The; Zhong2015Lentivirusmediated).

CTDP1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes. It is involved in transcription regulation, acting as a positive transcription regulator and a component of the elongation complex. The phosphatase activity of CTDP1 is stimulated by the general transcription factor TFIIF and inhibited by TFIIB (Zhong2015Lentivirusmediated). Additionally, CTDP1 is suggested to play a role in regulating mitotic progression by potentially counteracting Cdk-1-mediated phosphorylation (Zhong2015Lentivirusmediated).

CTDP1 also contains a BRCT domain, which is involved in the DNA damage response, interacting with proteins in the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway. This interaction enhances homologous recombination repair efficiency and is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity (Hu2019CTDP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTDP1 gene are primarily associated with Congenital Cataracts, Facial Dysmorphism, and Neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphisms, and neuropathy. The disease is caused by a homozygous point mutation in an intronic antisense Alu element between exons 6 and 7 of CTDP1, which substitutes a cytosine (C) for a thymine (T). This mutation creates a donor splice site, leading to aberrant splicing and the insertion of 95 nucleotides from the antisense Alu sequence into the processed CTDP1 mRNA. This insertion results in a frameshift and a premature termination codon, likely leading to a non-functional protein or its degradation through nonsense-mediated decay (Vaneynde2022The; Kalaydjieva2006Congenital).

CCFDN syndrome is particularly prevalent among individuals of Roma ethnicity, with a high carrier rate observed in the Rudari population. The disorder manifests with a range of symptoms, including bilateral congenital cataracts, developmental delay, small stature, and hypo/demyelinating neuropathy (Kalaydjieva2006Congenital). Despite the mutation, some normal splicing occurs, resulting in a partial deficiency of functional FCP1 protein (Vaneynde2022The).

## Interactions
CTDP1, a protein involved in DNA repair and transcription regulation, interacts with several proteins through its BRCT domain. It plays a significant role in DNA repair pathways by interacting with Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins, particularly FANCI and FANCA. CTDP1 promotes the phosphorylation of FANCI at specific sites, which is crucial for its activation and function in DNA repair. It also influences the ubiquitination and chromatin localization of FANCI, even in the absence of DNA damage, suggesting a role in the interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair pathway (Hu2019CTDP1).

CTDP1 enhances homologous recombination (HR) repair efficiency, as demonstrated by increased HR efficiency in HeLa-DR cells upon CTDP1 overexpression and decreased efficiency upon knockdown (Hu2019CTDP1). The protein interacts with ATM kinase, mismatch repair protein MSH3, and other DNA damage response proteins, as identified through tandem affinity purification-mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) (Hu2019CTDP1). CTDP1's interactions with FANCI and FANCA are particularly emphasized, affecting multiple aspects of FANCI activation, such as phosphorylation, mono-ubiquitination, and recruitment to DNA damage sites (Hu2019CTDP1). These interactions suggest that CTDP1 plays a significant role in modifying HR efficiency, potentially impacting cancer responses to DNA damage-inducing therapies.
