# CEACAM7

## Overview
CEACAM7, or carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 7, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein, CEA cell adhesion molecule 7, is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains and is primarily involved in cell adhesion processes. It is anchored to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, facilitating intercellular interactions and potentially modulating immune responses (Raj2021CEACAM7). CEACAM7 is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the colon, rectum, and pancreatic ducts, where it plays a role in maintaining tissue architecture and cellular differentiation (Han2020The; Messick2010CEACAM7:). Notably, its expression is downregulated in colorectal cancers, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive function (Bonsor2015Structure). The protein's structure includes unique glycosylation sites and a high affinity for dimerization, which distinguishes it from other CEACAM family members (Bonsor2015Structure).

## Structure
The CEACAM7 protein is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family and is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains, which are crucial for its role in cell adhesion. The primary structure of CEACAM7 includes unique glycosylation sites at Asn24, Asn52, Asn72, and Asn79, which are not involved in the dimerization interface but may play a role in its function (Bonsor2015Structure). The secondary structure of CEACAM7 is similar to the V-set fold of the immunoglobulin superfamily, consisting of two beta-sheets labeled ABED and A'GFCC'C'' (Bonsor2015Structure).

The tertiary structure of CEACAM7 involves a notable insertion that causes the C 00 strand to buckle, creating a hydrogen bond in the dimerization interface, which is a distinctive feature compared to other CEACAMs (Bonsor2015Structure). The quaternary structure is defined by the dimerization of its N-terminal IgV domain, forming a dimer interface that buries 1610 Å² of solvent-accessible surface area and involves nine hydrogen bonds (Bonsor2015Structure). CEACAM7's dimerization affinity is tenfold tighter than that of CEACAM5, suggesting that sequence variations in the dimerization surface modulate the dimerization affinities of CEACAMs (Bonsor2015Structure).

## Function
CEACAM7 is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, primarily expressed in epithelial cells of the colon and rectum. It plays a significant role in cell adhesion, which is crucial for maintaining tissue architecture and cellular signaling. CEACAM7 achieves cell adhesion through the dimerization of its N-terminal IgV domain, forming a structure that is similar to other CEACAM family members, such as CEACAM1 and CEACAM5, but with unique features that enhance its dimerization affinity (Bonsor2015Structure).

In healthy human cells, CEACAM7 is expressed in the lower two-thirds of the colonic crypts, where it is associated with fully differentiated epithelial cells. This expression pattern suggests a role in regulating normal cellular differentiation (Messick2010CEACAM7:). CEACAM7 is also expressed in the ducts of the pancreas and is involved in cellular differentiation processes (Han2020The).

The protein is anchored to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which facilitates its role in intercellular interactions and potentially in immune response modulation (Raj2021CEACAM7). Its expression is downregulated in colorectal cancers, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive function (Bonsor2015Structure).

## Clinical Significance
CEACAM7 has been implicated in several diseases, primarily due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In breast cancer, rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in CEACAM7, such as the mutation CEACAM7 c.195C > A;p.(Y65X), have been associated with increased risk in both European and African American populations. This mutation results in a loss-of-function by truncating the protein and disrupting important domains, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Huskey2021CEACAM).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), CEACAM7 expression is significantly downregulated, particularly in colonic adenocarcinoma. This downregulation is more pronounced in patients who develop recurrence, indicating that CEACAM7 could serve as a prognostic marker for identifying patients who might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (Wautier2022Old). The gene's expression changes are among the earliest molecular events leading to colorectal tumors, highlighting its potential role in early tumorigenesis (Huskey2021CEACAM).

CEACAM7 is also involved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Its expression is influenced by pro-inflammatory cytokines and certain bacteria, suggesting a role in the inflammatory response associated with IBD (Saiz-Gonzalo2021Regulation).

## Interactions
CEACAM7, a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen family, primarily functions in cell adhesion through dimerization of its N-terminal IgV domain. The crystal structure of this domain has been determined, revealing that CEACAM7 forms a dimer interface involving the second beta-sheet and specific loops, which buries a significant amount of solvent-accessible surface area. This dimerization is characterized by the formation of nine hydrogen bonds, which is more than CEACAM5 but less than CEACAM1, indicating a strong affinity for dimerization (Bonsor2015Structure).

CEACAM7's dimerization affinity is notably higher than that of CEACAM5, suggesting that sequence variations in the dimerization surface modulate the dimerization affinities of CEACAMs. This strong dimerization affinity is attributed to unique structural features, such as a single amino-acid insertion in the C' C'' loop, which affects the structure of the C'' strand (Bonsor2015Structure).

While CEACAM7 is expressed on highly differentiated epithelial cells of the colon, rectum, and pancreas ducts, its expression is downregulated during early colorectal tumor development, suggesting a potential tumor-suppression function. However, specific interactions of CEACAM7 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its dimerization properties have not been detailed in the available literature (Bonsor2015Structure).
