# CLDN2

## Overview
The CLDN2 gene encodes claudin-2, a transmembrane protein that is integral to the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudin-2 is a member of the claudin family, characterized by its tetra-transmembrane structure, which facilitates its role in creating paracellular channels that regulate ion and water permeability across cell layers (Krause2015Assembly). This protein is particularly significant in tissues such as the kidney and intestine, where it contributes to the reabsorption of essential ions like calcium and magnesium (Lameris2012Expression). Beyond its physiological roles, claudin-2 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, where its altered expression affects disease progression and cellular responses (Zeissig2007Changes; Dhawan2011Claudin2). The study of CLDN2 and its encoded protein, claudin-2, continues to provide insights into cellular barrier functions and potential therapeutic targets for related diseases.

## Structure
Claudin 2 (CLDN2) is a tetra-transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the formation and function of tight junctions in epithelial cells. The protein is characterized by four transmembrane helices, which form a left-handed four-helix bundle with a rhombic arrangement, as seen in related claudins like claudin-15 (Krause2015Assembly). The extracellular loop 1 (ECL1) of CLDN2 is crucial for its function, with specific residues such as D65, I66, H57, and Y35 being important for sodium interaction and pore architecture (Krause2015Assembly). The ECL1 is suggested to have a beta-sheet structure, potentially forming a half-pipe that contributes to the pore architecture (Krause2015Assembly).

The second extracellular loop (ECL2) is involved in intermolecular interactions and is critical for binding with Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), with a conserved proline and surrounding residues playing significant roles (Krause2015Assembly). CLDN2 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its localization and function within tight junctions (Nasako2020Claudin2). The protein's structure and interactions are complex, contributing to its role in regulating paracellular permeability and tight junction integrity.

## Function
Claudin-2, encoded by the CLDN2 gene, is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in forming tight junctions (TJs) in epithelial and endothelial cells. These tight junctions are essential for maintaining the selective permeability barrier of epithelial tissues, regulating the movement of ions and water across cell layers (Takigawa2017Creation). Claudin-2 is particularly involved in creating high-conductance, cation-permeable paracellular pores, facilitating the reabsorption of ions such as calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) in the kidney and intestine (Lameris2012Expression).

In the kidney, claudin-2 is highly expressed in the proximal tubule, where it aids in the reabsorption of a significant portion of the filtered calcium load from pro-urine via the paracellular pathway (Lameris2012Expression). In the intestine, claudin-2 is predominantly found in the small intestine segments, which are relatively leaky, serving as the main site for paracellular Ca2+ and Mg2+ absorption (Lameris2012Expression). The expression of claudin-2 is influenced by vitamin D, which enhances its expression and paracellular Ca2+ transport, highlighting its role in calcium homeostasis (Lameris2012Expression).

Claudin-2 is also involved in maintaining tight junction integrity, as demonstrated by its ability to modulate transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and its response to inflammatory stimuli such as TNFα, which can disrupt TJ integrity in conditions like inflammatory bowel diseases (Takigawa2017Creation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLDN2 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In IBD, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, CLDN2 expression is significantly increased, contributing to increased intestinal permeability and inflammation. This upregulation is linked to cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-13, which exacerbate the disease by altering tight junction integrity (Capaldo2023Claudin; Zeissig2007Changes). In colorectal cancer, CLDN2 expression is elevated and associated with tumor progression and increased tumorigenicity. This is partly due to its role in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, which promotes cell proliferation and survival (Cherradi2019&lt; p&gt; Claudin; Dhawan2011Claudin2). CLDN2 is also implicated in T2DM, where its expression is upregulated in pancreatic islets, suggesting a role in early metabolic stress and as a potential biomarker for pre-diabetes (Songtao2024Identification). These findings highlight CLDN2 as a significant factor in the pathogenesis of these conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Claudin-2 (CLDN2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In human lung adenocarcinoma cells, CLDN2 is found in the nucleus where it forms a complex with ZO-1, ZONAB, and cyclin D1. This complex is crucial for promoting cell proliferation by retaining ZONAB and cyclin D1 in the nucleus (Ikari2014Nuclear). CLDN2 also interacts with GEF-H1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, to suppress the activation of RHOA, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal dynamics. Silencing CLDN2 leads to increased GEF-H1 activity and RHOA activation, which affects cell proliferation and promotes a profibrotic phenotype in tubular cells (Dan2019Claudin2).

CLDN2 can form cis-interactions within the same membrane and trans-interactions between opposing membranes. It forms homo- or hetero-dimers with CLDN2 and CLDN3, but not with CLDN1 (Nasako2020Claudin2). Specific peptides, VPDSM and DSMKF, can bind to CLDN2, decreasing its protein level and affecting its interactions, which in turn increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs (Nasako2020Claudin2). These interactions highlight CLDN2's role in regulating cell proliferation, permeability, and response to external stimuli.
