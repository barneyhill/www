# PWP1

## Overview
PWP1 is a gene that encodes the PWP1 homolog protein, also known as endonuclein, which is a member of the WD40-repeat protein family. This protein is characterized by its multiple WD40 repeats, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are essential for its roles in telomere maintenance and ribosome biogenesis (Zhang2014Structure; Yu2019Pwp1). The PWP1 protein is involved in critical cellular processes, including the transcription of ribosomal RNA and the stabilization of the shelterin complex, which is vital for telomere integrity (Yu2019Pwp1; Liu2018PWP1). Additionally, PWP1 interacts with various proteins, influencing pathways such as Wnt and Hippo, and is regulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with the CRL4 DCAF1 E3 ligase complex (Wei2020&lt; Han2020CRL4).

## Structure
The PWP1 protein, encoded by the PWP1 gene, is a member of the WD40-repeat protein family, which typically forms a beta-propeller structure. This protein contains multiple WD40 repeats, which are crucial for its function in telomere maintenance and ribosome biogenesis (Zhang2014Structure; Yu2019Pwp1). The WD40 domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, playing a significant role in stabilizing the shelterin complex and maintaining histone H4K20 trimethylation, which are essential for telomere integrity (Yu2019Pwp1).

The PWP1 protein is also characterized by tryptophan repeats and charged regions, which are common features in regulatory proteins such as transcription factors (Duronio1992Comparative). These structural elements suggest a role in regulatory processes, potentially involving nucleic acid binding (Duronio1992Comparative). The protein's involvement in ribosome biogenesis is supported by its association with RNA processing and ribosomal protein subunits (Zhang2004The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, although specific details on these modifications are limited. The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its functions in cellular processes, including telomere length regulation and ribosome synthesis.

## Function
The PWP1 gene encodes a chromatin-binding protein that plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance in healthy human cells. PWP1 is involved in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), specifically 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNAs by RNA polymerase I and 5S rRNA by RNA polymerase III. It is activated by the mTOR signaling pathway through phosphorylation, which enhances its expression and function, maintaining the 5S rDNA loci in a transcription-competent state (Liu2018PWP1).

PWP1 also plays a crucial role in maintaining telomere length and stability by stabilizing the shelterin complex and maintaining histone H4K20 trimethylation. It interacts with shelterin proteins and is essential for telomere protection and homeostasis. Depletion of PWP1 leads to reduced enrichment of shelterin proteins at telomeres, triggering DNA damage signaling (Yu2019Pwp1).

In the context of ribosome biogenesis, PWP1 is part of a subcomplex associated with the ITS2 regions of the rRNA gene, and its regulation by the CRL4 DCAF1 E3 ligase is crucial for maintaining normal ribosome synthesis (Han2020CRL4).

## Interactions
PWP1, also known as endonuclein, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular functions. It interacts with DVL2 and Merlin, playing a role in the Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways, respectively. PWP1 enhances Wnt signaling by increasing the phosphorylation of DVL2 and active β-catenin, leading to the upregulation of Wnt target proteins such as Cyclin D, MMP7, and C-myc. It also inhibits the Hippo pathway by interacting with Merlin, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of Merlin, MST1, LATS1, and YAP, and increased expression of Hippo target genes like CTGF and Cyclin E (PWP1; p&gt; Wei2020&lt).

PWP1 interacts with SUV4-20H2, a methyltransferase responsible for H4K20 trimethylation, which is crucial for maintaining telomere length. This interaction is mediated by the second WD40 repeat of PWP1, necessary for restoring H4K20me3 levels and telomere length (Yu2019Pwp1). PWP1 also binds to shelterin proteins, including POT1a, POT1b, TPP1, and TIN2, stabilizing the shelterin complex and maintaining telomere integrity (Yu2019Pwp1).

Additionally, PWP1 is a substrate of the CRL4 DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it interacts with DCAF1. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitylation and regulation of PWP1 levels (Han2020CRL4).
