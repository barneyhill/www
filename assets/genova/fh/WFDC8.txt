# WFDC8

## Overview
The WFDC8 gene encodes the WAP four-disulfide core domain 8 protein, which is a member of the whey acidic protein (WAP) family, characterized by its distinctive WAP domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function as a protease inhibitor, facilitating protein-protein interactions through its compact, disulfide-bonded structure (Rajesh2011Identification; Wen2024Versatile). The WFDC8 protein is classified as a WAP/Kunitz-type protease inhibitor due to its structural composition, which includes both WAP and Kunitz domains (Small2016The). The gene is located on chromosome 20 and is part of a cluster with other WFDC family genes, exhibiting a unique exon structure for its signal peptide (Clauss2005The). WFDC8 is expressed in various tissues, notably in reproductive and respiratory organs, and is involved in immune responses, with its C-terminal region showing significant antibacterial activity against pathogens such as Escherichia coli (Rajesh2011Identification; Wen2024Versatile).

## Structure
The WFDC8 protein is characterized by the presence of a WAP (whey acidic protein) domain, which typically contains eight conserved cysteine residues forming four disulfide bonds, creating a compact, three-dimensional structure known as the four-disulfide core (Rajesh2011Identification; Wen2024Versatile). This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and plays a role in inhibiting proteases by inserting an inhibitory loop into their active sites (Clauss2005The).

In humans, the WFDC8 gene is located on chromosome 20 and is part of a gene cluster that includes other WFDC family members (Wen2024Versatile). The gene is composed of multiple exons, with the signal peptide predicted to originate from codons in the first and second exons. This is unique compared to other WFDC genes, where the signal peptide is typically encoded by a single exon (Clauss2005The). The protein's structure includes both WAP and Kunitz domains, classifying it as a WAP/Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (Small2016The).

The WFDC8 protein is expressed in various tissues, including the reproductive and respiratory organs, and its expression can be modulated by cytokines (Wen2024Versatile). The protein's C-terminal region, containing the second WAP motif, exhibits potent antibacterial activity, particularly against Escherichia coli (Rajesh2011Identification).
