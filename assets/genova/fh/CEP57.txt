# CEP57

## Overview
CEP57 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 57, a crucial component involved in the structural and functional integrity of the centrosome. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind, nucleate, and bundle microtubules, playing a significant role in microtubule stabilization and organization. It features two α-helical coiled-coil segments and a centrosome localization domain, which are essential for its localization and function within the centrosome (Momotani2008Cep57). CEP57 is integral to the processes of centriole duplication and spindle formation, interacting with various proteins such as Mad1, Mis12, and components of the γ-tubulin ring complex (Wu2012Cep57; Zhou2016Cep57). Mutations in the CEP57 gene are linked to Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy Syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in genomic stability and development (SantosSimarro2021Mosaic).

## Structure
The CEP57 protein is composed of 500 amino acid residues and features a molecular structure that includes two α-helical coiled-coil segments connected by a flexible linker region (Momotani2008Cep57). The N-terminal region of CEP57 contains a centrosome localization domain (CLD) within amino acid residues 58-239, which is crucial for its localization to centrosomes and is involved in multimerization (Momotani2008Cep57). This region also includes a conserved 36 amino-acid sequence known as the 'PINC motif,' essential for centriolar localization (Watanabe2019The).

The C-terminal domain of CEP57 is responsible for binding, nucleating, and bundling microtubules, forming a 'basket-like' structure around the nucleus when overexpressed (Momotani2008Cep57). This domain interacts with microtubules and is crucial for microtubule stabilization (Momotani2008Cep57). CEP57 also interacts with other proteins, such as Mad1 and Mis12, through its C-terminal region, which is important for kinetochore targeting (Zhou2016Cep57).

CEP57 is known to form complexes with other centrosomal proteins, such as Cep63 and Cep152, which are important for procentriole formation (Lukinavičius2013Selective). Multiple splice variants of CEP57 exist, potentially altering its functional properties (Watanabe2019The).

## Function
CEP57 is a centrosomal protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the centrosome and ensuring proper cell cycle progression. It is involved in the organization of the pericentriolar material (PCM) and centriole engagement, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis (Watanabe2019The). CEP57 forms ring-like structures around the mother centriole and acts as an anchor for the PACT domain of pericentrin (PCNT), a major PCM component, facilitating proper PCM organization (Watanabe2019The).

CEP57 also functions as a molecular scaffold, recruiting the Cep63-Cep152 complex to the proximal end of centrioles, which is crucial for centriole duplication and proper spindle formation (Zhao2019Cep57). It interacts with the Mis12 complex and the Mad1-Mad2 complex at kinetochores, playing a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) signaling, which ensures accurate chromosome alignment and segregation (Zhou2016Cep57).

In addition to its role in mitosis, CEP57 is involved in microtubule stabilization and organization, linking the centrosome to microtubules and contributing to their nucleation and bundling (Momotani2008Cep57). This multifaceted involvement in centrosome and microtubule dynamics underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP57 gene are associated with Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy Syndrome (MVA), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by mosaic aneuploidies involving multiple chromosomes and tissues. This condition is marked by growth retardation, distinctive facial features, and abnormalities in the endocrine, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems. Notably, malignancies have not been reported in patients with MVA2, a subtype of the syndrome caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in CEP57 (SantosSimarro2021Mosaic). The CEP57 gene encodes a protein involved in microtubule stabilization, crucial for normal chromosome separation during cell division. Mutations in CEP57 can lead to centrosome amplification and chromosomal instability, which are linked to cancer phenotypes in mouse models, although human patients with CEP57 mutations do not typically show a predisposition to childhood cancers (Aziz2018Mosaicvariegated).

CEP57 is also implicated in bone development, likely through its interaction with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), a key regulator of bone formation. Mutations in CEP57 can result in skeletal abnormalities due to impaired FGF2-mediated bone development (Aziz2018Mosaicvariegated; SantosSimarro2021Mosaic). The gene is considered a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, with its insufficiency potentially promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation by affecting cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways (Aziz2018Mosaicvariegated).

## Interactions
CEP57 is a centrosomal protein that participates in several critical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cell division and genomic stability. It interacts with the protein Mad1, a component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), through its C-terminal region. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of the Mad1-Mad2 complex to kinetochores, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division (Zhou2016Cep57). The binding of CEP57 to microtubules can reduce its interaction with Mad1, suggesting a competitive binding scenario (Zhou2016Cep57).

CEP57 also interacts with Mis12, a component of the KMN network, through its N-terminal region. This interaction is necessary for the kinetochore localization of CEP57, highlighting its role in kinetochore function (Zhou2016Cep57).

In the context of centrosome function, CEP57 binds to NEDD1, a component of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), through the N-terminal domain of NEDD1. This interaction is essential for the localization of CEP57 to the centrosome and for maintaining spindle pole integrity (Wu2012Cep57). CEP57 also forms a complex with Cep63 and Cep152, which is crucial for centriole biogenesis (Zhao2019Cep57).
