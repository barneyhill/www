# ERVFRD-1

## Overview
ERVFRD-1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as syncytin-2, which is a transmembrane protein integral to placental development in humans. Syncytin-2 is primarily involved in the fusion of cytotrophoblasts, leading to the formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer, a critical structure for nutrient and hormone exchange between the mother and fetus (Priščáková2023Syncytin1; Lokossou2014Implication). This protein interacts with the receptor MFSD2a, facilitating essential fatty acid transport and cell fusion processes (Lokossou2014Implication). The expression of ERVFRD-1 is regulated by transcription factors such as GCM1, ensuring proper placental development and immune modulation during pregnancy (Priščáková2023Syncytin1). Additionally, alterations in ERVFRD-1 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it may influence tumor growth and immune response, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Namba2021Transcripttargeted; Wen2023Endogenous).

## Function
The ERVFRD-1 gene encodes the syncytin-2 protein, which plays a crucial role in the formation and function of the placenta in healthy human cells. Syncytin-2 is involved in the fusion of cytotrophoblasts, leading to the development of the syncytiotrophoblast layer, a multinucleated cell layer essential for placental development (Priščáková2023Syncytin1; Lokossou2014Implication). This layer facilitates nutrient and hormone exchange between the mother and fetus and is vital for maintaining fetomaternal tolerance (Lokossou2014Implication).

Syncytin-2 interacts with the receptor MFSD2a, which is involved in the transport of essential fatty acids and cell fusion processes (Lokossou2014Implication). The expression of ERVFRD-1 is regulated by transcription factors such as GCM1, which bind to its promoter to induce transcription, ensuring proper syncytiotrophoblast formation and maintenance (Priščáková2023Syncytin1). Syncytin-2 also contributes to immune modulation by inhibiting Th1 cytokines, which is crucial for maintaining immune balance during pregnancy (Priščáková2023Syncytin1). The protein's expression is primarily localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of primary trophoblast cells, highlighting its specific role in placental development (Priščáková2023Syncytin1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ERVFRD-1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, the ERVFRD-1 gene is involved in fusion transcripts, such as the HIST1H2AG-NonGenic-ERVFRD-1 fusion, which may lead to the expression of the full-length ERVFRD-1 protein. This aberrant expression is associated with tumor growth by inhibiting the host's antitumor immune response, as demonstrated in mouse models where tumor cells expressing ERVFRD-1 grew larger (Namba2021Transcripttargeted). 

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), ERVFRD-1 expression is generally low compared to normal tissues. However, elevated levels of ERVFRD-1 are linked to favorable survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The gene's expression correlates with immune-related pathways, showing a positive association with mast cells and a negative association with regulatory T cells, which are immunosuppressive. This indicates that ERVFRD-1 may enhance the immune phenotype in KIRC (Wen2023Endogenous).

ERVFRD-1 methylation status also plays a role in its expression and associated prognosis. Higher methylation levels are linked to poor prognosis, suggesting that demethylating agents could be a therapeutic approach (Wen2023Endogenous).
