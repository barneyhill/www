# RNF220

## Overview
RNF220 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 220, a RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including neural development, immune response, and cell signaling pathways. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ring finger protein 220 is involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein stability and function. It is particularly significant in the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and the activation of STAT1 in immune responses. The protein's activity is essential for proper neural development, as it regulates the degradation of transcription factors critical for motor neuron and interneuron formation. Additionally, RNF220's interactions with other proteins, such as β-catenin and STAT1, highlight its role in cell proliferation and immune defense mechanisms. Alterations in the expression or function of RNF220 have been linked to various diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia, neurodegenerative disorders, and male infertility (Guo2020RNF220; Ma2014The; Pan2021RNF220; Kim2018Rnf220).

## Structure


## Function
RNF220 is a RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in several critical cellular processes through its role in ubiquitination. In the context of neural development, RNF220 cooperates with the zinc-finger protein ZC4H2 to regulate the formation of ventral progenitor domains in the spinal cord by targeting transcription factors such as Dbx1/2 and Nkx2.2 for degradation. This regulation is essential for the proper development of ventral interneurons and motor neurons (Kim2018Rnf220).

RNF220 also plays a significant role in modulating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. It enhances Wnt signaling by stabilizing β-catenin through its interaction with the deubiquitinase USP7, which prevents β-catenin degradation. This stabilization is crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation processes (Ma2014The).

In immune responses, RNF220 mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of STAT1, facilitating its interaction with JAK1 and promoting STAT1 activation. This activity is vital for the expression of interferon-stimulated genes and the host's defense against infections (Guo2020RNF220).

RNF220 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences protein stability and signaling pathways, impacting various developmental and immune processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RNF220 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), RNF220 is overexpressed in bone marrow cells, correlating with poor disease-free survival and overall survival. This overexpression promotes leukemic cell proliferation by stabilizing Cyclin D1 protein levels through interaction with USP22, a deubiquitinase, facilitating cell cycle progression from the G1 to S phase (Pan2021RNF220).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, haploinsufficiency of RNF220 in mice leads to ALS-like motor neuron defects. This is characterized by reduced motility, muscle wasting, and cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP43 in spinal motor neurons. RNF220 is involved in the polyubiquitination and degradation of TDP43, and its reduced expression results in elevated TDP43 levels, contributing to ALS-like symptoms (Ma2021Haploinsufficiency).

RNF220 mutations are also linked to male infertility. A homozygous missense mutation in RNF220 has been associated with teratozoospermia, specifically a small-headed sperm phenotype. This mutation leads to reduced RNF220 protein levels, affecting sperm head development and resulting in infertility (Jiang2019A).

## Interactions
RNF220, a RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular pathways. It interacts with β-catenin, a key protein in the Wnt signaling pathway, stabilizing it by reducing its ubiquitination. This interaction is facilitated through RNF220's association with ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7), forming a complex that deubiquitinates β-catenin, thereby enhancing Wnt signaling (Ma2014The).

RNF220 also interacts with STAT1, a critical molecule in interferon signaling. It mediates K63-linked polyubiquitination of STAT1, enhancing its interaction with JAK1, which is crucial for STAT1 activation and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. This interaction is essential for host defense mechanisms against infections (Guo2020RNF220).

In the context of acute myeloid leukemia, RNF220 interacts with Cyclin D1, stabilizing its protein levels and promoting leukemic cell proliferation. This interaction suggests a role for RNF220 in cell cycle regulation (Pan2021RNF220).

RNF220 is also involved in the ubiquitination and autophagic degradation of Gli proteins, interacting with HDAC6 to promote the accumulation of Gli proteins in aggresomes, which are then degraded via autophagy (Wang2021RNF220mediated).
