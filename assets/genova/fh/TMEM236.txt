# TMEM236

## Overview
TMEM236 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 236, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular communication, due to its location spanning the cellular membrane. The gene has garnered attention for its potential role in several diseases, acting as a biomarker due to its altered expression levels in conditions such as colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Its interactions with other genes and proteins further underscore its significance in disease pathology and progression (Maurya2021Transcriptome; Adnan2020Mutation; Wang2017Human).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM236 has been identified as a potential biomarker in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), TMEM236 is significantly downregulated in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. This downregulation is statistically significant and indicates its potential relevance in CRC pathology (Maurya2021Transcriptome). The gene's interaction with other genes implicated in CRC progression, such as OPRM1, AQP2, and SHBG, further supports its involvement in the disease (Maurya2021Transcriptome).

In the context of type 2 diabetes, TMEM236 expression is increased due to the SVA-438 insertion, which is associated with higher blood glucose levels and reduced metabolic clearance rate of insulin. This suggests that TMEM236 may contribute to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Wang2017Human).

TMEM236 has also been implicated in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) through the identification of a TMEM236-MRC1 hybrid gene, which was recurrent in aggressive stages of the disease. This hybrid gene suggests a potential role in CML progression (Adnan2020Mutation).

Additionally, TMEM236 has been associated with a reduced risk of hypothyroidism, as identified through a genome-wide association study (Li2023Wholegenome).
