# C1orf226

## Overview
C1orf226 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 226. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the organization of nuclear components and potentially contributing to chromosomal stability (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). While the specific functions of C1orf226 in healthy human cells are not fully characterized, it is known to interact with several proteins, such as BCR, BTRC, and PTPRJ, suggesting roles in regulatory processes, protein degradation, and signal transduction (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, C1orf226 is implicated in cancer-related pathways through its interactions with oncoproteins like BARD1 and HRAS (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene has clinical significance in conditions such as nephrotic syndrome and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression levels may influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Buerger2024Recessive; Wen2014Gene).

## Function
C1orf226 is a protein that appears to be involved in several cellular processes, although its specific functions in healthy human cells are not fully characterized. It is functionally associated with the formation of nuclear specks, which are involved in the organization of nuclear components, as indicated by its association with the Gene Ontology (GO) term 'GO:0016607~nuclear speck' (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). This suggests a role in nuclear processes, potentially contributing to chromosomal stability, as it is also linked with the GO term 'PA443358~aneuploidy' (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

C1orf226 interacts with several proteins, such as BCR, BTRC, and PTPRJ, in the brain, suggesting roles in regulatory processes, protein degradation, and signal transduction (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). These interactions imply that C1orf226 may participate in complex signaling pathways and regulatory networks within cells. Additionally, C1orf226 is involved in interactions with oncoproteins like BARD1, BCR, and HRAS, indicating a potential role in cancer-related pathways, although its specific function in non-cancerous cells remains unclear (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its potential significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular signals.

## Clinical Significance
C1orf226 has been implicated in several medical conditions through its altered expression and genetic interactions. In the context of kidney disease, recessive variants in the intergenic NOS1AP-C1orf226 locus have been associated with a monogenic form of nephrotic syndrome. This condition is characterized by podocytopathy and is responsive to anti-proteinuric treatment, particularly with RAAS inhibitors like lisinopril. The intergenic splicing between NOS1AP and C1orf226 is crucial for maintaining podocyte homeostasis and kidney function, and disruptions in this splicing can lead to severe nephrotic syndrome and early onset kidney failure (Buerger2024Recessive).

C1orf226 has also been studied in the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). It was identified as one of the genes downregulated in patients who showed a complete pathological response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. This suggests that C1orf226 expression levels may have potential clinical significance in predicting treatment outcomes for ESCC (Wen2014Gene).

Additionally, C1orf226 has been associated with immune system activation in uveitis, where it was found to be upregulated in various subtypes of the condition, indicating a potential role in inflammation-related pathways (Rosenbaum2021Identifying).

## Interactions
C1orf226 is involved in various protein interactions, particularly in the brain and in certain cancer types. In the brain, C1orf226 interacts with BCR, a protein involved in regulatory activities toward small GTP-binding proteins, with a correlation coefficient range of 0.53-0.59. In lower-grade glioma (LGG), the interaction with BCR shows a correlation of -0.06 (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). C1orf226 also interacts with BTRC, an E3-ubiquitin-protein ligase, in the brain with a correlation range of 0.60-0.76, and in LGG with a correlation of -0.09 (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Another significant interaction is with PTPRJ, a protein involved in dephosphorylation, showing a correlation range of 0.53-0.80 in the brain and 0.06 in LGG (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

These interactions suggest that C1orf226 may play roles in regulatory processes and protein modification pathways. The protein is also implicated in cancer-related signaling pathways through its interactions with proteins such as BARD1, BRD3, FOXO3, HRAS, and PRCC, although the exact nature and biological significance of these interactions require further elucidation (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
