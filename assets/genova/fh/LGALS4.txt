# LGALS4

## Overview
LGALS4 is a gene that encodes the protein galectin-4, a member of the galectin family known for its β-galactoside-binding properties. Galectin-4 is a type of lectin involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, signaling, and immune response modulation. It is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract, where it plays critical roles in oligodendrocyte differentiation, myelination, and maintaining epithelial cell integrity (Lidström2022Extracellular; NioKobayashi2021Galectins). The protein's interactions with T cell surface proteins, particularly the CD3 complex, highlight its significance in immune regulation and potential implications in cancer and inflammatory diseases (Paclik2008Galectin4; Satelli2010Galectin‐4). Galectin-4's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions.

## Function
Galectin-4, encoded by the LGALS4 gene, is a β-galactoside-binding lectin involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. In the central nervous system, galectin-4 plays a role in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. It is characteristically expressed during oligodendrocyte differentiation, where it suppresses differentiation and myelination by binding to premyelinating oligodendrocytes, thus influencing the timing of myelination (NioKobayashi2021Galectins). Despite its regulatory role in vitro, studies in galectin-4-deficient mice suggest that galectin-4 is not essential for normal myelination in vivo, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms or redundancy in its function (Brocca2022Normal).

Galectin-4 is also involved in axonal growth by clustering axon growth-promoting molecules, such as the neural cell adhesion molecule L1, and is sorted into discrete segments of the axonal membrane in a microtubule- and sulfatide-dependent manner (NioKobayashi2021Galectins). In the gastrointestinal tract, galectin-4 is abundant and plays a role in maintaining epithelial cell integrity, participating in cell adhesion, signaling, and immune response modulation, which influences tissue homeostasis and inflammation (Lidström2022Extracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of LGALS4, or galectin-4, have been implicated in various cancers, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer. In CRC, galectin-4 is highly expressed in normal colonic epithelial cells but is significantly reduced in adenomas and nearly absent in invasive carcinomas. This downregulation is associated with increased cell proliferation and tumor progression, suggesting that galectin-4 functions as a tumor suppressor (Satelli2010Galectin‐4). The loss of galectin-4 expression is also linked to the dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial in CRC development (Satelli2010Galectin‐4).

In gastric cancer, galectin-4 is involved in the structural changes of glycosphingolipid glycans, which may contribute to cancer metastasis. It is highly expressed in poorly differentiated gastric cancer cells with high metastatic potential, promoting cell proliferation and peritoneal dissemination (Hachisu2023Galectin4).

Galectin-4 expression is also affected by chronic inflammation and conditions like Crohn's disease, where its expression is decreased, suggesting a potential role in inflammation-related conditions (Satelli2010Galectin‐4). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LGALS4 in cancer progression and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
Galectin-4 (LGALS4) is known for its interactions with T cell surface proteins, particularly the CD3 complex. It binds selectively to the CD3 region on activated T cells, which is crucial for T cell signaling and activation. This interaction is carbohydrate-dependent and can be inhibited by lactose, indicating a specific binding mechanism (Paclik2008Galectin4). Galectin-4's binding to CD3 leads to the modulation of T cell functions, including the inhibition of cell cycle progression and the induction of apoptosis through a calpain-dependent pathway (Paclik2008Galectin4).

In the context of pancreatic cancer, Galectin-4 interacts with the CD3 complex on T cells, promoting immune evasion by inducing T cell apoptosis. This interaction is partially dependent on glycosylation, as demonstrated by reduced binding following glycosidase treatment. The binding specificity is further highlighted by the fact that it can be inhibited by galactose but not fructose (Lidström2022Extracellular). These interactions suggest that Galectin-4 plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases characterized by immune dysregulation.
