# FBXO31

## Overview
FBXO31 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 31, a member of the F-box protein family, which is integral to the SCF (Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. This protein plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the degradation of specific proteins to regulate various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and genomic stability. F-box protein 31 is particularly involved in the degradation of cyclin D1, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, which is essential for DNA repair and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ma2010FBXO31; Santra2009Fbox). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, highlighting its significance in the DNA damage response and tumor suppression (Tan2018The; Santra2009Fbox). The dysregulation of FBXO31 has been implicated in various cancers, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target (Zou2018FBXO31; Zhang2014Fbox).

## Structure
FBXO31 is a protein encoded by the FBXO31 gene, consisting of 539 amino acids with a molecular weight of 60,533 Da (Tan2018The). It is a member of the F-box protein family, characterized by the presence of an F-box domain, which is approximately 40 amino acids in length. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions within the SCF (Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (Tan2018The; Yang2024Fbox). The F-box domain interacts with the Skp1 protein, facilitating the formation of the SCF complex, which is essential for targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Yang2024Fbox).

FBXO31 may also contain additional domains that aid in substrate recognition, although specific details on these domains are not provided in the context. The protein is involved in the degradation of specific substrates, such as cyclin D1, which leads to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase (Yang2024Fbox). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of FBXO31, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. There is no information on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FBXO31, nor on any splice variant isoforms.

## Function
FBXO31 is a member of the F-box protein family and functions as a substrate recognition component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which regulates protein degradation, a critical process for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Tan2018The). In healthy human cells, FBXO31 plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the G1 phase. It mediates the degradation of cyclin D1, a key regulator of the G1 to S phase transition, thereby inducing G1 arrest. This process is crucial for allowing DNA repair to occur before the cell progresses through the cell cycle (Ma2010FBXO31; Santra2009Fbox).

FBXO31 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to the regulation of cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability. Its activity is dependent on the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine-286 and the presence of the F-box motif, which is essential for its function in protein degradation (Santra2009Fbox). The protein's expression is induced in response to DNA damage, highlighting its role in the DNA damage response (DDR) (Santra2009Fbox).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO31 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. In gastric cancer (GC), FBXO31 is downregulated, which correlates with increased tumor size, infiltration, and poor prognosis. Its reduced expression is associated with higher levels of Snail1, a protein involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting that FBXO31 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting Snail1 for degradation (Zou2018FBXO31; Zhang2014Fbox). Overexpression of FBXO31 in GC cells has been shown to reduce metastasis and tumor growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zou2018FBXO31).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FBXO31 is also downregulated, leading to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. This is partly due to its role in degrading cyclin D1, a key regulator of the cell cycle (Ma2010FBXO31). In endometrial cancer, FBXO31 expression is regulated by the transcription factor KLF9, and its overexpression enhances sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin, suggesting a role in overcoming drug resistance (Yang2023KLF9‑regulated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FBXO31 in cancer progression and treatment.

## Interactions
FBXO31 is a member of the F-box protein family and functions as part of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing) ubiquitin ligase complex. It interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in protein degradation pathways. FBXO31 binds to cyclin D1, promoting its ubiquitination and degradation, which is crucial for inducing G1 arrest following DNA damage (Santra2009Fbox). This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine-286 and the presence of the F-box motif in FBXO31 (Santra2009Fbox).

FBXO31 also interacts with other proteins involved in cancer progression. In breast cancer, it targets chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 (Cdt1) for degradation, contributing to its tumor suppressive function (Tan2018The). It interacts with forkhead box protein M1 (FXOM1) and mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2), leading to elevated p53 levels and cell cycle arrest (Tan2018The). In gastric cancer, FBXO31's function is inhibited by the pseudophosphatase STYX, which disrupts its ability to degrade CyclinD1 and Snail1, thereby promoting cancer progression (Liu2022Pseudophosphatase). These interactions highlight FBXO31's role in regulating cell cycle and tumorigenesis.
