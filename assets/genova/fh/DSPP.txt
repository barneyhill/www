# DSPP

## Overview
Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is a gene that encodes the precursor protein of the same name, which is crucial for the formation and mineralization of dentin, a calcified tissue in teeth. The DSPP protein undergoes post-translational cleavage to produce two major components: dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP), both of which play distinct roles in the mineralization process. DSPP is predominantly expressed in odontoblasts, the cells responsible for dentin production, and is part of the SIBLING family of proteins, known for their intrinsic disorder and phosphorylation motifs (Huq2005A; Fisher2011DMP1). The protein's function is facilitated by its interactions with various partners, including integrins and matrix metalloproteinases, which are essential for its role in biomineralization and the nucleation of apatite crystals (Suzuki2012Dentin; Prasad2010Dentin). Mutations in the DSPP gene are linked to hereditary dentin disorders such as dentinogenesis imperfecta, underscoring its significance in dental health (Yang2017BMP2).

## Structure
The dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) gene encodes a precursor protein that is cleaved into two major components: dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP). DSPP is characterized by its highly phosphorylated and acidic nature, which contributes to its role in dentin mineralization (von2010Dentin; Huq2005A). The primary structure of DSPP includes a signal peptide and specific cleavage sites, notably the MQG/DDP motif, which is cleaved by bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1) isoforms (von2010Dentin).

DSPP is part of the SIBLING family of proteins, which are often intrinsically disordered and contain phosphorylation motifs, such as the SerSerAsp repeat in the DPP domain (Huq2005A; Fisher2011DMP1). This intrinsic disorder allows DSPP to be flexible and multifunctional, facilitating interactions with various partners during dentinogenesis (Huq2005A). The DPP domain is particularly rich in phosphoserine repeats, contributing to its role in hydroxyapatite nucleation and regulation (Huq2005A).

Post-translational modifications, including extensive phosphorylation, are crucial for DSPP's function in biomineralization (Huq2005A). The gene also exhibits alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcripts that may influence the relative proportions of DSP and DPP in the dentin matrix (Feng1998Genomic).

## Function
Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is a critical gene involved in the formation and mineralization of dentin, a calcified tissue in teeth. DSPP is primarily expressed in odontoblasts, the cells responsible for dentin production, and to a lesser extent in osteoblasts (Suzuki2012Dentin). The DSPP protein is cleaved into two main components: dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP), both of which play distinct roles in dentin mineralization. DSP is involved in the initiation of mineralization, while DPP contributes to the maturation of mineralized dentin (Suzuki2012Dentin).

DSPP activates integrin-dependent signaling pathways, which are crucial for the mineralization process. It acts as a nucleator of apatite crystal formation in the presence of collagen, facilitating organized intrafibrillar collagen mineralization (Suzuki2012Dentin). The protein's cleavage by bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1) isoforms is essential for its function, as these isoforms process DSPP into its active components, DSP and DPP, which are necessary for proper dentin matrix formation (von2010Dentin).

Mutations in the DSPP gene are linked to hereditary dentin disorders, such as dentinogenesis imperfecta, highlighting its importance in maintaining dentin integrity (Yang2017BMP2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DSPP gene are associated with several dental conditions, primarily dentinogenesis imperfecta (DGI) types I, II, and III, and dentin dysplasia (DD) types I and II. These conditions are characterized by defects in dentin, the hard tissue beneath the enamel of a tooth, leading to discolored, weak, or misshapen teeth. DGI is marked by opalescent teeth, bulbous crowns, and significant attrition, with DGI-III also showing 'shell teeth' due to pulp enlargement. DD-II affects only deciduous teeth, presenting with a 'thistle-tube' pulp appearance on X-rays (McKnight2008Overlapping; de2014Isolated).

DSPP mutations often result in frameshifts that alter the protein's repetitive sequences, leading to different phenotypes. Longer sequence changes are linked to dentine dysplasia, while shorter changes are associated with dentinogenesis imperfecta type II (Maciejewska2012Hereditary). These mutations can cause dominant-negative effects, potentially affecting preameloblasts during the formation of the dentino-enamel junction, leading to enamel defects (Wang2011Enamel).

Some DSPP mutations are also associated with progressive sensorineural high-frequency hearing loss, suggesting a broader impact beyond dental tissues (Kim2004A). The inheritance pattern for these conditions is typically autosomal dominant (Kim2004A).

## Interactions
Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is involved in several interactions crucial for its role in dentin mineralization. DSPP is cleaved into dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) by bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1) isoforms, a process essential for its function in biomineralization (von2010Dentin). DPP, one of the cleaved products, binds large amounts of calcium and interacts with type I collagen, particularly in the 'e' band region of fibrillar collagen. This interaction is significant for the formation of initial apatite crystals, which are vital for dentin mineralization (Prasad2010Dentin).

DSPP also interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-2 and MMP-20, which are involved in its further processing. This interaction is likely part of a degradation process following the initial activation by BMP1 (Prasad2010Dentin). Additionally, DSPP has been shown to interact with matrix metalloproteinase 20 (MMP20), suggesting a role in cell migration and metastasis in cancer contexts (Gkouveris2018The).

These interactions highlight DSPP's role in both normal physiological processes, such as dentin mineralization, and pathological conditions, including its potential involvement in cancer progression.
