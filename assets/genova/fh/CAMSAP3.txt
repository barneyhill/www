# CAMSAP3

## Overview
CAMSAP3 is a gene that encodes the calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein family member 3, a crucial component in the regulation of microtubule dynamics within cells. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind to the minus ends of microtubules, thereby stabilizing them and preventing depolymerization. This function is vital for maintaining cell shape, polarity, and the organization of noncentrosomal microtubule networks, particularly in epithelial cells (Noordstra2016Control; Ning2016The). CAMSAP3 is involved in various cellular processes, including the anchoring of microtubules to adherens junctions and the coordination of microtubule and actin filament dynamics, which are essential for cell migration and orientation (Ning2016The). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as ACF7 and katanin, further underscore its role in maintaining cellular structure and function (Robinson2020CAMSAP3; Ning2016The). Alterations in CAMSAP3 expression or function have been linked to clinical conditions, including ciliary dysfunction and cancer progression, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Robinson2020CAMSAP3; Pongrakhananon2018Loss).

## Structure
CAMSAP3, also known as Nezha or Marshalin, is a protein characterized by several distinct structural domains. It contains a C-terminal CKK domain, which is crucial for microtubule minus-end recognition and protection. This domain has a compact, globular structure composed of two N-terminal α-helices connected by a disordered loop, which pack against a central five-stranded β-sheet (Atherton2017A). The CKK domain binds to microtubules at the intra-dimer site between protofilaments, showing a preference for the minus ends (Atherton2017A).

CAMSAP3 also features several coiled-coil regions and an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, although the function of the CH domain is not fully understood (Noordstra2016Control; Jiang2018Structural). The coiled-coil regions are suggested to enhance the protein's avidity for interacting with other complexes, such as the katanin heterodimer (Jiang2018Structural).

The protein is known to have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and interactions. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, could regulate its activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. CAMSAP3's structural features are essential for its role in stabilizing and organizing microtubule arrays in cells.

## Function
CAMSAP3, also known as Nezha, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the organization and stabilization of noncentrosomal microtubule networks in mammalian epithelial cells. It binds to the minus ends of microtubules, preventing their depolymerization and maintaining their stability, which is essential for cell shape and polarity (Noordstra2016Control; Ning2016The). CAMSAP3 is involved in anchoring microtubules to adherens junctions and interacts with ACF7, a protein that binds to microtubule plus ends, to tether microtubules to actin filaments. This interaction is vital for coordinating the dynamics of microtubules and actin filaments, impacting cell migration and microtubule orientation (Ning2016The).

In epithelial cells, CAMSAP3 is essential for the proper assembly and positioning of the Golgi apparatus. It interacts with CG-NAP, a protein that provides a microtubule nucleation site, facilitating microtubule emanation from CAMSAP3 clusters. This interaction is necessary for Golgi assembly and integrity (Wang2017CAMSAP3dependent). CAMSAP3 also plays a role in maintaining neuronal polarity by regulating microtubule stability, preventing the formation of multiple axons in neurons (Pongrakhananon2018CAMSAP3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the CAMSAP3 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly those involving ciliary dysfunction and cancer progression. CAMSAP3 is crucial for the formation and function of motile cilia, and its deficiency can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)-like symptoms. These include respiratory issues, hydrocephalus, subfertility, and impaired mucociliary clearance, which can cause conditions such as rhinosinusitis and otitis media (Robinson2020CAMSAP3; O’Donnell2022Vestibular). In Camsap3 tm1a/tm1a mice, knockdown of CAMSAP3 results in structural defects in motile cilia, such as disoriented basal bodies and missing central microtubule pairs, leading to ineffective mucus clearance and respiratory distress (Robinson2020CAMSAP3).

In cancer, particularly lung carcinoma, the loss of CAMSAP3 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process associated with increased cell motility and metastasis. This occurs through enhanced tubulin acetylation and Akt activation, which are critical for EMT induction and cancer cell invasion (Pongrakhananon2018Loss). CAMSAP3's role in maintaining epithelial phenotypes suggests its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
CAMSAP3 interacts with the spectraplakin protein ACF7, a crucial interaction for anchoring noncentrosomal microtubules to actin filaments. This interaction is mediated through the CC(1,2) domain of CAMSAP3 and the 19th spectrin repeat of ACF7, facilitating the tethering of microtubule minus ends to actin filaments and coordinating their dynamics (Ning2016The). The CAMSAP3-ACF7 complex is essential for maintaining microtubule orientation and cell migration, as it influences the retrograde flow of actin arcs and the orientation of microtubules perpendicular to the cell edge (Ning2016The).

CAMSAP3 also plays a role in epithelial cell polarity by interacting with ACF7 to regulate the apical localization of microtubule minus ends. This interaction is necessary for the proper distribution of Rab11A endosomes and the organization of apico-basal microtubule arrays (Noordstra2016Control). In multiciliated cells, CAMSAP3 is involved in basal body polarity and the formation of the central pair of microtubules, interacting with the MT-severing protein katanin to balance microtubule nucleation and destruction (Robinson2020CAMSAP3). These interactions highlight CAMSAP3's role in coordinating cytoskeletal networks and maintaining cellular structure and function.
