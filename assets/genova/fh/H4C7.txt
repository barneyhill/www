# H4C7

## Overview
The H4C7 gene encodes the H4 clustered histone 7 protein, a canonical isoform of histone H4, which is integral to the structure and function of chromatin. Histone H4 is a core component of the nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin, and plays a critical role in DNA packaging within the nucleus. The protein interacts with other histones, such as H2A, H2B, and H3, to form the nucleosome core particle, facilitating the organization of DNA into a compact, yet accessible, structure (Luger1997Crystal). The N-terminal tail of histone H4 is particularly important for chromatin stability and dynamics, as it engages in inter-nucleosomal interactions that are essential for higher-order chromatin structure (Luger1997Crystal). Beyond its structural role, H4C7 is implicated in cancer biology, where its expression levels correlate with cancer progression and may be modulated by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (Espiritu2021Molecular). This dual role in chromatin architecture and cancer progression underscores the significance of H4C7 in both cellular biology and clinical research.

## Clinical Significance
The H4C7 gene, encoding a canonical isoform of histone H4, plays a significant role in cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer. Alterations in the expression of H4C7 have been linked to various stages of cancer development. In breast cancer, the expression level of H4C7 correlates with cancer progression stages, with higher expression levels associated with more advanced stages of the disease. Knockout models of H4C7 have demonstrated reduced tumorigenesis, suggesting that its expression is crucial for tumor development (Espiritu2021Molecular).

The clinical significance of H4C7 in cancer is further underscored by its localization in nucleoli, where it enhances rDNA transcription. This activity is vital for cancer cell proliferation, as it supports increased ribosomal RNA synthesis, a requirement for rapid cell growth and division (Espiritu2021Molecular). The differential expression of histone isoforms, including H4C7, may be influenced by DNA methylation patterns, which can affect cancer prognosis and therapeutic responses (Espiritu2021Molecular).

These findings suggest that H4C7 could serve as a potential biomarker for cancer progression and a target for therapeutic intervention, highlighting its importance in the clinical landscape of cancer treatment and prognosis.

## Interactions
The H4C7 gene encodes a canonical isoform of histone H4, which is involved in the formation of nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin. Histone H4, including the isoform produced by H4C7, interacts with other core histones, such as H2A, H2B, and H3, to form the nucleosome core particle. This particle consists of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer, which is organized into H3-H4 tetramers and H2A-H2B dimers (Luger1997Crystal).

The H4 histone is noted for its N-terminal tail, which makes extensive contacts with the H2A-H2B dimer of an adjacent nucleosome particle. These interactions involve multiple hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, which are crucial for the stability and higher-order structure of chromatin (Luger1997Crystal). The H4 tail, particularly amino acids 16-24, interacts with the acidic region on the H2A-H2B dimer, contributing to interparticle contacts and chromatin dynamics (Luger1997Crystal).

In the context of cancer, the expression level of H4C7 correlates with cancer progression, and its differential expression may be influenced by DNA methylation patterns, affecting cancer prognosis and therapeutic responses (Espiritu2021Molecular).
