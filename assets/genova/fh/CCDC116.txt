# CCDC116

## Overview
CCDC116 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 116, which is characterized by the presence of a coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions. This protein is primarily expressed in the testis, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis, and is localized to the centrosome, implicating it in the regulation of the cell cycle and genomic stability. The gene's expression is generally low in other tissues, but variations in its expression have been linked to cancer susceptibility, with specific genetic variants offering protective effects against various cancers. The dual role of CCDC116 in cancer and autoimmune diseases highlights its potential as a target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies (Qin2017A).

## Function
CCDC116 is a gene that encodes a protein with a coiled-coil domain, which is a structural motif known to facilitate protein-protein interactions. This suggests that CCDC116 may play a role in cellular organization or signaling processes. The protein is primarily expressed in the testis, indicating a potential involvement in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development (Qin2017A). 

In terms of cellular localization, CCDC116 is found at the centrosome, a key organelle involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and the maintenance of genomic stability. Aberrations in the centrosome duplication cycle can lead to genome instability, which is a hallmark of cancer. The presence of CCDC116 at the centrosome suggests it may play a role in the centrosome duplication cycle, potentially influencing cell division and genomic integrity (Qin2017A).

The gene's expression is generally low in other solid tissues, but even this low-level expression in normal tissues might contribute to cancer predisposition, highlighting its potential role in tumorigenesis (Qin2017A). The specific molecular functions and pathways involving CCDC116 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC116 gene has been implicated in the susceptibility to multiple types of cancer. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs3747093, located in the promoter region of CCDC116, has been identified as having a protective effect against cancer. This variant is associated with decreased expression of CCDC116 in both normal and cancerous lung tissues, suggesting a role in cancer risk modulation (Qin2017A). The A allele of rs3747093 is particularly noted for its protective effect against lung cancer, as well as gastric, esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancers, in both Asian and European populations (Qin2017A).

The study also highlights the potential dual role of the genetic region encompassing CCDC116 in cancer and autoimmune diseases, with opposite effects observed for these conditions (Qin2017A). The findings suggest that even low-level expression of CCDC116 in normal tissues may contribute to cancer predisposition, indicating its potential as a diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic target (Qin2017A). The research underscores the importance of genetic variants in cancer-testis genes like CCDC116 in influencing cancer susceptibility, particularly through effects on gene expression (Qin2017A).
