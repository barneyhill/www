# WASHC2C

## Overview
WASHC2C is a gene that encodes the WASH complex subunit 2C, a protein integral to the WASH complex, which is involved in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. The WASH complex subunit 2C protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by facilitating the formation of branched actin networks through the activation of the Arp2/3 complex, thereby maintaining the architecture of the endolysosomal system and aiding in the recycling of surface proteins (Alekhina2017Cellular; CerdánVélez2024The). This protein is crucial for the recycling of plasma membrane proteins, such as integrins, and interacts with the Retromer complex to promote endosomal sorting (Buckley2016WASH; Deatherage2020Retromer). Alterations in the WASHC2C gene have been linked to various diseases, including intellectual disability syndromes and hereditary spastic paraplegia, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology (Alekhina2017Cellular).

## Function
WASHC2C is a component of the WASH complex, which plays a critical role in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. This protein is involved in the regulation of endocytic trafficking, influencing processes such as receptor recycling and degradation. WASHC2C, as part of the WASH complex, is recruited to endosomes where it contributes to the formation of branched actin networks by activating the Arp2/3 complex. This actin polymerization is essential for maintaining the architecture of the endolysosomal system and facilitating the recycling of surface proteins from endosomes back to the plasma membrane (Alekhina2017Cellular; CerdánVélez2024The).

The WASH complex, including WASHC2C, is crucial for the recycling of plasma membrane proteins, such as integrins, from macropinosomes and phagosomes. This recycling process is vital for maintaining surface levels of phagocytic receptors, which are necessary for efficient phagocytosis and cellular homeostasis (Buckley2016WASH). In the absence of WASHC2C, cells may experience disruptions in endosomal sorting, leading to increased degradation of surface proteins and impaired cellular functions (Buckley2016WASH). The activity of WASHC2C in endosomes underscores its importance in cellular organization and membrane dynamics, impacting various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WASHC2C gene, a component of the WASH complex, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. The WASH complex is crucial for endosomal sorting and receptor recycling, and its dysfunction can lead to significant cellular and physiological consequences. Mutations in components of the WASH complex, including WASHC2C, have been associated with intellectual disability syndromes and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) (Alekhina2017Cellular). 

In the context of viral infections, WASHC2C plays a significant role in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication. Knockdown of WASHC2C results in decreased viral titers, indicating its importance in viral replication. HCMV infection stabilizes the CCC-WASH complex, enhancing its association and supporting intracellular transport, which is crucial for virus production (Hashimoto2020Temporal).

In cancer research, WASHC2C has been identified in studies examining the impact of cigarette smoke on lung mucoepidermoid cancer cells, although specific clinical significance in this context is not detailed (Solanki2017Chronic). Additionally, WASHC2C is mentioned in studies on colorectal cancer, but its specific role or clinical significance in this disease is not elaborated (Nunes2024Prognostic).

## Interactions
WASHC2C, also known as WASH complex subunit 2C, is a component of the WASH complex, which plays a significant role in actin polymerization and endosomal sorting. WASHC2C interacts with the Retromer complex, specifically through its unstructured segment containing 21 Leucine-Phenylalanine-acidic motifs (LFa), which serve as Retromer-binding sites. This interaction is crucial for recruiting the WASH complex to endosomal membranes, promoting actin polymerization and sorting, although WASHC2C does not influence the oligomeric state of the Retromer complex (Deatherage2020Retromer).

During human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, WASHC2C shows increased association with the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex, enhancing the stability of the CCC-WASH complex. This interaction is important for virus production, likely by supporting intracellular trafficking events (Hashimoto2020Temporal).

WASHC2C is also involved in interactions with other proteins within the WASH complex, such as FAM21, which binds to the retromer protein Vps35. This interaction is mediated by the extended C-terminal tail of FAM21, highlighting the role of WASHC2C in endosomal protein sorting and vesicular trafficking (Alekhina2017Cellular; Harbour2012Recruitment).
