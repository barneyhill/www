# CHRNA1

## Overview
The CHRNA1 gene encodes the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit, a critical component of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which is a transmembrane receptor. This receptor plays a pivotal role in neuromuscular transmission by mediating synaptic communication at the neuromuscular junction. The protein encoded by CHRNA1 is integral to the formation of the receptor's ligand-binding site, facilitating the binding of acetylcholine, which triggers ion flow and muscle contraction. The nAChR is a heteropentameric complex, and the alpha 1 subunit is essential for its proper assembly and function. Mutations in CHRNA1 are linked to various neuromuscular disorders, including congenital myasthenic syndromes and lethal multiple pterygium syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhuang2022Case; Ohno2023Clinical; Hurst2013Nicotinic).

## Structure
The CHRNA1 gene encodes the α1 subunit of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), an integral membrane protein. This subunit consists of approximately 482 amino acids and features a hydrophobicity profile consistent with four transmembrane segments, indicating its role as a transmembrane protein (Hurst2013Nicotinic). The α1 subunit includes two adjacent cysteines in the extracellular domain, which are crucial components of the ligand-binding site (Hurst2013Nicotinic). 

The muscle nAChR is a heteropentameric receptor, initially composed of α1, β1, γ, and δ subunits in its embryonic form, with the γ subunit being replaced by the ε subunit in the adult form. This switch is essential for muscle development and function (Hurst2013Nicotinic). The receptor's quaternary structure involves the assembly of these subunits around an axis of symmetry to form a structure that spans the membrane, creating an ionic pore (Hurst2013Nicotinic).

The α1 subunit's extracellular domain is largely composed of β-sheets, while the transmembrane domains are α-helices (Albuquerque2009Mammalian). The receptor complex has a cone shape, with subunits tilted relative to the membrane plane, allowing it to function as a hydrated channel permeable to selected ions (Albuquerque2009Mammalian).

## Function
The CHRNA1 gene encodes the alpha subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are crucial for neuromuscular transmission in healthy human cells. These receptors are neurotransmitter-gated ion channels located at the neuromuscular junction, where they mediate synaptic transmission initiated by the binding of acetylcholine (ACh) to the receptor. This binding triggers ion flow, leading to muscle membrane depolarization and subsequent muscle contraction (Tei2015Antisense; Rahman2013HnRNP).

The nAChR is a pentameric complex composed of five transmembrane subunits, including two alpha subunits encoded by CHRNA1, along with beta, delta, and gamma (or epsilon in adult muscle) subunits. The alpha subunit contains the site for acetylcholine binding, which is essential for the receptor's function in facilitating the transmission of nerve impulses to muscle fibers (Beeson1990The; Rahman2013HnRNP).

In healthy human cells, the CHRNA1 gene undergoes alternative splicing to produce two splice variants: P3A(-), which forms functional nAChRs, and P3A(+), which does not. The balance between these splice variants is maintained to ensure the production of functional nAChRs, which are essential for proper neuromuscular function (Tei2015Antisense).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHRNA1 gene, which encodes the alpha 1 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, are associated with several neuromuscular disorders. Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of inherited disorders characterized by muscle weakness due to impaired neuromuscular transmission. Pathogenic variants in CHRNA1 can lead to different forms of CMS, including slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (SCCMS) and fast-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (FCCMS). SCCMS is often caused by gain-of-function mutations that result in prolonged acetylcholine receptor ion channel openings, while FCCMS is linked to loss-of-function mutations that reduce receptor function (Ohno2023Clinical; Schaaf2014Nicotinic).

CHRNA1 mutations are also implicated in lethal multiple pterygium syndrome (LMPS), a severe condition characterized by fetal akinesia and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. These mutations typically result in a loss of function, leading to defective neuromuscular junction signal transmission (Zhuang2022Case; Schaaf2014Nicotinic).

Alterations in CHRNA1 expression levels have been linked to primary focal hyperhidrosis (PFH), a condition marked by excessive sweating. In PFH, CHRNA1 is up-regulated in sweat glands, and its inhibition has been shown to reduce symptoms, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Lin2021CHRNA1).

## Interactions
The CHRNA1 gene encodes the alpha 1 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which is involved in neuromuscular transmission. This subunit is part of a pentameric receptor complex that includes other subunits such as beta, gamma, and delta. The CHRNA1 protein interacts with these subunits to form a functional receptor that binds acetylcholine, leading to ion channel opening and muscle contraction.

In the context of agrin-induced postsynaptic specialization, the CHRNA1 mRNA, rather than the protein itself, has been shown to associate with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor complexes in C2C12 myotubes. This association is facilitated by the RNA-binding protein Stau1, which interacts with CHRNA1 mRNA in an agrin-dependent manner. Stau1 co-clusters with AChR in agrin-treated myotubes, and its knockdown results in defective AChR clustering, indicating its role in the organization of postsynaptic components (Chang2012Agrin).

Additionally, the CHRNA1 gene is involved in splicing regulation through interactions with splicing factors such as hnRNP H. This protein binds to an intronic splicing silencer in CHRNA1, affecting the splicing of exon P3A. Mutations that disrupt this binding can lead to congenital myasthenic syndrome by causing the inclusion of a nonfunctional exon (Masuda2008hnRNP).
