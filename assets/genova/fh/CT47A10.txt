# CT47A10

## Overview
CT47A10 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 47 member A10, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen family. This family of proteins is characterized by its restricted expression pattern, typically limited to the testis and various cancerous tissues, making them of particular interest in cancer research and immunotherapy. The CT47A10 protein is implicated in the regulation of the mitotic cell cycle, and its expression is associated with certain cancer subtypes, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The gene's involvement in a dense subgraph of genes related to the mitotic cell cycle further underscores its potential significance in oncology, particularly as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and a target for therapeutic interventions (Ye2020Detecting).
