# PRL

## Overview
The PRL gene encodes prolactin, a peptide hormone primarily associated with lactation and reproductive functions. Prolactin is a member of the cytokine family and is characterized by a four-helix bundle structure, similar to other hormones like growth hormone and placental lactogen (GOFFIN1996SequenceFunction). Synthesized as a prehormone, prolactin undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which influence its bioactivity and secretion (SINHA1995Structural). Beyond its classical role in milk production, prolactin is involved in a wide array of physiological processes, including immune regulation and cellular growth, by interacting with prolactin receptors that activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (BoleFeysot1998Prolactin). The gene's expression and the hormone's diverse functions underscore its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and certain cancers (BoleFeysot1998Prolactin).

## Structure
Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone with a primary structure consisting of a single polypeptide chain of approximately 199 amino acids, with a molecular weight of about 23,000 daltons (SINHA1995Structural; Cooke1981Human). The protein is synthesized as a prehormone with 227 amino acids, which includes a 28-amino acid signal peptide that is cleaved to form the mature hormone (SINHA1995Structural; Cooke1981Human). 

The secondary structure of PRL is characterized by a four-helix bundle composed of antiparallel alpha-helices, a common motif shared with growth hormone and placental lactogen (GOFFIN1996SequenceFunction). The tertiary structure is modeled based on growth hormone, suggesting a globular shape stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bridges (SINHA1995Structural). PRL functions as a monomer and lacks a quaternary structure (SINHA1995Structural).

Post-translational modifications of PRL include glycosylation and phosphorylation. Glycosylated PRL (G-PRL) constitutes about 16-24% of total plasma PRL in humans, affecting its bioactivity and plasma clearance (SINHA1995Structural). Phosphorylation alters the charge and conformation of PRL, potentially regulating its secretion (SINHA1995Structural). Splice variants and cleaved forms of PRL have been identified, contributing to its structural diversity and functional regulation (SINHA1995Structural).

## Function
Prolactin (PRL) is a hormone with diverse roles in human physiology, primarily known for its involvement in lactation by promoting milk production in the mammary glands. Beyond its role in lactation, PRL is involved in various molecular processes and cellular functions. It acts as an immunoregulatory hormone, influencing immune responses, macrophage functions, and the production of immunologically active cells in the bone marrow (Montgomery1992Human). PRL is synthesized and secreted by lymphocytes and other extrapituitary tissues, playing a crucial role in T-cell proliferative responses and lymphocyte function (YuLee1997Molecular; Montgomery1992Human).

PRL functions by binding to prolactin receptors (PRL-R), which are part of the hematopoietin/cytokine receptor superfamily. These receptors are present on various cells, including hematopoietic cells, and are involved in the growth and differentiation of lympho-hematopoietic lineage cells (YuLee1997Molecular). The binding of PRL to its receptor activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to receptor dimerization and activation of JAK2 kinases, which phosphorylate downstream targets (BoleFeysot1998Prolactin). This signaling cascade is crucial for PRL's role in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and immune regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRL (prolactin) gene can significantly impact the generation of vasoinhibins, peptides derived from prolactin, by altering the efficiency of PRL-cleaving enzymes. These changes can affect the levels and isoform composition of vasoinhibins, potentially influencing diseases associated with the PRL/vasoinhibin axis. For instance, excessive generation of the 16 kDa vasoinhibin isoform, due to increased activity of the enzyme cathepsin D, may impair myocardial microvascularization and trigger peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), a condition characterized by heart failure towards the end of pregnancy or shortly after delivery (Triebel2017Human). 

In diabetic retinopathy, vasoinhibins play a protective role by inhibiting retinal neovascularization. Mutations in the PRL gene could either increase or decrease vasoinhibin generation, potentially acting as risk or protective factors for these diseases (Triebel2017Human). 

While no specific genetic diseases have been directly linked to mutations in the PRL gene, elevated levels of prolactin are associated with various pathological conditions, including reproductive issues such as amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and impotence. Prolactin is also implicated in autoimmune states like systemic lupus erythematosus and is thought to increase the aggressiveness of certain tumors (BoleFeysot1998Prolactin).
