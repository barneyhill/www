# CSK

## Overview
The CSK gene encodes the C-terminal Src kinase, a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of Src family kinases (SFKs). This kinase is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by phosphorylating a conserved tyrosine residue in the C-terminal tail of SFKs, thereby keeping them in an inactive state and preventing their potential oncogenic activity (Okada2012Regulation; Chong2005C-terminal). Structurally, the CSK protein comprises several domains, including the Src homology 3 (SH3) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which are integral to its regulatory functions (Sun2023Dissection; Dias2022Csk). CSK is involved in various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and immune response modulation, and its dysregulation is associated with diseases like cancer, hypertension, and autoimmune disorders (Zhu2023Regulation; Fortner2022Apoptosis).

## Structure
The C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) is a protein tyrosine kinase composed of 450 amino acids, organized into several distinct domains: the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a catalytic kinase domain (Sun2023Dissection; Dias2022Csk). The SH3 domain is involved in binding to proline-rich motifs, while the SH2 domain binds to phosphotyrosine residues, playing a crucial role in the regulation of Src family kinases (Sun2023Dissection; Tanaka2013Identification). 

The tertiary structure of CSK reveals a unique arrangement of these domains compared to Src family kinases. The SH3 and SH2 domains directly interact with the small lobe of the kinase domain, which is intrinsically inactive and requires activation by the regulatory domains (Sun2023Dissection; Ogawa2002Structure). The SH3 domain interacts with the kinase domain through a cation-π interaction, crucial for activation (Sun2023Dissection). 

CSK can form dimers at higher concentrations, with its crystal structure showing six molecules forming three pairs of dimers per asymmetric unit (Ogawa2002Structure). The protein lacks an N-terminal acylation signal, an autophosphorylation site, and a C-terminal regulatory tyrosine, which are conserved in Src family kinases, indicating a different regulatory mechanism (Ogawa2002Structure).

## Function
The CSK (C-terminal Src kinase) protein is a critical regulator of Src family kinases (SFKs) in healthy human cells. It functions as a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates a conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr-527) in the C-terminal tail of SFKs, maintaining them in an inactive state and preventing their oncogenic potential (Okada2012Regulation; Chong2005C-terminal). CSK primarily resides in the cytosol and translocates to the plasma membrane to exert its regulatory functions, facilitated by interactions with scaffold proteins such as Cbp/PAG1 (Zhu2023Regulation; Chong2005C-terminal).

CSK's role extends to various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and survival. It is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing excessive SFK activation, which can lead to cancer and other diseases (Zhu2023Regulation; Chong2005C-terminal). In T-cells, CSK regulates TCR signaling, impacting T cell growth and apoptosis (Zhu2023Regulation). It also plays a role in the immune response by modulating signaling pathways such as NF-kB and MAPK (Zhu2023Regulation). The absence of CSK leads to increased SFK activity, resulting in developmental defects and potential tumorigenesis (Imamoto1993Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CSK gene have been implicated in various diseases. In hypertension, decreased CSK activity leads to increased Src signaling, which is associated with elevated blood pressure. This is particularly evident in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats, where low CSK activation results in heightened Ang II-mediated vasoconstriction in vascular smooth muscle cells (Lee2016Gene). In cancer, CSK acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting Src family kinases (SFKs). Its downregulation or mislocalization can lead to increased oncogenicity, as seen in gastric cancer where the interaction with ELTD1 inhibits CSK, promoting MAPK/ERK signaling and metastasis (Zhu2023Regulation; Fortner2022Apoptosis). 

In autoimmune diseases, CSK is involved in regulating apoptosis and immune cell activation. Variants that increase CSK expression in B-cells can lead to stronger inhibition of Lyn, another SFK, resulting in enhanced immune cell activation and a higher likelihood of autoreactive B-cells, contributing to conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (Fortner2022Apoptosis). CSK also plays a role in neurologic diseases, where its inhibition of the SFK Fyn is crucial. Dysregulation of this pathway is implicated in Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy (Fortner2022Apoptosis).

## Interactions
C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its regulatory functions. CSK interacts with c-Src, a member of the Src family kinases, through a specific interface involving the C-terminal lobes of their kinase domains. This interaction is primarily electrostatic, involving ion-pairing networks with specific residues such as Arg 279, Arg 281, and Arg 283 of CSK, and Glu 510, Tyr 511, and Asp 518 of c-Src. Mutations in these residues can significantly affect binding and phosphorylation activity (Levinson2008Structural).

CSK also interacts with proteins through its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues. This interaction recruits CSK to sites of action, enhancing its kinase activity. Notable interactions include those with partitioning defective 3 (Par3), DDR1, SYK, and protein kinase C iota. Phosphotyrosine 1127 of Par3 directly binds to the CSK-SH2 domain, and CSK colocalizes with Par3 in tight junctions, suggesting a role in regulating cellular tight junctions (Yang2009Proteomic).

CSK's interaction with Src family kinases is facilitated by a substrate-docking site, which is crucial for recognizing and phosphorylating these kinases. This docking-based mechanism is distinct from other protein tyrosine kinases (Lee2006Docking-based).
