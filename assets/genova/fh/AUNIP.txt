# AUNIP

## Overview
AUNIP, or Aurora kinase A and ninein-interacting protein, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly those related to cell division and DNA repair. The protein encoded by AUNIP is integral to maintaining centrosomal structure and facilitating spindle formation, which are essential for accurate mitosis and meiosis. It interacts with Aurora-A kinase, a pivotal protein in cell cycle regulation, to ensure proper spindle assembly and function. Additionally, AUNIP plays a significant role in DNA repair by directing double-strand breaks towards the homologous recombination repair pathway, thereby maintaining genomic stability. This function is crucial for preventing genomic instability, which can lead to cancer. AUNIP's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in oncogenesis (Ma2020AUNIP; Lou2017AUNIPC1orf135).

## Function
AUNIP, also known as Aurora kinase A and ninein-interacting protein, plays a crucial role in maintaining centrosomal structure and facilitating spindle formation during cell division. It interacts with the C-terminus of Aurora-A, a key protein necessary for the dynamic movement of Aurora-A at centrosomes and the spindle apparatus throughout the cell cycle. This interaction is essential for the assembly of bipolar spindles, which is critical for both mitosis and meiosis (Ma2020AUNIP).

AUNIP is also involved in directing DNA double-strand breaks towards the homologous recombination repair pathway, a vital mechanism for DNA repair. This function is important for maintaining genomic stability by ensuring accurate DNA repair, which is crucial for preventing genomic instability that can lead to cancer (Ma2020AUNIP).

In healthy human cells, AUNIP is active at the centrosomes and within the nucleus, contributing to proper cell cycle progression and mitosis. It is involved in controlling the activation of Plk1 and Aurora-A, which are essential for modulating mitotic entry and spindle assembly, ensuring accurate cell division and genomic integrity (Ma2020AUNIP).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AUNIP gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. AUNIP is overexpressed in several cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), where its high expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival (Ma2020AUNIP). This overexpression is often linked to copy number amplification, suggesting a potential oncogenic role for AUNIP in these cancers (Ma2020AUNIP). 

AUNIP's role in DNA double-strand break repair is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Its deficiency can lead to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, particularly those causing replication-associated breaks, which may contribute to cancer development (Lou2017AUNIPC1orf135). The gene's interaction with CtIP and its involvement in homologous recombination repair pathways highlight its importance in preventing genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer (Lou2017AUNIPC1orf135).

AUNIP expression also correlates with immune cell infiltration in tumors, indicating its potential role in the tumor microenvironment and its impact on cancer progression and immune response (Ma2020AUNIP). These findings suggest that AUNIP could serve as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
AUNIP, also known as C1orf135, is a protein that plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by directing breaks towards the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway. AUNIP physically interacts with CtIP, a protein crucial for DNA end resection, which is a key step in HR. This interaction is essential for the efficient recruitment of CtIP to sites of DNA damage, facilitating the repair process (Lou2017AUNIPC1orf135).

AUNIP also forms a complex with the MRN complex (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1), which is involved in the recruitment of CtIP to DSBs. However, AUNIP's recruitment to DNA damage sites is independent of the MRN complex, indicating separate regulatory mechanisms (Lou2017AUNIPC1orf135).

In addition to protein interactions, AUNIP exhibits structure-specific DNA-binding activity. It preferentially binds to DNA substrates that mimic damaged replication forks, such as splayed arm, 5′-flap, and 3′-flap DNA structures. This DNA-binding activity is crucial for AUNIP's localization to DNA damage sites and its function in DNA end resection (Lou2017AUNIPC1orf135). The DNA-binding region of AUNIP encompasses residues 21-70, which is sufficient to target the protein to sites of DNA damage (Lou2017AUNIPC1orf135).
