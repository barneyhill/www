# POC5

## Overview
POC5 is a gene that encodes the POC5 centriolar protein, which plays a crucial role in the assembly and elongation of centrioles within human cells. The POC5 protein is categorized as a centrin-binding protein, characterized by its interaction with centrin proteins such as hCen2 and hCen3, which is essential for centriole maturation and function (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5). This protein is integral to the later stages of centriole assembly, particularly in the formation of the distal portion of centrioles, and is recruited during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5). Mutations in the POC5 gene, such as the A429V variant, have been implicated in conditions like adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and other ciliopathy syndromes, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions (Hassan2019Adolescent; Hassan2023Differential).

## Structure
The POC5 protein is a centrin-binding protein essential for the assembly of full-length centrioles in human cells. Its primary structure consists of 575 amino acids, encoded by a full-length cDNA. The protein sequence includes three putative Sfi1p-like centrin-binding repeats (CBRs) and two short coiled-coil domains, which are crucial for its function in centriole assembly (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5). These CBRs facilitate specific interactions with human centrin proteins, particularly hCen2 and hCen3, in a calcium-independent manner (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5).

The secondary structure of POC5 likely includes coiled-coil regions, which are common structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. The tertiary structure is characterized by tandem repeats of centrin-binding sequences and coiled-coil regions, although specific details on the overall 3D shape are not provided in the context (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5).

POC5 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may play a role in its recruitment to centrioles during mitosis (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5). The protein is evolutionarily conserved across various eukaryotic species, indicating its ancient origin and essential role in centriole assembly (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5).

## Function
POC5 is a centrin-binding protein essential for the assembly and elongation of full-length centrioles in human cells. It plays a critical role in the later stages of centriole maturation, particularly in the assembly of the distal portion of centrioles. POC5 is recruited to centrioles during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and is associated with centrin proteins, specifically hCen2 and hCen3, in a microtubule-independent manner (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5).

The protein is predominantly localized at the distal end of centrioles and is crucial for the proper elongation of procentrioles, a process necessary for cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. In the absence of POC5, cells experience cell cycle arrest and defects in centriole duplication, leading to extended S phase and cell death in certain cell lines (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5).

POC5 is also involved in the organization of microtubule singlets and doublets around the cartwheel structure during early S phase, and its phosphorylation is associated with its recruitment to centrioles (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5). This protein is essential for maintaining normal cell cycle dynamics and centrosome function, highlighting its importance in healthy human cells (Hassan2023Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POC5 gene, particularly the A429V variant, have been associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), a condition characterized by a curvature of the spine. This mutation affects the localization and interaction of POC5 with other proteins, leading to impaired cilia length and centrosome protein interactions, which are crucial for cell cycle regulation and mechanotransduction (Hassan2019Adolescent). The A429V mutation results in reduced mineralization and proliferation rates in osteoblasts, contributing to progressive scoliosis and osteopenia (Hassan2023Differential). 

POC5 is also regulated by estrogen, and its upregulation through the estrogen receptor ERα is significant in AIS, which predominantly progresses in girls during puberty. Mutant POC5 A429V AIS osteoblasts exhibit a reduced response to estrogen, suggesting a mechanism for estrogen resistance that could contribute to scoliosis progression (Hassan2023Differential). 

In addition to AIS, POC5 mutations have been linked to other ciliopathy syndromes, such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Meckel-Gruber syndrome, due to their impact on ciliary function (Hassan2019Adolescent). These findings highlight the clinical significance of POC5 in various conditions related to ciliary dysfunction.

## Interactions
POC5 is a centriolar protein that interacts with several other proteins crucial for centriole assembly and function. It binds to centrin proteins, specifically hCen2 and hCen3, through its centrin-binding repeats, which is essential for the assembly of full-length centrioles (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5). This interaction is calcium-independent and does not involve calmodulin, highlighting its specificity (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5). POC5 is also associated with centrosomes and is recruited to centrioles during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, playing a critical role in centriole maturation (Azimzadeh2009hPOC5).

In the context of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, the POC5 A429V mutation alters its interaction landscape. Wild-type POC5 interacts with a variety of ciliary and cytoskeletal proteins, including centrin, but the A429V mutant shows significantly reduced interactions, affecting proteins such as RAB11 and CEP290, which are important for cilia formation and function (Hassan2019Adolescent). This mutation leads to mislocalization of POC5 and impaired ciliary function, contributing to the pathogenesis of scoliosis (Hassan2019Adolescent). These interactions underscore the importance of POC5 in maintaining normal cellular processes related to cilia and centrosomes.
