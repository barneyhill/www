# CAPZA2

## Overview
The CAPZA2 gene encodes the alpha 2 subunit of the capping actin protein of muscle Z-line, a critical component of the F-actin capping protein complex, CapZ. This protein complex is essential for regulating actin filament dynamics by capping the barbed ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing further polymerization and depolymerization. The CAPZA2 protein, categorized as a cytoskeletal protein, plays a pivotal role in maintaining cell shape, motility, and division, particularly in muscle cells where it contributes to muscle structure and function. The gene is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, underscoring its importance in these areas. Mutations in CAPZA2 have been associated with various clinical conditions, including intellectual disability and developmental delays, highlighting its significance in normal cellular and developmental processes (Yao2022CAPZA2; Hart1997Vertebrates; Huang2020Variants).

## Structure
The CAPZA2 protein is a component of the F-actin capping protein complex, known as CapZ, which is a heterodimer consisting of α and β subunits. The α subunit, encoded by the CAPZA2 gene, is involved in actin polymerization processes. Both the α and β subunits of CapZ have similar secondary and tertiary structures, characterized by the presence of an actin-binding domain at the carboxyl terminal end, known as the tentacle domain. This domain is approximately 30 amino acids long and plays a crucial role in actin affinity, with conserved basic amino acids that interact with acidic residues on F-actin ends (Huang2020Variants).

The CAPZA2 protein's quaternary structure involves forming a heterodimer with the β subunit, which is encoded by the CAPZB gene. This interaction is essential for the protein's function in capping the barbed ends of actin filaments, thereby regulating actin filament dynamics (Huang2020Variants). The protein's structure is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes, sharing significant sequence similarity with its homologs in other species, such as the fly homolog cpa (Huang2020Variants). Specific mutations in the CAPZA2 gene, such as p.Arg259Leu and p.Lys256Glu, affect the actin capping efficiency but do not disrupt heterodimer formation (Huang2020Variants).

## Function
The CAPZA2 gene encodes a subunit of the F-actin capping protein complex, CapZ, which is essential for regulating actin filament dynamics in human cells. This complex is a heterodimer composed of α and β subunits, with CAPZA2 encoding the α2 subunit. CapZ functions by capping the barbed ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing further polymerization and depolymerization, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division (Hart1997Vertebrates; Huang2020Variants).

In healthy human cells, CAPZA2 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in muscle cells, where it contributes to muscle structure and function. It plays a significant role in actin filament stabilization, allowing precise control over actin filament distribution (Huang2020Variants). The α2 isoform of the capping protein is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, indicating its importance in these areas (Hart1997Vertebrates).

CAPZA2 is also involved in maintaining normal actin dynamics and cellular morphology. Knockdown studies have shown that loss of CAPZA2 function can lead to increased filopodia formation and reduced spine density, highlighting its role in cellular structure and function (Huang2020Variants).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CAPZA2 gene have been linked to intellectual disability and developmental delay. Two specific de novo variants, p.Arg259Leu and p.Lys256Glu, have been identified in patients exhibiting symptoms such as hypotonia, motor development delays, speech delay, seizures, and autism. These variants are located near the actin binding domain and are predicted to be deleterious, affecting the protein's function in actin filament dynamics (Huang2020Variants). 

The CAPZA2 gene is intolerant to loss-of-function mutations, and its variants have been shown to cause a mild loss of function, contributing to the observed clinical symptoms. In Drosophila models, these variants result in a reduced ability to rescue lethality and cause defects in bristle morphogenesis, indicating a dominant negative effect (Huang2020Variants).

Additionally, CAPZA2 has been implicated in ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic inflammatory disease. Alterations in CAPZA2 expression levels have been observed in patients, suggesting its involvement in immune-related processes and the pathogenesis of the disease (Yao2022CAPZA2).

## Interactions
CAPZA2 is a component of the F-actin capping protein complex, which is a heterodimer composed of α and β subunits. CAPZA2 specifically forms a functional heterodimer with the β subunit, CAPZB, to cap actin filaments, thereby regulating actin filament dynamics by preventing further polymerization (Wear2004Capping; Huang2020Variants). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the organization of the actin cytoskeleton.

In Drosophila, CAPZA2 interacts with the β subunit Cpb, forming a heterodimer that caps actin filaments. Variants in CAPZA2, such as p.Arg259Leu and p.Lys256Glu, have been shown to reduce the actin capping rate, although they do not affect the binding with the β subunit to form the heterodimer (Huang2020Variants).

CAPZA2 also interacts with other proteins involved in actin regulation, such as VASP and the ARP2/3 complex, which influence cell motility and signaling pathways. These interactions highlight the role of CAPZA2 in cytoskeletal organization and its impact on cellular processes (Chapelle2019Dissecting). The phosphorylation of CAPZA2 by PIM1 kinase affects its ability to cap actin filaments, promoting changes in actin filament organization crucial for cell adhesion and migration (Santio2020PIM1).
