# PUS10

## Overview
PUS10 is a gene that encodes the protein pseudouridine synthase 10, which is a member of the pseudouridine synthase family. This protein is primarily involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA, specifically catalyzing the isomerization of uridine to pseudouridine in tRNA molecules. Pseudouridine synthase 10 is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including a THUMP domain and a pseudouridine synthase domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, with the cytoplasmic form being active in pseudouridylation and the nuclear form playing roles in apoptosis and microRNA processing (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian; Deogharia2018The). PUS10's activity is essential for tRNA stability and function, and it has been implicated in various cellular processes, including viral replication and cancer progression (Luo2023HIF1A-repressed; Deogharia2018The).

## Structure
The human PUS10 protein is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes specific domains and potential post-translational modifications. It contains an amino-terminal THUMP-containing domain and a carboxy-terminal pseudouridine synthase domain, which houses the conserved active site residues necessary for its enzymatic function (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian). The catalytic domain of human PUS10 is structurally similar to that of archaeal Pus10, with nearly superimposable catalytic domains, indicating a conserved mechanism of action across species (Deogharia2018The).

PUS10 exists in two isoforms within human cells: a nuclear isoform that is catalytically inactive and a cytoplasmic isoform that is active in pseudouridylation. These isoforms are products of the same gene but differ likely due to structural or post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may account for differences in their molecular weights compared to predicted sizes (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian; Deogharia2018The). The nuclear isoform is involved in apoptosis and miRNA processing, while the cytoplasmic isoform is responsible for producing pseudouridine at positions 54 and 55 in tRNAs (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian). Human PUS10 is suggested to have six splice variants, with only four being protein-coding, and the shorter versions lack the catalytic domain (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian).

## Function
The PUS10 gene encodes a protein that functions as a pseudouridine synthase, primarily involved in the modification of tRNA molecules in human cells. PUS10 is responsible for the production of pseudouridine (Ψ) at positions 54 and 55 in select tRNAs, a modification crucial for the stability and function of these molecules. This activity is predominantly cytoplasmic, where PUS10 catalyzes the formation of Ψ54 and Ψ55, particularly in tRNAs used as primers in retroviral DNA synthesis, such as in HIV (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian; Deogharia2018The).

In the cytoplasm, PUS10's role in pseudouridylation is essential for proper tRNA maturation and function, contributing to efficient protein synthesis. The presence of Ψ54 in tRNAs is linked to retroviral DNA synthesis, highlighting PUS10's importance in cellular processes involving viral replication (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian; Deogharia2018The).

In the nucleus, PUS10 is catalytically inactive for pseudouridylation but plays roles in apoptosis and miRNA processing, indicating its involvement in broader regulatory networks within the cell (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian; Song2019Differential). This dual functionality underscores PUS10's significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and gene expression regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PUS10 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), PUS10 is downregulated, and its low expression is associated with poorer clinical prognosis. Studies have shown that reduced PUS10 levels correlate with increased cancer cell migration and metastasis, suggesting a tumor suppressor role for PUS10 in RCC. This effect is independent of its enzymatic activity and is linked to its role in promoting the maturation of microRNA miR-194-5p, which regulates cytoskeleton dynamics through the NUDC/Cofilin1 pathway (Luo2023HIF1A-repressed).

In the context of apoptosis, PUS10 is involved in TRAIL-induced apoptosis, a pathway significant for cancer treatment. PUS10 translocates from the nucleus to the mitochondria, facilitating the release of cytochrome c and SMAC, which enhances caspase-3 activity. This process is crucial for the apoptotic pathway, and any interference with PUS10's movement or interactions can reduce tumor cell sensitivity to TRAIL, impacting cancer therapy strategies (Jana2017Reciprocal).

While PUS10's role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was investigated, its expression did not show significant clinical relevance in this context, as it was not differentially expressed in HCC tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues (Jin2022Integrative).

## Interactions
PUS10, a pseudouridine synthase, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing RNA processing and modification. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), PUS10 interacts with the microprocessor complex to regulate microRNA maturation, particularly promoting the maturation of miR-194-5p. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting RCC migration by affecting the cytoskeleton through the NUDC/Cofilin1 pathway (Luo2023HIF1A-repressed).

In the context of apoptosis, PUS10 translocates from the nucleus to the mitochondria during TRAIL-induced apoptosis, a process mediated by caspase-3. This translocation is associated with the release of cytochrome c and SMAC, which enhances caspase-3 activity, forming a feedback loop that amplifies apoptotic signals (Jana2017Reciprocal).

PUS10 also interacts with tRNAs, particularly in the nucleus, where it binds to specific tRNAs to inhibit TRUB1-mediated pseudouridylation at position 55. This interaction is specific to tRNAs containing the sequence 57-AAAU-60, highlighting PUS10's role in regulating tRNA modification (Mukhopadhyay2020Mammalian).
