# KCTD5

## Overview
KCTD5 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 5, which is a member of the KCTD family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its unique pentameric structure, which is facilitated by its N-terminal BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Barone2015KCTD5; Nguyen2023Structure). KCTD5 functions primarily as a substrate-specific adaptor for CUL3-based ubiquitin ligases, playing a significant role in protein degradation pathways (Bayón2008KCTD5). It is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal regulation, cytokinesis, and cell migration, and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm (Canales2020K+; Skoblov2013Protein). KCTD5 has been implicated in several cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels are associated with clinical outcomes and potential as a therapeutic target (Shi2022Comprehensive; Li2024CD8+).

## Structure
The KCTD5 protein is characterized by a pentameric assembly, a unique feature among its family, which typically forms tetramers. This structure is facilitated by its N-terminal BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain and a C-terminal domain (CTD), connected by a flexible linker. The BTB domain, spanning residues 45-150, is crucial for oligomerization and partner recognition, forming a pentameric ring that interacts with CUL3 NTD in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Barone2015KCTD5; Nguyen2023Structure). The CTD, comprising residues 156-209, also forms a pentameric structure and is involved in binding to substrates like Gβγ (Nguyen2023Structure).

The protein's secondary structure includes α-helices and β-sheets, with the BTB domain containing five α-helices and a three-stranded β-sheet, while the CTD consists of a three-stranded β-sheet and one α-helix (Barone2015KCTD5). The tertiary structure reveals a gown-like configuration with a central cavity, and the quaternary structure is stabilized by specific intermolecular interactions, including polar and hydrophobic contacts (Dementieva2009Pentameric).

KCTD5's dynamic nature allows for significant interdomain motions, with rotations up to 40°, which are essential for its function in ubiquitylation processes (Barone2015KCTD5; Nguyen2023Structure).

## Function
KCTD5 is a protein involved in several molecular processes within healthy human cells. It functions as a substrate-specific adaptor for CUL3-based ubiquitin ligases, playing a crucial role in protein degradation pathways by recruiting proteins to be ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome (Bayón2008KCTD5). The BTB domain of KCTD5 is essential for its interaction with CUL3, facilitating the formation of a cullin-based E3 ligase complex (Bayón2008KCTD5).

KCTD5 is also implicated in the regulation of the cytoskeleton and cytokinesis. It interacts with NIMA-related kinase NEK6, which is vital for mitotic spindle formation, and with CKAP5/ch-TOG, a component of the TACC3/clathrin complex that stabilizes kinetochore fibers (Skoblov2013Protein). These interactions suggest a role in cytoskeletal regulation and cell division.

In addition, KCTD5 modulates cell migration and focal adhesion dynamics through calcium signaling and Rac1 activity. Its depletion leads to increased cell migration and spreading, indicating its role as a negative regulator of these processes (Canales2020K+). KCTD5 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Bayón2008KCTD5).

## Clinical Significance
KCTD5 has been implicated in various cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In TNBC, high KCTD5 expression is associated with poorer clinical outcomes, such as shorter overall survival, disease-free survival, and relapse-free survival. It is considered an independent prognostic factor alongside lysyl oxidase (LOX) and is linked to drug sensitivity and immune checkpoint gene expression. Knockdown of KCTD5 in TNBC cells reduces cell viability, migration, and invasion, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2024CD8+).

In LUAD, KCTD5 expression is significantly increased compared to normal tissues and is associated with advanced tumor stages, lymph node metastasis, and TP53 mutations. High KCTD5 expression correlates with poor prognosis and is linked to immune cell infiltration and hypoxia-related pathways. It is suggested as a potential molecular target for LUAD treatment and a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis prediction (Shi2022Comprehensive).

KCTD5 also plays a role in cell migration, as its depletion increases migration and spreading in melanoma and breast cancer cells. This effect is mediated through modulation of calcium signaling and Rac1 activity, indicating its involvement in cancer metastasis (Canales2020K+).

## Interactions
KCTD5 is known to participate in various protein-protein interactions, forming hetero-oligomeric complexes with members of the KCTD protein family. These interactions are facilitated by the BTB domain and the C-terminus of KCTD5. The BTB domain is crucial for interactions with KCTD2, KCTD5 itself, and KCTD17, while the C-terminus is important for interactions with KCTD8, KCTD12, and KCTD16 (Liao2023KCTD5). KCTD5 also interacts with other KCTD family members, including KCTD14, KCTD10, KCTD13, KCNRG, KCTD15, KCTD6, KCTD21, KCTD3, SHKBP1, KCTD18, KCTD20, and BTBD10, with varying interaction strengths (Liao2023KCTD5).

KCTD5 acts as a substrate-specific adaptor for Cullin3-based ubiquitin E3 ligases, interacting with Cullin3 to mediate the ubiquitination of target proteins. This interaction is essential for the mono-ubiquitination of ΔNp63α, a process that modulates its activity (He2018Cullin3KCTD5). KCTD5 also interacts with proteins such as MCM7, ZNF711, and FAM193B, with these interactions being influenced by the subcellular localization of KCTD5 (Rutz2015Interactions). The BTB domain of KCTD5 is critical for its interaction with Cullin3, forming part of a complex that includes Gβγ subunits, which are targeted for ubiquitylation (Nguyen2023Structure).
