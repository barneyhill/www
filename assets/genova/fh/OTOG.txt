# OTOG

## Overview
The OTOG gene encodes the protein otogelin, a large secreted glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the auditory system, particularly within the cochlea of the inner ear. Otogelin is categorized as a non-collagenous component of the tectorial membrane, an acellular structure crucial for hearing. It is involved in forming essential connections between the stereocilia of outer hair cells and the tectorial membrane, facilitating the mechanoelectrical transduction process that converts sound vibrations into electrical signals. The protein's structure includes several domains, such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) domains and a C-terminal cysteine-knot (CTCK) domain, which are vital for its function and interactions with other proteins like otogelin-like and stereocilin. Mutations in the OTOG gene can lead to congenital hearing impairments and are associated with conditions such as autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss and familial Meniere's disease, underscoring the gene's importance in auditory and vestibular health (RomanNaranjo2020Burden; Avan2019Otogelin).

## Structure
Otogelin is a large secreted protein composed of 2,911 amino acids in mice, with a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains a signal peptide, four von Willebrand factor (vWF) domains, four cysteine-rich (C8) domains, an alpha-L arabinofuranosidase B (AbfB) domain, and a C-terminal cysteine-knot (CTCK) domain (Avan2019Otogelin). The CTCK domain is particularly important for the antiparallel homodimerization of otogelin, a process that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is common to secreted mucins and other proteins like von Willebrand factor (Avan2019Otogelin). This dimerization is crucial for the protein's function in forming connections between outer hair cell stereocilia and the tectorial membrane in the ear (Avan2019Otogelin).

Otogelin is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, which may influence its stability and interactions (Avan2019Otogelin). The protein can form homodimers but does not assemble into larger oligomers (Avan2019Otogelin). These structural features are essential for its role in the auditory system, particularly in maintaining the integrity and function of the cochlear hair cells (Avan2019Otogelin).

## Function
The OTOG gene encodes the protein otogelin, which plays a crucial role in the auditory system, particularly in the cochlea's outer hair cells (OHCs). Otogelin is a non-collagenous component of the tectorial membrane, an acellular structure that overlays the sensory epithelium of the inner ear. This protein is involved in forming connections between the stereocilia of OHCs and the tectorial membrane, which are essential for proper hearing function (Avan2019Otogelin; Yu2019A).

Otogelin, along with otogelin-like proteins and stereocilin, forms structures such as horizontal top connectors and tectorial membrane-attachment crowns. These structures are vital for the cohesiveness and mechanical integrity of the hair bundles, facilitating the cooperative motion of stereocilia in response to sound waves (Avan2019Otogelin). The protein's role in anchoring the tallest stereocilia to the tectorial membrane is critical for mechanoelectrical transduction, a process that converts sound vibrations into electrical signals in the auditory pathway (Avan2019Otogelin).

Mutations in the OTOG gene can disrupt these processes, leading to congenital hearing impairments, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining normal auditory function (Avan2019Otogelin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OTOG gene, which encodes the otogelin protein, are associated with various forms of hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. The gene is linked to autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (AR-NSHL), specifically DFNB18B, which typically presents as mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss, often prelingual in onset (Yu2019A). A specific missense variant, R795C, has been identified in Iranian families with severe-to-profound hearing loss, suggesting that certain mutations in OTOG can lead to more severe auditory impairments (Askari2021Prediction).

In familial Meniere's disease (FMD), an enrichment of rare missense variants in the OTOG gene has been observed, with these variants present in 33% of familial cases. This suggests a significant role for OTOG in the genetic architecture of FMD, which is characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, episodic vertigo, and tinnitus (RomanNaranjo2020Burden). Mouse models with mutations in the OTOG gene, such as the Otog vbd/vbd mutation, exhibit moderate hearing impairment and vestibular dysfunction, further supporting the gene's involvement in auditory and balance disorders (El2015A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of OTOG mutations in hearing and balance-related conditions.

## Interactions
Otogelin (OTOG) is involved in several critical interactions within the cochlea, particularly with otogelin-like and stereocilin proteins. These interactions are essential for the formation of horizontal top connectors and tectorial membrane (TM)-attachment crowns in outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia. Otogelin and otogelin-like proteins are secreted and have a modular structure that includes a C-terminal cysteine-knot (CTCK) domain, which facilitates homodimerization. This domain is similar to that found in the von Willebrand factor, suggesting that otogelin forms a force-resistant structure through antiparallel homodimerization (Avan2019Otogelin).

Otogelin interacts with stereocilin, a protein associated with the plasma membrane, either directly or indirectly, to form the TM-attachment crowns. These interactions are crucial for the proper localization and function of the stereocilia structures, contributing to the mechanical function of the cochlea (Avan2019Otogelin). In zebrafish, otogelin is also involved in otolith tethering, interacting with α-tectorin to facilitate the initial seeding of otolith precursor particles to kinocilia, a process essential for otolith formation and maintenance (StookeVaughan2015Otolith). These interactions highlight otogelin's role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the auditory and vestibular systems.
