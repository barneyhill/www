# CD160

## Overview
CD160 is a gene that encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored transmembrane glycoprotein, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The CD160 protein is primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, certain T-cell subsets, and intraepithelial lymphocytes, where it plays a crucial role in immune regulation. It is involved in the modulation of immune responses through interactions with various ligands, including the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. These interactions are essential for the regulation of cytokine production and cytolytic activity, particularly in the context of chronic viral infections and autoimmune diseases (Tu2015CD160; Nikolova2002BY55CD160). The CD160 protein's structure, characterized by a beta-sandwich immunoglobulin fold, contributes to its stability and function (Piotrowska2021CD160). Given its involvement in various pathological conditions, CD160 is considered a potential therapeutic target for enhancing immune responses and treating diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and cancer (Oumeslakht2022CD160; Piotrowska2021CD160).

## Structure
The CD160 protein is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored transmembrane glycoprotein and a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It consists of 181 amino acids, with a theoretical mass of 19.81 kDa, though post-translational modifications increase its actual molecular weight. These modifications include N-glycosylation at asparagine residues 28 and 137, and amidation by GPI at serine 159 (Piotrowska2021CD160). The primary structure includes specific cysteine residues, with some forming intramolecular disulfide bridges, contributing to the protein's stability (Piotrowska2021CD160).

The secondary structure of CD160 features a beta-sandwich typical of an immunoglobulin fold, with nine beta-strands forming two antiparallel beta sheets. The back beta-sheet consists of strands A, B, and E, while the front beta-sheet includes strands G, G', F, C, and C'. A unique strand H is anti-parallel to the G strand, enhancing stability (Piotrowska2021CD160).

CD160 primarily exists as a monomer in solution, with no evidence of forming intermolecular disulfide bonds or trimeric structures, contrary to previous claims (Kojima2011Molecular; Piotrowska2021CD160). The protein has four isoforms generated by alternative splicing, differing in the presence of a GPI anchor, an Ig domain, and transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Oumeslakht2022CD160).

## Function
CD160 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein that plays a significant role in immune regulation. It is primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, certain T-cell subsets, and intraepithelial lymphocytes. In NK cells, CD160 is crucial for the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key cytokine in the immune response, particularly after activation through stimuli such as poly(I:C) priming or NK1.1 cross-linking. This process involves the interaction of CD160 with the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) on dendritic cells or macrophages, which is essential for efficient IFN-γ production (Tu2015CD160; Šedý2013CD160).

In T-cells, CD160 acts as a co-receptor in TCR signal transduction, particularly in cytotoxic effector T lymphocytes lacking CD28 expression. It enhances CD3-induced proliferation of TCRgd+ T cell clones by interacting with MHC class I molecules, forming a functional signaling complex with protein tyrosine kinase p56 lck and tyrosine-phosphorylated z chains (Nikolova2002BY55CD160). CD160 also modulates T-cell responses by enhancing IL-2 production in CD4+ T-cells when engaged by HVEM-Fc, indicating its role in positive regulation of T-cell activation (ElFar2014CD160).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CD160 gene are implicated in various diseases. In chronic viral infections such as HIV, HCV, EBV, and CMV, increased CD160 expression on CD8+ T cells is associated with T cell exhaustion, which inhibits the immune response. Blocking the CD160-HVEM interaction can enhance T cell function and cytokine production (Piotrowska2021CD160). In autoimmune diseases, abnormal CD160 expression is linked to conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting its role as a signaling gene in these diseases (Piotrowska2021CD160).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CD160 is aberrantly expressed at all disease stages, promoting prosurvival and anti-apoptotic signals through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which enhances cytokine production and cell survival (Oumeslakht2022CD160). CD160 expression in CLL is associated with impaired effector functions in CD8+ T cells, contributing to an exhausted T cell phenotype (Bozorgmehr2021Expanded). CD160 is also implicated in cancer, where its expression on endothelial cells of new blood vessels in colon cancer and melanoma suggests a role in tumor angiogenesis (Piotrowska2021CD160). These findings highlight CD160's potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
CD160 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that interacts with several key molecules in the immune system. It binds to the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which is expressed on various immune cells. This interaction inhibits CD4+ T cell activation and is characterized by a 1:1 stoichiometry (Kojima2011Molecular; Liu2019Structural). CD160 and another coinhibitory molecule, BTLA, compete for binding to the cysteine-rich domain 1 (CRD1) of HVEM, with overlapping binding sites (Kojima2011Molecular; Piotrowska2021CD160).

CD160 also interacts with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, such as HLA-C, HLA-A2, HLA-B7, HLA-E, and CD1d, enhancing NK and T cell activity (Liu2019Structural; Lenhartová2021Molecular). In NK cells, the CD160-HVEM interaction promotes cytokine production and cytolytic activity, serving as a countermeasure to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Lenhartová2021Molecular). The interaction of CD160 with HVEM is crucial in chronic viral infections and autoimmune diseases, where it can lead to T cell exhaustion and impaired immune response (Piotrowska2021CD160). Blocking the CD160-HVEM complex can enhance cytokine production and T cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Piotrowska2021CD160).
