# MYH8

## Overview
The MYH8 gene encodes the myosin heavy chain 8 protein, a crucial component of the myosin family involved in muscle contraction and development. This protein is categorized as a motor protein, playing a significant role in the formation and maturation of skeletal muscle tissue, particularly during the embryonic and fetal stages. Myosin heavy chain 8 is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of myofibrils, where it contributes to the structural integrity and contractile function of muscle fibers. The protein's ability to bind actin and hydrolyze ATP is essential for muscle contraction, highlighting its importance in muscle physiology (SternStraeter2011Characterization; Veugelers2004Mutation). Mutations in the MYH8 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Toydemir2006Trismus‐pseudocamptodactyly).

## Structure


## Function
The MYH8 gene encodes the perinatal myosin heavy chain, which is primarily expressed in embryonic and fetal skeletal muscles. This protein plays a crucial role in muscle development and differentiation. During myogenesis, MYH8 is involved in the formation of myotubes, which are essential for muscle maturation. Its expression increases significantly in satellite cells treated with differentiation medium, indicating its role in the maturation process of muscle cells (SternStraeter2011Characterization).

MYH8 is localized in the cytoplasm, specifically within the thick filaments of myofibrils in elongated, multinucleated myotubes. This localization is crucial for its function in muscle contraction and development (SternStraeter2011Characterization). The protein's structure includes a region that binds to actin, which is essential for muscle contraction. The R674 residue, conserved across multiple myosin isoforms, is part of the ATP-binding pocket, highlighting its role in ATP hydrolysis and energy conversion during muscle contraction (Veugelers2004Mutation).

Overall, MYH8 is a key player in the differentiation and maturation of muscle cells, contributing to the development of functional skeletal muscle tissue.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYH8 gene are primarily associated with Trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome (TPS), also known as distal arthrogryposis type 7 (DA7). This condition is characterized by trismus, which is restricted mouth opening, and pseudocamptodactyly, which involves finger contractures that become apparent upon wrist extension. The syndrome is caused by a recurrent missense mutation, specifically the substitution of glutamine for arginine at position 674 (p.R674Q) in the MYH8 gene. This mutation has been identified in multiple families across North America and Europe, indicating independent occurrences in these populations (Toydemir2006Trismus‐pseudocamptodactyly).

The MYH8 gene is expressed in skeletal muscles, particularly during the perinatal period, which aligns with the prenatal onset of contractures in TPS. These contractures are non-progressive and primarily affect the limbs and face (Toydemir2006Trismus‐pseudocamptodactyly). Although there was an initial hypothesis linking MYH8 mutations to Carney complex, a multiple neoplasia syndrome, studies have shown that these conditions have independent etiologies (Toydemir2006Trismus‐pseudocamptodactyly).

Additionally, novel MYH8 mutations have been identified in individuals with ovarian endometriosis, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition. These mutations were not found in control samples, indicating a possible link to the disease (Lou2020Novel).
