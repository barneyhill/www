# TWF2

## Overview
TWF2 is a gene that encodes the protein twinfilin actin binding protein 2, which plays a significant role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics. Twinfilin-2 is categorized as an actin-binding protein and is involved in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, crucial for various cellular processes such as motility, shape, and division. The protein is characterized by two actin-depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domains, which facilitate its interaction with actin monomers and capping of filament barbed ends, thereby regulating actin polymerization and depolymerization (Hakala2021Twinfilin; Nevalainen2008Two). Twinfilin-2 exists in two isoforms, twinfilin-2a and twinfilin-2b, which exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns and distinct biochemical properties, reflecting their specialized roles in different cellular contexts (Nevalainen2008Two). The gene's involvement in actin dynamics has also been linked to various pathological conditions, including cancer, where alterations in its expression and mutations have been associated with tumor progression and prognosis (Liu2022Oncogenic).

## Structure
The TWF2 gene encodes twinfilin-2, a protein involved in actin dynamics. Twinfilin-2 is composed of two actin-depolymerizing factor homology (ADF-H) domains, which are crucial for its function in binding actin monomers and regulating actin filament dynamics (Hakala2021Twinfilin; Nevalainen2008Two). These domains are separated by a short linker and followed by a C-terminal tail, which contains a capping protein-interacting (CPI) motif (Johnston2018A; Falck2004Biological). The C-terminal ADF-H domain is responsible for high-affinity binding to actin monomers, while both ADF-H domains are necessary for capping filament barbed ends (Nevalainen2008Two).

Twinfilin-2 exists in two isoforms, twinfilin-2a and twinfilin-2b, generated through alternative promoter usage. These isoforms differ at their N-terminal region, with twinfilin-2a being expressed in non-muscle tissues and twinfilin-2b in heart and skeletal muscle (Nevalainen2008Two). The N-terminal ADF-H domain of twinfilin-2b has a higher affinity for ADP-G-actin compared to ATP-G-actin, whereas twinfilin-2a binds both with equal affinities, indicating distinct biochemical properties and tissue-specific roles (Nevalainen2008Two).

## Function
TWF2, or twinfilin actin binding protein 2, plays a crucial role in actin filament dynamics by regulating the actin cytoskeleton. It is involved in binding actin monomers and capping filament barbed ends, which prevents both polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments. This regulation is essential for maintaining cellular processes such as motility, shape, and division, impacting cell migration and tissue development (Nevalainen2008Two).

Twinfilin-2, encoded by the TWF2 gene, exists in two isoforms, twinfilin-2a and twinfilin-2b, which are generated through alternative promoter usage. These isoforms have distinct tissue-specific expression patterns, with twinfilin-2a being expressed in non-muscle tissues and twinfilin-2b predominantly in heart and skeletal muscle. Both isoforms bind actin monomers and capping protein, and they cap actin filament barbed ends, inhibiting filament growth. Twinfilin-2b, in particular, has a higher affinity for ADP-G-actin compared to ATP-G-actin, which suggests a specialized role in muscle tissues (Nevalainen2008Two).

In healthy human cells, TWF2 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in areas with dynamic actin remodeling, such as lamellipodia and endocytic structures, where it contributes to the rapid turnover of actin networks (Hakala2021Twinfilin).

## Clinical Significance
The TWF2 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in actin filament dynamics. Alterations in TWF2 expression and mutations have been associated with cancer progression and prognosis. In a pan-cancer analysis, TWF2 was found to be overexpressed in several cancer types, including uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), with significant differences compared to adjacent normal tissues (Liu2022Oncogenic). High transcription levels of TWF2 were linked to poorer overall survival in acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), low-grade glioma (LGG), and LIHC, while paradoxically associated with improved survival in lung and ovarian cancers (Liu2022Oncogenic).

Genetic alterations in TWF2, such as 'deep deletion' in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC) and 'amplification' in UCEC, have been observed, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (Liu2022Oncogenic). The study also highlighted the P342 missense mutation in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) (Liu2022Oncogenic). TWF2's involvement in immune cell infiltration, particularly with neutrophils in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and T-cell regulation in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), suggests its influence on the tumor microenvironment (Liu2022Oncogenic).

## Interactions
Twinfilin actin binding protein 2 (TWF2) is involved in actin dynamics through its interactions with various proteins. TWF2 binds actin monomers and capping protein (CP) with high affinity, playing a crucial role in capping actin filament barbed ends, which inhibits filament growth (Nevalainen2008Two). The N-terminal ADF-H domain of TWF2, particularly in the twinfilin-2b isoform, binds ADP-G-actin with higher affinity than ATP-G-actin, suggesting a specific role in actin monomer sequestration (Nevalainen2008Two).

TWF2 also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which inhibits its actin monomer-sequestering activity, indicating a regulatory mechanism for its function in actin dynamics (Palmgren2001Interactions). This interaction with PI(4,5)P2 is significant as it affects the efficiency of TWF2 in sequestering actin monomers, thereby influencing actin filament turnover (Palmgren2001Interactions).

In yeast, TWF2's interaction with capping proteins is essential for its localization to cortical actin patches, highlighting its role in actin cytoskeleton organization (Palmgren2001Interactions). These interactions underscore TWF2's multifaceted role in regulating actin dynamics and its involvement in cellular processes such as cell motility and synaptic endocytosis.
