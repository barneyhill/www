# PMPCB

## Overview
The PMPCB gene encodes the mitochondrial processing peptidase beta subunit, a critical component of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) complex. This complex is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of mitochondrial targeting sequences from precursor proteins, facilitating their maturation and functional integration within the mitochondria. The PMPCB protein, in conjunction with the non-catalytic subunit PMPCA, forms a heterodimer that is essential for mitochondrial homeostasis and the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters, which are vital for various enzymatic activities, including those in the respiratory chain complexes (Vögtle2018Mutations; PovedaHuertes2016The). Beyond its traditional role in mitochondrial protein processing, PMPCB has been implicated in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its broader significance in cellular proliferation and metabolic regulation (Takai2019GenomeWide).

## Structure


## Function
The PMPCB gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial presequence protease (MPP), which is essential for processing precursor proteins imported into mitochondria. In healthy human cells, PMPCB, in conjunction with the non-catalytic subunit PMPCA, forms the active MPP heterodimer. This enzyme is responsible for cleaving mitochondrial targeting sequences from precursor proteins, allowing them to mature and function properly within the mitochondria (Vögtle2018Mutations; PovedaHuertes2016The).

The MPP is crucial for the maturation of approximately 70% of mitochondrial precursor proteins, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and function (Vögtle2018Mutations). This processing is particularly important for the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are necessary for the activity of several enzymes, including those involved in the respiratory chain complexes and other metabolic processes (Vögtle2018Mutations).

PMPCB's role in mitochondrial protein processing is critical for cellular energy production and metabolic functions, impacting overall cell health and organismal outcomes. Proper functioning of PMPCB ensures the stability and functionality of mitochondrial proteins, which are essential for various cellular processes, including DNA repair and cytosolic protein translation (Vögtle2018Mutations; Gakh2002Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PMPCB gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial presequence protease, are associated with severe neurodegenerative conditions in early childhood. These mutations lead to a range of symptoms, including Leigh-like syndrome, characterized by episodic neurological regression, basal ganglia lesions, cerebellar atrophy, and increased T2 signal of the cerebellar cortex (Vögtle2018Mutations). More severe cases can involve therapy-resistant epileptic encephalopathy or leukodystrophy (Vögtle2018Mutations).

The dysfunction caused by PMPCB mutations primarily affects mitochondrial biogenesis, particularly under stress conditions such as febrile illnesses, leading to neurological injury. This is due to impaired biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which are crucial for various cellular functions, including mitochondrial bioenergetic processes and cytosolic protein translation (Vögtle2018Mutations). The mutations result in decreased activity of respiratory chain complex II and abnormal assembly of complex I, particularly affecting muscle tissue (Vögtle2018Mutations).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PMPCB has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Its knockdown in EpCAM+ HCC cells reduces TCF4 activities and the expression of downstream Wnt/β-catenin signaling targets, affecting cell proliferation and survival (Takai2019GenomeWide).

## Interactions
PMPCB, the mitochondrial processing peptidase beta subunit, is a key component of the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) complex. It interacts closely with PMPCA, the alpha subunit of the complex, to form a functional unit essential for the cleavage of mitochondrial targeting sequences from precursor proteins imported into the mitochondria (Antonicka2020A). This interaction is highly specific, as demonstrated by studies using BioID technology, which showed that PMPCA strongly and specifically enriched PMPCB, indicating a close and specific interaction between these two proteins (Antonicka2020A).

In addition to its role in the MPP complex, PMPCB has been implicated in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. PMPCB knockdown affects the phosphorylation of LRP6 and CTNNB1, key proteins in this signaling pathway, suggesting that PMPCB may interact with components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to maintain CTNNB1 stability (Takai2019GenomeWide). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cell proliferation and mitochondrial function in certain cancer cell lines, highlighting PMPCB's role beyond its traditional function in mitochondrial protein processing (Takai2019GenomeWide).
