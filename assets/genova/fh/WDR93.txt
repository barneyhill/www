# WDR93

## Overview
WDR93 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 93 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the WD repeat domain 93 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. Although the precise biological functions of WDR93 are not fully understood, it has been implicated in several signaling pathways, including those related to immune response and neurological function. The gene's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential significance in both normal cellular activities and disease pathogenesis (Abedalthagafi2019Precsion; Mosquera2021Detection; Yamamoto2021Multiple).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WDR93 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, although specific associations are still under investigation. In the context of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms, WDR93 has been identified as a significantly mutated gene, with a notable frequency of nonsense mutations. These mutations are part of a network enriched in pathways such as the B cell receptor signaling pathway and the NFKB signaling pathway, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms (Mosquera2021Detection).

WDR93 has also been associated with neurological disorders. It is among the genes identified through whole-exome sequencing as potentially contributing to intellectual disability and other neurological conditions. However, further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to establish a direct link between WDR93 mutations and impaired brain function (Abedalthagafi2019Precsion).

In the study of familial schizophrenia, a missense mutation in WDR93 was identified, suggesting its involvement in the molecular pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, the specific role of WDR93 in this condition remains to be fully elucidated (Yamamoto2021Multiple). Overall, while WDR93 mutations are associated with certain diseases, further research is required to clarify these relationships.
