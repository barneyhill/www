# POTEM

## Overview
POTEM is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member M, which is part of the POTE gene family. This family is known for its evolutionary significance and expression in specific human tissues, including the prostate, ovary, testis, and placenta. The POTEM protein is characterized by its unique structural features, including multiple ankyrin repeats and cysteine-rich regions, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. Unlike some other members of the POTE family, POTEM lacks coiled-coil domains, suggesting a distinct functional role within cellular processes. The structural attributes of POTEM imply potential involvement in cellular signaling pathways and interactions, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

## Structure
The POTEM protein, a member of the POTE gene family, is characterized by a specific molecular structure that includes 12 exons and a full long inverted repeat (LIR) sequence. Notably, the β-actin retrogene insertion is located outside of the coding sequence (CDS) in POTEM, distinguishing it from other POTE proteins where this insertion contributes to an actin module (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The protein structure of POTEM includes three cysteine repeats and seven ankyrin repeats, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. However, unlike some other POTE proteins, POTEM lacks coiled-coil domains (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).

The ankyrin repeats in POTEM contribute to its secondary and tertiary structures, providing a scaffold for potential interactions with other proteins. The absence of coiled-coil domains suggests a unique structural configuration compared to other POTE family members. The presence of multiple ankyrin repeats and cysteine-rich regions indicates a complex tertiary structure that may be involved in specific cellular functions. The protein's structure and domain composition suggest potential roles in cellular signaling and interactions, particularly in tissues where POTE genes are expressed, such as the prostate, ovary, testis, and placenta (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary).
