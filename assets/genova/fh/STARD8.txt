# STARD8

## Overview
STARD8 is a gene that encodes the protein StAR related lipid transfer domain containing 8, also known as DLC-3. This protein is a member of the mammalian START domain protein family, which is involved in lipid transport and the regulation of Rho GTPases. As a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP), StAR related lipid transfer domain containing 8 plays a pivotal role in cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion by modulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration (Clark2011The; Zhang2018Downregulation). The protein is characterized by a conserved START domain that facilitates lipid binding, suggesting its involvement in lipid distribution within cells (Clark2011The). It is active in the cytoplasm and associated with cellular membranes, influencing processes such as cell shape and motility (Clark2011The). Additionally, STARD8 is part of a subfamily with tumor suppressor activities, indicating its potential role in maintaining normal cellular functions and possibly in tumor suppression (Clark2011The).

## Function
STARD8, also known as DLC-3, is a member of the mammalian START domain protein family, which is involved in lipid transport and regulation of Rho GTPases. This protein functions as a Rho GTPase-activating protein (RhoGAP), playing a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion by modulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration (Clark2011The; Zhang2018Downregulation). STARD8 is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with cellular membranes, influencing processes such as cell shape and motility (Clark2011The).

The START domain of STARD8 is characterized by a conserved sequence that forms a hydrophobic pocket for lipid binding, suggesting its involvement in lipid distribution within cells (Clark2011The). The protein is part of a subfamily with tumor suppressor activities, indicating its potential role in maintaining normal cellular functions and possibly in tumor suppression (Clark2011The). Although the specific functions of STARD8 in healthy human cells are not fully established, its involvement in Rho-GTPase signaling suggests a role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular signaling pathways (Clark2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STARD8 gene have been implicated in 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, a condition characterized by atypical development of gonadal structures. A study identified a specific mutation, p.Ser913Asn, within the conserved START domain of STARD8, suggesting its potential role in gonadal sex determination and steroidogenesis. This mutation was found in two sisters with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, who exhibited dysgenetic gonads with features such as clarified Leydig-like cells and low testosterone levels, indicating a disruption in testosterone synthesis. The mutation was inherited from their heterozygous mother and was absent in their father and healthy brother, highlighting its potential significance in sexual development (Ilaslan2018A).

Alterations in STARD8 expression have also been linked to cancer progression, particularly in breast and prostate cancers, due to its role in cell migration and invasion. Dysregulation of STARD8 may impact cardiovascular diseases through its influence on endothelial cell function. These findings suggest that STARD8 plays a critical role in various physiological processes, and its dysregulation can lead to significant clinical consequences (Ilaslan2018A).

## Interactions
STARD8, also known as DLC3, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with the sorting nexin SNX27, which is important for its role in regulating RhoB activity at endosomal membranes (Noll2019DLC3). STARD8 also associates with the PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein Scribble, which is significant for maintaining adherens junction stability and polarized 3D morphogenesis in epithelial cells (Noll2019DLC3). 

The protein is localized in focal adhesions and regulates cell morphology by acting as a GAP for RhoA and Cdc42, influencing the actin cytoskeleton and cell morphology (Alpy2014START; Noll2019DLC3). STARD8's PDZL motif is crucial for its membrane association and localization at various subcellular sites, such as focal adhesions and endocytic recycling compartments (Hendrick2016Spatial). 

STARD8 is part of the RhoGAP-START group, which includes STARD12 and STARD13, sharing a SAM-RhoGAP-START domain organization. These proteins have redundant functions, although STARD12 has unique roles (Alpy2014START). The interactions of STARD8 with these proteins and domains highlight its role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling.
