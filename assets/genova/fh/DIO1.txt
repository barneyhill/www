# DIO1

## Overview
The DIO1 gene encodes the enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase 1 (D1), a selenoprotein that plays a pivotal role in thyroid hormone metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a thioredoxin-fold integral membrane protein, characterized by its ability to catalyze the conversion of thyroxine (T4) into the more biologically active triiodothyronine (T3), as well as the conversion of reverse T3 (rT3) into diiodothyronine (T2) (Bianco2002Biochemistry; Maia2011Type). D1 is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, with additional expression in various tissues, including the thyroid and pituitary gland (Maia2011Type). The enzyme's activity is regulated by several factors, including thyroid hormone levels and selenium availability, the latter being crucial due to the enzyme's selenocysteine content (Maia2011Type). DIO1's function is essential for maintaining the balance of thyroid hormones, which are critical for normal metabolic processes, growth, and development (Bianco2002Biochemistry).

## Structure
The DIO1 gene encodes the iodothyronine deiodinase 1 enzyme, which is a selenoprotein involved in thyroid hormone metabolism. The primary structure of DIO1 includes a selenocysteine residue, which is crucial for its catalytic activity. This residue is part of a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is essential for the incorporation of selenocysteine into the protein (Schweizer2015New).

The secondary structure of DIO1 features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of the enzyme involves a thioredoxin fold, a common motif in proteins that participate in redox reactions (Schweizer2015New). This fold is integral to the enzyme's catalytic mechanism, allowing it to facilitate the removal of iodine atoms from thyroid hormones.

DIO1 functions as a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure where two identical subunits associate to form the active enzyme. This dimerization is important for its enzymatic activity and stability (Schweizer2014Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of DIO1 may include phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions with other cellular components (Schweizer2015New). These structural features are critical for the enzyme's role in thyroid hormone regulation.

## Function
The DIO1 gene encodes the enzyme type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (D1), which is crucial for thyroid hormone metabolism. D1 catalyzes the conversion of thyroxine (T4) into the more active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) and also converts reverse T3 (rT3) into diiodothyronine (T2) (Maia2011Type). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining the balance of thyroid hormones, which are vital for normal metabolic processes, growth, and development (Bianco2002Biochemistry).

D1 is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, with additional expression in the thyroid, pituitary gland, intestine, placenta, and gonads (Maia2011Type). It is a thioredoxin-fold integral membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment, allowing it to access circulating thyroid hormones (Bianco2002Biochemistry). The enzyme's activity is regulated by thyroid hormone levels, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, retinoic acid, and cyclic AMP (Maia2011Type). Selenium is a critical micronutrient for D1 function, as it is a selenoenzyme (Maia2011Type).

D1's role in converting T4 to T3 is crucial for regulating various biological processes, as T3 is the more active form of thyroid hormone (Panicker2008A). The enzyme's activity is sensitive to inhibition by propylthiouracil (PTU) and is characterized by ping-pong kinetics involving an unidentified endogenous thiol cofactor (Maia2011Type).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DIO1 gene have significant clinical implications. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), DIO1 expression is notably downregulated, which is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and detachment from extracellular matrix proteins. This downregulation is linked to decreased intratumoral T3 levels and is thought to be an adaptive mechanism to protect cells from overstimulation and apoptosis (Goemann2018Current). The expression of DIO1 splice variants is also disturbed in ccRCC, with a shift towards nonactive forms due to changes in splicing factors, potentially contributing to tumor progression (PiekielkoWitkowska2009Disturbed).

In thyroid neoplasias, DIO1 expression is decreased in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which may lead to reduced intracellular T3 levels and favor tumor proliferation (Goemann2018Current). In other cancers, such as liver and breast neoplasias, DIO1 expression varies, potentially serving as a marker of differentiation (Goemann2018Current).

Mutations in the DIO1 gene, such as the N94K and M201I variants, have been linked to abnormal thyroid hormone metabolism, characterized by elevated serum reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) levels and altered rT3/T3 ratios, indicating impaired thyroid hormone metabolism (França2021Human).
