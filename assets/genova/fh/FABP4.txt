# FABP4

## Overview
FABP4, or fatty acid-binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the fatty acid-binding protein family, which is involved in the intracellular transport of lipids. The protein product of FABP4, also known as adipocyte FABP or aP2, is primarily expressed in adipocytes and macrophages, where it plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. As a lipid chaperone, fatty acid-binding protein 4 facilitates the transport of fatty acids and other lipophilic molecules within cells, influencing processes such as adipocyte differentiation, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation. The protein's structure, characterized by a beta-barrel motif, allows it to bind hydrophobic ligands effectively, and its interactions with nuclear receptors like PPARγ underscore its importance in metabolic regulation (Gillilan2007Structural; Furuhashi2014Fatty). FABP4 is implicated in various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Liu2022FABP4; Furuhashi2019Fatty).

## Structure
FABP4, or fatty acid-binding protein 4, is characterized by a primary structure consisting of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure of FABP4 includes ten anti-parallel beta strands that form a beta-barrel, which is a common feature among fatty acid-binding proteins. This beta-barrel structure creates a central hydrophobic cavity that facilitates the binding of long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands (Smathers2011The; Zimmerman2002New).

The tertiary structure of FABP4 is a compact, globular shape, allowing it to effectively bind hydrophobic ligands within its internal cavity. The protein also features a helix-loop-helix motif that acts as a portal for ligand access and egress (Storch2009Structural). This motif is crucial for the protein's function in ligand binding and release.

FABP4 typically does not form quaternary structures, but it can self-associate into dimers in both its apo form and when bound to certain ligands, such as troglitazone (Gillilan2007Structural). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can occur, influencing the protein's affinity for fatty acids and its role in metabolic pathways (Smathers2011The).

## Function
Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) is primarily expressed in adipocytes and macrophages, where it plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. In healthy human cells, FABP4 functions as a lipid chaperone, facilitating the intracellular transport of fatty acids (FAs) and other lipophilic substances. It binds to FAs that enter the cell membrane and assists in their transport within adipocytes, thereby regulating lipid metabolism and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Liu2022FABP4; Prentice2019Adipokine).

FABP4 interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism. This interaction is crucial for processes such as adipocyte differentiation, insulin sensitivity, and macrophage function (Gillilan2007Structural; Liu2022FABP4). During lipolysis, FABP4 binds free fatty acids within the cytoplasm, modulating the activity of lipolytic enzymes and contributing to the release of lipids from the cell (Prentice2019Adipokine).

FABP4 also plays a role in the nuclear import of specific ligands, which enhances the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors like PPARγ. This process involves structural changes in FABP4 that expose its nuclear localization signal, facilitating its translocation to the nucleus (Gillilan2007Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the FABP4 gene are linked to various metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Elevated levels of FABP4 are associated with obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular events, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions through mechanisms involving inflammation and lipid metabolism (Liu2022FABP4; Furuhashi2014Fatty). FABP4 is also implicated in atherosclerosis, with high expression levels linked to plaque instability and increased cardiovascular risk (Furuhashi2019Fatty; Saksi2014LowExpression).

A low-expression variant of FABP4, specifically the rs77878271 polymorphism, is associated with reduced manifestations of atherosclerotic disease and increased plaque stability. This variant correlates with lower serum total cholesterol levels and a decreased risk of myocardial infarction, particularly in individuals with higher body mass index (Saksi2014LowExpression). In cancer, FABP4 expression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis in various types, including colon, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancers, where it influences fatty acid uptake and signaling pathways (Liu2022FABP4).

FABP4's role extends to other conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, where its expression is elevated and associated with insulin resistance (Furuhashi2014Fatty). These findings highlight FABP4 as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic, cardiovascular, and cancer-related diseases.

## Interactions
FABP4 interacts with cytokeratin 1 (CK1) in endothelial cells, where CK1 acts as a receptor-like protein facilitating the uptake of extracellular FABP4 (eFABP4). This interaction is crucial for the internalization and intracellular trafficking of FABP4, influencing lipid-mediated processes such as inflammation and oxidative stress. The binding between FABP4 and CK1 is specific, with a particular region within CK1 identified as the binding site for FABP4. Peptide mapping revealed that a peptide covering the last 20 amino acids of the CK1 binding region exhibited strong binding affinity to FABP4 (MartínezMicaelo2019Extracellular).

FABP4 also plays a role in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling process, which is essential for the transcriptional activation of the nuclear receptor PPARγ. FABP4 delivers specific ligands from the cytosol to PPARγ in the nucleus, enhancing the receptor's transcriptional activity. This process involves ligand-induced nuclear import and ligand-independent active nuclear export, mediated by specific residues in FABP4's tertiary structure (Ayers2007Continuous). These interactions highlight FABP4's role in regulating metabolic and inflammatory pathways.
