# TNF

## Overview
The TNF gene encodes the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) protein, a crucial cytokine involved in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. TNF is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily and functions primarily as a pro-inflammatory mediator. The protein is synthesized as a transmembrane precursor that is cleaved to release a soluble form, which acts as a homotrimer to exert its biological effects. TNF interacts with two specific receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, each initiating distinct signaling pathways that can lead to diverse cellular outcomes, including apoptosis, cell survival, and proliferation. The gene and its protein product play significant roles in various physiological and pathological processes, such as immune system regulation, inflammation, and cell death, and are implicated in numerous diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cancer (Ghorbaninezhad2022Tumor; Haider2009Human; Idriss2000TNF?).

## Structure
The TNF (tumor necrosis factor) protein is a cytokine involved in inflammation and immune regulation. Its primary structure consists of a polypeptide chain of 157 amino acids, with the mature form being a 17 kDa protein after proteolytic cleavage of a 76-residue peptide (Ghorbaninezhad2022Tumor; Eck1989The). The secondary structure of TNF includes a 'jelly-roll' beta-sheet sandwich composed almost entirely of antiparallel beta-strands, forming a compact, bell-shaped trimer (Eck1989The; Vanamee2018Structural). 

The tertiary structure is characterized by a hydrophobic core and a disulfide bridge between residues 69 and 101, which links specific polypeptide loops (Eck1989The). The quaternary structure involves a homotrimer, with each monomer contributing to the overall stability and function of the protein (Smith1987The; Vanamee2018Structural). 

TNF contains a TNF homology domain (THD), which is crucial for its interaction with receptors. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may regulate trimer formation and receptor binding (Ghorbaninezhad2022Tumor; Idriss2000TNF?). The trimeric structure is essential for its biological activity, as it binds to TNF receptors TNFR-1 and TNFR-2, triggering various cellular responses (Vanamee2018Structural; Idriss2000TNF?).

## Function
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in various cellular processes, including inflammation, cell survival, apoptosis, and proliferation. TNF signals through two main receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, each mediating distinct cellular responses. TNFR1 activation generally leads to pro-inflammatory responses and programmed cell death pathways, often associated with tissue injury. This involves complex signaling pathways, including the activation of NFκB, a key transcription factor that regulates inflammation, development, and cellular stress responses (Haider2009Human). TNFR2, in contrast, can promote cell survival, tissue repair, and angiogenesis, and is involved in activating pathways like PI3K-Akt, which modulate cell adhesion, proliferation, and survival (Haider2009Human).

TNF is primarily produced by monocytes and macrophages, but also by endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and neuronal tissue. It can act in its membrane-bound form or as a soluble trimer after cleavage by the TNF alpha converting enzyme (TACE) (Haider2009Human). In the context of human reproductive tissues, TNF is implicated in processes such as ovulation, corpus luteum formation, and luteolysis, and plays a role in balancing cell fusion and apoptotic shedding of villous trophoblasts (Haider2009Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the TNF gene have significant clinical implications, influencing susceptibility to various diseases. The TNF2 allele, a polymorphism in the TNF-α promoter, is associated with increased TNF-α production and has been linked to more severe outcomes in infections such as malaria and leishmaniasis (Wilson1997Effects). This allele is also associated with a higher risk of septic shock and increased mortality rates in affected patients (Mira1999Association).

In autoimmune diseases, specific TNF polymorphisms are linked to conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). For instance, the TNF a6 allele is associated with RA severity, particularly in females, while the TNF a2 allele is part of a diabetogenic haplotype linked to high TNF-α production in IDDM (Hajeer2000TNF?). The TNF -308*A allele is associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and Crohn's disease, but it has a protective effect in ulcerative colitis (Hajeer2000TNF?).

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the TNF À 857C variant is linked to higher TNF production and increased risk for IBD, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis, suggesting a functional effect on TNF production and transcription factor interactions (van2002Inflammatory). These genetic variations highlight the complex role of TNF in disease susceptibility and progression.

## Interactions
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a cytokine that interacts with various proteins to mediate its effects on inflammation, cell survival, and apoptosis. TNF primarily interacts with two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, which initiate distinct signaling pathways. TNFR1 contains a death domain that can recruit adaptor proteins like TRADD, leading to the formation of complex I, which includes RIPK1, TRAF2, and cIAP1/2, and activates NF-κB signaling (Van2018A). TNFR2, lacking a death domain, interacts with TRAF2 and forms a complex with cIAP1 and cIAP2, which inhibits caspases and promotes NF-κB activation (Zelová2013TNF-α).

TNF also plays a role in the formation of signaling complexes that regulate cell death and survival. For instance, under stress conditions, TNFR2 can form signaling complex II via TRAF2, leading to the activation of caspase 8 and apoptosis (Zelová2013TNF-α). Additionally, TNF-induced NF-κB signaling involves proteins such as LUBAC, TAK1/TAB2/3, and IKK complexes, which are crucial for ubiquitination and activation processes (Van2018A).

In the context of inflammation, TNF interacts with endothelial cells to increase the expression of adhesion molecules like ICAM-1 and E-selectin, facilitating leukocyte adhesion and transmigration (Zelová2013TNF-α). These interactions highlight TNF's central role in immune response modulation and inflammation.
