# PAGE3

## Overview
PAGE3, or P antigen family member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cancer/testis antigen family, specifically the PAGE family. This family of proteins is characterized by their expression in various tumor types and restricted expression in normal tissues, primarily in the testis. The PAGE3 protein is implicated in cellular processes related to cancer biology, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. As a member of the PAGE family, PAGE3 is of interest in cancer research due to its potential role in tumorigenesis and as a target for cancer immunotherapy. The gene's expression pattern and involvement in cancer pathways suggest its significance in the study of cancer/testis antigens and their applications in therapeutic strategies.
