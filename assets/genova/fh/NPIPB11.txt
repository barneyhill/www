# NPIPB11

## Overview
The NPIPB11 gene encodes the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member B11, a protein that is part of a larger family involved in interactions with the nuclear pore complex. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression. Although the specific functions of NPIPB11 are not fully elucidated, it is believed to be involved in various cellular processes, potentially influencing the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of NPIPB11 in cellular physiology and its potential links to disease states.
