# PEX26

## Overview
PEX26 is a gene that encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 26, a transmembrane protein integral to peroxisomal function and biogenesis. This protein is characterized by its tail-anchored structure, with a significant role in anchoring the PEX1-PEX6 AAA ATPase complex to the peroxisomal membrane, which is crucial for the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins (Matsumoto2003The; Guder2019Isoformspecific). PEX26 interacts with other peroxisomal proteins, such as PEX19 and PEX3, to ensure its proper localization and function within the peroxisome (Halbach2006Targeting; Yagita2013Tailanchored). Mutations in the PEX26 gene are linked to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, including Zellweger spectrum disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Matsumoto2003Mutations). Additionally, alterations in PEX26 expression have implications in colorectal cancer, where it may act as a metastasis repressor (Yan2023Loss).

## Structure
PEX26 is a peroxisomal membrane protein characterized by its tail-anchored structure, with the N-terminal part exposed to the cytosol and the C-terminal part facing the peroxisomal matrix (Matsumoto2003The). The protein contains two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2, which are crucial for its oligomerization. These regions include leucine zip motifs that facilitate helical oligomerization, essential for its structural stability and function (Guder2019Isoformspecific). 

PEX26 has a transmembrane domain and two PEX19-binding sites located in the C-terminal region, which are critical for its targeting to peroxisomes (Halbach2006Targeting). The first binding site spans amino acids 248-270, while the second spans 276-296 (Halbach2006Targeting). The protein also features a PEX6 binding domain at the N-terminal, which is involved in recruiting the PEX1-PEX6 complex to the peroxisomal membrane (Guder2019Isoformspecific).

A splice variant, PEX26Δex5, lacks the transmembrane domain and shows different interaction patterns, particularly its inability to bind PEX13, although it can still bind PEX14 (Guder2019Isoformspecific). This variant can complement PEX26 deficiency in cells, indicating functional versatility despite structural differences (Guder2019Isoformspecific).

## Function
PEX26 is a crucial peroxisomal membrane protein involved in peroxisomal biogenesis and maintenance. It functions as a membrane anchor for the PEX1-PEX6 AAA ATPase complex, which is essential for the recycling of the PEX5 cargo receptor and the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins (Matsumoto2003The; Guder2019Isoformspecific). PEX26 interacts with PEX19 and PEX3, facilitating its proper localization to peroxisomes. PEX19 acts as a cytosolic chaperone, forming a complex with PEX26 to maintain it in an import-competent state, while PEX3 serves as a membrane receptor for this complex (Halbach2006Targeting; Yagita2013Tailanchored).

The protein contains two PEX19-binding sites, which are critical for its targeting to peroxisomes and preventing mislocalization to mitochondria (Halbach2006Targeting). PEX26 also forms homooligomers, which are important for its function, and interacts with other peroxisomal proteins such as PEX13 and PEX14, contributing to the assembly of the peroxisomal import machinery (Guder2019Isoformspecific). The proper functioning of PEX26 is vital for peroxisomal homeostasis, impacting cellular metabolism and detoxification processes (Guder2019Isoformspecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX26 gene are associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), particularly those within the Zellweger spectrum, which includes Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD). These disorders result from impaired peroxisomal function due to defective protein import, leading to a range of clinical manifestations from severe to mild (LotzHavla2021Edgetic; Matsumoto2003Mutations). Specific mutations, such as the G89R missense mutation, result in severe phenotypes like ZS, while others, like the R98W mutation, are associated with milder forms such as NALD (Matsumoto2003Mutations). 

The PEX26 gene also plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC), where its down-regulation is linked to poor prognosis. Over-expression of PEX26 has been shown to inhibit CRC cell migration and invasion, suggesting its potential as a metastasis repressor (Yan2023Loss). Additionally, missense variants in PEX26 can lead to edgetic perturbations, affecting protein interactions and contributing to phenotypic variability in PBDs (LotzHavla2021Edgetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PEX26 mutations and expression alterations in various diseases.

## Interactions
PEX26 is a peroxisomal membrane protein that plays a crucial role in peroxisome biogenesis through its interactions with various proteins. It directly interacts with PEX6 and indirectly with PEX1, forming a complex essential for the proper localization of these proteins to peroxisomes (Matsumoto2003The). PEX26 serves as a membrane anchor for the PEX1-PEX6 AAA ATPase complex, which is vital for the ubiquitination and dislocation of PEX5 cargo receptors, facilitating peroxisomal matrix protein import (Guder2019Isoformspecific).

PEX26 also interacts with PEX19, forming a binary complex that is crucial for peroxisomal protein import. This interaction is mediated by specific binding sites located in the C-terminal region of PEX26, which are essential for its peroxisomal localization (koccak2021insight; Halbach2006Targeting). The PEX19-PEX26 complex can restore peroxisomal matrix protein import in PEX26-deficient fibroblasts, highlighting its functional significance (koccak2021insight).

Additionally, PEX26 interacts with components of the docking complex, such as PEX13 and PEX14, but not with PEX2 or PEX10. These interactions are important for its role in peroxisomal biogenesis and the importomer complex (Guder2019Isoformspecific).
