# DDIAS

## Overview
The DDIAS gene encodes the DNA damage-induced apoptosis suppressor protein, which plays a pivotal role in cellular processes related to DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. This protein is characterized by its DNA-binding domain and is involved in forming complexes with replication protein A (RPA), facilitating DNA replication, recombination, and repair. DDIAS is primarily located in the cytoplasm but can translocate to the nucleus in response to specific stimuli, where it participates in DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms, particularly during the S phase of the cell cycle. The protein is enriched with serine residues, suggesting potential phosphorylation sites, and is subject to ubiquitination, which regulates its stability and degradation. DDIAS is implicated in cancer progression, as it inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell survival, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in various cancers, including lung and hepatocellular carcinoma (Im2023DDIAS).

## Structure
The DDIAS gene encodes a protein consisting of 998 amino acids, structured into six exons, with the translation initiation site located at the third exon (Im2023DDIAS). The protein features a DNA-binding domain C (DBD C) in its N-terminal region, spanning amino acids 8-123. This domain is also found in replication protein A (RPA), a nuclear single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and is essential for forming heterotrimeric complexes with RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3, which are involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair processes (Im2023DDIAS).

The DDIAS protein is enriched with serine residues, indicating potential phosphorylation sites. It has putative phosphorylation sites for several kinases, including DNA-PK, ATM, cdc2, CDK5, CKII, p38MAPK, RSK, PKA, and PKC (Im2023DDIAS). The protein is ubiquitinated at specific lysine residues, namely lysine386, lysine500, and lysine807 (Im2023DDIAS). DDIAS is primarily located in the cytoplasm but can also be found in the nucleus in response to certain stimuli (Im2023DDIAS). The interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, which promotes its proteasomal degradation, is mediated by the TPR domain of CHIP, interacting with the N (aa 1-400) and C (aa 601-998) termini of DDIAS (Won2017Stability).

## Function
The DDIAS (DNA damage-induced apoptosis suppressor) gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular processes related to DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. In healthy human cells, DDIAS is involved in DNA synthesis and repair, particularly through its interaction with DNA polymerase α, which suggests a role in double-strand break repair via nonhomologous end-joining (Im2023DDIAS). The protein contains a DNA-binding domain in its N-terminal region, essential for forming complexes with replication protein A (RPA), facilitating replication, recombination, and repair processes (Im2023DDIAS).

DDIAS is expressed in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and is most active during the S phase of the cell cycle, indicating its involvement in DNA replication and repair mechanisms (Im2023DDIAS). The protein is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, depending on the cell type, such as lung cancer cells and hepatocellular carcinoma cells, respectively (Im2023DDIAS). Its expression is regulated by pathways involving epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the MEK5/ERK5/MEF2B signaling cascade, highlighting its role in cellular response to external stimuli (Im2023DDIAS).

## Clinical Significance
The DDIAS gene, known as DNA damage-induced apoptosis suppressor, is significantly implicated in cancer progression due to its role in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell survival. Overexpression of DDIAS is associated with various cancers, including lung, colorectal, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it contributes to tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance (Im2023DDIAS). In lung cancer, DDIAS enhances STAT3 phosphorylation by preventing its dephosphorylation by PTPRM, sustaining STAT3 activation, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival (Im2020DDIAS). This mechanism makes DDIAS a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in lung cancers with aberrant STAT3 activation (Im2020DDIAS).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, DDIAS overexpression accelerates the G1-S phase transition, enhancing DNA synthesis and repair, and interacts with DNA polymerase α to promote DNA polymerase-primase complex formation (Im2023DDIAS). DDIAS also plays a role in drug resistance, protecting cancer cells from apoptosis induced by agents like camptothecin and cisplatin (Im2023DDIAS). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DDIAS as a target for cancer therapy, particularly in overcoming drug resistance and enhancing apoptosis in cancer cells.

## Interactions
The DDIAS protein, also known as DNA damage-induced apoptosis suppressor, engages in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cancer cell proliferation and DNA repair. DDIAS interacts with DNA polymerase α, enhancing DNA synthesis by promoting the formation of DNA polymerase-primase complexes, and is involved in double-strand break repair through homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining (Im2023DDIAS). It also binds to the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP, which targets DDIAS for proteasomal degradation, a process mediated by the TPR domain of CHIP and facilitated by HSP70 (Won2017Stability).

DDIAS interacts with STAT3, a signal transducer and activator of transcription, by binding to its transactivation domain. This interaction prevents STAT3 from binding to the phosphatase PTPRM, thereby sustaining STAT3 phosphorylation and activation, which is crucial for cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Im2020DDIAS). DDIAS also interacts with the death effector domain of FADD, inhibiting its recruitment to the death-inducing signaling complex and preventing caspase-8 activation, which is essential for inhibiting TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells (Im2023DDIAS). These interactions highlight DDIAS's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
