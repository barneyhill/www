# TIMELESS

## Overview
TIMELESS is a gene that encodes the timeless circadian regulator protein, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of circadian rhythms and DNA replication processes. The protein is categorized as a circadian clock component and is involved in maintaining genomic stability by interacting with various proteins and complexes essential for DNA replication and repair. TIMELESS forms part of the fork protection complex (FPC) with TIPIN, contributing to the stabilization of replication forks and ensuring proper cell cycle progression. It also interacts with circadian clock proteins and cell cycle checkpoint proteins, highlighting its dual role in synchronizing circadian rhythms with cellular processes. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several clinical conditions, including cancer and sleep disorders, underscoring its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (ÜnsalKaçmaz2005Coupling; Kurien2019TIMELESS; Yoshida2013TIMELESS).

## Structure
The TIMELESS protein is a crucial component of the circadian clock and DNA replication processes. Its molecular structure includes several key features. The primary structure of TIMELESS consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The secondary structure is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, with the N-terminal domain forming a series of armadillo repeats, which are common in proteins involved in protein-protein interactions (Grabarczyk2020Crystal).

The tertiary structure of TIMELESS involves the folding of these secondary elements into a three-dimensional configuration, which includes a conserved cleft lined with basic and hydrophobic residues, significant for peptide binding and potentially involved in DNA interactions (Grabarczyk2020Crystal). The quaternary structure of TIMELESS is exemplified by its interaction with other proteins, such as the formation of the Timeless-Tipin complex, which is analogous to the Tof1-Csm3 complex in yeast, playing a role in fork protection during DNA replication (Grabarczyk2020Crystal).

TIMELESS also contains a C-terminal domain known as the PARP1-binding PAB domain, which is involved in interactions with poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, although this domain is not present in all homologues, such as Arabidopsis Timeless (Grabarczyk2020Crystal). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are likely to regulate its function, particularly in the context of nuclear entry and circadian rhythm regulation (Lin2022CryptochromeTimeless).

## Function
The TIMELESS gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in regulating circadian rhythms and cell cycle progression in healthy human cells. The TIMELESS protein is involved in the synchronization of the circadian clock with the cell cycle, ensuring that cellular processes occur at the appropriate times. It interacts with circadian clock proteins such as cryptochrome 2 and cell cycle checkpoint proteins like Chk1 and the ATR-ATRIP complex, which are essential for the DNA damage checkpoint response (ÜnsalKaçmaz2005Coupling). This interaction is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity during DNA replication and for the proper activation of Chk1 in response to DNA damage (Kondratov2007Circadian).

TIMELESS also forms a complex with TIPIN, which is important for the stability and nuclear localization of both proteins. This complex is involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression, interacting with replication protein A and components of the minichromosome maintenance replicative helicase complex (Kondratov2007Circadian). The protein's role in stabilizing stalled replication forks and acting as a mediator between damage sensors and signal transducers highlights its function as a damage sensor (ÜnsalKaçmaz2005Coupling). These activities underscore TIMELESS's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability.

## Clinical Significance
The TIMELESS gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or disrupted interactions. In lung cancer, TIMELESS is overexpressed, with a 3.7-fold increase in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a 2.2-fold increase in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) compared to normal tissues. This overexpression correlates with poorer overall survival in NSCLC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Yoshida2013TIMELESS).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), the loss of TIMELESS expression is associated with unfavorable prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and metastatic spreading. This loss induces epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via a ZEB1-dependent mechanism, contributing to tumor progression (Colangelo2022Loss). TIMELESS expression levels also correlate with survival outcomes in CRC patients (Colangelo2022Loss).

The TIMELESS gene is also involved in circadian regulation. A specific mutation, R1081X, causes Familial Advanced Sleep Phase (FASP) by affecting the stability and nuclear presence of the TIM protein, leading to altered circadian rhythms and sleep phase modulation (Kurien2019TIMELESS).

## Interactions
The TIMELESS protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in DNA replication and repair processes. TIMELESS forms a complex with TIPIN, known as the fork protection complex (FPC), which is essential for maintaining DNA replication fork integrity. This complex interacts with the CMG helicase complex, stabilizing the parental DNA duplex and facilitating strand separation (Patel2023The). TIMELESS also interacts with CLASPIN, which is crucial for the association of the replication fork and enhances its function (Patel2023The).

TIMELESS is part of the Tim-Tipin-RPA complex, which is recruited to replication forks via Replication Protein A (RPA). This complex is essential for maintaining genome stability and interacts with various replisome proteins, including the MCM2-7 helicase and DNA polymerases (Witosch2014Architecture). The interaction between TIMELESS and RPA is mediated by the C-terminal region of the RPA32 subunit (Witosch2014Architecture).

TIMELESS also interacts with PARP1, a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family, through its C-terminus. This interaction is crucial for recruiting TIMELESS to DNA damage sites, facilitating DNA repair through homologous recombination (Xie2015Timeless). Additionally, TIMELESS interacts with proteins such as RAD51, BRCA2, and the MCM8/9 helicase complex to protect stalled replication forks and maintain genome stability (Patel2023The).
