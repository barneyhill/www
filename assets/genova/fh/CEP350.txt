# CEP350

## Overview
CEP350 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 350, a large coiled-coil protein primarily associated with the centrosome, an organelle essential for cell division and microtubule organization. The protein plays a critical role in the regulation of primary cilia biogenesis and centrosome function, acting as a scaffold for the recruitment and stabilization of other centrosomal proteins, such as CEP78, which are crucial for ciliogenesis (Gonçalves2020CEP78). Additionally, centrosomal protein 350 is involved in lipid metabolism through its interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), influencing fatty acid oxidation and cellular lipid homeostasis (Ghosh2020A). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes and its interactions with other proteins underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, including its potential role as a tumor suppressor in melanoma and its association with liver diseases and major depressive disorder (Mann2015Transposon; Long2021Construction).

## Structure
CEP350 (centrosomal protein 350) is a large protein primarily associated with the centrosome, an organelle crucial for cell division. The protein is characterized by a coiled-coil domain structure, which is essential for facilitating protein-protein interactions. This structural feature plays a significant role in the organization and anchoring of microtubules, which are vital components of the cell's cytoskeleton and are involved in maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and segregating chromosomes during cell division.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to regulate the function of CEP350, although specific phosphorylation sites and their effects on the protein's activity are not detailed in the available context. The presence of multiple splice variants of CEP350 suggests that the protein may have diverse roles in various cellular processes, potentially allowing it to participate in different cellular contexts or stages of the cell cycle. These splice variants contribute to the functional versatility of CEP350, although the specific structural differences between these isoforms are not described in the provided information. The coiled-coil domains and potential post-translational modifications underscore the complexity and adaptability of CEP350 in cellular functions.

## Function
CEP350 is a centrosomal protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of primary cilia biogenesis and centrosome function. It is primarily located at the distal end of the mother centriole/basal body in ciliated cells, where it is crucial for the recruitment and stability of other proteins, such as CEP78, to the centrosome (Gonçalves2020CEP78). CEP350 functions upstream of CEP78, facilitating the regulation of CP110 levels, a protein essential for ciliogenesis. This regulation is vital for the proper formation and length control of primary cilia, as CEP350's interaction with CEP78 influences ciliary frequency and length (Gonçalves2020CEP78).

In addition to its role in ciliogenesis, CEP350 is involved in lipid metabolism. It interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a transcription factor involved in fatty acid oxidation. CEP350 sequesters PPARα, thereby modulating its activity and influencing the expression of genes related to fatty acid β-oxidation (Ghosh2020A). This interaction suggests that CEP350 plays a role in balancing lipid metabolism by controlling PPARα activity, which is crucial for maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis (Ghosh2020A).

## Clinical Significance
CEP350 has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In melanoma, CEP350 is identified as a potential tumor suppressor gene. Mutations in CEP350, including stop-gain and missense mutations, have been found in 7.2% of human melanoma genomes. These mutations are predicted to affect CEP350 expression, and functional studies have shown that reduced CEP350 expression enhances tumor formation in vivo, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor in melanoma (Mann2015Transposon).

In the context of liver diseases, CEP350 is involved in lipid metabolism and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection pathways. It negatively interacts with PPARα, a transcription factor involved in fatty acid oxidation. Alterations in CEP350 expression, influenced by miR-c12, are associated with liver conditions such as HCV infection, liver steatosis, and fibrosis. In chronic hepatitis C patients, miR-c12 is downregulated, leading to upregulation of CEP350 and correlating with reduced expression of β-oxidation genes (Ghosh2020A).

CEP350 has also been linked to major depressive disorder (MDD). A genome-wide study indicated that a single nucleotide polymorphism near CEP350 was associated with depressive symptoms, suggesting its involvement in MDD pathogenesis (Long2021Construction).

## Interactions
CEP350 is a centrosomal protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It interacts with PPARα, a nuclear receptor involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, by sequestering it in the cytoplasm, thereby limiting its nuclear translocation and activity. This interaction is modulated by miR-c12, a microRNA that targets CEP350, enhancing PPARα activity and promoting fatty acid oxidation in the liver (Ghosh2020A).

CEP350 also interacts with CEP78, another centrosomal protein, to regulate ciliogenesis. CEP350 is crucial for the stability and centrosomal recruitment of CEP78, which in turn is necessary for the recruitment of EDD1, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in CP110 regulation. This interaction is important for controlling CP110 levels and ciliogenesis (Gonçalves2020CEP78).

In the context of viral infections, CEP350 has been identified as part of the interactome modulated by SARS-CoV-2, with a novel interaction involving RSRP1. This suggests a potential role in viral pathogenesis and cilium organization (Karunakaran2020Interactome). These interactions highlight CEP350's involvement in diverse cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.
