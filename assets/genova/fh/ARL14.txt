# ARL14

## Overview
ARL14 is a gene that encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 14, a member of the ARF family of GTPases. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of vesicle biogenesis and lipid composition within cells, playing a crucial role in processes such as membrane curvature, vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and exocytosis (Li2023The). ARL14 is specifically expressed in certain cell types, including enterocytes, Paneth cells, and gastric mucus-secreting cells, highlighting its specialized functions in these tissues (Li2023The). The protein's activity is modulated by its association with the plasma membrane and endosomes, which is influenced by its GTP- and GDP-bound states and the presence of an N-terminal amphipathic helix (Li2022ADPRibosylation; Yang2024Investigating). ARL14's interactions, particularly with phospholipase D1 (PLD1), underscore its significance in cellular signaling pathways and its potential implications in diseases such as lung adenocarcinoma (Guo2019Silencing).

## Function
ARL14, a member of the ARF family of GTPases, plays a significant role in the regulation of vesicle biogenesis and lipid composition within cells. It is particularly involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid (PA) through its interaction with phospholipase D1 (PLD1). This process is crucial for promoting membrane curvature, facilitating vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, and exocytosis (Li2023The). ARL14 is specifically expressed in enterocytes, Paneth cells, and gastric mucus-secreting cells, indicating its specialized role in these cell types (Li2023The).

ARL14 is associated with the plasma membrane and endosomes, with its localization influenced by an N-terminal amphipathic helix. This helix can be myristoylated or acetylated, which is essential for its membrane association. The GTP-bound form of ARL14 is preferentially located at the plasma membrane, while the GDP-bound form is found in endosomes (Li2022ADPRibosylation; Yang2024Investigating). This localization mechanism allows ARL14 to participate efficiently in trafficking cycles, contributing to cellular processes that require rapid turnover and activation of proteins (Li2022ADPRibosylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ARL14 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Elevated mRNA expression of ARL14 is observed in lung adenocarcinoma samples compared to normal tissues, and this increased expression is strongly negatively correlated with the overall survival of lung cancer patients (Guo2019Silencing). Silencing ARL14 in lung adenocarcinoma cells leads to inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces cell cycle arrest in the G0 phase, resulting in cell dormancy. This effect is mediated by blocking the ERK/p38 signaling pathway and enhancing the expression of CIDEC, a cell death activator (Guo2019Silencing).

The knockdown of ARL14 also affects the radiation response of lung adenocarcinoma cells, weakening the decrease in cell proliferation caused by γ-ray irradiation, suggesting that ARL14 may influence the outcome of radiotherapy (Guo2019Silencing). Additionally, ARL14 is involved in pathways related to metabolism and the immune system, indicating its broader role in cancer biology (Guo2019Silencing). These findings suggest that ARL14 could serve as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma.

## Interactions
ARL14, a member of the ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) family, is known for its interaction with phospholipase D1 (PLD1). This interaction is facilitated by the flexible loop region in PLD1, which specifically binds and activates PLD1. ARL14, along with ARL11, exhibits a stronger interaction with PLD1 compared to other ARF family members such as ARF1 and ARF6. This activation of PLD1 by ARL14 is particularly significant in certain cell types, including enterocytes, Paneth cells, and gastric mucus-secreting cells, where ARL14 expression is highly restricted (Li2023The).

ARL14 is also involved in membrane recruitment and localization, which is influenced by its GDP and GTP-bound states. The N-terminal amphipathic helix of ARL14 is crucial for its membrane association, allowing it to localize at the plasma membrane and endosomes. This localization can occur independently of GTP-binding, which is atypical for ARF family proteins (Li2022ADPRibosylation). Despite these interactions, specific physical interactions of ARL14 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond PLD1 are not detailed in the provided excerpts (Li2022ADPRibosylation; Li2023The).
