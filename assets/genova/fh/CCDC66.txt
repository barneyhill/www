# CCDC66

## Overview
CCDC66 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 66 protein, which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly those involving microtubule dynamics and ciliary function. The CCDC66 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its role as a microtubule-associated protein. It is involved in critical cellular functions such as mitotic progression, cytokinesis, and the regulation of primary cilium stability and signaling. The protein's localization to centrosomes, spindle poles, and ciliary structures underscores its importance in maintaining cellular organization and function. Mutations in the CCDC66 gene have been implicated in retinal diseases, including retinitis pigmentosa and progressive retinal atrophy, highlighting its clinical significance in ocular health (Batman2022The; Conkar2017The; Gerding2011Ccdc66).

## Structure
CCDC66 is a protein characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. Specifically, CCDC66 contains two coiled-coil domains: CC1, spanning amino acids 252-283, and CC2, covering amino acids 466-564. The CC2 domain overlaps with an evolutionarily conserved CCDC66 domain, indicating its potential importance in the protein's function (Conkar2017The).

The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the retina, heart, brain, liver, and blood, and localizes to the centrosome and centriolar satellites in interphase cells. In ciliated cells, it redistributes to the primary cilium and basal body, with its localization dependent on PCM1 and microtubule integrity (Conkar2017The).

CCDC66 is known to undergo complex RNA splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms. In humans, there are four known isoforms, including two long spliced variants (LSV) of 109 and 105 kDa, and one short spliced variant (SSV) of 21 kDa, with an unconfirmed 32 kDa SSV. In mice, a 107 kDa LSV and two unconfirmed LSVs of 103 and 90 kDa have been identified (Gerding2011Ccdc66). These isoforms suggest a diversity in structure and function, although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
The CCDC66 protein is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a significant role in both ciliary and non-ciliary functions within healthy human cells. It is crucial for mitotic progression and cytokinesis by promoting microtubule nucleation and organization. CCDC66 localizes to spindle poles and microtubule-based structures during cell division, where it is involved in the recruitment of core machinery for centrosome maturation, spindle assembly, and organization. This protein is essential for maintaining k-fiber and midbody integrity, chromosome alignment, and successful cytokinesis (Batman2022The).

In addition to its role in cell division, CCDC66 is involved in the regulation of primary cilium stability, disassembly, and signaling, which are important for epithelial organization. It localizes to the ciliary axoneme and acts as a microtubule-stabilizing factor, promoting microtubule bundling and stabilizing axonemal microtubules. This function is critical for maintaining ciliary stability and function, affecting ciliary signaling pathways such as Hedgehog and Wnt, and contributing to proper cell polarity and tissue organization (Deretic2024Ccdc66).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC66 gene are associated with several retinal diseases, most notably retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). In humans, mutations in CCDC66 have been linked to RP, a degenerative condition that leads to vision loss due to the degeneration of photoreceptor cells (Gerding2011Ccdc66). In animal models, such as mice and dogs, CCDC66 mutations result in early and progressive retinal degeneration. For instance, Ccdc66 null mice exhibit early photoreceptor degeneration, leading to a progressive retinal phenotype similar to RP (Schreiber2018Neurodegeneration; Gerding2011Ccdc66). In Schapendoes dogs, mutations in CCDC66 are linked to autosomal recessively inherited PRA, characterized by a lack of CCDC66 protein expression in the retina (Dekomien2009Progressive).

In Portuguese Water Dogs, a frameshift variant in CCDC66 causes early-onset progressive retinal atrophy (EOPRA), with the mutant protein mislocalizing to the nucleus, suggesting altered function (Murgiano2020CCDC66). The CCDC66 protein is crucial for ciliary function, and its dysfunction can lead to ciliopathy-like diseases, including retinal dystrophies (Conkar2017The; Murgiano2020CCDC66). These findings underscore the importance of CCDC66 in maintaining retinal health and its role in various retinal degenerative conditions.

## Interactions
CCDC66 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with several proteins involved in centrosome maturation and cytokinesis, such as CDK5RAP2, Cep192, Cep152, and gamma-tubulin, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Batman2022The). CCDC66 also interacts with PRC1, a regulator of microtubule bundling during cell division, but not with CEP55 (Batman2022The). These interactions suggest its role in regulating centrosome maturation and microtubule organization during cell division.

In the context of ciliogenesis, CCDC66 interacts with CEP290 and PCM1 at centriolar satellites, which are important for cilium formation and trafficking (Conkar2017The). It also interacts with CSPP1 and CEP104, which are involved in axonemal length regulation, indicating its role in primary cilium length and signaling competence (Conkar2022CCDC66). CCDC66's interaction with the dynein/dynactin complex is essential for its centrosomal targeting and dynamics, as it co-precipitates with components like GFP-DYNC1IC1 and p150 glued (Conkar2019Centrosomal). These interactions highlight CCDC66's multifaceted role in cellular organization and function.
