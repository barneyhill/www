# SMYD2

## Overview
SMYD2 (SET and MYND domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes a lysine methyltransferase protein involved in the regulation of gene expression through histone modification. The SMYD2 protein is characterized by its ability to methylate lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins, influencing various cellular processes such as transcriptional repression and cell cycle progression. It primarily targets lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36), a modification associated with actively transcribed genes, and interacts with proteins like p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), affecting their function and stability (Brown2006Identification; Sesé2013SMYD2). SMYD2 is implicated in the regulation of differentiation pathways in stem cells and is associated with various cancers, where its altered expression can influence tumor progression and drug resistance (Padilla2023Targeting; Sesé2013SMYD2). As a histone methyltransferase, SMYD2 represents a potential therapeutic target in oncology due to its role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular functions.

## Structure
The SMYD2 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It features a bilobal structure with an N-lobe and a C-lobe. The N-lobe contains the SET, MYND, SET-I, and post-SET domains, while the C-lobe is composed of the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Spellmon2015Molecular). The SET domain is responsible for the protein's methyltransferase activity, facilitating cofactor and substrate binding (Spellmon2015Molecular). The MYND domain, although not involved in cofactor binding, plays a role in protein-protein interactions (Jiang2014Structural).

The CTD of SMYD2 is composed of seven antiparallel α-helices, resembling tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which contribute to its role in protein-protein interactions and substrate binding (Jiang2014Structural; Chandramouli2016Conformational). This domain exhibits significant conformational flexibility, allowing SMYD2 to accommodate a variety of substrates (Chandramouli2016Conformational).

SMYD2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including methylation, which influences its interaction with substrates such as the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Chandramouli2019Smyd2). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its functional properties (Yadav2021Novel).

## Function
SMYD2 (SET and MYND domain containing 2) is a histone methyltransferase that primarily targets lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36), a modification associated with actively transcribed genes. This methylation is linked to the recruitment of the Sin3 histone deacetylase complex, which includes HDAC1, and is involved in the deacetylation of coding regions of active genes, thereby repressing transcription and restraining cell proliferation (Brown2006Identification). SMYD2 also interacts with non-histone proteins, such as p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb), affecting their function. For instance, monomethylation of p53 at K370 reduces its ability to bind to promoter target genes, decreasing their expression, while methylation of Rb at K860 and K810 facilitates interactions that promote cell cycle progression (Sesé2013SMYD2).

In human embryonic stem cells, SMYD2 acts as a negative regulator of endodermal differentiation, with its knockdown leading to increased expression of endodermal genes. Conversely, overexpression of SMYD2 impairs the induction of endodermal and mesodermal genes, while enhancing ectodermal gene expression, indicating its role in regulating the balance of differentiation pathways (Sesé2013SMYD2). SMYD2 is expressed at higher levels in somatic cells compared to pluripotent cells and is regulated by the miR-302/367 cluster, which is downregulated upon neuronal differentiation, allowing SMYD2 expression (Sesé2013SMYD2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SMYD2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), germline variants in SMYD2, such as the rs2291830-T allele, are associated with poor clinical outcomes and reduced survival time in patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy (GalvánFemenía2018Genomic). Overexpression of SMYD2 is linked to poor prognosis in gastric cancer, where it promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Komatsu2014Overexpression). In pediatric B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high SMYD2 expression correlates with poor prognosis, higher white blood cell counts, and a higher percentage of high-risk cases (Zhang2019Overexpression).

SMYD2 is also involved in drug resistance mechanisms in cancers such as NSCLC and colon cancer, where its inhibition can reverse resistance to chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin and oxaliplatin (Padilla2023Targeting). In cervical cancer, SMYD2 overexpression is associated with enhanced glycolysis and poor prognosis, as it suppresses p53 activity, promoting cancer cell metabolism (Wang2021SMYD2). These findings suggest that SMYD2 could serve as a potential therapeutic target in various malignancies.

## Interactions
SMYD2 is a lysine methyltransferase that engages in various protein interactions, influencing cellular processes such as gene expression and protein function. It physically interacts with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), co-purifying with its core components EZH2 and SUZ12. This interaction is confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, which also show SMYD2's association with EED and RbAp48 in breast cancer cell lines (Zeng2019Regulation). SMYD2 directly interacts with EZH2, with its SET domain responsible for this interaction, suggesting that EZH2 could be a methylation target of SMYD2 (Zeng2019Regulation).

SMYD2 also interacts with the Sin3 histone deacetylase complex, particularly associating with HDAC1, linking its methyltransferase activity to transcriptional repression (Brown2006Identification). It binds to the molecular chaperone HSP90 and its cochaperone P23, with specific motifs crucial for these interactions. The interaction with HSP90 involves the C-terminal domain of HSP90 and the catalytic N-lobe of SMYD2, enhancing SMYD2's methylation activity on substrates like the estrogen receptor α (ERα) (Obermann2018A). SMYD2's interaction with p53 is significant, as it methylates p53 at lysine 370, affecting p53's transcriptional activity and stability (Chandramouli2019Smyd2).
