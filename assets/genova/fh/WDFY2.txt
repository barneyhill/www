# WDFY2

## Overview
WDFY2 is a gene that encodes the protein WD repeat and FYVE domain containing 2, which is involved in endosomal trafficking and cellular homeostasis. The protein is characterized by the presence of seven WD40 repeats and a FYVE domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) binding, respectively (Hayakawa2006The; Sneeggen2018WDFY2). This binding is crucial for the protein's localization to endosomal membranes, where it plays a significant role in endocytosis and endosomal sorting (Sneeggen2019WDFY2). WDFY2 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating the secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), thereby controlling extracellular matrix degradation and cell invasion, processes that are critical in preventing cancer metastasis (Sneeggen2019WDFY2; Sneeggen2018WDFY2). The gene's involvement in cancer biology, particularly through its interactions with proteins like VAMP3 and its role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Kannan2014CDKN2DWDFY2).

## Structure
The WDFY2 protein is characterized by its structural components, which include seven WD40 repeats and a FYVE domain. The WD40 repeats are predicted to form a beta-propeller structure with seven blades, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Hayakawa2006The; Sneeggen2018WDFY2). The FYVE domain is inserted between the sixth and seventh WD40 repeats and is crucial for binding phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), a phospholipid involved in endosomal membrane dynamics (Hayakawa2006The; Sneeggen2019WDFY2). This domain is essential for the protein's localization to endosomal membranes, where it plays a role in endocytosis and endosomal sorting (Sneeggen2019WDFY2).

The FYVE domain of WDFY2 contains a unique insertion at the N terminus of the membrane insertion loop, which may influence its binding properties and localization preferences (Hayakawa2006The). The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Hayakawa2006The). WDFY2 may also exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which could affect its function and localization, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Kannan2014CDKN2DWDFY2).

## Function
The WDFY2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in endosomal trafficking and cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, WDFY2 localizes to specific endosomal tubules, where it interacts with the v-SNARE protein VAMP3. This interaction is essential for retaining VAMP3 within endosomal tubules, preventing its redistribution to the plasma membrane and thereby regulating the secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) such as MT1-MMP. This regulation is vital for controlling extracellular matrix degradation and cell invasion, processes that are critical in preventing cancer metastasis (Sneeggen2019WDFY2; Sneeggen2018WDFY2).

WDFY2 is characterized by a FYVE domain, which binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), targeting the protein to specific endosomal membranes. This localization is crucial for its function in endosomal sorting and recycling processes, which are important for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Hayakawa2006The; Sneeggen2018WDFY2). The protein is involved in the early stages of endocytosis, marking a distinct class of early endosomes necessary for the initial stages of endocytic transport (Hayakawa2006The). Through these mechanisms, WDFY2 acts as a tumor suppressor by restraining excessive cell invasion and maintaining normal cellular functions (Sneeggen2019WDFY2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WDFY2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. WDFY2 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating the recycling of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are crucial for extracellular matrix degradation and cell invasion. Loss of WDFY2 function leads to increased secretion of MMPs, enhancing the invasive potential of cancer cells. This has been observed in various cancer cell lines, including prostate and breast cancer, where WDFY2 loss is associated with increased invasiveness and metastatic potential (Sneeggen2019WDFY2).

In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HG-SC), a recurrent fusion gene involving WDFY2, known as CDKN2D-WDFY2, has been identified. This fusion results in the loss of wildtype WDFY2 and the expression of a truncated WDFY2 protein, potentially altering the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is critical for cancer progression. The CDKN2D-WDFY2 fusion is present in approximately 20% of HG-SC tumors, highlighting its potential as a cancer-specific marker and therapeutic target (Kannan2014CDKN2DWDFY2).

These findings underscore the importance of WDFY2 in cancer biology and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. The frequent loss or alteration of WDFY2 in cancers suggests its critical role in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Interactions
WDFY2 interacts with the v-SNARE protein VAMP3, playing a crucial role in the regulation of endosomal recycling processes. This interaction is significant for the retention of VAMP3 in endosomal tubules, which in turn affects the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MT1-MMP. The binding of WDFY2 to VAMP3 is facilitated by the FYVE domain of WDFY2, which localizes to actin-stabilized endosomal tubules. This interaction is essential for controlling the sorting of VAMP3 into stable recycling tubules, thereby regulating the trafficking and secretion of MT1-MMP (Sneeggen2019WDFY2; Sneeggen2018WDFY2).

WDFY2 also interacts with proteins involved in actin organization, such as Coronin and WASH, as well as components of the retromer complex like VPS26 and VPS35. These interactions suggest a role for WDFY2 in the specific sorting of cargo within endosomal tubules, potentially influencing the recycling of endocytosed materials (Sneeggen2018WDFY2).

The interaction between WDFY2 and VAMP3 is further supported by GFP affinity purifications and western blotting, which confirm their colocalization on the same vesicles, indicating that VAMP3 resides on WDFY2-positive tubules (Sneeggen2019WDFY2).
