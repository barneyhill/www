# CCDC85C

## Overview
CCDC85C is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 85C protein, which is a member of the DUF2216 superfamily. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is primarily localized at cell-cell junctions, particularly in epithelial tissues (Hasan2022Expression; Mori2012Ccdc85c). The CCDC85C protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of tight and adherens junctions, and it is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and organ development (tanaka2015ccdc85c). It is also a significant regulator of the Hippo signaling pathway, interacting with YAP1 to influence neural progenitor cell maintenance and neurogenesis (tanaka2015ccdc85c). Alterations in CCDC85C expression have been linked to neurological conditions such as hydrocephalus and subcortical heterotopia, as well as the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its importance in both neurodevelopmental and oncological contexts (Hasan2022Expression; Guo2021KLF7VPS35).

## Structure
The CCDC85C protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions. In mice, the predicted Ccdc85C protein contains two coiled-coil domains located between Leu55-Cys91 and Trp133-Ala164. These domains include two leucine zipper motifs, LKDVNQRLQDDNQELCCFL at position 74 and LEARQEALL-RENLELKELVLLL at position 134, which are important for the protein's structural integrity (Mori2012Ccdc85c). A leucine-rich nuclear exporting signal, LELKELVLLL, is part of the zipper, but the protein lacks a nuclear localization signal (Mori2012Ccdc85c).

The CCDC85C protein is a member of the DUF2216 superfamily and contains a conserved uncharacterized domain in its N-terminal half, which shows high sequence homology to Ccdc85A, another member of the DUF superfamily (Mori2012Ccdc85c). The protein is primarily localized at cell-cell junctions, particularly in the apical membrane, and is associated with tight junctions and adherens junctions, suggesting its role in maintaining the structural integrity of these cellular components (Hasan2022Expression). The specific post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms of CCDC85C are not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The CCDC85C protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in epithelial tissues and organ development. It is expressed in systemic epithelia with proliferative activity, suggesting a role in cell proliferation and tissue development (tanaka2015ccdc85c). CCDC85C is localized at epithelial junctions, especially at the apical region, and may interact with cell adhesion molecules like p120-catenin, indicating a potential role in maintaining cell-cell junction integrity (tanaka2015ccdc85c). The protein is strongly expressed during early organ development and decreases as development progresses, except in the testes where it increases during sexual maturation (tanaka2015ccdc85c).

CCDC85C is associated with the Hippo pathway, interacting with YAP1, a major transcription factor involved in regulating organ development and cell proliferation. CCDC85C negatively regulates YAP1 by inhibiting its nuclear translocation through direct protein-protein interaction, suggesting its role in maintaining neural progenitor cells and neurogenesis (tanaka2015ccdc85c). The protein's expression is linked to the regulation of neural progenitor cells, as its absence leads to subcortical heterotopia due to YAP1 dysregulation (tanaka2015ccdc85c). These findings highlight the potential roles of CCDC85C in cell proliferation, organ development, and maintaining epithelial integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC85C gene have been implicated in several neurological conditions. CCDC85C is identified as a causative factor for hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. Disruption of CCDC85C expression in animal models, such as hhy mice and Ccdc85c knockout rats, leads to hydrocephalus and subcortical heterotopia, indicating its critical role in brain development and maintenance of ependymal cells lining the ventricles (Hasan2022Expression; Konishi2020Pathological).

In addition to its role in hydrocephalus, CCDC85C is involved in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The KLF7/VPS35/CCDC85C/β-catenin signaling axis is crucial for HCC progression, with CCDC85C being highly expressed in HCC patients. This overexpression is associated with poor overall and disease-free survival, suggesting that CCDC85C contributes to cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Guo2021KLF7VPS35).

Furthermore, a specific variant of CCDC85C (R300W) has been identified in autism research, although its direct association with autism spectrum disorder remains to be fully elucidated (Matsunami2014Identification). These findings highlight the gene's significance in both neurodevelopmental and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
CCDC85C is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCDC85C interacts with VPS35, a relationship that is crucial for the progression of HCC through the activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, mass spectrometry, and western blot analysis. The overexpression of VPS35 enhances cell growth and invasion, effects that can be partially reversed by knocking down CCDC85C, indicating its role in modulating these processes (Guo2021KLF7VPS35).

In the context of the Hippo signaling pathway, CCDC85C acts as a novel regulator of YAP, a transcriptional co-activator. CCDC85C localizes to tight junctions and binds to the WW domains of YAP, leading to its nuclear export and inhibition. This suggests that CCDC85C may compete with other proteins for binding to YAP, thereby integrating different signaling inputs from cell junctions (Moya2014Discovering).

CCDC85C is also associated with the ASPP/PP1 complex, where it interacts with PP1 through ASPP proteins. This interaction is facilitated by the coiled-coil domain of ASPP, which is necessary for recruiting CCDC85C to the complex (Bertran2019ASPP).
