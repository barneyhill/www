# DDX39B

## Overview
DDX39B is a gene that encodes the DExD-box helicase 39B protein, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family. This protein is characterized by its conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif and plays a pivotal role in RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA nuclear export. As an RNA helicase, DExD-box helicase 39B is integral to the early stages of spliceosome assembly and is involved in maintaining genome stability by unwinding RNA-DNA hybrids known as R-loops. The protein is a component of the human core transcription-export (TREX) complex, which is essential for mRNA export. DDX39B's interactions extend to various cellular pathways, including the modulation of inflammatory responses and cancer progression, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis and disease (Szymura2020DDX39B; PérezCalero2020UAP56DDX39B; Zhao2022DDX39B).

## Structure
The DDX39B protein, also known as UAP56, is a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. It contains two ATPase lobes, RecA1 and RecA2, which are crucial for its helicase activity. The RecA2 lobe is observed in structural studies, while the RecA1 lobe remains mobile in the absence of RNA and ATP (Pühringer2020Structure). DDX39B is involved in unwinding RNA-DNA hybrids, known as R-loops, across the genome, which is essential for maintaining genome stability (PérezCalero2020UAP56DDX39B).

The protein is part of the human core transcription-export (TREX) complex, forming a tetrameric assembly with other subunits, including THOC1, THOC2, THOC3, THOC5, THOC6, and THOC7 (Pühringer2020Structure). This complex facilitates mRNA export by binding multiple mRNA regions and maturation marks (Pühringer2020Structure). The THO-UAP56 complex's structure is stabilized by interactions between various subunits, including coiled coils and β-propeller domains (Pühringer2020Structure).

DDX39B may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these aspects are not provided in the context.

## Function
DDX39B, also known as DExD-box helicase 39B, is a crucial component in various RNA metabolic processes in healthy human cells. It functions as an RNA helicase involved in pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA nuclear export, playing a significant role in the early steps of spliceosome formation by interacting with U2AF2 and U1 snRNA at the 5' splice site (Nagasawa2024Inefficient). DDX39B is essential for the splicing of introns with C-rich polypyrimidine tracts, such as those found in the FOXP3 gene, which is critical for regulatory T cell function (Hirano2020The).

In addition to its role in RNA splicing, DDX39B is involved in maintaining genome stability by preventing the accumulation of harmful R loops, which are RNA-DNA hybrids that can cause DNA damage and replication stress (PérezCalero2020UAP56DDX39B). It acts as an RNA-DNA helicase, unwinding these R loops across the genome, particularly in highly transcribed regions, thus ensuring smooth transcription and replication processes (PérezCalero2020UAP56DDX39B).

DDX39B also modulates the cellular response to stress by interacting with the pattern recognition receptor pathway to inhibit NF-κB activity, thereby downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and attenuating the inflammatory response to endogenous double-stranded RNA (Szymura2020DDX39B). This function helps prevent chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DDX39B gene are linked to several diseases and conditions. In cancer, DDX39B is implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). In HCC, DDX39B is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, promoting cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and lipogenesis through interactions with SREBP1, a key regulator of lipid metabolism (Feng2023DDX39B). In CRC, DDX39B enhances tumor growth and metastasis by stabilizing PKM2, a glycolytic enzyme, and facilitating its nuclear translocation, which is crucial for oncogenic transcription (Zhao2022DDX39B).

DDX39B is also associated with a novel syndrome characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, short stature, and congenital hypotonia. This condition is linked to de novo and inherited variants in the DDX39B gene, which affect protein folding and function, potentially disrupting mRNA processing (Booth2023De). Additionally, DDX39B is involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility, where it interacts with the interleukin-7 receptor-α gene (IL7R) and influences the expression of immune-related genes, including FOXP3, which is crucial for regulatory T cell function (Hirano2020The).

## Interactions
DDX39B, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) pathway, specifically binding to LGP2, a member of the RIG-I-like receptor family. This interaction inhibits NF-κB activity by preventing the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit, which is essential for NF-κB activation (Szymura2020DDX39B).

In colorectal cancer, DDX39B interacts with PKM2, a key enzyme in glycolysis, stabilizing it by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is crucial for the nuclear translocation of PKM2, which enhances the transcription of oncogenes and glycolytic genes, contributing to cancer progression (Zhao2022DDX39B). DDX39B also binds to the pre-mRNA of CDK6 and CCND1, influencing their splicing and expression, which promotes cell cycle progression and proliferation in colorectal cancer cells (Zhang2022DDX39B).

DDX39B is involved in the assembly of the spliceosome and interacts with components of the TRanscription-EXport complex, such as ALYREF and THOC1, facilitating mRNA splicing and export (Zhao2022DDX39B). These interactions highlight DDX39B's multifaceted role in RNA processing and cancer biology.
