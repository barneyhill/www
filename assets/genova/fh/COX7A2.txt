# COX7A2

## Overview
COX7A2 is a gene that encodes the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7A2, a component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is a nuclear-encoded subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), which plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen, a process essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation. The cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7A2 is integral to the assembly and stabilization of the COX complex, contributing to its structural integrity and functional efficiency within the inner mitochondrial membrane (Čunátová2020Role). Additionally, COX7A2 is involved in the formation of mitochondrial supercomplexes, interacting with other subunits to modulate the activity of the COX complex and ensure efficient energy metabolism (Čunátová2020Role; FernándezVizarra2021SILACbased).

## Function
COX7A2 encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme complex, also known as Complex IV, is responsible for the final step in the electron transport chain, facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, resulting in the production of water. This process is essential for the generation of a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which drives ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation (Čunátová2020Role).

COX7A2 is a nuclear-encoded subunit that plays a role in the assembly and stabilization of the COX complex. It is involved in the regulation of COX activity, which is crucial for efficient ATP production and cellular energy metabolism. The subunit is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it contributes to the structural integrity and functional efficiency of the COX complex (Čunátová2020Role).

In healthy human cells, COX7A2 is part of the regulatory subunits that modulate the enzyme's activity, ensuring proper cellular respiration and energy production. Its expression and incorporation into the COX complex are vital for maintaining the balance of metabolic processes and supporting cellular functions (Fornuskova2010Novel).

## Interactions
COX7A2, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), is involved in the formation of mitochondrial supercomplexes by interacting with other cytochrome c oxidase subunits and complexes. It is recruited by supercomplex I1III2, forming a variant population of respirasomes (Čunátová2020Role). COX7A2 primarily co-segregates with the CIV monomer and dimer, as well as with the supercomplex I + III2 + IV, although to a lesser extent than its homolog COX7A2L/SCAFI (FernándezVizarra2021SILACbased).

In the context of cytochrome c oxidase assembly, COX7A2 is likely added to the assembly intermediate S3, indicating its role in the later stages of Complex IV assembly (Fornuskova2010Novel). Despite its involvement in these processes, specific physical interactions of COX7A2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts (Čunátová2020Role). The presence of COX7A2-containing respirasomes in similar amounts in both wild-type and SCAFI knockout cells suggests that COX7A2's interactions are stable and not significantly impacted by the absence of SCAFI (FernándezVizarra2021SILACbased).
