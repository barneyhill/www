# PRMT5

## Overview
Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a gene that encodes a type II protein arginine methyltransferase, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and various cellular processes. The PRMT5 protein is involved in the symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues on both histone and non-histone proteins, thereby influencing chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation (Stopa2015The; Karkhanis2011Versatility). Structurally, PRMT5 forms a hetero-octameric complex with MEP50, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other cellular components (Timm2018Cryoelectron). This complex is characterized by a unique assembly that facilitates its role in epigenetic regulation and RNA processing (Ho2013Structure). PRMT5's dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, making it a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Hing2023Dysregulation). Its involvement in critical cellular pathways underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a biomarker for disease progression (Xiao2019Role).

## Structure
The PRMT5 protein, in complex with MEP50, forms a hetero-octameric assembly with D2 symmetry, consisting of a core tetramer of PRMT5 subunits and peripheral MEP50 subunits (Timm2018Cryoelectron). PRMT5 contains an N-terminal TIM barrel domain and a methyltransferase domain, which includes a Rossmann fold and a C-terminal β-barrel (Timm2018Cryoelectron). The MEP50 subunit is composed of WD40 repeats forming a seven-bladed β-propeller structure (Timm2018Cryoelectron; Ho2013Structure).

The PRMT5-MEP50 complex is characterized by a substantial surface negative charge, which is essential for the methylation of histones H2A and H4 (Ho2013Structure). The catalytic site of PRMT5 is defined by specific residues, such as Glu431 and Glu440, which are involved in hydrogen bonding with SAH, indicating a potential post-catalysis state (Ho2013Structure). The complex's quaternary structure is stabilized by numerous interaction points, including salt bridges and conserved residues, forming a head-to-tail dimerization within the tetramer (Ho2013Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as lysine acetylation and serine phosphorylation, modulate PRMT5 activity, influencing substrate interactions and enzyme turnover (Ho2013Structure). These structural features and modifications are crucial for PRMT5's role in epigenetic regulation and its potential as a target for drug discovery (Timm2018Cryoelectron).

## Function
PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It catalyzes the symmetric dimethylation of arginine residues on histone and non-histone proteins, influencing chromatin structure and gene expression (Stopa2015The; Karkhanis2011Versatility). PRMT5 is involved in the methylation of histones H2AR3, H4R3, H3R2, and H3R8, which are crucial for transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Stopa2015The; Pal2004Human). It interacts with chromatin remodeling complexes like SWI/SNF and NuRD, affecting gene activation and repression (Stopa2015The; Pal2004Human).

PRMT5 also plays a critical role in RNA processing by methylating spliceosomal proteins, which is essential for proper mRNA splicing (Stopa2015The). It is involved in cell cycle regulation, influencing the G1-S transition and cell proliferation (Scoumanne2009PRMT5). PRMT5 regulates the expression of key proteins like p53 and eIF4E, impacting cell survival and proliferation (Scoumanne2009PRMT5).

In addition to its nuclear functions, PRMT5 is active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in processes like ribosomal assembly and signal transduction (Stopa2015The). Its activity is modulated by interactions with various proteins and post-translational modifications, highlighting its versatile role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Stopa2015The; Morales2016Biochemistry).

## Clinical Significance
PRMT5 (protein arginine methyltransferase 5) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and survival. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), PRMT5 is overexpressed and associated with disease progression to Richter's transformation (RT), a more aggressive form of lymphoma. This overexpression promotes proliferation and anti-apoptotic signaling, making PRMT5 a potential therapeutic target in CLL and RT (Hing2023Dysregulation). 

In skin cancer, particularly malignant melanoma, and colorectal cancer, PRMT5 mutations are prevalent and contribute to cancer progression. These mutations often result in increased histone de-methylation and cellular proliferation (Rasheed2023Protein). PRMT5 is also overexpressed in lung and breast cancers, where it influences tumor growth and metastasis. In lung cancer, it regulates fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and participates in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Xiao2019Role).

In hematological malignancies, PRMT5 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma and leukemia, promoting leukemic cell growth and being associated with decreased survival. Inhibitors targeting PRMT5 have shown potential in reducing cancer cell proliferation (Xiao2019Role). PRMT5's role in DNA repair and splicing also makes it a target for combination therapies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Hamard2018PRMT5).

## Interactions
PRMT5 is a protein arginine methyltransferase that engages in numerous interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, influencing various cellular processes. It forms a stable heterooctamer complex with MEP50, enhancing its histone methyltransferase activity, which is crucial for the methylation of spliceosomal proteins and histones (Stopa2015The). PRMT5 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), methylating it at R1175, which affects downstream signaling pathways like ERK, crucial for cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis (Karkhanis2011Versatility).

PRMT5 is involved in the methylation of histone arginine residues, such as H3R8 and H4R3, which leads to gene silencing. It interacts with the SWI/SNF complex and negatively regulates the transcription of growth inhibitory genes (Karkhanis2011Versatility). PRMT5 also forms complexes with MEP50 and is part of the NuRD complex, interacting with MBD2, which is methylated by PRMT5, affecting its binding to methylated DNA and influencing gene repression (Karkhanis2011Versatility).

PRMT5 interacts with substrate adaptors like pICln, RIOK1, and COPR5, which help recruit it to specific substrates for methylation. These interactions are mediated by a conserved peptide sequence known as the PRMT5 binding motif (PBM) (Mulvaney2020Molecular). PRMT5's interaction with mutant Jak2, common in leukemia, results in phosphorylation that impairs its ability to methylate histones (Stopa2015The).
