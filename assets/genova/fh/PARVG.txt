# PARVG

## Overview
PARVG, or parvin gamma, is a gene that encodes a member of the parvin family of proteins, which are integral to cellular processes involving actin binding and cell-matrix adhesion. The protein encoded by PARVG, known as parvin gamma, is categorized as a focal adhesion protein and is characterized by its two calponin homology (CH) domains that facilitate interaction with actin filaments. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cell shape and promoting cell motility, particularly through integrin-mediated pathways (Korenbaum2001Genomic; Sepulveda2005The). Parvin gamma is primarily expressed in lymphoid tissues and is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion, with notable expression in the heart, liver, and lung (Korenbaum2001Genomic). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants that may influence its function and localization in different tissues (Korenbaum2001Genomic). Despite its established roles in cellular adhesion and migration, the full spectrum of PARVG's functions in human health and disease remains an area of active research.

## Structure
PARVG, or parvin gamma, is a member of the parvin family of proteins, which are characterized by their actin-binding capabilities. The protein structure of PARVG includes two calponin homology (CH) domains, CH1 and CH2, located in the C-terminal region. These domains are crucial for its interaction with actin filaments (Korenbaum2001Genomic; Sepulveda2005The). The CH domains in parvins are separated by a linker of approximately 60 amino acids, which is a distinctive feature of this protein family (Sepulveda2005The).

The primary structure of PARVG shows a 42% identity and 67% similarity with PARVA, indicating a more distant relationship compared to other parvin family members (Sepulveda2005The). The N-terminal region of PARVG is variable and does not match known functional domains, except for a PxxP motif found in a- and b-parvins, which might represent an SH3 binding domain (Korenbaum2001Genomic).

PARVG undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple transcript variants. At least nine out of 64 human g-parvin related ESTs represent alternatively spliced transcripts, which may affect the protein's function and localization (Korenbaum2001Genomic). The expression of PARVG is developmentally regulated and is downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues (Korenbaum2001Genomic).

## Function
PARVG (parvin gamma) is a member of the parvin family of focal adhesion proteins, which are involved in actin binding and cell-matrix adhesion. In healthy human cells, PARVG plays a crucial role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, which are essential for maintaining cell shape and facilitating cell motility (Korenbaum2001Genomic; Bell2011CpG). PARVG is primarily expressed in lymphoid tissues and is associated with lymphatic organs and the digestive tract, with expression also noted in the heart, liver, and lung (Korenbaum2001Genomic).

The protein is active at focal adhesions, which are dynamic complexes where integrins connect the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton, influencing cellular signaling pathways (Korenbaum2001Genomic). PARVG's interaction with integrin signaling-related proteins, such as a4-integrin, promotes cell migration and spreading, particularly in leukocytes (Bell2011CpG). The presence of alternatively spliced and polyadenylated gene products suggests that PARVG may have diverse functional roles in different tissues (Korenbaum2001Genomic). Despite its involvement in these critical cellular processes, the specific functions of PARVG in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
PARVG (parvin gamma) is known to interact with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) as part of the ILK-PINCH-parvin (IPP) complex. This complex is crucial for integrin-containing adhesion sites, where ILK acts as both a kinase and an adaptor. The interaction between ILK and parvin-γ induces ILK kinase activity, which is significant for its role in cancer biology, where ILK can function as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor (Cabodi2010Integrin). 

PARVG is also involved in biological adhesion processes, as indicated by its interaction with the lncRNA ENST00000433673. This lncRNA binds to PARVG mRNA with a strong binding potential, suggesting a regulatory role in embryo adhesion and invasion (Li2019Preliminary). 

The expression of PARVG is noted to be downregulated in certain cancers, and it is associated with lymphatic organs and the digestive tract (Korenbaum2001Genomic). The genomic organization of PARVG includes 14 exons, with the first two introns splitting the 5' UTR, and it is located on chromosome 22, about 12 kb downstream of the b-parvin gene (PARVB) (Korenbaum2001Genomic).
