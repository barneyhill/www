# EIF2B5

## Overview
EIF2B5 is a gene that encodes the epsilon subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, a critical component in the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The eIF2B complex functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on the eIF2 protein, which is essential for the initiation of mRNA translation (Gomez2000Identification; Sidrauski2015Pharmacological). The protein encoded by EIF2B5, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B subunit epsilon, plays a pivotal role in the catalytic activity of the eIF2B complex, interacting with other subunits to modulate its function (Gomez2000Identification; Merrick2018Protein). This protein is particularly important under stress conditions, where it helps regulate protein synthesis by responding to changes in cellular environments. Mutations in EIF2B5 are linked to leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM), a disorder characterized by progressive neurological decline (Nourmohammadi2023A).

## Function
The EIF2B5 gene encodes the epsilon subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, which is crucial for protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. eIF2B functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on the eIF2 protein. This exchange is essential for the formation of the eIF2•GTP•Met-tRNAi ternary complex, a critical step in the initiation of mRNA translation (Gomez2000Identification; Sidrauski2015Pharmacological).

EIF2B5, as part of the eIF2B complex, plays a significant role in regulating protein synthesis, particularly under stress conditions. During cellular stress, eIF2 is phosphorylated, which inhibits its interaction with eIF2B, thereby reducing protein synthesis. However, the small molecule ISRIB can activate eIF2B even in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2, enhancing protein synthesis by stabilizing eIF2B dimers (Sidrauski2015Pharmacological).

The eIF2B complex, including EIF2B5, is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell growth and survival by modulating protein production. The epsilon subunit, specifically, is involved in the catalytic activity of the complex, interacting with other subunits to facilitate its function (Gomez2000Identification; Merrick2018Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EIF2B5 gene are associated with leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM), a rare genetic disorder affecting the central nervous system. VWM is characterized by progressive neurological deterioration, cerebellar ataxia, spasticity, and optic atrophy, with symptoms often exacerbated by stress (Nourmohammadi2023A). The disease shows a wide range of severity, from severe forms starting in early infancy to milder forms beginning in adolescence or adulthood (van2010Genotype–phenotype). 

The most common mutation in EIF2B5 is p.Arg113His, which is associated with a milder phenotype, particularly in the homozygous state, leading to adulthood onset and a protracted disease course (van2010Genotype–phenotype). This mutation is prevalent in 76.2% of cases (Kong2022Association). Other mutations, such as p.Arg195His, are linked to more severe phenotypes with early onset and early death (van2006Vanishing).

The pathophysiology of VWM involves impaired activity of eIF2B, leading to cellular stress responses and activation of the unfolded-protein response, particularly affecting glial cells like oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (van2006Vanishing). These mutations result in decreased eIF2B activity, making glial cells particularly vulnerable to stress, which contributes to the disease's progression (van2006Vanishing).

## Interactions
EIF2B5, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) complex, plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on eIF2. This process is essential for translation initiation. EIF2B5 interacts with other subunits of the eIF2B complex, particularly eIF2Be and eIF2Bg, to perform its function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (Jennings2013eIF2B). The eIF2Be subunit is the major interaction site for eIF2, and its C-terminal domain is critical for GEF activity. However, full guanine nucleotide dissociation factor (GDF) activity requires the combined action of eIF2Be and eIF2Bg (Jennings2013eIF2B).

EIF2B5 is also involved in regulatory interactions under stress conditions. In hypoxic cancer cells, the retention of intron 12 in the EIF2B5 gene leads to a truncated isoform of eIF2Bε, which lacks the GEF domain and a region required for interaction with eIF2α. This truncated isoform is hypothesized to inhibit translation, providing a survival advantage to cancer cells under hypoxic conditions (Brady2017Transcriptome). The expression of this isoform is influenced by the splicing factor SRSF3 and is associated with increased phosphorylation of Ser2-RNAPII at intron 12 (Brady2017Transcriptome).
