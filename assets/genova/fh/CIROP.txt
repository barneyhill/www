# CIROP

## Overview
The CIROP gene encodes the ciliated left-right organizer metallopeptidase, a protein that plays a crucial role in the development of left-right asymmetry in vertebrates. This protein is categorized as a metallopeptidase, which is a type of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in proteins, utilizing a metal ion in the catalytic process. The ciliated left-right organizer metallopeptidase is involved in the regulation of ciliary function, which is essential for the proper establishment of the left-right axis during embryonic development. Disruptions in the function of this protein can lead to abnormalities in organ positioning and other developmental defects. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their significant implications in developmental biology and potential links to congenital disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
