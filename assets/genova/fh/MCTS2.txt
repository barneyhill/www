# MCTS2

## Overview
MCTS2 is a gene that encodes the protein MCTS family member 2, which plays a crucial role in the process of translation re-initiation in mammalian cells. This protein is part of a heterodimeric complex with the density-regulated protein (DENR), facilitating the recruitment and release of tRNA from the ribosomal P-site, thereby enabling re-initiation at upstream open reading frames (uORFs) (Meurs2024Anin). Although MCTS2 was once considered a pseudogene, it is now recognized for its functional expression and ability to form active protein complexes with DENR, potentially substituting for its paralog MCTS1 in certain biological contexts (Meurs2024Anin). The MCTS2-DENR complex exhibits functional redundancy with the MCTS1-DENR complex, as evidenced by its ability to rescue re-initiation activity in Denr knockout extracts (Meurs2024Anin). MCTS2 is co-expressed with MCTS1 in various tissues, including the mouse liver and kidney, although its expression is variable across different cell types (Meurs2024Anin).

## Function
MCTS2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in translation re-initiation, a process distinct from canonical initiation and termination. MCTS2 forms a heterodimeric complex with DENR, similar to its paralog MCTS1, and is involved in recruiting and releasing tRNA from the ribosomal P-site, facilitating re-initiation at upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in mammalian cells (Meurs2024Anin). Despite being previously considered a pseudogene, MCTS2 is expressed at relevant levels and forms functional protein complexes with DENR in vivo, suggesting it can substitute for MCTS1 in certain contexts (Meurs2024Anin).

The MCTS2-DENR complex has been shown to rescue re-initiation activity in Denr knockout extracts, indicating potential redundancy in function with MCTS1-DENR (Meurs2024Anin). Structural data suggest that MCTS2-specific amino acid changes do not affect its interaction with DENR or the 40S ribosomal subunit, supporting its role in translation re-initiation (Meurs2024Anin). MCTS2 is co-expressed with MCTS1 in various tissues, such as the mouse liver and kidney, although its expression is undetectable in certain human myeloid lineage cells, indicating variability across different tissues (Meurs2024Anin).

## Interactions
MCTS2 is known to interact with the protein DENR, forming a heterodimeric complex similar to the MCTS1-DENR complex. This interaction suggests that MCTS2 can serve as an alternative partner to DENR, which is involved in translation re-initiation processes. The MCTS2-DENR complex has been shown to have similar activity to the MCTS1-DENR complex in promoting translation re-initiation, indicating potential functional redundancy between these complexes (Meurs2024Anin).

MCTS2 was identified as a copurifying protein with DENR through coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, supporting the formation of MCTS2-DENR complexes. Structural data suggest that MCTS2-specific amino acid changes do not affect its interaction surface with the 40S ribosome, implying that MCTS2-DENR can interact with the ribosome in a manner similar to MCTS1-DENR (Meurs2024Anin).

MCTS2 is expressed significantly in NIH/3T3 cells and is co-expressed with MCTS1 in mouse liver and kidney, suggesting it is a broadly expressed paralog. This expression pattern may explain discrepancies in phenotypes observed in Mcts1 versus Denr knockout studies, highlighting the importance of MCTS2 in cellular processes (Meurs2024Anin).
