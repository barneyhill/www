# CS

## Overview
Citrate synthase (CS) is a gene that encodes the enzyme citrate synthase, a pivotal component of the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. This enzyme is classified as a lyase and is located in the mitochondrial matrix, where it catalyzes the condensation of oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to form citrate, marking the first committed step of the cycle. The activity of citrate synthase is crucial for cellular respiration and energy production, as it facilitates the complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA, leading to ATP generation. The enzyme's function is tightly regulated by substrate availability and feedback inhibition by its products, ensuring metabolic balance within the cell (Małecki2017Uncovering; Iacobazzi2014Citrate). Additionally, citrate synthase is subject to post-translational modifications, such as methylation, which modulate its activity and interactions with other mitochondrial enzymes, highlighting its role in complex regulatory networks within cellular metabolism (Małecki2017Uncovering).

## Structure
Citrate synthase (CS) is a key enzyme in the citric acid cycle, characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of citrate synthase consists of 437 amino acid residues per subunit (Wiegand1986CITRATE). The secondary structure is predominantly alpha-helical, with 75% of the residues forming 20 alpha-helical segments and a small beta-sheet composed of 13 residues (Wiegand1986CITRATE). 

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional shape, with the subunit divided into two domains: a larger domain with 15 helices and a smaller domain with five helices. The larger domain forms a twisted eight-helical sandwich, featuring bent antiparallel helices (Wiegand1986CITRATE). 

In terms of quaternary structure, citrate synthase typically exists as a homodimer, with two identical subunits interacting through antiparallel helices (Wiegand1986CITRATE). The enzyme undergoes conformational changes upon substrate binding, transitioning between open and closed forms, which involves an 18-degree rotation of the small domain relative to the large domain (Wiegand1986CITRATE). 

The active site of citrate synthase is located in the cleft between the two domains of one subunit, characterized by a polar environment with specific interactions involving hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Wiegand1986CITRATE).

## Function
Citrate synthase (CS) is a crucial enzyme in the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle, which is a key metabolic pathway for energy production in cells. Located in the mitochondrial matrix, CS catalyzes the first committed and irreversible step of the cycle by condensing oxaloacetate (OAA) with acetyl-CoA to form citrate and CoA. This reaction is essential for cellular respiration, as it initiates the series of reactions that lead to the complete oxidation of acetyl-CoA, ultimately producing ATP, the primary energy currency of the cell (Małecki2017Uncovering; Iacobazzi2014Citrate).

CS activity is regulated by the availability of its substrates, acetyl-CoA and OAA, and is inhibited by its product, citrate, as well as succinyl-CoA. This regulation ensures that the enzyme's activity is aligned with the cell's metabolic needs (Małecki2017Uncovering). In addition to its role in energy production, CS activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as lysine methylation by the mitochondrial methyltransferase METTL12. This methylation occurs at Lys-395, a site within the enzyme's active site, and results in a reduction of CS activity, linking its function to metabolic changes within the cell (Małecki2017Uncovering).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the citrate synthase (CS) gene have been linked to cancer progression and malignancy. The loss of CS expression is associated with a metabolic shift from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, a hallmark of the Warburg effect, which is commonly observed in cancer cells. This shift results in increased tumor cell proliferation and metastasis, as demonstrated in various cancer cell lines, including cervical carcinoma cells (Lin2012Loss). The knockdown of CS expression leads to impaired mitochondrial function, reduced ATP production, and increased glycolysis, which are linked to enhanced tumor growth and malignancy (Lin2012Loss).

The study also highlights the role of CS in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that contributes to cancer metastasis. CS knockdown induces EMT by downregulating epithelial markers and upregulating mesenchymal markers, thereby increasing cell migration and invasion (Lin2012Loss). These findings suggest that alterations in CS expression can significantly impact cancer progression by promoting metabolic reprogramming and enhancing malignant characteristics (Lin2012Loss). The research indicates that targeting CS expression or its metabolic pathways could be a potential strategy for cancer therapy.

## Interactions
Citrate synthase (CS) is involved in several protein-protein interactions within the mitochondrial matrix, playing a crucial role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. CS forms specific complexes with malate dehydrogenase (MDH), facilitating substrate channeling of oxaloacetate between these enzymes. This interaction is modulated by various metabolites, such as acetyl-CoA and NAD+, which enhance the binding affinity, while products like NADH and citrate decrease it. The interaction is influenced by the conformational state of CS, with the closed conformation favoring MDH binding (Halper1977Interaction; Omini2021Association).

CS also interacts with thiolase, another mitochondrial matrix enzyme, indicating a pattern of specific enzyme-enzyme interactions that are important for metabolic processes like the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation (Sumegi1985Interaction). Additionally, CS can form solid-state multienzyme complexes with MDH, which enhance catalytic efficiency by allowing direct transfer of intermediates (Datta1985Substrate).

The methylation of CS by the mitochondrial methyltransferase METTL12 at lysine-368 may regulate interactions within these metabolons, suggesting a role in the regulation of the TCA cycle (Rhein2017Human). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving CS in mitochondrial metabolism.
