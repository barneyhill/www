# ORMDL3

## Overview
ORMDL3, or ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is a member of the ORMDL family and plays a critical role in the regulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis and calcium signaling within cells. The ORMDL3 protein interacts with key enzymes and proteins, such as the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex and the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump, to modulate sphingolipid homeostasis and calcium dynamics, respectively (Hjelmqvist2002ORMDL; CanteroRecasens2009The). Dysregulation of ORMDL3 has been implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including asthma, where it influences immune responses and airway remodeling (Ma2018ORMDL3). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathogenesis.

## Structure
The ORMDL3 protein is a member of the ORMDL family, characterized by its conserved transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein (Hjelmqvist2002ORMDL). The protein's structure includes a crucial N-terminal region that plays a significant role in its biological activity, particularly in the regulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis (Jin2011Characterization). This N-terminal region forms polar interactions with components of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex, stabilizing the structure and contributing to the inhibition of SPT activity (Xie2023Ceramide).

The ORMDL3 protein can form complexes with other proteins, such as the SPT complex, which is essential for its function in sphingolipid homeostasis. The interaction with ceramide, a central sphingolipid metabolite, induces conformational changes in ORMDL3, locking its N-terminus into an inhibitory conformation (Xie2023Ceramide). The protein's structure is further defined by specific residues, such as Asn13, which are critical for ceramide binding and the regulation of enzymatic activity (Xie2023Ceramide).

A novel isoform of ORMDL3, known as ORMDL3 V1, has been identified, which lacks the second exon of the wild-type gene, resulting in a protein with a truncated N-terminus (Jin2011Characterization). This splicing variant highlights the structural diversity within the ORMDL3 gene products.

## Function
ORMDL3 is a transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that plays a crucial role in regulating calcium signaling and sphingolipid biosynthesis. It modulates ER-mediated calcium homeostasis by interacting with the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump, which is responsible for replenishing ER calcium stores. Overexpression of ORMDL3 has been shown to decrease the activity of the SERCA pump, leading to reduced ER calcium concentration and increased cytosolic calcium levels (CanteroRecasens2009The).

ORMDL3 also influences store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and lymphocyte activation. It affects the translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) to the nucleus, which is essential for T-cell activation. ORMDL3 overexpression reduces NFAT nuclear translocation and the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a marker of T-cell activation (CarrerasSureda2012ORMDL3).

In addition to its role in calcium signaling, ORMDL3 is involved in the regulation of sphingolipid synthesis. It mediates feedback inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase, the enzyme initiating sphingolipid biosynthesis, to maintain sphingolipid homeostasis. This regulation is vital for preventing the accumulation of bioactive sphingolipid metabolites that can interfere with physiological processes (Clarke2019The).

## Clinical Significance
The ORMDL3 gene has been implicated in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Alterations in ORMDL3 expression are associated with asthma, where increased expression is linked to airway remodeling, smooth muscle proliferation, and enhanced IgE levels, contributing to asthma pathogenesis (Ma2018ORMDL3). Genetic polymorphisms in the ORMDL3 locus, particularly within the 17q21 region, have been associated with childhood asthma across different ethnic groups (Ma2018ORMDL3). ORMDL3 is also involved in the regulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis, and its dysregulation can affect immune responses, contributing to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and type 1 diabetes (Hsu2013Functional).

In addition to asthma, ORMDL3 has been linked to other inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the ORMDL3 region, such as rs7216389 and rs9303277, have been identified as significant in regulating ORMDL3 expression and associated with disease risk (Ma2018ORMDL3). The gene's role in modulating store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and lymphocyte activation further implicates it in immune system dysregulation, which is a common feature in these diseases (CarrerasSureda2012ORMDL3).

## Interactions
ORMDL3 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes related to calcium signaling and sphingolipid biosynthesis. One of the primary interactions of ORMDL3 is with the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump (SERCA). ORMDL3 binds to and inhibits SERCA, which reduces the calcium content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and affects calcium homeostasis (Ma2018ORMDL3; CanteroRecasens2009The). This interaction is crucial for modulating ER-mediated calcium signaling and is linked to the unfolded protein response (UPR) (CanteroRecasens2009The).

ORMDL3 also interacts with serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. ORMDL3 forms a complex with SPT, regulating its activity and thus influencing sphingolipid metabolism (Siow2015ORMDLserine; Paulenda2016The). This interaction is significant in the context of inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, where sphingolipid levels are critical (Paulenda2016The).

Additionally, ORMDL3 is involved in interactions at the ER-mitochondria contact sites, affecting mitochondrial calcium uptake and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), which are essential for T-cell activation and immune responses (CarrerasSureda2012ORMDL3). These interactions highlight ORMDL3's role as a key regulator in calcium signaling and immune function.
