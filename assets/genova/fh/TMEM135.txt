# TMEM135

## Overview
TMEM135, or transmembrane protein 135, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in several essential cellular processes, including mitochondrial dynamics, energy homeostasis, and calcium signaling. The protein plays a pivotal role in regulating mitochondrial fission and fusion, which are critical for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. TMEM135 interacts with key proteins such as dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) to facilitate mitochondrial fission, thereby influencing energy production and cellular metabolism (Beasley2021TMEM135; Hu2023TMEM135). Beyond its mitochondrial functions, TMEM135 is also implicated in lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport, highlighting its broad role in cellular homeostasis. The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic and age-related diseases, with mutations in TMEM135 linked to conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and obesity (Landowski2020Modulation; Hu2023TMEM135).

## Structure


## Function
TMEM135, also known as transmembrane protein 135, is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in mitochondrial dynamics and energy homeostasis. It plays a significant role in regulating mitochondrial fission and fusion, processes essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function. TMEM135 interacts with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) to facilitate mitochondrial fission, which is crucial for mitochondrial fragmentation and energy production (Beasley2021TMEM135; Hu2023TMEM135).

In addition to its role in mitochondrial dynamics, TMEM135 is involved in maintaining calcium homeostasis, which is vital for mitochondrial energy metabolism. It regulates calcium flux and interacts with proteins involved in calcium signaling, impacting processes such as stress responses and cardiac health (Beasley2021TMEM135). TMEM135 also plays a role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the oxidation of long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acids in peroxisomes, and is involved in cholesterol transport and distribution within cells (Beasley2021TMEM135; Maharjan2020TMEM135).

TMEM135's activity is not limited to mitochondria; it is also found in peroxisomes, the nucleus, and other cellular structures, indicating its broad role in cellular homeostasis and function (Beasley2021TMEM135). Its involvement in these processes highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for metabolic and age-related diseases.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TMEM135 gene have been linked to a variety of diseases and conditions. In the context of retinal health, TMEM135 mutations, such as the Tmem135 FUN025 mutation, lead to retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) degeneration and photoreceptor cell degeneration, which are associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Landowski2020Modulation; Landowski2022A). These mutations result in disrupted lipid metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics, contributing to visual deficits and structural abnormalities in the retina (Landowski2022A).

In metabolic disorders, TMEM135 plays a significant role in regulating mitochondrial fission and energy homeostasis in brown adipose tissue. Overexpression of TMEM135 enhances thermogenesis and reduces diet-induced obesity, while its knockout impairs these processes, leading to increased obesity and insulin resistance (Hu2023TMEM135). A specific TMEM135 mutation (G369E) is associated with increased body mass index (BMI) in certain populations, indicating a potential link to obesity (Hu2023TMEM135).

TMEM135 is also implicated in cardiac pathologies, where its overexpression leads to cardiac hypertrophy and mitochondrial fragmentation (Landowski2024Roles). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance in various age-related and metabolic diseases.

## Interactions
TMEM135 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in mitochondrial dynamics and energy homeostasis. It interacts with DRP1, a key protein in mitochondrial fission, promoting DRP1-dependent fission through potential post-transcriptional modifications (Lee2016Mouse). TMEM135 also interacts with AKAP1, facilitating PKA-dependent phosphorylation of DRP1, which is essential for mitochondrial fission (Hu2023TMEM135). This interaction network is significant for the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, particularly in brown adipose tissue.

TMEM135 is also linked to calcium signaling, interacting with Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (SMPD3), which is involved in calcium signaling and ceramide synthesis (Beasley2021TMEM135). This interaction suggests a role for TMEM135 in modulating calcium dynamics within cells.

In the context of primary ciliogenesis, TMEM135 interacts with Rab8, a master regulator of ciliary protein trafficking. TMEM135 affects Rab8's trafficking to the centrioles, which is crucial for ciliogenesis (Maharjan2020TMEM135). These interactions highlight TMEM135's involvement in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins.
