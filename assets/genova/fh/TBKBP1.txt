# TBKBP1

## Overview
TBKBP1 (TANK-binding kinase 1 binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes the TBK1 binding protein 1, an adaptor protein integral to various cellular signaling pathways, particularly those involved in immune response and autophagy. The protein plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of TBK1, a kinase crucial for immune signaling, by enhancing its phosphorylation, which is essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This function is particularly significant in the context of viral infections, where it amplifies the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells. Additionally, TBKBP1 is involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process vital for cellular homeostasis, by influencing the mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of Ulk1. The protein's interactions with other components of the immune signaling pathways, such as IKKi and the TBK1 core complex, underscore its role in antiviral immunity and type-I interferon production. Mutations in the TBKBP1 gene have been linked to autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in diseases such as multiple sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (Ryzhakov2007SINTBAD; Zhu2018TBKbinding; Yu2024DNA; Broce2018Immunerelated).

## Function
TBKBP1 (TBK1 binding protein 1) is a crucial adaptor protein involved in several cellular signaling pathways, particularly those regulating immune responses and autophagy. In healthy human cells, TBKBP1 plays a significant role in modulating the activity of TBK1, a kinase involved in immune signaling. It enhances TBK1 phosphorylation, which is essential for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thereby amplifying the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells, especially in the context of viral infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Yu2024DNA).

TBKBP1 is also involved in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and survival. It facilitates autophagy by antagonizing mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of Ulk1, a key autophagy-initiating kinase, thereby promoting its activation. This process is particularly important in natural killer T (NKT) cells, where TBKBP1 is essential for IL-15-induced autophagy and survival, as it helps maintain mitochondrial function and regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Zhu2018TBKbinding).

Through these mechanisms, TBKBP1 contributes to the regulation of immune cell development and function, influencing the balance of NKT cell subpopulations and enhancing the antiviral capabilities of CD8+ T cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TBKBP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a study identified the TBKBP1 gene as relevant for MS susceptibility through a multi-step genomic approach. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs4267364, rs8070463, and rs67919208 were associated with changes in TBKBP1 expression and methylation, suggesting a role in MS pathogenesis (Sorosina2022A). The SNP rs8070463 has also been linked to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) severity in the Chinese Han population, indicating a potential genetic marker for AS susceptibility and severity (Lian2013Analysis).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, TBKBP1 has been associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is involved in immune-related genetic factors and modulates TNF-alpha signaling by binding to TBK1. This interaction is significant as rare pathogenic variants in TBK1 are known to cause FTD-ALS, highlighting a genetic overlap between FTD and immune-mediated diseases (Broce2018Immunerelated). These findings underscore the importance of TBKBP1 in the pathogenesis of various diseases through its influence on gene expression, methylation, and immune signaling pathways.

## Interactions
TBKBP1, also known as SINTBAD, is a protein that interacts with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKi, but not with IKKa or IKKb. It shares a TBK1-binding domain (TBD) with other adaptor proteins such as NAP1 and TANK, which are crucial for the activation of IRF3 in response to viral infections. These interactions form part of the innate antiviral immunity pathway, linking TBK1 and IKKi to virus-activated signaling cascades (Ryzhakov2007SINTBAD).

TBKBP1 is involved in the formation of multiprotein complexes that are essential for efficient IRF induction. The binding of TBKBP1 to TBK1 and IKKi is mediated by a conserved α-helix in the TBD, and specific mutations in this domain can affect binding affinity, thereby influencing the activation of IRF signaling pathways (Ryzhakov2007SINTBAD).

In addition to its role in antiviral signaling, TBKBP1 is part of the TBK1 core complex, which includes other proteins such as DDX3X and TANK. This complex is involved in the regulation of type-I interferon production, highlighting TBKBP1's role in modulating immune responses (Soulat2008The).
