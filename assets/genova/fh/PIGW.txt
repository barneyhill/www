# PIGW

## Overview
The PIGW gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class W protein, which is an inositol acyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. These anchors are critical for attaching various proteins to the cell membrane, playing essential roles in cellular processes such as signal transduction and cell-cell interactions. The PIGW protein is characterized by its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum and its structure, which includes multiple transmembrane domains. It facilitates the acylation of the inositol ring in the GPI precursor, a key step in GPI-anchor maturation. Mutations in the PIGW gene can lead to disorders such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis defect 11 and hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Murakami2003PIGW; Wu2020The; Peron2020PIGW‐related).

## Structure
The PIGW protein is involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors and is encoded by the PIGW gene. It is a 504-amino-acid protein that functions as an inositol acyltransferase, crucial for the acylation of the inositol ring in GPI biosynthesis (Wu2020The; Murakami2003PIGW). The protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, consistent with its role in GPI biosynthesis (Murakami2003PIGW).

The PIGW protein is predicted to have multiple hydrophobic regions, suggesting the presence of 13 transmembrane domains, which are important for its function and are conserved across species (Murakami2003PIGW). The membrane orientation of PIGW indicates that the N terminus is luminally oriented while the C terminus is cytoplasmically oriented, suggesting that its acyltransferase activity occurs on the luminal side of the membrane (Murakami2003PIGW).

The protein does not share significant sequence homology with other proteins but has six well-conserved regions across different species, indicating its functional importance (Murakami2003PIGW). The molecular structure of PIGW includes mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrameric forms, as inferred from SDS-PAGE analysis (Murakami2003PIGW).

## Function
The PIGW gene encodes an inositol acyltransferase that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors in mammalian cells. This enzyme is responsible for the acylation of the inositol ring in the GPI precursor, a crucial step for the proper surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins (Murakami2003PIGW; Liu2021A). The PIGW protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it facilitates the transfer of an acyl chain, typically palmitate, from palmitoyl-CoA to the inositol ring of GlcN-PI, forming GlcN-(acyl)PI (Murakami2003PIGW; Maeda2011Structural).

This acylation process is essential for the maturation and function of GPI-anchored proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell-cell interactions (Wu2020The). Although inositol acylation is not required for the flipping of the GPI-anchor within the ER, it is crucial for the subsequent addition of bridging phosphoethanolamine to the third mannose, which is necessary for anchoring proteins to the cell membrane (Murakami2003PIGW; Wu2020The). Deficiencies in PIGW function can lead to impaired GPI-AP expression and are associated with certain genetic disorders (Wu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGW gene are associated with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis defect 11, a condition that falls under the spectrum of congenital disorders of glycosylation. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, epileptic seizures, and distinctive facial features, with significant clinical variability among affected individuals (Peron2020PIGW‐related). Patients with PIGW mutations often present with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, including West syndrome, which is marked by clusters of tonic spasms and a high-amplitude hypsarrhythmic pattern on EEG (Chiyonobu2013Glycosylphosphatidylinositol). 

Hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS), also known as Mabry syndrome, is another condition linked to PIGW mutations. It is characterized by elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, intellectual disability, and seizures (Thompson2024Rare; Knaus2018Characterization). The PIGW gene encodes an inositol acyltransferase crucial for the initial stages of GPI anchor synthesis, and mutations can disrupt this process, leading to the clinical manifestations observed in these syndromes (Thompson2024Rare; Peron2020PIGW‐related). The variability in phenotypic expression suggests that PIGW-related disorders may involve complex interactions with other genetic and environmental factors (Knaus2018Characterization).
