# UCP2

## Overview
UCP2 (uncoupling protein 2) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein belonging to the mitochondrial solute carrier family. This protein is characterized by its role as a transmembrane transporter, facilitating the movement of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. UCP2 is involved in the regulation of energy balance and metabolism by dissipating the proton gradient, which reduces ATP production and generates heat, a process known as mild uncoupling. This function is crucial for decreasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage. UCP2 is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, thymus, pancreatic β-cells, heart, lung, and white adipose tissue, and plays a significant role in modulating insulin secretion and lipid metabolism (Mattiasson2006The; Brand2005Physiological; Diano2012Mitochondrial).

## Structure
The structure of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) has been studied using various methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics simulations. UCP2 is a member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family and is characterized by six transmembrane helices that form a channel facilitating proton transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Škulj2021Molecular; Berardi2011Mitochondrial).

The tertiary structure of UCP2 has been determined using NMR, revealing a resemblance to the bovine ADP/ATP carrier but with distinct helical segment orientations, resulting in a wider opening on the matrix side of the inner membrane (Berardi2011Mitochondrial). The NMR structure was determined in the presence of GDP, which binds inside the channel near transmembrane helices 1-4 (Berardi2011Mitochondrial).

UCP2 can form tetramers in lipid membranes, which are functional in proton transport. These tetramers are described as dimers of dimers, with stronger interactions within dimers than between them (Ardalan2018Experimental). The tetrameric form is stabilized by electrostatic interactions and potentially by non-specific protein-lipid interactions (Ardalan2018Experimental).

Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that UCP2 is almost water impermeable due to a salt bridge network at the matrix side, involving arginine/lysine and aspartate/glutamate residues (Škulj2021Molecular). The UCP2 structure also allows ATP binding to arginine residues within its cavity (Škulj2021Molecular).

## Function
UCP2 (uncoupling protein 2) is a mitochondrial protein that plays a significant role in regulating energy balance and metabolism in human cells. It functions by dissipating the proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane, which reduces ATP production and generates heat. This process, known as mild uncoupling, helps to decrease the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage (Mattiasson2006The; Brand2005Physiological).

UCP2 is expressed in various tissues, including the spleen, thymus, pancreatic β-cells, heart, lung, and white adipose tissue, with lesser amounts in the brain, kidney, liver, and muscle (Mattiasson2006The). In pancreatic β-cells, UCP2 modulates insulin secretion by affecting the mitochondrial proton motive force, which influences the ATP/ADP ratio and the closure of K ATP channels, ultimately impacting insulin release (Mattiasson2006The).

UCP2 is also involved in lipid metabolism, promoting fatty acid oxidation over glucose utilization, which is particularly relevant during fasting (Diano2012Mitochondrial). Its activity is influenced by factors such as free fatty acids and superoxide anions, and it is thought to be induced as a protective response to cellular stress (Mattiasson2006The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the UCP2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), UCP2 negatively regulates insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells, as its activity decreases ATP production from glucose metabolism, impairing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This is supported by studies showing that UCP2 overexpression suppresses insulin secretion, while UCP2 knockout mice exhibit increased insulin secretion and improved beta cell function (Mattiasson2006The; Souza2011The). 

UCP2 polymorphisms, such as -866G/A, Ala55Val, and Ins/Del, have been associated with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in T2DM patients. These polymorphisms are linked to decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and increased risk for DKD, with the mutated UCP2 haplotype (-866A/55Val/Ins) associated with lower eGFR and decreased UCP2 gene expression in the kidney (Souza2015Polymorphisms).

In neurodegenerative diseases, UCP2 plays a neuroprotective role by reducing oxidative stress and protecting neurons, as seen in models of Parkinson's disease (Mattiasson2006The). UCP2 is also involved in cancer, where it influences tumor growth by managing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and affecting tumor metabolism (Nesci2024UCP2).

## Interactions
UCP2 (uncoupling protein 2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in mitochondrial processes. UCP2 interacts with adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2) in the context of mitochondrial respiration. This interaction is suggested to be part of a multiprotein complex that may influence substrate utilization during changes in cellular metabolism. The interaction between UCP2 and ANT2 can be disrupted by inhibitors such as carboxyatractyloside, bongkrekik acid, and GDP, indicating sensitivity to these compounds (Schiffer2022Mitochondrial).

UCP2 also forms tetramers in lipid bilayers, described as dimers of dimers, which are stabilized by non-specific protein-lipid interactions. These tetramers are capable of proton transport, a characteristic function of UCPs, and are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Ardalan2018Experimental).

In the context of non-small-cell lung cancer, UCP2 interacts with DDX5 and UBAP2L, forming a multiprotein complex. These interactions are significant for understanding UCP2's role in metabolic plasticity and chemoresistance, with UCP2 showing a stronger binding preference for DDX5 over UBAP2L (Yang2021Molecular).

Additionally, UCP2's expression is regulated by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK), which binds to ucp2 mRNA, enhancing its translation in response to insulin (Ostrowski2004Heterogeneous).
