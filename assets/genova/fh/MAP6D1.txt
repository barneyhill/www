# MAP6D1

## Overview
MAP6D1, or microtubule-associated protein 6 domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, a critical component of the cytoskeleton. The protein, also referred to as MAP6 domain containing 1, is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein. It plays a significant role in stabilizing microtubules, thereby maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport. MAP6D1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and lungs, indicating its involvement in a range of physiological processes such as neuronal differentiation and synaptic functions. The protein's ability to interact with multiple cellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and mitochondria, underscores its potential roles in cellular signaling and compartmentalization (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular).

## Function
MAP6D1, also known as MAP6 domain containing 1, encodes a protein involved in the stabilization and dynamics of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining cell structure and facilitating intracellular transport. In healthy human cells, MAP6D1 is known to stabilize microtubules against depolymerizing conditions, which is crucial for cellular morphology and function (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular).

MAP6D1 is palmitoylated at its N-terminal cysteines, a modification that aids its association with the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. This palmitoylation is not required for its localization to mitochondria, indicating a potential role in mitochondrial function (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular). The protein can multimerize via its microtubule-binding module, which is essential for its function and localization within the cell (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular).

MAP6D1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and lungs, suggesting its involvement in broader physiological processes beyond microtubule stabilization, such as neuronal differentiation and synaptic functions (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular). Its ability to interact with different cellular compartments highlights its role in cellular signaling and compartmentalization (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular).

## Interactions
MAP6D1, also known as STOP-Like protein 21 kD (SL21), is involved in various protein-protein interactions that extend beyond its role in microtubule stabilization. MAP6D1 can form non-covalent multimers with itself and with MAP6-E, but not with lamin, indicating specific protein-protein interactions. This multimerization involves the Mn3 module and does not require cysteines (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular). 

MAP6D1 also interacts with several cellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and mitochondria. Its association with the Golgi and plasma membrane is dependent on palmitoylation, while its mitochondrial localization is independent of this modification. The N-terminal domain of MAP6D1 is sufficient for its targeting to mitochondria (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular). 

In transfected NIH/3T3 cells, MAP6D1 localizes to microtubules, Golgi, plasma membrane, and mitochondria, with varying frequencies, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular processes (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular). These interactions and localizations suggest that MAP6D1 plays roles in cellular structures beyond microtubules, potentially impacting neuronal differentiation and synaptic functions (GoryFauré2014NonMicrotubular).
