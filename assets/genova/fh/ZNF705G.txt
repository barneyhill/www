# ZNF705G

## Overview
ZNF705G is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 705G, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which are small protein structural motifs that can coordinate one or more zinc ions to help stabilize their folds. These proteins are typically involved in DNA binding and play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation, cellular differentiation, and development. The specific functions of zinc finger protein 705G remain to be fully elucidated, but it is believed to participate in gene expression regulation through its interaction with DNA and possibly other proteins. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in cellular processes and potential implications in human health and disease.
