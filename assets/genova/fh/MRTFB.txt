# MRTFB

## Overview
MRTFB, or myocardin-related transcription factor B, is a gene that encodes a transcriptional coactivator protein involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in association with the serum response factor (SRF). The MRTFB protein is characterized by several structural domains, including RPEL subdomains, a basic region, a B-box-like region, a glutamine-rich region, a SAP domain, a leucine zipper, and a transcription activation domain, which facilitate its role in modulating genes related to the actin cytoskeleton and synaptic activity (Andrews2022De). As a coactivator, MRTFB is integral to processes such as cell motility, adhesion, and differentiation, impacting various cell types including endothelial, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells (Gau2018SRF’ing). The protein's activity is regulated by actin dynamics, which influence its cellular localization and transcriptional activation (Gau2018SRF’ing). Clinically, MRTFB is significant in conditions such as colorectal cancer, where it acts as a tumor suppressor, and in neurodevelopmental disorders, where mutations can lead to intellectual disabilities and other phenotypes (Andrews2022De; Kodama2019MRTFB).

## Structure
MRTFB, or myocardin-related transcription factor B, is a protein characterized by several distinct structural domains that contribute to its function as a transcriptional regulator. The protein contains an N-terminal domain with three RPEL subdomains, which are crucial for its regulation by binding to G-actin. This interaction influences MRTFB's cellular localization and transcriptional activity (Andrews2022De). The protein also features a basic region, a B-box-like region, a glutamine-rich region, a SAP domain, a leucine zipper, and a transcription activation domain (Andrews2022De). These domains facilitate its interaction with the serum response factor (SRF) and are involved in the regulation of genes related to the actin cytoskeleton and synaptic activity (Andrews2022De).

MRTFB undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that can affect its function and interactions. For instance, the SOLOIST/MRTFB i4 isoform includes an inserted short exon between the 3rd and 4th exons of MRTFB isoform 3, leading to a 21 amino acid sequence that disrupts the ERK-docking motif present in isoform 3 (Ishibashi2020Expression). This structural variation among isoforms suggests different interactions with kinases and potentially distinct roles in cellular processes (Ishibashi2020Expression).

## Function
MRTFB, or myocardin-related transcription factor B, is a coactivator that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression through its interaction with the serum response factor (SRF). This interaction is crucial for the modulation of genes associated with the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for cell motility, adhesion, and contractility (Gau2018SRF’ing). MRTFB is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing processes such as cell migration and differentiation in various cell types, including endothelial, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells (Gau2018SRF’ing).

In endothelial cells, MRTFB disruption leads to reduced actin-based filopodial processes and impaired angiogenesis, highlighting its role in vascular development (Gau2018SRF’ing). MRTFB also regulates the expression of β1-integrin, a protein crucial for cell adhesion and motility, through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (Gau2018SRF’ing). In the nervous system, MRTFB is involved in regulating dendritic and spine morphology, which is essential for neuronal function and plasticity (Tabuchi2021Regulation).

MRTFB's activity is modulated by actin dynamics, with changes in actin polymerization affecting its cellular localization and activation, thereby influencing SRF-mediated transcription (Gau2018SRF’ing). This regulation is critical for maintaining normal cellular processes and preventing tumorigenesis, as evidenced by its role in suppressing colorectal cancer development (Kodama2019MRTFB).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MRTFB gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MRTFB functions as a tumor suppressor. Knockdown of MRTFB expression in human CRC cells accelerates tumor growth and increases cell invasion and migration, suggesting that reduced MRTFB expression contributes to CRC progression and decreased patient survival (Kodama2019MRTFB). MRTFB regulates genes such as SPDL1 and MCAM, which are associated with tumor suppression, and their downregulation in MRTFB-deficient cells is linked to increased tumor development (Kodama2019MRTFB).

In neurodevelopmental disorders, de novo variants in MRTFB, specifically R104G and A91P, have been associated with intellectual disability, speech apraxia, and distinct dysmorphic features. These variants disrupt the RPEL domain, affecting MRTFB's interaction with actin and leading to altered transcriptional activity, which may contribute to the observed phenotypes (Andrews2022De).

MRTFB also plays a role in retinal angiogenesis. Its ablation in endothelial cells results in impaired vascular development, highlighting its importance in normal vascular function (Weinl2013Endothelial). These findings underscore the clinical significance of MRTFB in various pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and vascular diseases.

## Interactions
MRTFB (myocardin-related transcription factor B) is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcriptional coactivator. MRTFB interacts with YAP (Yes-associated protein) through a PPXY motif-WW domain interaction, which is essential for activating TEAD-YAP transcriptional activity and promoting the expression of YAP target genes (Kim2016MRTF). This interaction is significant in the context of cancer metastasis, as MRTFB enhances the binding of TEAD2/YAP to the transcriptional coactivator NcoA3, facilitating the activation of TEAD-YAP target genes (Kim2016MRTF).

MRTFB also interacts with TEAD transcription factors, playing a role in the regulation of gene expression in Ewing Sarcoma. It functions as a co-activator for TEAD, and its recruitment to the YAP-1-TEAD complex is crucial for the activation of target genes involved in cytoskeletal processes (Katschnig2017EWSFLI1). Additionally, MRTFB's interaction with serum response factor (SRF) is important for modulating transcription of target genes, although its interaction with SRF is weaker compared to other myocardin-related transcription factors (Wang2002Potentiation). These interactions highlight MRTFB's role in linking cytoskeletal dynamics to transcriptional regulation.
