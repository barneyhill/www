# EPHA10

## Overview
EPHA10 is a gene that encodes the EPH receptor A10, a member of the Eph receptor family, which is the largest subgroup of receptor tyrosine kinases. Despite being classified as a pseudokinase due to its lack of catalytic activity, EPH receptor A10 is thought to play a significant role in non-catalytic regulatory functions, potentially influencing the activity of other Eph receptors (Liang2019Eph; Lisabeth2013Eph). The protein is primarily expressed in reproductive tissues, suggesting a role in fertility and reproductive system development (Bush2022Cellular). EPHA10 is involved in cell signaling pathways that affect cell shape, movement, and adhesion through interactions with ephrin ligands (Bush2022Cellular). Although its specific functions in normal human physiology are not fully understood, EPHA10 has been implicated in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Kou2018Differential).

## Structure


## Function
EPHA10, a member of the Eph receptor family, is a pseudokinase, meaning it lacks catalytic activity due to modifications in its kinase domain (Liang2019Eph; Lisabeth2013Eph). Despite this, EPHA10 is believed to have non-catalytic regulatory functions, potentially acting as a molecular switch to modulate the activity of other Eph receptors (Liang2019Eph). It shares a high sequence identity with EphA7, suggesting a gene duplication event in its evolutionary history (Liang2019Eph).

EPHA10 is involved in cell signaling pathways that regulate cell shape, movement, and adhesion, primarily through interactions with ephrin ligands (Bush2022Cellular). The receptor is predominantly expressed in reproductive tissues, indicating a possible role in fertility and reproductive system development (Bush2022Cellular). The activation loop of EPHA10 retains a conserved tyrosine residue, which implies it could adopt various conformational states depending on its phosphorylation state, suggesting a distinct regulatory mechanism compared to other Eph receptors (Liang2019Eph). However, the specific functions of EPHA10 in healthy human cells remain largely unexplored, necessitating further biochemical and structural studies (Liang2019Eph).

## Clinical Significance
EPHA10 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly prostate and breast cancer. In prostate cancer, EPHA10 expression levels are elevated in some cancer cell lines compared to normal prostate cells. This altered expression suggests a potential role in tumorigenesis. A genome sequence analysis identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an intron of the EPHA10 gene, which may interact with other SNPs to modify prostate cancer risk, indicating a possible genetic risk factor associated with EPHA10 (Kou2018Differential).

In breast cancer, EPHA10 is noted for its physical interaction with EphA7, which may be relevant to tumorigenesis and lymph node metastasis. However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations or expression changes in EPHA10 are not detailed in the available literature (Kou2018Differential).

While EPHA10 lacks kinase activity due to altered sequences in its kinase domain, its involvement in cancer suggests it could be a target for therapeutic interventions. The aberrant regulation and expression of Eph receptors, including EPHA10, can lead to changes in the proliferative, migratory, and invasive potential of cancer cells, making them potential targets for cancer therapeutics (Kou2018Differential).
