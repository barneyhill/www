# SAMD15

## Overview
SAMD15, or sterile alpha motif domain containing 15, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, also known as FAM153A, contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which is a protein interaction module implicated in the regulation of diverse biological functions. SAMD15 has been associated with several pathological conditions, including infectious diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Its expression levels are notably altered in response to specific disease states, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis and as a biomarker for certain conditions (Khan2022Singlecell; Namulondo2024Transcriptome; Lee2020Genomic). Further research is required to fully understand the functional mechanisms of SAMD15 and its encoded protein in health and disease.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
SAMD15 (sterile alpha motif domain containing 15) has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In children with coinfections of Schistosoma mansoni and Plasmodium falciparum, SAMD15 is upregulated and associated with inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting a role in the clinical manifestations of these infections (Namulondo2024Transcriptome). In the context of neuroblastoma, SAMD15, also referred to as FAM153A, is significantly overexpressed in high-risk groups, indicating its potential as a biomarker for risk stratification in this cancer type (Lee2020Genomic). 

In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease induced by pesticide exposure, SAMD15 was identified as one of the top significant genes in mural cells, hinting at its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Khan2022Singlecell). Additionally, SAMD15 has been noted for altered expression in the context of X-linked intellectual disability, although specific clinical implications in this condition are not detailed (Vaidyanathan2017Identification). These findings suggest that SAMD15 may play a role in various pathological processes, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance.
