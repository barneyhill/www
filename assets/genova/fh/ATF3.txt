# ATF3

## Overview
Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a gene that encodes a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors, which are involved in regulating gene expression in response to various stress signals. The ATF3 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator, capable of acting as both an activator and a repressor depending on its dimerization partners and the cellular context (Vu2020The; Hai2001The). It is rapidly induced by stress stimuli and plays a pivotal role in cellular stress responses, homeostasis, and immune modulation (Thompson2009ATF3; HAI2010ATF3). ATF3 is implicated in numerous signaling pathways, including those involving NF-κB and Smad, and is associated with various physiological and pathological processes, such as cancer progression, metabolic disorders, and immune responses (Rohini2018Role; Ku2020Master). The protein's ability to interact with a wide range of other proteins and transcription factors underscores its versatility and significance in maintaining cellular function and responding to environmental changes (Zhao2016The).

## Structure
ATF3 is a transcription factor that belongs to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, characterized by a basic region for DNA binding and a leucine zipper motif that facilitates dimerization. The protein can form homodimers or heterodimers with other bZIP transcription factors, such as c-Jun, which influences its role as a transcriptional activator or repressor (Vu2020The; Hai2001The). 

ATF3 is a 24 kDa protein in mammals, with a positively charged DNA-binding region adjacent to the leucine zipper coiled coil motif (Vu2020The). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and SUMOylation. SUMOylation occurs at lysine 42, which is crucial for its transcriptional repression activity on the TP53 gene (Wang2013SUMOylation). 

ATF3 interacts with various histone deacetylases (HDACs), particularly HDAC6, through its N-terminal and basic domains, excluding the leucine zipper domain (DarlyukSaadon2012The). The protein's degradation is mediated by the Arg/N-degron pathway, involving E3 ubiquitin ligases such as UBR1 and UBR2 (Vu2020The).

## Function
Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cellular stress responses and homeostasis. In healthy human cells, ATF3 is involved in regulating the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. It functions by forming homodimers or heterodimers with other members of the AP-1 family, which can either activate or repress transcription depending on the context (Rohini2018Role). ATF3 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA at the ATF/CRE site or similar AP-1 sites to influence gene expression (Rohini2018Role).

ATF3 is rapidly induced by stress signals, acting as an immediate-early gene that modulates the expression of other genes to facilitate cellular adaptation to stress (HAI2010ATF3). It is involved in various signaling pathways, including NF-κB, Smad, ERK, JNK, and p38, which are activated by stressors such as cytokines, hypoxia, and chemotherapeutic agents (Rohini2018Role). ATF3 also plays a role in the unfolded protein response during endoplasmic reticulum stress, being transcribed via the PERK pathway (Rohini2018Role).

In the immune system, ATF3 acts as an immunomodulator, interacting with NF-κB to regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Thompson2009ATF3). It can both repress and enhance cytokine expression, depending on the cell type and context, highlighting its complex role in immune responses (HAI2010ATF3).

## Clinical Significance
ATF3 plays a significant role in various diseases and conditions due to its involvement in cellular stress responses and gene regulation. In cancer, ATF3 expression is often altered, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. In breast cancer, high ATF3 expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes and increased metastasis, as it regulates genes involved in cell migration and invasion (Wolford2013Transcription; Ku2020Master). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low ATF3 expression correlates with shorter overall survival, particularly in specific patient subgroups (Li2021Role). 

ATF3 is also implicated in metabolic disorders. It influences glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, with knockout mice showing metabolic dysregulation, including obesity and insulin resistance (Ku2020Master). In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ATF3 expression correlates with disease activity and treatment response, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for RA progression and therapy efficacy (Hu2021Identification).

In infectious diseases, ATF3 modulates immune responses, affecting susceptibility to infections and inflammatory conditions. It acts as a negative regulator of IFN-γ expression in NK cells, influencing host defense mechanisms (Liu2024The; Ku2020Master). These diverse roles highlight ATF3's clinical significance across a range of pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ATF3 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It binds to the ATF/CRE cis-acting element in gene promoters, regulating gene expression associated with stress responses and human diseases (Zhao2016The). ATF3 shares a binding motif with ATF4 and interacts with transcription factors such as p53, p63, AR, and Sp1, as well as histone-modifying enzymes like Tip60 and HDAC (Zhao2016The). The interaction with p53 is particularly notable, as ATF3 and p53 co-localize at several genomic sites, including those associated with genes like CDKN1A, MDM2, and BBC3. This interaction is mediated by mutual recruitment to sites with p53 motifs, and p53 depletion affects ATF3 binding at certain sites (Zhao2016The).

ATF3 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), binding to its DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD), thereby repressing AR-mediated gene expression by preventing AR from binding to androgen response elements (AREs) (Wang2012The). In breast cancer cells, ATF3 interacts with Smad4, which is crucial for the activation of the MMP13 gene, a key player in cancer metastasis (Rohini2019Stimulation). These interactions highlight ATF3's role as a versatile transcriptional regulator, capable of both activating and repressing gene expression in response to various cellular signals.
