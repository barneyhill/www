# TUBGCP2

## Overview
TUBGCP2 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin gamma complex component 2 (GCP2), which is a vital part of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC). This complex is crucial for microtubule nucleation, a process essential for various cellular functions such as chromosome segregation, intracellular transport, and cell motility. GCP2, categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, interacts with other gamma-tubulin complex proteins to form the γ-TuRC, which acts as a template for microtubule formation at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) (Mitani2019Biallelic; Gungor2021Autosomal). The protein's structural integrity and function are critical for maintaining the cytoskeleton's stability, particularly in neuronal development and brain function (Gungor2021Autosomal). Mutations in TUBGCP2 have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in proper brain development (Mitani2019Biallelic).

## Structure
The TUBGCP2 gene encodes the gamma-tubulin complex protein 2 (GCP2), a core component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gTuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation. The molecular structure of GCP2 includes conserved Grip motifs, specifically Grip1 and Grip2, which are crucial for its interaction with gamma-tubulin and other components of the gTuRC (Mitani2019Biallelic). These motifs are located in conserved domains of the protein and are essential for its function in microtubule nucleation (Mitani2019Biallelic).

GCP2 forms a stable heterodimer with GCP3, a recurring structural motif within the gTuRC, which is crucial for the structural integrity of the complex (Consolati2020Microtubule). The GCP2-GCP3 interface is stabilized by MZT2, which cross-links with these proteins on the outer perimeter of the gTuRC (Consolati2020Microtubule). The structure of GCP2 is not explicitly detailed in terms of secondary or tertiary structures, but it is part of the gTuRC's quaternary structure, interacting with other GCP subunits to form the complex (Consolati2020Microtubule). The gTuRC is composed of several repeating units of GCP2 and GCP3, forming a left-handed spiral cone that supports gamma-tubulin protomers (Consolati2020Microtubule).

## Function
TUBGCP2 encodes the gamma-tubulin complex protein 2 (GCP2), a core component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation at the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), such as the centrosome (Mitani2019Biallelic; Gungor2021Autosomal). This complex acts as a template for microtubule formation, playing a critical role in various cellular processes, including chromosome separation, intracellular transport, organelle positioning, and cell motility (Mitani2019Biallelic). 

In healthy human cells, TUBGCP2 is involved in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the cytoskeleton, which is crucial for proper neuronal development and function (Gungor2021Autosomal). The γ-TuRC, which includes GCP2, is responsible for microtubule nucleation and stabilization by acting as a minus-end capping complex (Gungor2021Autosomal). TUBGCP2 is expressed in the brain and other tissues, highlighting its critical role in neuronal migration and brain development (Mitani2019Biallelic). 

The protein is active in the centrosome, contributing to proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation during mitosis, ensuring the spatial and temporal control of microtubule nucleation (Mitani2019Biallelic; Gungor2021Autosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBGCP2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including microcephaly and lissencephaly spectrum disorders. These conditions are characterized by defects in neuronal migration, leading to structural brain abnormalities such as pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia (Mitani2019Biallelic). The TUBGCP2 gene encodes a component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (g-TuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation and neuronal migration. Pathogenic variants in TUBGCP2, such as the homozygous missense variant c.931G > A, p.Glu311Lys, have been identified in individuals with severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental delay, hypotonia, epilepsy, and brain malformations (Gungor2021Autosomal).

These mutations can disrupt the electrostatic interaction between GCP2 and GCP3, leading to altered localization of the g-TuRC components and affecting cellular processes like cytoskeleton assembly and cell adhesion (Gungor2021Autosomal). The developing nervous system is particularly sensitive to these mutations, which can result in a spectrum of clinical phenotypes from mild to severe, depending on the specific variant and its impact on the protein's function (Mitani2019Biallelic). The clinical significance of TUBGCP2 mutations underscores the gene's critical role in brain development and function.

## Interactions
TUBGCP2 is a core component of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which is essential for microtubule nucleation. It interacts with other gamma-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs), including GCP3, GCP4, GCP5, and GCP6, forming part of the γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC) and the larger γ-TuRC (Böhler2021The). TUBGCP2 interacts with γ-tubulin via its C-terminal GRIP2 domain and forms part of the heterotetrameric γ-TuSC by interacting laterally with other GCPs through its N-terminal GRIP1 domain (Böhler2021The). 

The interaction between TUBGCP2 and GCP3 is particularly significant, as mutations in TUBGCP2, such as the p.Glu311Lys mutation, can disrupt the electrostatic complementarity between GCP2 and GCP3, potentially destabilizing the γ-TuRC (Gungor2021Autosomal). This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the γ-TuRC, which is targeted to the centrosome by proteins like NEDD1 (Böhler2021The). 

TUBGCP2 also interacts with non-tubulin proteins, such as microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), suggesting a role in signal transduction and microtubule nucleation (Ramesh2023Prediction). These interactions highlight the complex network of proteins that regulate microtubule dynamics and are essential for cellular functions.
