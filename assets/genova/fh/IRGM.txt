# IRGM

## Overview
The IRGM gene encodes the immunity-related GTPase M (IRGM) protein, which is a member of the immunity-related GTPase family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of autophagy, a critical cellular process for maintaining homeostasis and defending against intracellular pathogens. IRGM is characterized by its unique GTP-binding domain, which includes a methionine substitution in the G1 motif, distinguishing it from other GTPases (Bekpen2010Human). The protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial dynamics and autophagic responses, interacting with key autophagy regulators and mitochondrial proteins to promote autophagosome formation and pathogen clearance (Singh2010Human; Chauhan2015IRGM). Variants in the IRGM gene have been associated with diseases such as Crohn's disease and tuberculosis, highlighting its significance in immune response and disease susceptibility (McCarroll2008Deletion; Glas2013IRGM).

## Structure
The IRGM gene encodes a protein that is part of the immunity-related GTPase family, characterized by a GTP-binding domain with five classical GTP-binding motifs. The IRGM protein is unique due to its truncated G-domain, which includes a methionine substitution in the G1 motif, distinguishing it from other P-loop GTPases that typically have a lysine residue in this position (Bekpen2010Human). This methionine substitution is a characteristic feature of the GMS type proteins within the GTPase family.

IRGM exists in several splice variant isoforms, including IRGMa, IRGMb, IRGMc, and IRGMd, which differ mainly in their C-terminal tails. These isoforms have predicted molecular weights between 19 and 24 kD, although their expression at the protein level has not been fully documented (Bekpen2010Human; Singh2010Human). The IRGMd isoform, in particular, is noted for its role in mitochondrial functions, including mitochondrial fission and depolarization, and is associated with mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin (Singh2010Human).

The IRGM protein's structure and function are influenced by its interaction with mitochondria, where it localizes and affects mitochondrial dynamics. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of the IRGM protein are not provided in the available context (Singh2010Human).

## Function
The IRGM gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy, a cellular process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and defending against intracellular pathogens. In healthy human cells, IRGM interacts with key autophagy regulators such as ULK1 and Beclin 1, promoting their phosphorylation and assembly into complexes that initiate autophagy (Chauhan2015IRGM). It influences the composition of the Beclin 1 complex by displacing negative regulators and enriching positive ones, thereby enhancing autophagic activity (Chauhan2015IRGM).

IRGM also affects mitochondrial dynamics, promoting mitochondrial fission and autophagy through interactions with mitochondrial lipids and proteins like DRP1 (Singh2010Human). This interaction is crucial for the protein's localization and function in mitochondrial fission, which signals microbial presence and triggers autophagy to eliminate pathogens (Singh2010Human).

IRGM is involved in the autophagic response to microbial infection, interacting with proteins such as NOD2 and ATG16L1, which are associated with Crohn's disease (Chauhan2015IRGM). It acts as a bridge between ULK1-Beclin 1 complexes and the autophagy conjugation machinery, integrating different components of the autophagy initiation process (Chauhan2015IRGM).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IRGM gene are associated with several diseases, most notably Crohn's disease (CD) and tuberculosis. Variants such as rs13361189 and a 20-kb deletion polymorphism upstream of the IRGM gene have been linked to increased susceptibility to CD. These genetic changes affect IRGM expression and its role in autophagy, a process crucial for managing intracellular bacteria, which is implicated in CD pathogenesis (McCarroll2008Deletion; PalominoMorales2009Association). The IRGM variant rs10065172, in linkage disequilibrium with rs13361189, is also associated with CD and tuberculosis, suggesting a shared mechanism involving altered microRNA interactions and bacterial phagocytosis (Glas2013IRGM).

The expression of IRGM is influenced by genetic variants, with risk haplotypes leading to reduced expression levels in certain populations, such as African populations, but not in Japanese or Chinese populations (Prescott2010Independent). This reduced expression compromises the efficiency of antibacterial autophagy, potentially contributing to the persistence of intracellular pathogens and the development of CD (McCarroll2008Deletion). The IRGM gene's involvement in autophagy and immune response underscores its clinical significance in inflammatory and infectious diseases (Chauhan2015IRGM).

## Interactions
IRGM (immunity-related GTPase family M) is involved in numerous protein interactions that play a critical role in autophagy and immune responses. It interacts with several autophagy-related proteins, including ATG5, ATG10, MAP1LC3C, and SH3GLB1, which are essential for the initiation and elongation phases of autophagy (Grégoire2011IRGM). IRGM also forms complexes with ULK1 and Beclin 1, promoting their co-assembly, and interacts with ATG14L and ATG16L1, which are crucial for autophagosome formation (Chauhan2015IRGM).

IRGM's interactions extend to viral proteins such as MeV-C, HCV-NS3, and HIV-1-NEF, which induce autophagy in an IRGM-dependent manner, suggesting a role in viral replication (Grégoire2011IRGM). It also interacts with mammalian Atg8 proteins, including LC3 and GABARAP, facilitating the recruitment of Stx17 to autophagosomes, which is crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion (Kumar2018Mechanism).

IRGM is involved in the regulation of mTOR and TFEB, interacting with TFEB and its phosphatase PPP3CB, which controls TFEB activation. This interaction is important for TFEB's nuclear translocation and function, highlighting IRGM's role in cellular responses to stress conditions (Kumar2020Mammalian).
