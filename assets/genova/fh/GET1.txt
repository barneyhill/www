# GET1

## Overview
The GET1 gene, also known as WRB, encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the guided entry of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The GET1 protein is a key component of the GET complex, which is essential for the post-translational targeting and insertion of TA proteins, characterized by a C-terminal transmembrane domain, into the ER membrane. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein localization, impacting various cellular functions such as vesicular trafficking, protein translocation, and apoptosis (Denic2012A; McDowell2023The). Structurally, GET1 is characterized by three transmembrane domains and a cytosolic domain that interacts with the Get3 ATPase, forming a symmetric heterotetramer essential for TA protein insertion (Stefer2011Structural). Disruptions in the GET pathway can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, highlighting its critical role in maintaining proteostasis (Josefson2023The).

## Structure
The human gene GET1, also known as WRB, encodes a protein that is integral to the insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The GET1 protein is characterized by its structure, which includes three transmembrane domains (TMDs) and a cytosolic domain (Get1-CD) that is crucial for binding to the Get3 protein (Stefer2011Structural). The cytosolic domain is predicted to adopt a coiled-coil structure with two long helices extending from the transmembrane regions (Stefer2011Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, GET1 forms a symmetric heterotetramer with Get3, where two Get1 molecules bind at the interface of the Get3 homodimer. This interaction is essential for the insertion of TA proteins into the membrane (Stefer2011Structural). The interaction between GET1 and Get3 involves two interfaces: interface I, which is extensive and involves aromatic residues and a salt bridge, and interface II, which is smaller and involves helix α4 of the Get3 TABD (Stefer2011Structural). The structural analysis suggests that GET1 regulates the Get3 nucleotide interaction, with the tip of GET1 reconfiguring switch regions of Get3 (Stefer2011Structural).

## Function
The GET1 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the guided entry of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein localization. In humans, GET1 is homologous to the tryptophan-rich basic protein, WRB, and is predicted to adopt a coiled-coil structure with two long helices extending from the transmembrane regions (Stefer2011Structural). The GET1 protein functions as part of the GET complex, specifically forming a heterodimer with Get2, which together with Get3, facilitates the insertion of TA proteins into the ER membrane (Denic2012A; McDowell2023The).

The GET pathway is crucial for the post-translational targeting of TA proteins, which have a C-terminal transmembrane domain, to the ER membrane. This pathway involves the Get3 ATPase, which captures TA proteins in the cytosol and delivers them to the Get1/Get2 complex at the ER membrane, facilitating their insertion (Denic2012A; McDowell2020Structural). The proper functioning of this pathway is vital for various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, protein translocation, and apoptosis (McDowell2023The). Disruptions in the GET pathway can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and protein aggregates, indicating its critical role in maintaining proteostasis (Josefson2023The).

## Interactions
GET1, also known as WRB, is a crucial component of the GET pathway, which facilitates the insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. GET1 interacts with GET3, an ATPase, forming a complex that is essential for the targeting and insertion of TA proteins. The interaction between GET1 and GET3 is characterized by a symmetric heterotetramer structure, where two GET1 molecules bind at the interface of the GET3 homodimer. This interaction involves two distinct interfaces: interface I, which is extensive and stabilized by a hydrophobic zipper, and interface II, which is smaller and involves helix α4 of the GET3 TABD. Interface I is crucial for high affinity and specificity, while interface II regulates nucleotide interaction (Stefer2011Structural).

GET1 also interacts with GET2, forming a receptor complex on the ER membrane that recruits the GET3-TA complex. This complex is necessary for the proper insertion of TA proteins into the ER. GET1 and GET2 can bind to GET3 individually or simultaneously, but attempts to crystallize the ternary complex have only resulted in the GET3/GET1 complex (Stefer2011Structural). The interaction of GET1 with GET3 is nucleotide-dependent, with ATP binding prohibiting GET1 rebinding, suggesting a dynamic role of ATP in modulating these interactions (Rome2014Differential).
