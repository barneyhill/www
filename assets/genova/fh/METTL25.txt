# METTL25

## Overview
METTL25 is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase like 25, which is part of the methyltransferase enzyme family. These enzymes are responsible for transferring methyl groups to specific substrates, a process that plays a crucial role in regulating various biological functions, including gene expression, protein function, and RNA processing. Methyltransferase like 25 is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, which can affect their activity, localization, and interaction with other cellular molecules. The precise biological roles and mechanisms of METTL25 and its encoded protein are still under investigation, but they are believed to be significant in cellular processes and may have implications in certain diseases. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the functions and potential clinical significance of METTL25.
