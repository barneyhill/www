# AFG1L

## Overview
AFG1L is a gene that encodes the AFG1-like ATPase, a protein involved in mitochondrial function and protein homeostasis. The AFG1-like ATPase is categorized as an ATPase, which is a type of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP, providing energy for various cellular processes. This protein is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, which is essential for cellular energy production and regulation. Dysregulation of AFG1L expression has been linked to several pathological conditions, including skin diseases such as psoriasis and neurodegenerative disorders like frontotemporal dementia. The gene's involvement in these conditions underscores its significance in both dermatological and neurological health (Sahlén2021Chromatin; Dehghani2021A).

## Clinical Significance
The AFG1L gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in mitochondrial function and protein homeostasis. Alterations in AFG1L expression have been associated with skin pathologies such as psoriasis. The gene interacts with psoriasis risk variants, and its dysregulation may lead to inflammation and reduced apoptosis in keratinocytes, suggesting a potential link to skin diseases (Sahlén2021Chromatin). AFG1L is also differentially expressed in psoriatic lesions, interacting with variants that show enhancer activity, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis (Sahlén2021Chromatin).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, AFG1L has been associated with non-Alzheimer's dementias. Copy number variations (CNVs) involving AFG1L have been detected in dementia patients, including a specific duplication found in a family with frontotemporal dementia, although the pathogenicity of this CNV remains uncertain (Dehghani2021A). The gene is also mentioned in studies of Turkish dementia patients, where CNVs overlapping AFG1L were identified, highlighting its potential involvement in neurodegenerative conditions (Dehghani2021A; Demirci2022What). These findings suggest that AFG1L may play a role in the genetic landscape of both skin and neurodegenerative diseases.
