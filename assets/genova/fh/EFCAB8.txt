# EFCAB8

## Overview
EFCAB8 is a gene that encodes the protein EF-hand calcium binding domain 8, which is involved in calcium ion binding and signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its EF-hand motif, a helix-loop-helix structural domain that is commonly found in calcium-binding proteins. This motif allows the protein to play a role in various cellular processes that are regulated by calcium ions. Although the precise biological functions of EF-hand calcium binding domain 8 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in several cellular pathways and has been associated with various diseases, including cancer and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (Voutsadakis2022Sensitivities; Wang2019Identification; Morales2014Differential). Further research is needed to clarify the specific mechanisms by which EFCAB8 and its encoded protein contribute to these conditions.

## Clinical Significance
EFCAB8 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its mutations and altered expression levels. In the context of chemotherapy, particularly platinum-based treatments, EFCAB8 has been associated with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. The gene exhibits 'on-off' variations in expression levels in leukocytes, which may serve as potential biomarkers for neuropathy and other chemotherapy-related toxicities (Morales2014Differential).

In non-medullary thyroid cancer (NMTC), a splice donor variant of EFCAB8 (c.431 + 1G>C) has been identified, suggesting a potential role in the carcinogenesis of NMTC. This variant was highlighted in a study that used whole-genome sequencing to identify candidate genes linked to NMTC, indicating a possible correlation between EFCAB8 mutations and cancer (Wang2019Identification).

EFCAB8 is also noted as a preferentially essential gene in BRAF mutant colorectal cancer cell lines, suggesting its involvement in the survival and proliferation of these cancer cells. This highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in the context of colorectal cancer (Voutsadakis2022Sensitivities).

While EFCAB8 has been associated with various conditions, detailed information on its specific role in these diseases remains limited, necessitating further research to fully understand its clinical significance.
