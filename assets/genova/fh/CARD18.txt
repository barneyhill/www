# CARD18

## Overview
CARD18 is a gene that encodes the protein caspase recruitment domain family member 18, also known as ICEBERG. This protein is categorized as a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-only protein and functions primarily as a negative regulator of inflammasome activation. By interacting with pro-caspase-1, CARD18 inhibits its activation, thereby preventing the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Göblös2016Keratinocytes; Qin2017The). CARD18 is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes, the main cell type in the epidermis, and plays a role in their terminal differentiation and response to inflammatory stimuli (Göblös2016Keratinocytes; Qin2017The). Its expression is upregulated in response to stressors like mechanical injury or UVB irradiation, highlighting its importance in skin immune responses (Göblös2016Keratinocytes; Qin2017The). The gene is present in humans and higher primates but absent in rodents, suggesting a specific evolutionary role in regulating inflammation (Devi2020An).

## Function
CARD18, also known as ICEBERG, is a protein that functions as a negative regulator of inflammasome activation in healthy human cells. It achieves this by interacting with pro-caspase-1, thereby inhibiting its activation and preventing the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (Göblös2016Keratinocytes; Qin2017The). This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining a balanced immune response and preventing excessive inflammation (Göblös2016Keratinocytes).

CARD18 is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis, and is involved in the terminal differentiation of these cells (Göblös2016Keratinocytes; Qin2017The). Its expression is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as mechanical injury or UVB irradiation, indicating its role in the skin's response to stress and injury (Göblös2016Keratinocytes; Qin2017The). CARD18's function as a decoy protein allows it to modulate inflammasome activity, thereby contributing to the fine-tuning of keratinocyte innate immune processes and potentially preventing chronic inflammation (Göblös2016Keratinocytes; Park2019Caspase).

## Clinical Significance
CARD18, also known as ICEBERG, plays a significant role in regulating inflammasome activation and immune responses. Alterations in CARD18 expression levels have been linked to cardiovascular diseases. Specifically, lower levels of cardiac ICEBERG mRNA have been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Patients requiring left ventricular assist device implantation exhibited lower ICEBERG and higher caspase-1 and proIL-1b mRNA levels compared to stable heart failure patients, suggesting that CARD18 expression levels may have clinical significance in cardiovascular health (Matusiak2015CARD‐).

CARD18 acts as a dominant negative regulator of caspase-1 activation, inhibiting LPS-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. This regulation is crucial for balancing pro-inflammatory responses, and disruptions in this balance could potentially lead to inflammatory diseases (Le2013Pyrin; Matusiak2015CARD‐). The gene is absent in rat and mouse genomes but present in humans and higher primates, indicating a specific evolutionary role that may be linked to its regulatory functions in inflammation (Devi2020An). While specific mutations in CARD18 have not been detailed, its role in modulating inflammatory responses suggests that alterations could impact immune system dysregulation.

## Interactions
CARD18, also known as ICEBERG, is a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-only protein that primarily interacts with pro-caspase-1. This interaction inhibits the activation of caspase-1, thereby reducing the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 (Göblös2016Keratinocytes; Qin2017The). CARD18 shares significant sequence similarity with the CARD domain of pro-caspase-1, which facilitates its binding and inhibitory function (Matusiak2015CARD‐; Qin2017The).

CARD18 does not interact with the ASC-CARD, distinguishing it from other CARD-only proteins like CARD16 (Devi2020An). It also does not bind to the NF-kB-stimulating kinase receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), which is a notable difference from other COPs (Matusiak2015CARD‐). The protein's expression is upregulated by pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and it inhibits LPS-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in THP-1 cells (Matusiak2015CARD‐).

In keratinocytes, CARD18 acts as a negative regulator of inflammasome activation, and its expression is altered in conditions like psoriasis, where it modulates inflammatory responses (Göblös2016Keratinocytes).
