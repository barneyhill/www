# HDGFL2

## Overview
HDGFL2, or Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Like 2, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a member of the HDGF family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a conserved PWWP domain, which is involved in chromatin-associated functions, suggesting roles in DNA binding and modification processes. HDGFL2 functions primarily as a nucleosome binding protein, facilitating RNA polymerase II transcription through interactions with specific histone modifications. It is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcription regulation, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair, and is primarily localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and functional roles within the cell. HDGFL2 is also associated with several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Seddighi2024Misspliced; Irwin2024A; Floyd2021Systematic).

## Structure
HDGFL2, or Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Like 2, is a protein encoded by the HDGFL2 gene in humans. It is a member of the HDGF family, which is characterized by the presence of a conserved PWWP domain. This domain is known for its involvement in chromatin-associated functions, suggesting a role in DNA binding or modification processes. The PWWP domain is a prominent feature of the protein's structure, contributing to its functional capabilities.

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within the cell. These modifications are crucial for regulating the protein's function and localization, potentially affecting its role in cellular processes.

HDGFL2 is known to have multiple splice variant isoforms. These isoforms can lead to variations in the protein's structure, which may alter its function and localization within different cellular contexts. The existence of these isoforms highlights the complexity and versatility of HDGFL2 in its biological roles.

While specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of HDGFL2 are not provided, the presence of the PWWP domain and potential post-translational modifications are key structural features that define its function.

## Function
HDGFL2 (Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Like 2) is a protein involved in several cellular processes, including transcription regulation and chromatin remodeling. In healthy human cells, HDGFL2 functions as a nucleosome binding protein that facilitates RNA polymerase II transcription by interacting with histone modifications, specifically H3K36me3 and, to a lesser extent, H3K79me3. This interaction is crucial for maintaining transcriptional activity and is regulated by the phosphorylation state of HDGFL2. The dephosphorylated form of HDGFL2 can maintain its interaction with histone H3, while the phosphorylated form cannot, indicating a role for phosphorylation in transcription regulation and potentially in cell proliferation (Floyd2021Systematic).

HDGFL2 is also implicated in chromatin and DNA repair processes. In the context of TDP-43 deficiency, HDGFL2's role in chromatin regulation becomes more pronounced, with increased interactions with proteins involved in mRNA splicing, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair (Seddighi2024Misspliced). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and may influence tissue regeneration and repair. HDGFL2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in cellular function and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
HDGFL2 (HDGF like 2) has been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, alterations in HDGFL2 expression are associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). The loss of TDP-43 splicing repression leads to the inclusion of cryptic exons in the HDGFL2 gene, resulting in the production of cryptic exon-encoded neoepitopes. These neoepitopes are detectable in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, serving as potential biomarkers for early detection of TDP-43 dysfunction in ALS-FTD, especially in C9orf72 mutation carriers (Irwin2024A).

In cancer, HDGFL2 has been linked to drug response in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A genetic variant in HDGFL2, rs11878277, is associated with the response to entinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor under clinical trial for multiple cancers. This suggests a role for HDGFL2 in influencing drug response, although its direct involvement in specific cancers beyond leukemogenesis is still under investigation (Giri2023Exomewide).

The inclusion of cryptic exons in HDGFL2 is also observed in conditions involving TDP-43 manipulation, dysregulation, or depletion, highlighting its role as a specific biomarker for TDP-43 loss of function (Sinha2024Largescale).

## Interactions
HDGFL2, also known as Hepatoma-Derived Growth Factor-Like 2, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. One notable interaction is with histone H3, where HDGFL2 binds to H3K36me3 and, with less affinity, to H3K79me3. This interaction facilitates RNA polymerase II transcription, suggesting a role in transcription regulation (Floyd2021Systematic). HDGFL2 is also a phosphoprotein, and its interaction with histone H3 is influenced by its phosphorylation state. The dephosphorylated form of HDGFL2 can maintain interactions that the phosphorylated form cannot, indicating a phosphorylation-regulated mechanism (Floyd2021Systematic).

In the context of TDP-43 deficiency, HDGFL2 expresses a cryptic exon, altering its protein interactome. This change affects interactions with proteins involved in ribosome, spliceosome, actin, and neurodegeneration pathways. Notably, HDGFL2 interacts with MYO18A, clustering with actin-regulating proteins. The loss of TDP-43 increases HDGFL2's interactions with proteins involved in mRNA splicing, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair, while decreasing interactions with those involved in cytoskeleton organization (Seddighi2024Misspliced).

HDGFL2 also contains transcriptional network domains (TNDs), which are part of a network of elongation complexes interacting with major transcription elongation regulators (Cermakova2021A).
