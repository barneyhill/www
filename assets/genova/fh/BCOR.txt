# BCOR

## Overview
The BCOR gene encodes the BCL6 corepressor, a nuclear protein that functions as a transcriptional corepressor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is a key component of the non-canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1.1), which plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression through histone modification. The BCOR protein is characterized by several domains, including the BCL-6 binding domain and the Polycomb-group RING finger homolog (PCGF) ubiquitin-like fold discriminator (PUFD) domain, which are essential for its interactions with other proteins and its function in transcriptional regulation (Wong2020Structure; Aldera2020Gene). BCOR is crucial for normal embryonic development and differentiation, and its mutations are implicated in various developmental disorders and cancers, highlighting its dual role as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene in different contexts (Hamline2020OFCD; Kelly2019Bcor).

## Structure
The BCOR protein is composed of 1755 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 192 kDa (Aldera2020Gene). It contains several key domains, including the BCL-6 binding domain and the Polycomb-group RING finger homolog (PCGF) ubiquitin-like fold discriminator (PUFD) domain. The PUFD domain is crucial for binding to the RING finger and WD40-associated ubiquitin-like domain of PCGF proteins, facilitating the formation of the noncanonical PRC1.1 complex (Wong2020Structure; Aldera2020Gene). The BCOR PUFD is characterized by a β-sheet structure that is disordered in the absence of PCGF1, but becomes ordered upon binding, which is essential for stable association with KDM2B (Wong2020Structure).

The BCOR protein also includes ankyrin (ANK) repeats, which are necessary for stable assembly with KDM2B/SKP1, highlighting the importance of these repeats and the linker region in its structure (Wong2020Structure). BCOR has splice variants, such as BCoR-S, which encodes a shorter protein of 1004 amino acids and lacks the ankyrin repeats present in the full-length protein (Huynh2000BCoR).

## Function
The BCOR gene encodes a nuclear protein that functions as a transcriptional corepressor, primarily interacting with BCL-6 to modulate gene expression. BCOR is a component of the non-canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1.1), which plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression by ubiquitinating histone H2A at lysine 119, a modification essential for chromatin structure and gene expression regulation (Astolfi2019BCOR; Aldera2020Gene). This activity is vital for the epigenetic silencing of several genes, including those in the HOX group, and is involved in maintaining normal cellular processes and development (Aldera2020Gene).

BCOR is essential for normal embryonic development and differentiation of embryonic stem cells into ectoderm, mesoderm, and hematopoietic lineages (Wamstad2008Role). It regulates hematopoietic stem cell-associated transcriptional networks, maintaining normal myeloid differentiation and preventing leukaemogenesis (Kelly2019Bcor). BCOR's function is highly tissue-specific, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while having pro-oncogenic roles in others (Kelly2019Bcor). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences various developmental processes and is critical for the formation of primitive erythrocytes and the development of B and T cells (Astolfi2019BCOR).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BCOR gene are associated with several diseases and conditions, primarily due to its role in the Polycomb-group repressive complex 1.1 (PRC1.1). Oculofaciocardiodental syndrome (OFCD) is a rare X-linked developmental disorder caused by heterozygous mutations in BCOR, leading to craniofacial, skeletal, and cardiovascular defects in females, while hemizygous mutations in males result in embryonic lethality (Hamline2020OFCD). BCOR mutations are also linked to Lenz Microphthalmia syndrome, characterized by microphthalmia, mental retardation, and cardiac anomalies (Hamline2020OFCD).

In cancer, BCOR mutations can act as either oncogenic or tumor suppressor, depending on the context. In myeloid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), BCOR mutations lead to disruptions in PRC1.1 complex assembly, contributing to oncogenic signaling (Schaefer2022BCOR). In clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK), internal tandem duplications in BCOR result in oncogenic gain-of-function mutations, disrupting normal PRC1.1 interactions and leading to tumorigenesis (Roy2015Recurrent). These mutations highlight the critical role of BCOR in maintaining normal cellular processes and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
BCOR (BCL6 corepressor) is a transcriptional corepressor that interacts with several proteins to regulate gene expression. It was initially identified as a binding partner for the BCL6 protein, specifically interacting with the BCL6 BTB domain. The minimal binding domain of BCOR for BCL6 is located at residues 498-514, and this interaction is crucial for BCOR's role in transcriptional repression (Ghetu2008Structure). BCOR competes with other corepressors like SMRT and NCoR for binding to the BCL6 BTB domain, despite lacking sequence similarity with these proteins (Ghetu2008Structure).

BCOR also interacts with components of the Polycomb group proteins, particularly through its PUFD (PCGF1-binding Ubiquitin Fold Domain). This domain binds selectively to the RAWUL domain of PCGF1 and PCGF3, facilitating the assembly of noncanonical Polycomb repression complex 1 (PRC1.1) (Junco2013Structure; Wong2020Structure). The interaction with PCGF1 is essential for the formation of a dRAF-like complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression (Junco2013Structure).

BCOR's interactions are critical for its function in transcriptional regulation and have implications in various diseases, including lymphomas and developmental disorders (Wong2020Structure; Ghetu2008Structure).
