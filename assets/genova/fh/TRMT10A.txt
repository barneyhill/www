# TRMT10A

## Overview
TRMT10A is a gene that encodes the protein tRNA methyltransferase 10A, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules, specifically catalyzing the N1-methylation of guanosine at position 9 (m1G9) in tRNA. This modification is crucial for maintaining tRNA stability and function, thereby ensuring proper protein synthesis and cellular function (Cosentino2018Pancreatic; Igoillo-Esteve2013tRNA). TRMT10A is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, reflecting its role in tRNA processing. Beyond its role in tRNA methylation, TRMT10A also interacts with the mRNA demethylase FTO, influencing mRNA stability and gene expression through modulation of m6A methylation levels (Ontiveros2020Coordination). Mutations in the TRMT10A gene have been linked to a syndrome characterized by young onset diabetes, short stature, and microcephaly, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Igoillo-Esteve2013tRNA).

## Function
TRMT10A is a tRNA methyltransferase responsible for the N1-methylation of guanosine at position 9 (m1G9) in tRNA molecules, a modification crucial for tRNA stability and function. This enzyme is predominantly localized in the nucleolus, aligning with its role in tRNA modification, as tRNA transcription and early processing occur in the nucleus (Igoillo-Esteve2013tRNA). TRMT10A's activity is essential for maintaining the integrity of tRNA, preventing fragmentation, and ensuring proper translational fidelity (Cosentino2018Pancreatic; Ontiveros2020Coordination).

In healthy human cells, TRMT10A methylates several tRNAs, including tRNA Gln and tRNA iMet, which are critical for normal cellular function (Howell2019Distinct; Cosentino2018Pancreatic). The enzyme's function is particularly important in pancreatic β-cells, where its deficiency can lead to tRNA hypomethylation and fragmentation, contributing to β-cell apoptosis and diabetes (Cosentino2018Pancreatic). TRMT10A also interacts with the mRNA demethylase FTO, influencing mRNA stability and gene expression by modulating m6A methylation levels (Ontiveros2020Coordination). This dual role in tRNA and mRNA methylation highlights TRMT10A's broader impact on cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRMT10A gene are associated with a syndrome characterized by young onset diabetes, short stature, and microcephaly with intellectual disability. A specific nonsense mutation, c.379 G.A; p.Arg127Stop, has been identified in a consanguineous family, leading to the absence of TRMT10A mRNA and protein, which results in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and/or transcriptional silencing (Igoillo-Esteve2013tRNA). TRMT10A deficiency is linked to tRNA hypomethylation and fragmentation, particularly affecting tRNA Gln, which is associated with increased apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. This contributes to the development of diabetes by reducing β-cell mass and function (Cosentino2018Pancreatic).

The gene's expression is enriched in the brain and pancreatic islets, suggesting its role in neuronal and pancreatic β-cell function. TRMT10A mutations may also impact neuronal development, contributing to microcephaly (Igoillo-Esteve2013tRNA). In some cases, TRMT10A mutations have been linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders and early-onset diabetes, with increased oxidative stress and apoptosis in β-cells being significant contributors to these conditions (Vilardo2020Functional; Cosentino2018Pancreatic). The clinical significance of TRMT10A mutations underscores their potential impact on understanding the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and related neurological disorders (Igoillo-Esteve2013tRNA).

## Interactions
TRMT10A, a tRNA methyltransferase, is known to interact with the mRNA demethylase FTO, forming a functional axis that influences mRNA stability and decay through m6A modifications. This interaction is facilitated by RNA and has been confirmed through various experimental techniques, including immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (Ontiveros2020Coordination). TRMT10A enhances FTO's demethylation activity on m6A sites in polyadenylated RNA, increasing FTO's activity threefold in vitro (Ontiveros2020Coordination). 

The interaction between TRMT10A and FTO is specific, as TRMT10A does not interact with another mRNA m6A demethylase, ALKBH5 (Ontiveros2020Coordination). This specificity suggests a unique role for TRMT10A in modulating m6A levels and influencing mRNA decay, potentially through the YTHDF2 protein, which recognizes m6A-containing transcripts (Ontiveros2020Coordination). 

TRMT10A's role extends beyond its catalytic activity, as both wild-type and catalytic-inactive variants of TRMT10A can restore m6A levels, indicating that its impact on m6A is not solely dependent on its enzymatic function (Ontiveros2020Coordination). These interactions highlight TRMT10A's involvement in coordinating RNA modifications and its potential impact on gene expression.
