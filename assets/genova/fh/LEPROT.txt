# LEPROT

## Overview
The LEPROT gene encodes a protein known as endospanin, which is integral to the regulation of leptin receptor signaling. Endospanin is a transmembrane protein characterized by a four-helix bundle structure, playing a crucial role in endosomal trafficking and the modulation of leptin receptor surface expression. This protein is distinct from the leptin receptor itself and is involved in various cellular processes, including energy balance and appetite control, by influencing leptin receptor signaling pathways. LEPROT's evolutionary conservation across species highlights its fundamental biological importance. Additionally, LEPROT is implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts, such as metabolic disorders and cancer, where it affects receptor signaling and cellular interactions within the tumor microenvironment (Wang2022SINE; Li2021Leptin; Londraville2017On).

## Structure
The LEPROT gene encodes a protein known as endospanin, which is involved in the regulation of leptin receptor signaling. The protein is composed of 131 amino acids and is distinct from the leptin receptor (LEPR) in its primary sequence (Londraville2017On). The structure of endospanin includes a four-helix transmembrane bundle, which features a highly conserved hydrophobic core. This structural motif is crucial for its function in regulating endosomal trafficking and surface expression of the leptin receptor (Londraville2017On). 

Endospanin is homologous to the yeast vesicle trafficking gene VPS55, indicating its role in vesicle trafficking processes (Londraville2017On). The protein's conservation across various species, including fungi and plants, underscores its evolutionary significance (Londraville2017On). While specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of LEPROT are not provided, the protein's interaction with the leptin receptor suggests potential sites for protein-protein interactions, which may be influenced by such modifications (Londraville2017On). The genomic proximity of LEPROT to LEPR in vertebrates, except teleost fishes, suggests a coevolutionary relationship that affects leptin receptor expression (Londraville2017On).

## Function
The LEPROT gene, also known as endospanin, plays a crucial role in regulating leptin receptor signaling, which is vital for energy balance and appetite control. LEPROT is transcribed from an alternate start site within the leptin receptor gene (LEPR) and produces a protein that does not share a primary sequence with LEPR. It is involved in regulating endosomal trafficking and the surface expression of the leptin receptor, thereby modulating cellular responses to leptin (Londraville2017On). In vertebrates, knockout of LEPROT results in increased surface expression of leptin receptors, making cells hyperresponsive to leptin and resistant to diet-induced obesity. This suggests that LEPROT negatively correlates with LEPR protein expression and may control tissue-specific expression of LEPR (Londraville2017On).

LEPROT interacts with small G-proteins Rab13 and Rab8, which are critical for trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and other cell compartments, indicating a broader role beyond just regulating leptin receptor protein (Londraville2017On). The conservation of LEPROT across various species, including fungi and plants, underscores its evolutionary importance and suggests a fundamental role in cellular processes (Londraville2017On).

## Clinical Significance
The LEPROT gene, also known as the leptin receptor overlapping transcript, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, LEPROT expression is significantly aberrant across multiple cancer types, being downregulated in some, such as bladder and breast cancers, and upregulated in others, like cholangiocarcinoma and glioblastoma. These expression changes are associated with the tumor microenvironment and may influence cancer progression and patient prognosis (Li2021Leptin). LEPROT expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and cancer-associated fibroblasts, suggesting a role in modulating the immune response within tumors (Li2021Leptin).

In metabolic disorders, LEPROT is involved in regulating leptin sensitivity, and its expression is negatively correlated with leptin receptors. This relationship suggests that alterations in LEPROT expression could impact metabolic processes, potentially contributing to obesity and related conditions (Wang2022SINE). Additionally, energy restriction studies in mouse models have shown that changes in LEPROT methylation and expression may play a role in breast cancer development, highlighting its potential involvement in cancer and metabolic disease pathways (Cicekdal2019Effects).

## Interactions
LEPROT, also known as endospanin, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with small G-proteins Rab13 and Rab8, which are essential for trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and other cellular compartments. This interaction suggests that LEPROT plays a broader role in cellular trafficking beyond just regulating the leptin receptor (Londraville2017On).

In the context of cancer, LEPROT is associated with various signaling pathways and proteins within the tumor microenvironment. It is positively correlated with toll-like receptor (TLR) signals and interacts with tumor-infiltrating immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) has shown that LEPROT is linked to inflammatory and immune response pathways, including IL6_JAK_STAT3 signaling and TNF-alpha signaling via NFKB. LEPROT-related genes include IL6ST, with JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3 being downstream molecules, indicating that LEPROT's interactions in the tumor microenvironment might be mediated by the IL6ST/JAK1/2/STAT3 signaling pathway (Li2021Leptin).

These interactions highlight LEPROT's role in modulating receptor signaling and its potential impact on cellular processes related to metabolism and cancer progression.
