# B2M

## Overview
Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) is a gene that encodes the protein beta-2-microglobulin, a non-glycosylated polypeptide that plays a crucial role in the immune system. The B2M protein is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are expressed on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells. It is essential for the structural stability and surface expression of MHC class I molecules, facilitating the presentation of peptide antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thereby playing a pivotal role in immune surveillance and defense against intracellular pathogens (Li2016The). Beyond its immunological functions, B2M is involved in various physiological processes, including bone metabolism and iron homeostasis. Clinically, alterations in the B2M gene are associated with several diseases, including cancer, where they can influence prognosis and treatment resistance (Zhang2021B2M; He2022B2M).

## Structure
Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) is a non-glycosylated single polypeptide chain composed of 119 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 11,800 Da (Zhang2002Microarray). It is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are expressed on the surface of almost all nucleated cells (Shi2021Association). The primary structure of B2M consists of a single polypeptide chain of 99 amino acids (Shi2021Association). Its secondary structure includes beta sheets, forming a beta-barrel, which is a common feature in immunoglobulin-like domains (Parham1987Localization). The tertiary structure of B2M is stabilized by disulfide bonds, although the formation of certain epitopes does not rely on these bonds (Parham1987Localization). B2M does not form a quaternary structure on its own but associates with the heavy chain of MHC class I molecules, contributing to their structural stability and cell surface expression (Shi2021Association). B2M is secreted into circulation and eliminated by the kidneys, and it is studied as a biomarker of renal function (Shi2021Association).

## Function
Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) is a critical component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are present on the surface of nearly all nucleated cells. It plays a vital role in the immune system by stabilizing the structure of MHC class I molecules, facilitating the presentation of peptide antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (Li2016The). This process is essential for immune surveillance and the defense against intracellular pathogens (Li2016The).

B2M is involved in the initial folding and surface expression of various MHC I-like molecules, including the human hemochromatosis protein (HFE), which regulates iron uptake (Li2016The). It also plays a role in the function of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which protects IgG and albumin from degradation, thereby extending their half-lives (Li2016The). B2M is necessary for the surface expression of FcRn and facilitates the pH-dependent binding of IgG (Junghans1996The).

In addition to its role in immune function, B2M is involved in the regulation of bone metabolism and iron homeostasis. It can induce calcium efflux from bone tissue and is implicated in the catabolism of immunoglobulins and albumin (Li2016The). B2M's multifunctional roles highlight its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and various physiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the B2M gene are associated with various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer. In gliomas, high B2M expression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with specific genomic alterations such as chr7 amplification and chr10 deletion, which are significant in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Zhang2021B2M). B2M overexpression in gliomas correlates with increased mutations in genes like IDH1, TTN, ATRX, EGFR, and PTEN, and is linked to immune and stromal signatures, indicating its role in the malignancy and immune environment of these tumors (Zhang2021B2M).

In colorectal carcinomas, particularly microsatellite-unstable (MSU) types, B2M mutations are associated with resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies. These mutations contribute to a higher driver mutation load and are linked to immune evasion by tumor cells (Yeon2019Immune). Similarly, in metastatic melanoma, B2M mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are associated with resistance to checkpoint blockade therapies, leading to poorer overall survival (SadeFeldman2017Resistance).

In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), B2M mutations result in impaired MHC-I assembly and decreased expression of HLA class I and II, contributing to immune evasion and poor prognosis (He2022B2M). These mutations are linked to reduced infiltration of CD8+ T cells, further indicating their role in immune tolerance and tumor progression (He2022B2M).

## Interactions
Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) is a component of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing the MHC class I heavy chain and facilitating its interaction with peptide antigens. B2M interacts with the heavy chain of MHC class I molecules to form a stable complex that is essential for presenting peptide antigens to CD8+ T cells. This interaction is critical for the immune response, as it allows for the recognition and destruction of infected or malignant cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Pedersen1995The).

The interaction between B2M and MHC class I molecules is species-specific. For instance, mouse natural killer (NK) cell receptor Ly49A requires mouse B2M for effective binding to its MHC class I ligand, H-2D^d. Human B2M, although capable of associating with mouse MHC class I molecules, does not support the same interactions, highlighting the importance of species-specific determinants in B2M's role (Matsumoto2001The).

Human B2M can induce conformational changes in mouse MHC class I molecules, affecting their antigenicity and serological reactivity. This interaction can alter the structural flexibility of the MHC class I molecules, impacting their ability to present a diverse array of peptides (Nieto1989The).
