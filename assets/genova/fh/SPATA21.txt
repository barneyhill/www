# SPATA21

## Overview
SPATA21 is a gene that encodes the protein spermatogenesis associated 21, which plays a significant role in the process of spermatogenesis. The protein is implicated in various cellular pathways, including mTOR signaling and immune system regulation, suggesting its involvement in complex biological networks (Kolur2020Transcriptome). While the precise molecular functions of the SPATA21 protein remain to be fully characterized, it has been identified in protein interaction studies, such as those involving PKA-RIα during mouse spermiogenesis (Shi2021Yeast). Additionally, SPATA21 has been noted in genomic studies, including its involvement in a fusion gene event with RASA2 in Sézary syndrome, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Prasad2016Identification).

## Interactions
SPATA21, a gene associated with spermatogenesis, has been identified in various studies as participating in protein interactions, although specific details about these interactions are limited. In a yeast two-hybrid screen conducted to identify proteins interacting with PKA-RIα during mouse spermiogenesis, SPATA21 was identified as one of the proteins potentially interacting with PKA-RIα. However, the specific interactions of SPATA21 with other proteins or nucleic acids were not detailed in the study (Shi2021Yeast).

In the context of coronary artery disease, SPATA21 was identified as a hub gene in a protein-protein interaction network analysis. This analysis highlighted SPATA21's involvement in pathways such as mTOR signaling and regulation of immune system processes, suggesting its potential role in complex interaction networks, although specific protein partners were not mentioned (Kolur2020Transcriptome).

Additionally, SPATA21 was involved in a fusion gene event with RASA2 in Sézary syndrome, indicating a possible interaction at the genomic level, though the functional implications of this fusion remain to be fully elucidated (Prasad2016Identification).
