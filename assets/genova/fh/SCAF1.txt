# SCAF1

## Overview
SCAF1, or SR-related CTD associated factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, including pre-mRNA splicing and mitochondrial function. The SCAF1 protein is categorized as a splicing factor due to its role in interacting with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, which is essential for the regulation of alternative splicing and gene expression (Kontos2011SCAF1). Additionally, SCAF1 plays a significant role in the formation and stability of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, particularly through its interaction with complexes III2 and IV, which is vital for efficient cellular respiration and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Calvo2020Functional; Calvo2019Functional). The dual functionality of SCAF1 in both nuclear and mitochondrial contexts underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various diseases, including cancer and mitochondrial disorders (Calvo2020Functional; Martinez2024In).

## Function
The SCAF1 gene, also known as SR-A1, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing by interacting with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. This interaction is essential for the regulation of alternative splicing, a process that generates protein diversity by allowing a single gene to produce multiple protein isoforms. The SCAF1 protein contains an Arg/Ser-rich domain, characteristic of splicing factors, which is involved in this regulatory function. It is predicted to localize to the nucleus, where it participates in the splicing of pre-mRNA, thus playing a significant role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation (Kontos2011SCAF1).

In healthy human cells, SCAF1 is widely expressed across various tissues, with particularly high levels in the fetal brain and liver. Its function in RNA processing is essential for normal cellular function and the regulation of gene expression. The protein's nuclear localization and involvement in splicing suggest a fundamental role in maintaining normal cellular processes. Despite the lack of specific in vivo expression data for the human SCAF1 protein, its conserved function across species, as indicated by its homology with mouse and rat Scaf1 proteins, underscores its importance in cellular biology (Kontos2011SCAF1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SCAF1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). SCAF1 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene in PDAC, and its knockout in pancreatic cancer cells can lead to premature polyadenylation, resulting in shorter protein isoforms that may contribute to tumorigenesis (Martinez2024In). The loss of SCAF1 is associated with increased tumor proliferation and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for PDAC treatment (Martinez2024In). 

In PDAC, mutations and homozygous deletions of SCAF1 are rare, but shallow deletions, indicative of heterozygous loss, are more common and associated with reduced gene expression and shorter overall survival in patients. This suggests that SCAF1 may function in a haploinsufficient manner, contributing to cancer progression (Martinez2024In). 

Beyond cancer, SCAF1 is also involved in the structural organization of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes. Mutations in SCAF1 can lead to impaired mitochondrial function, increased oxidative stress, and altered respiratory performance, which may have implications for other diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction (Calvo2020Functional).

## Interactions
SCAF1 (SR-related CTD associated factor 1) is involved in the formation and stability of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, particularly through its interaction with complexes III2 and IV within the respirasome. This interaction is crucial for the structural attachment between these complexes, enhancing NADH-dependent respiration and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Calvo2020Functional; Calvo2019Functional). SCAF1 is the only detectable assembly factor present in supercomplexes containing complexes III and IV, indicating its specific role in these interactions (Calvo2020Functional).

SCAF1 also interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II, suggesting its involvement in pre-mRNA splicing as part of the human SR superfamily of pre-mRNA splicing factors (Martinez2024In). This interaction may regulate the expression of other proteins, such as USP15, a known tumor suppressor, by influencing the splicing process. The loss of SCAF1 has been associated with altered gene expression profiles, indicating its role in regulating various signaling pathways (Martinez2024In).

These interactions highlight SCAF1's dual role in both mitochondrial function and gene expression regulation, underscoring its importance in cellular bioenergetics and transcriptional processes.
