# SOX13

## Overview
SOX13 is a gene that encodes the SRY-box transcription factor 13, a member of the SOX (SRY-related HMG-box) family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their ability to bind DNA and regulate gene expression, playing crucial roles in various developmental and cellular processes. SOX13, in particular, is involved in T-cell development and endothelial cell function, acting as a transcriptional regulator that influences cell differentiation and response to mechanical stimuli. It functions as a Wnt/TCF signaling antagonist in T-cells and as a flow-sensitive transcription factor in endothelial cells, contributing to vascular homeostasis. The dysregulation of SOX13 has been implicated in several cancers, where it may act as an oncogene, influencing tumor progression and metastasis (Demos2022Sox13; Chew2009The; Du2020SOX13).

## Function
SOX13 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various biological processes, particularly in T-cell development and endothelial cell function. In T-cell differentiation, SOX13 promotes the development of the gammaDelta lineage from progenitors while suppressing differentiation to the alphaBeta lineage. This is achieved by inhibiting Wnt signaling through antagonizing T-cell factor 1 (TCF1), rather than directly interacting with beta-catenin (Chew2009The; Kormish2009Interactions). SOX13 also downregulates TCF1 target genes, such as Ly49a, in T cells, and its absence leads to increased thymocyte proliferation, indicating its role as a Wnt/TCF signaling antagonist (Chew2009The).

In endothelial cells, SOX13 functions as a flow-sensitive transcription factor that helps maintain a non-inflammatory state by repressing the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL5 and CXCL10. This repression is crucial for preventing endothelial inflammation and maintaining vascular homeostasis, which is important for preventing atherosclerosis (Demos2022Sox13). SOX13 is predominantly expressed in the nucleus of endothelial cells and is upregulated under stable flow conditions, highlighting its role in responding to mechanical stimuli in the vascular environment (Demos2022Sox13).

## Clinical Significance
The SOX13 gene has been implicated in several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SOX13 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to non-tumor tissues, and its high expression is associated with poor differentiation, metastasis, recurrence, and overall poor survival. SOX13 promotes HCC cell invasion, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by activating Twist1 transcription, suggesting its role as an oncogene and potential prognostic marker in HCC (Feng2020Sox13).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), SOX13 is significantly overexpressed and linked to aggressive cancer features and poor prognosis. It promotes CRC metastasis by transactivating SNAI2 and c-MET, which are crucial for EMT and cancer cell migration. SOX13 expression is induced by the HGF/STAT3 signaling pathway, and targeting this pathway with the c-MET inhibitor crizotinib has shown potential in reducing CRC metastasis (Du2020SOX13).

In breast cancer, SOX13 is highly expressed and associated with immune infiltration and drug resistance. Its expression correlates with poor overall survival and is linked to immune system interactions, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Gao2024SOX13).

## Interactions
SOX13 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple cellular processes. In glioma endothelial cells, SOX13 is part of a regulatory feedback loop involving FUS, circ_002136, and miR-138-5p. It is negatively regulated by miR-138-5p, which binds to the 3'-UTR of SOX13, inhibiting its expression. Circ_002136 acts as a molecular sponge for miR-138-5p, indirectly promoting SOX13 expression. SOX13 also binds to the FUS promoter region, up-regulating FUS expression and forming a positive feedback loop that enhances glioma angiogenesis (He2019FUScirc002136miR1385pSOX13).

In colorectal cancer, SOX13 interacts with the HGF/STAT3 signaling pathway, leading to the transactivation of SNAI2 and c-MET, which are crucial for cancer metastasis. SOX13 binds to the promoters of these genes, enhancing their expression and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Du2020SOX13).

In T-cell development, SOX13 interacts with TCF1, potentially preventing β-catenin from binding to TCF1 and repressing Wnt target gene expression. This interaction suggests that SOX13 modulates Wnt signaling pathways, particularly in the context of T-cell development (Bernard2010Acquisition; Kormish2009Interactions).
