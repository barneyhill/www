# TNK2

## Overview
The TNK2 gene encodes the protein tyrosine kinase non-receptor 2, commonly referred to as Activated CDC42-associated Kinase 1 (ACK1), which is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes. This kinase is characterized by its complex multidomain structure, including domains such as the sterile alpha motif (SAM), kinase domain, and Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which facilitate its diverse functional roles (Kan2023Domain; Tahir2021ProximityDependent). TNK2 plays a critical role in intracellular signal transduction, particularly in pathways related to endocytosis, receptor trafficking, and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is implicated in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), and is involved in the phosphorylation of proteins like AKT1 and histone H4, influencing cellular signaling and function (Tahir2021ProximityDependent). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with various cancers, where its overexpression or mutation can contribute to tumor progression and poor prognosis (Mahajan2018Blockade; Howlin2008TNK2).

## Structure
The TNK2 gene encodes the non-receptor tyrosine kinase known as Ack1, which has a complex multidomain structure. The primary structure of TNK2 includes a sequence of amino acids that form various domains, such as the sterile alpha motif (SAM), kinase domain, Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding (CRIB) domain (Kan2023Domain; Tahir2021ProximityDependent). The secondary structure features typical elements like alpha helices and beta sheets, particularly within the kinase domain, which adopts a bi-lobed structure with an N-terminal lobe containing an α-C helix and a β-sheet (Kan2023Domain).

The tertiary structure of TNK2 is characterized by its three-dimensional folding, which includes specific domains that facilitate its interactions and functions. The SAM domain is involved in dimerization and protein-protein interactions, while the CRIB domain specifically binds to the small GTPase Cdc42 (Kan2023Domain). The UBA domain is crucial for ubiquitin binding and interaction with p62/SQSTM1, affecting EGFR trafficking (Kan2023Domain).

TNK2 can form homodimers via its N-terminal SAM domain, indicating a quaternary structure that is important for its function (Tahir2021ProximityDependent). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in its activation and function (Kan2023Domain). The presence of splice variant isoforms may also influence TNK2's functional diversity and interactions.

## Function
The TNK2 gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, also known as Activated CDC42-associated Kinase 1 (ACK1), which plays a significant role in intracellular signal transduction. In healthy human cells, TNK2 is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle-mediated endocytosis and the recycling of surface receptors, particularly receptor tyrosine kinases such as the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Insulin receptor, and AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (Tahir2021ProximityDependent). TNK2 regulates protein expression and kinase activity by binding to various ubiquitin ligases, which control its degradation (Tahir2021ProximityDependent).

TNK2 interacts with proteins like clathrin for endocytosis and sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) for autophagy, suggesting its involvement in pathways regulating receptor tyrosine kinase trafficking, endocytosis, and cell adhesion (Tahir2021ProximityDependent). It can phosphorylate AKT1 and histone H4, influencing their functions, and is activated by SRC-mediated phosphorylation (Tahir2021ProximityDependent). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and membrane, where it interacts with other proteins to regulate endocytosis and cytoskeletal dynamics (Tahir2021ProximityDependent). These interactions suggest that TNK2 plays a crucial role in maintaining normal signaling pathways and cellular processes in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
The TNK2 gene, also known as ACK1, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation, survival, and migration. In breast cancer, TNK2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced cancer cell invasion by preserving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression on the cell surface, which promotes migration and invasion of cancer cells (Howlin2008TNK2). In prostate cancer, TNK2 is crucial for the survival of prostate cancer stem-like cells, contributing to the progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Mahajan2018Blockade).

TNK2 mutations and alterations are also observed in endometrial cancer, with somatic mutations found in various subtypes, including serous and endometrioid tumors (Rudd2014Mutational). In osteosarcoma, TNK2 is a transcriptional target of ZNF692, and its expression correlates with poor survival outcomes, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker (Zheng2024ZNF692). In colon cancer, high TNK2 expression is linked to worse prognosis and is associated with immune cell infiltration, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Kong2022Identification).

## Interactions
TNK2, also known as ACK1, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular processes and viral infections. TNK2 interacts with WASL (N-WASP) and NCK1, forming a pathway essential for the entry of picornaviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). In this pathway, TNK2 phosphorylates WASL, enhancing its actin nucleation activity, while NCK1 is thought to recruit WASL to TNK2 for activation (Jiang2019Entry). 

Biochemical assays have demonstrated direct binding between TNK2 and NCK1, as well as between WASL and NCK1. Co-localization studies show that TNK2 forms puncta in the cytoplasm, with NCK1 co-localizing when co-expressed (Jiang2019Entry). TNK2 is also involved in endocytosis and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, interacting with proteins such as CLINT1, CLTC, CTTN, and GAK, which are involved in these pathways (Tahir2021ProximityDependent). 

The proximity-dependent biotinylation method has identified novel TNK2 interactors, including CLINT1, TTI1, and NOXA1, suggesting a broader role in cellular signaling and endocytic processes (Tahir2021ProximityDependent). These interactions highlight TNK2's involvement in both viral entry and cellular signaling pathways.
