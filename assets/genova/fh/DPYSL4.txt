# DPYSL4

## Overview
DPYSL4 is a gene that encodes the dihydropyrimidinase-like 4 protein, a member of the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family. This protein is primarily involved in neuronal development and axonal guidance, playing a significant role in synaptic physiology and neurodevelopment. As a CRMP family member, dihydropyrimidinase-like 4 is characterized by a conserved CRMP domain and is involved in regulating ion currents and synaptic plasticity, particularly through its interactions with presynaptic and postsynaptic machinery. It also influences cellular energy metabolism and redox balance, being a p53-inducible gene associated with oxidative phosphorylation. The protein's ability to form dimers or oligomers is crucial for its function in maintaining synapse structure and function. Mutations in the DPYSL4 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including intellectual disability and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Desprez2023Contribution; Quach2020Intellectual; Jiang2019Glycolysis).

## Structure
DPYSL4, a member of the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family, plays a crucial role in neuronal development and axonal guidance. The protein is characterized by a conserved CRMP domain, which is integral to its function. Structurally, DPYSL4 features regions rich in beta-sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions within cellular pathways.

In terms of quaternary structure, DPYSL4 has the potential to form dimers or oligomers, which may be important for its biological function. These structural formations can affect how the protein interacts with other molecules and participates in signaling pathways. The ability to dimerize or oligomerize is a common feature within the CRMP family, suggesting a conserved mechanism of action across different family members. The specific structural details of DPYSL4, including its beta-sheet-rich regions and potential for oligomerization, underscore its role in the complex processes of neuronal development and axonal guidance.

## Function
DPYSL4, a member of the dihydropyrimidinase-like protein family, plays a significant role in synaptic physiology and neurodevelopment. It is involved in synaptic plasticity by interacting with both presynaptic and postsynaptic machinery, and it regulates ion currents, particularly facilitating the depolarization-evoked Ca2+ response of L-and N-type Ca2+ channels. This activity promotes dendrite morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role in synaptic architecture and activity (Desprez2023Contribution).

DPYSL4 is also implicated in the trafficking of AMPA and NMDA receptors, which are crucial for synaptic strength and plasticity. It interacts with cytoskeletal and synaptic scaffolding proteins, indicating its involvement in maintaining synapse structure and function (Desprez2023Contribution).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, DPYSL4 is involved in cellular energy metabolism and redox balance. It is a p53-inducible gene associated with oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energy supply. Silencing DPYSL4 results in decreased ATP levels and increased reactive oxygen species, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and reducing oxidative stress (Rao2023Activation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the DPYSL4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of intellectual disability (ID), DPYSL4, also known as CRMP3, is considered a novel candidate gene. It is located on chromosome 10q26, a region associated with 10q25-10qter deletion syndrome, which presents with ID, ADHD, craniofacial anomalies, growth failure, and congenital heart defects. The gene's involvement in dendrite maintenance suggests its role in the dendritic anomalies observed in ID (Quach2020Intellectual).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), DPYSL4 is identified as a dangerous prognostic indicator. Its expression is significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Mutations in DPYSL4, including gene amplification, missense, and truncation mutations, have been observed in HCC patients, indicating its potential clinical significance in cancer prognosis (Jiang2019Glycolysis).

DPYSL4 is also involved in synaptic physiology and neurodevelopmental disorders. It plays a role in synaptic plasticity and dendrite morphogenesis, with its loss leading to dysregulation of synaptic transmission-related gene expression, affecting synaptic plasticity (Desprez2023Contribution).

## Interactions
DPYSL4, a member of the dihydropyrimidinase-like protein family, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular structures and dynamics. One notable interaction is with tubulin, where DPYSL4 inhibits microtubule polymerization, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal regulation (Desprez2023Contribution). This interaction highlights its potential impact on cellular architecture and dynamics, particularly in the nervous system.

DPYSL4 also plays a role in synaptic physiology by facilitating the depolarization-evoked Ca2+ response of L-and N-type Ca2+ channels, which promotes dendrite morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons (Desprez2023Contribution). This suggests that DPYSL4 is involved in regulating ion currents and synaptic activity, although specific details on its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided in the available context.

While the context does not provide extensive details on the physical interactions of DPYSL4 with other proteins or nucleic acids, it is clear that DPYSL4, like other DPYSL proteins, interacts with cytoskeletal components and influences synaptic architecture and activity. Further studies are suggested to explore these interactions in more detail (Desprez2023Contribution).
