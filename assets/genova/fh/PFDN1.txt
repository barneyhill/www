# PFDN1

## Overview
PFDN1 is a gene that encodes the protein prefoldin subunit 1, which is a crucial component of the prefoldin complex, a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding. The prefoldin complex is a heterohexameric structure that plays a significant role in the stabilization and transport of unfolded proteins, particularly cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, within the cell (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear; Liang2020The). Prefoldin subunit 1, along with other subunits, forms a jellyfish-like structure that captures and delivers unfolded polypeptides to the chaperonin CCT for proper folding, a process essential for maintaining cellular integrity and preventing protein aggregation (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear; Arranz2018Structure). This protein is particularly important in cellular stress responses and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, due to its role in protein homeostasis and cellular signaling pathways (PayánBravo2018Functional; Wang2016Prefoldin).

## Structure
The PFDN1 gene encodes the prefoldin subunit 1, which is a component of the prefoldin complex, a heterohexameric structure involved in protein folding. The prefoldin complex has a jellyfish-like structure with a base composed of double beta barrels and six coiled-coil tentacles, which are crucial for its function in stabilizing and transporting unfolded proteins (MartínBenito2007Divergent; Liang2020The). The primary structure of PFDN1 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, although detailed sequence information is not provided in the context.

The secondary structure of PFDN1 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, as is common in proteins with coiled-coil domains. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional arrangement of these elements, contributing to the formation of the prefoldin complex's characteristic tentacle-like extensions (Arranz2018Structure). In terms of quaternary structure, PFDN1 assembles with other prefoldin subunits, specifically PFDN2, PFDN3, PFDN4, PFDN5, and PFDN6, to form the functional prefoldin complex (Liang2020The).

Post-translational modifications of PFDN1 may include phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the prefoldin complex. However, specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context.

## Function
PFDN1 (prefoldin subunit 1) is a component of the prefoldin complex, a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in the folding of newly synthesized proteins. This complex is essential for the proper assembly of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are vital for maintaining cellular structure and function (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear; Liang2020The). PFDN1, along with other subunits, forms a heterohexameric structure that binds to immature or unstable proteins, stabilizing them until they can be correctly folded or transferred to other components of the cellular folding machinery (Liang2020The).

In healthy human cells, PFDN1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it assists in cytoskeletal organization and cellular stress responses (PayánBravo2018Functional). The prefoldin complex, including PFDN1, captures unfolded polypeptides and delivers them to the chaperonin CCT for proper folding, a process crucial for cytoskeleton assembly and cellular integrity (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear). This activity is not ATP-dependent, which distinguishes it from many other chaperone proteins (Liang2020The). The prefoldin complex also plays a role in preventing protein aggregation, particularly in brain cells, which is significant in conditions like Alzheimer's disease (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
PFDN1 (prefoldin subunit 1) is implicated in the progression of several cancers, including lung, colorectal, and breast cancers, due to its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. In lung cancer, PFDN1 overexpression is associated with increased tumor growth and metastasis. It functions by suppressing cyclin A expression, which is crucial for maintaining the epithelial phenotype, thereby promoting EMT and enhancing cell migration and invasion (Wang2016Prefoldin). PFDN1's involvement in the TGF-β1 signaling pathway further underscores its role in lung cancer progression (Wang2016Prefoldin).

In colorectal cancer, PFDN1 is upregulated and correlates with tumor size and invasion, serving as an indicator of poor prognosis. Silencing PFDN1 in colorectal cancer cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation and motility, attributed to G2/M cell cycle blockage and cytoskeletal deficiencies (Wang2015PFDN1). 

PFDN1 is also linked to neurodegenerative diseases, where it helps prevent protein aggregation and maintains neuronal cell activity. Deficiencies in PFDN1 can lead to cerebellar neuron loss, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopmental processes (Liang2020The).

## Interactions
PFDN1, a subunit of the prefoldin complex, participates in several critical protein interactions. It is a component of the hexameric prefoldin complex, which includes subunits PFDN2, PFDN3, PFDN4, PFDN5, and PFDN6. This complex assists in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin by interacting with the cytoplasmic chaperone protein TCP-1 (CCT) (The; p&gt; Mo2020&lt; Liang2020The).

PFDN1 also interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), specifically the pVHL213 isoform. This interaction stabilizes pVHL213 against aggregation and degradation, highlighting PFDN1's role in protein folding and proteostasis (Chesnel2020The).

In the context of cancer, PFDN1 is involved in transcriptional regulation by repressing cyclin A expression through direct interaction with its promoter. This interaction is significant in lung cancer and during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is crucial for tumor progression (PayánBravo2018Functional; Liang2020The).

PFDN1's interactions extend to its role in neurodegenerative diseases, where it helps prevent protein aggregation and promotes degradation, maintaining neuronal health (Liang2020The).
