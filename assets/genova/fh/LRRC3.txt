# LRRC3

## Overview
The LRRC3 gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 3, which is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions. This protein is primarily involved in cellular signaling pathways, cell adhesion, and immune responses, and is categorized as an integral component of the membrane, indicating its role in membrane-related processes. LRRC3 is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the bone marrow and colorectal cancers. It has been implicated in several diseases, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, intracranial aneurysms, Wilson Disease, and Alzheimer's disease, through genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications (Mordaunt2019Epigenomic; Hong2019Genomic; Hirvonen2017Wholeexome; Piras2023Integrated). Despite its recognized roles, the full spectrum of LRRC3's molecular functions and its impact on organismal physiology remain subjects of ongoing research.

## Function
The LRRC3 gene encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its leucine-rich repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for cellular signaling pathways, cell adhesion, and immune responses. The protein is typically active in the cytoplasm and may influence cell structure and communication. In healthy human cells, LRRC3 is widely expressed across different tissues, including the bone marrow, where it shows moderate cytoplasmic-positive staining in most malignancies, with the strongest expression observed in colorectal cancers (Hirvonen2017Wholeexome).

LRRC3 is also associated with membrane-related functions, as it is categorized under 'integral component of membrane' and 'intrinsic component of membrane' in gene ontology terms. This suggests its involvement in membrane-related processes, although the specific function in healthy human cells is not fully detailed (Hong2019Genomic). Additionally, in the context of Wilson Disease, LRRC3 has been identified with a hypermethylated differentially methylated region in the liver, indicating potential regulatory roles in liver-specific transcription factor binding sites (Mordaunt2019Epigenomic). Despite these findings, the precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes of LRRC3 in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the LRRC3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), LRRC3 has been identified as a potential candidate gene associated with familial cases of polycythemia vera (PV), a type of MPN. These genetic predispositions are often transmitted through autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance, suggesting a role for LRRC3 in familial clustering of MPN cases (BellannéChantelot2020Germline; McMullin2020Aetiology).

LRRC3 has also been linked to intracranial aneurysms in the Korean population. A genome-wide association study identified a synonymous mutation in LRRC3, SNP rs116969723, which showed a significant association with reduced risk of developing intracranial aneurysms (Hong2019Genomic).

In Wilson Disease (WD), LRRC3 is noted for its hypermethylation in liver-specific enhancers, particularly in advanced stages of the disease. This epigenetic alteration may contribute to WD pathogenesis, highlighting the potential of LRRC3 as a biomarker for disease progression (Mordaunt2019Epigenomic).

Additionally, in Alzheimer's disease, LRRC3 is connected to epigenetic changes, showing similar methylation and expression patterns as other genes involved in the disease, suggesting a potential role in its pathogenesis (Piras2023Integrated).
