# FBXL2

## Overview
FBXL2 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 2, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by an F-box motif that mediates protein-protein interactions. This protein is a crucial component of the Skp-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. The FBXL2 protein plays a significant role in regulating cell cycle progression and maintaining genomic stability by targeting key proteins such as Aurora B kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for degradation. Through these interactions, FBXL2 acts as a tumor suppressor, preventing abnormal cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Its involvement in various cellular processes underscores its potential as a therapeutic target, particularly in cancer treatment (Niu2021FBXL2; Chen2013SkpcullinF).

## Function
FBXL2 is a component of the Skp-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a critical role in regulating cell division and maintaining genomic stability. It specifically targets Aurora B kinase for ubiquitination and degradation, a process essential for proper chromosome segregation and cytokinesis during mitosis. By modulating Aurora B concentrations, FBXL2 prevents tetraploidy and ensures the fidelity of cellular division (Chen2013SkpcullinF).

FBXL2 localizes to the centrosome during early mitosis and relocates to the midzone and midbody during late mitosis, where it influences the timing of abscission. This spatial regulation is crucial for maintaining mitotic fidelity and preventing uncontrolled cell growth (Chen2013SkpcullinF). In addition to Aurora B, FBXL2 targets other proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as cyclin D3, and centrosomal assembly proteins like Cdk11, Aurora A, and Plk4, highlighting its broad role in cell cycle control (Chen2013SkpcullinF).

FBXL2 acts as a tumor suppressor by controlling the levels of these proteins, thereby preventing abnormal cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Its function as a homeostatic sensor in regulating the cytokinesis program underscores its potential as a target for cancer therapy (Chen2013SkpcullinF).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the FBXL2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FBXL2 acts as a negative regulator of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Reduced expression of FBXL2 is associated with increased EGFR stability, leading to enhanced tumor growth and poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. FBXL2's ability to degrade EGFR and its TKI-resistant mutants, such as EGFR T790M and C797S, highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in NSCLC (Niu2021FBXL2).

FBXL2 also plays a role in targeting Aurora B kinase for degradation, which is crucial for proper cell division. In lung adenocarcinoma, reduced FBXL2 expression leads to increased Aurora B levels, contributing to tumorigenesis. The use of small molecules to stabilize FBXL2 and promote Aurora B degradation has shown promise in reducing tumor growth (Chen2013SkpcullinF).

In leukemia, FBXL2 interacts with the FUNDC1 gene, which reduces FBXL2 ubiquitination and maintains its expression, potentially affecting disease progression by reducing ferroptosis and enhancing cell proliferation (Tan2024Methylation). These findings underscore the importance of FBXL2 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
FBXL2 is an F-box protein that functions as part of the SCF (SKP1-Cullin1-F-box) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex. It interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in their ubiquitination and degradation. FBXL2 binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and promotes its polyubiquitination, leading to proteasome-mediated degradation. This interaction is independent of EGF stimulation and involves the formation of stable complexes with SKP1 and Cullin1, components of the SCF complex (Niu2021FBXL2). FBXL2 also competes with glucose-regulated protein 94 (Grp94) for binding to EGFR, affecting the stability and degradation of EGFR, particularly in TKI-resistant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Niu2021FBXL2).

FBXL2 is targeted and degraded by another E3 ubiquitin ligase, FBXO3, through an interaction mediated by the FBXO3-ApaG domain. This interaction can be disrupted by nebivolol, a beta-blocker, which stabilizes FBXL2 and enhances its ability to degrade EGFR (Niu2021FBXL2). FBXL2 also interacts with proteins containing calmodulin-binding motifs, such as cyclin D2 and cyclin D3, leading to their ubiquitination and affecting cell cycle progression (Chen2013Fbox). These interactions highlight FBXL2's role in regulating protein stability and its potential impact on tumorigenesis.
