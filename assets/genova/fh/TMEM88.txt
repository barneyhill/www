# TMEM88

## Overview
TMEM88 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 88, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is integral to the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical pathway involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. TMEM88 functions primarily as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, influencing the localization of the Wnt signalosome and reducing nuclear β-catenin accumulation, which is essential for maintaining appropriate signaling levels during embryonic development and in adult tissues (Lee2019TMEM88). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including cardiomyocytes and hematopoietic stem cells, and is associated with cellular structures such as the plasma membrane and multivesicular bodies (Lee2019TMEM88; Cai2022Targeting). TMEM88's interactions with components of the Wnt pathway, particularly through its PDZ-binding motif, underscore its unique role in modulating cellular signaling and trafficking (Lee2019TMEM88). Additionally, TMEM88 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression and localization can influence tumor progression, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhao2021TMEM88; Cai2022Targeting).

## Function
TMEM88 is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in regulating the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, TMEM88 acts as a negative regulator of Wnt signaling by promoting the localization of the Wnt signalosome to multivesicular bodies (MVBs), thereby reducing nuclear β-catenin accumulation and repressing Wnt signaling. This function is essential for maintaining low levels of Wnt signaling, which is important for the specification of cardiac progenitor fate during embryonic development (Lee2019TMEM88).

TMEM88 is expressed in tissues such as cardiomyocytes and hematopoietic stem cells, where it influences their development and activation. It is associated with the plasma membrane, Golgi, and MVBs, indicating its involvement in cellular trafficking processes (Lee2019TMEM88; Cai2022Targeting). The protein contains a PDZ-binding motif, which is essential for its trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, facilitating its role in signaling pathways and cellular trafficking (Lee2019TMEM88). TMEM88's ability to inhibit Wnt signaling is independent of Dishevelled (DVL), a known positive mediator of the pathway, highlighting its unique regulatory role (Lee2019TMEM88).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM88 is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and cellular localization influencing its role as either a tumor suppressor or oncogene. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMEM88 expression is higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues, and its high expression is associated with better overall survival and progression-free survival. TMEM88 is suggested to promote immune escape in HCC and is linked to clinicopathological factors such as clinical stage and TP53 mutation status (LIMAN2022TMEM88). In bladder cancer, TMEM88 exhibits an antiproliferative and anti-invasive effect by downregulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Its expression is significantly lower in bladder cancer tissues, and upregulation of TMEM88 decreases cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Zhao2021TMEM88).

In thyroid cancer, TMEM88 is frequently downregulated, and its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting a tumor-suppressive function through the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Geng2020Transmembrane). In breast cancer, TMEM88 expression is higher in cancer tissues, with cytoplasmic localization promoting tumor progression and nuclear localization suppressing it (Cai2022Targeting). These findings highlight TMEM88's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
TMEM88 interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly through its association with Dishevelled (Dvl) proteins. This interaction is facilitated by the PDZ-binding motif in TMEM88, which allows it to bind to the PDZ domain of Dvl proteins. This binding is crucial for TMEM88's role in modulating Wnt signaling, as it can inhibit the pathway by preventing Dvl from activating downstream signaling components (Lee2019TMEM88; Herrera-Quiterio2023The).

TMEM88 also plays a role in the localization of the Wnt signalosome. It promotes the sequestration of the internalized Wnt signalosome, including β-catenin, to multivesicular bodies (MVBs), thereby reducing nuclear β-catenin levels and inhibiting Wnt signaling. This function is independent of Dvl, as demonstrated in DVL triple knockout cells (Lee2019TMEM88).

In the context of cancer, TMEM88's interaction with Dvl proteins has been shown to influence cancer cell behavior. In triple-negative breast cancer, TMEM88 interacts with Dvl in the cytoplasm, promoting cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing Snail expression and decreasing Occludin and Zo-1 expression (Yu2015Cytosolic).
