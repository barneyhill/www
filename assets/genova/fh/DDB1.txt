# DDB1

## Overview
DDB1 (damage specific DNA binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and transcriptional control. The DDB1 protein is a critical component of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a pivotal role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) by recognizing and binding to damaged DNA, particularly following UV irradiation (Tan2007DDB1; Nichols2003Basal). Structurally, DDB1 is characterized by three seven-bladed beta-propeller domains and a C-terminal helical domain, which facilitate its interactions with a wide range of proteins, including viral proteins and cellular factors (Liu2023Structure; Li2006Structure). These interactions underscore DDB1's versatility in cellular pathways, influencing processes such as protein degradation and viral hijacking mechanisms (Li2006Structure). Clinically, alterations in DDB1 have been linked to diseases involving impaired DNA repair, such as myeloid malignancies and Xeroderma pigmentosum, highlighting its significance in maintaining genomic stability (Klampfl2013Complex).

## Structure
The DDB1 protein is characterized by a unique structure comprising three seven-bladed beta-propeller domains (BPA, BPB, and BPC) and a C-terminal helical domain (CTD) (Li2006Structure). These beta-propellers are common protein folds, each formed by multiple four-stranded antiparallel beta sheets, twisted and radially packed around a central axis. The BPA and BPC domains are closely coupled, forming a large pocket between them, while the BPB domain is flexibly attached, allowing for dynamic interactions (Liu2023Structure; Li2006Structure).

The DDB1 structure is organized into a compact tristar configuration, supported by the CTD, which stabilizes the propeller domains by inserting a short helix between them (Li2006Structure). The flexibility of the BPB domain is particularly notable, facilitating diverse orientations for substrate ubiquitination (Liu2023Structure). DDB1 interacts with various proteins, including viral proteins and cellular factors, through its propeller domains, which provide multiple protein-protein interaction sites (Li2006Structure).

DDB1's structure is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its functional importance across species (Li2006Structure). The protein's structural flexibility and interaction capabilities are crucial for its role in the ubiquitin ligase complex and other cellular pathways (Li2006Structure).

## Function
DDB1 (damage specific DNA binding protein 1) is a key component of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a significant role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) by recognizing and binding to damaged DNA. In healthy human cells, DDB1 is primarily located in the cytoplasm but translocates to the nucleus following DNA damage, such as UV irradiation, where it forms a complex with DDB2 to facilitate DNA repair (Tan2007DDB1; Nichols2003Basal). This complex, known as the UV-DDB repair complex, has a high affinity for UV-damaged DNA, underscoring DDB1's role in maintaining genomic stability (Tan2007DDB1).

DDB1 is also involved in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control. It interacts with various transcription factors, including N-myc, Sp1, and NF1, which are crucial for its transcriptional regulation and promoter activity (Nichols2003Basal). The gene's promoter is G/C-rich and lacks a TATA box, typical of cell cycle-regulated genes, indicating its involvement in cell proliferation (Nichols2003Basal). DDB1's interaction with viral proteins, such as HIV-1 Vpr, highlights its role in cell cycle arrest and protein degradation pathways, further emphasizing its multifaceted functions in cellular processes (Tan2007DDB1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DDB1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving impaired DNA repair mechanisms. DDB1 is associated with myeloid malignancies, where mutations can lead to the inactivation of nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways, contributing to cancer development by preventing tumor suppressor gene transcription (Klampfl2013Complex). In the context of multiple myeloma, mutations in DDB1 may affect its interaction with CUL4A, part of the cereblon ubiquitin ligase complex, potentially influencing drug resistance mechanisms (Hu2019&lt; Progress; p&gt).

DDB1 was initially identified in patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum, a condition characterized by a deficiency in NER, leading to increased cancer risk due to UV-induced DNA damage (Klampfl2013Complex). Although no naturally occurring mutations in DDB1 have been directly linked to specific diseases, its role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation suggests that alterations in its expression or function could contribute to various pathologies (Nichols2003Basal).

Additionally, viral proteins can exploit DDB1 to manipulate host cellular mechanisms, as seen in interactions with HIV-2 proteins, which may impact immune responses and viral replication (Landsberg2018A). These interactions highlight the broader implications of DDB1 in disease contexts beyond genetic mutations.

## Interactions
DDB1 (damage specific DNA binding protein 1) is a versatile protein that participates in numerous interactions, primarily as a component of the CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. It interacts directly with Cul4A through its BPB domain, forming a stable complex essential for ubiquitination processes (Li2006Structure). DDB1 also serves as a linker to recruit WD40 repeat proteins, such as DDB2 and CSA, to the CUL4A complex, facilitating the assembly of the DDB1-CUL4A-ROC1 ligase complex (He2006DDB1).

The protein's structure, characterized by a triple-propeller cluster, allows it to engage in multiple protein-protein interactions. It can recruit various cellular substrates to the ubiquitin ligase complex through its double-propeller pocket, which is also a binding site for the paramyxovirus V protein, altering DDB1's substrate recognition properties (Li2006Structure). DDB1 interacts with DDA1, a core component of the CRL4-DDB1 complex, through the N-terminal 28 amino acids of DDA1, which bind to the bottom surface of the DDB1 BPA domain (Shabek2018Structural).

DDB1's interactions extend to viral proteins, such as the SV5 V protein, which binds to DDB1 using a bipartite structure, engaging both the N-terminal extension and core domain of the viral protein (Li2006Structure). These interactions highlight DDB1's role in both cellular and viral contexts, influencing protein degradation pathways and viral hijacking mechanisms.
