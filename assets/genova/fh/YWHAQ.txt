# YWHAQ

## Overview
The YWHAQ gene encodes the 14-3-3 theta protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which is integral to numerous cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins, thereby modulating their activity, localization, and stability. The 14-3-3 theta protein is predominantly found in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a significant role in neuronal development and stress responses (Demars2020Dysregulation). In cardiac cells, it is involved in essential metabolic and regulatory pathways, such as glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, and is crucial for maintaining cardiac homeostasis (Qu2022Proteomic). The protein's interactions are vital for coordinating energy production and consumption, particularly in cardiac tissues, and it is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial complex I, which is essential for oxidative phosphorylation (Qu2022Proteomic). Alterations in the YWHAQ gene have been linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Pagan2017Disruption; Jacobsen2015Epistatic; Ramshaw2013Locomotor).

## Structure
The YWHAQ gene encodes the 14-3-3 theta protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family involved in signal transduction. The primary structure of the 14-3-3 theta protein consists of a conserved amino acid sequence typical of the 14-3-3 family. Its secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha helices, which contribute to the protein's overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of the 14-3-3 theta protein forms a cup-like shape, which is crucial for its role in binding various phosphorylated target proteins. In terms of quaternary structure, the 14-3-3 theta protein typically exists as a dimer, which is a common feature among 14-3-3 proteins, allowing them to interact with a wide range of cellular partners (Eisa2019YWHA; Asih2022Differential).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in the 14-3-3 theta protein, influencing its interaction with other proteins and its regulatory functions (Demars2020Dysregulation). While specific domains and prominent folds are not detailed in the provided context, the structural characteristics mentioned are essential for the protein's function in various cellular processes.

## Function
The YWHAQ gene encodes the 14-3-3 theta protein, a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins, which are involved in a variety of cellular processes. In healthy human cells, 14-3-3 theta plays a crucial role in signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis by binding to phosphorylated serine/threonine residues on target proteins, thereby influencing their activity, localization, and stability (Demars2020Dysregulation). This protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting neuronal development and stress responses (Demars2020Dysregulation).

In cardiac cells, 14-3-3 theta is involved in core metabolic pathways and regulatory signaling pathways, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and β-oxidation, as well as processes like protein translation and insulin signaling (Qu2022Proteomic). It also plays a role in maintaining cardiac homeostasis by participating in protein quality control, energy production, and consumption, which are essential for cardiac muscle contraction and protein synthesis (Qu2022Proteomic). The protein's interactions are crucial for coordinating energy production and consumption, particularly in cardiac cells, and it is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial complex I, which is vital for oxidative phosphorylation and energy production (Qu2022Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the YWHAQ gene, which encodes the 14-3-3 theta protein, have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. The gene is associated with schizophrenia, where it plays a role in dopamine neurotransmission. In particular, 14-3-3 theta is involved in the regulation of the dopamine transporter (DAT), and its dysfunction can lead to increased dopamine levels in the striatum, contributing to schizophrenia-like symptoms (Ramshaw2013Locomotor). 

YWHAQ has also been linked to attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Genetic studies suggest that interactions between YWHAQ and other genes in the YWHA family may influence the risk of ADHD, with some evidence pointing to its involvement in monoamine synthesis regulation (Jacobsen2015Epistatic). 

In addition, the YWHAQ gene is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) through its role in melatonin synthesis. Disruptions in 14-3-3 protein levels, including those encoded by YWHAQ, can lead to melatonin deficits, which are frequently observed in ASD patients (Pagan2017Disruption). These findings highlight the clinical significance of YWHAQ in various neuropsychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
YWHAQ, also known as 14-3-3 theta, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. In the cardiac context, YWHAQ interacts with a range of proteins, including PYGM, which is involved in glycogen catabolism. This interaction was validated using Western blotting techniques (Qu2022Proteomic). The study identified 52 proteins interacting with 14-3-3 isoforms, including YWHAQ, in mouse heart tissue, highlighting its involvement in energy production and consumption pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and β-oxidation (Qu2022Proteomic).

YWHAQ also interacts with CDC25B phosphatase in mouse oocytes and eggs, which is significant for oocyte maturation and early embryonic development (Eisa2019YWHA). In the brain, YWHAQ is part of a network involving proteins like MARK3, which is associated with cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell signaling (Angrand2006Transgenic). These interactions underscore the role of YWHAQ in modulating the subcellular distribution and activity of its associated proteins in response to cellular signaling, contributing to its regulatory functions in various tissues.
