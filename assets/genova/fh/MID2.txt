# MID2

## Overview
The MID2 gene encodes the midline 2 protein, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, which is characterized by its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of microtubule dynamics and protein degradation pathways. The midline 2 protein contains several conserved domains, such as a RING finger, B-boxes, and a coiled-coil region, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in ubiquitination (Buchner1999MID2; Massiah2007Solution). MID2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it associates with microtubular structures, playing a critical role in microtubule stabilization and cell cycle progression (Buchner1999MID2). The gene is expressed in various adult tissues, including the thyroid and smooth muscle, and mutations in MID2 have been linked to X-linked intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance (Geetha2013Targeted; Zanchetta2019Emerging).

## Structure
The MID2 protein is characterized by a conserved structure that includes several key domains: a RING finger, two B-boxes, a coiled-coil region, and a RFP-like C-terminal domain. The RING finger domain, located at the N-terminus, is a cysteine-rich motif involved in protein-protein interactions, featuring a specific arrangement of cysteine and histidine residues (Buchner1999MID2). The B-box domains, which are also cysteine/histidine-rich, play a role in protein multimerization and are structurally similar to the RING domain, sharing a conserved ββα RING fold (Massiah2007Solution). The coiled-coil domain is believed to facilitate homomultimerization, contributing to the protein's quaternary structure (Buchner1999MID2).

The MID2 protein is part of the TRIM family, which is involved in various cellular processes, including ubiquitination. This is supported by the presence of the RING domain, which is commonly associated with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Chen2023The). The protein's subcellular localization is primarily cytoplasmic, where it associates with microtubular structures, suggesting a role in microtubule stabilization (Buchner1999MID2). The MID2 gene also exhibits splice variant isoforms, with exon 6 containing 30 additional amino acids compared to its paralogue MID1 (Buchner1999MID2).

## Function
The MID2 gene encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in tagging proteins for degradation, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zanchetta2019Emerging). MID2 is involved in microtubule stabilization, a process vital for neural tube closure and epithelial remodeling during development (Geetha2013Targeted). The protein is associated with the microtubular apparatus, particularly during mitosis, where it localizes to the central spindle and midbody, indicating a role in cell cycle progression and cytokinesis (Buchner1999MID2; Zanchetta2019Emerging).

MID2 interacts with the microtubule-associated protein Astrin, promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, which is necessary for proper cytokinesis (Zanchetta2019Emerging). It also interacts with Alpha 4, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), tethering it to microtubules and potentially regulating PP2A activity (Short2002MID1). This interaction is significant for microtubule dynamics and cellular processes involving phosphatase regulation (Short2002MID1).

In adult tissues, MID2 is primarily expressed in the thyroid, smooth muscle, prostate, breast, and ovary, suggesting its involvement in maintaining cellular structure and function in these tissues (Zanchetta2019Emerging).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MID2 gene have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). In a study involving a large family from India, two novel variants, p.Arg347Gln and p.Asn343Ser, were identified in the MID2 gene. The p.Arg347Gln variant was predicted to be probably damaging and was shown to alter the subcellular localization of the protein, potentially affecting the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and other target proteins. This disruption may contribute to disease by affecting microtubule binding and PP2A regulation, which are crucial for neural tube closure and epithelial remodeling (Geetha2013Targeted). The p.Asn343Ser variant, although identified, was not considered disease-causing (Geetha2013Targeted).

The MID2 gene is part of the tripartite motif family and is involved in microtubule stabilization. While it has been hypothesized as a candidate for Opitz syndrome, no mutations in MID2 have been reported in patients with this condition. However, duplications in the MID2 region have been linked to Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, indicating its potential role in other developmental disorders (Geetha2013Targeted). The study highlights the importance of the ubiquitin pathway in intellectual disability and the specific impact of MID2 mutations (Geetha2013Targeted).

## Interactions
MID2, a member of the TRIM family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes such as microtubule dynamics and ubiquitination pathways. MID2 interacts with several proteins, including ALPHA-4, ASTRIN, ASPM, CEP128, and LNX1, as well as other TRIM proteins like TRIM27, TRIM42, TRIM54, TRIM29, and TRIM32 (Zanchetta2019Emerging). It also interacts with tubulin proteins TUBB and TUBB4B, and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes such as UBE2D1, UBE2D2, UBE2D3, UBE2D4, UBE2E1, UBE2E2, UBE2E3, and UBE2N (Zanchetta2019Emerging).

A significant interaction of MID2 is with the phosphoprotein Alpha 4 (IGBP1), a regulatory subunit of PP2-type phosphatases, including PP2A. This interaction is mediated by the B-box region of MID2 and is crucial for tethering Alpha 4 to microtubules, potentially influencing the function of PP2A and related phosphatases (Short2002MID1). MID2 also forms homo- and heterodimers with its paralogue MID1, facilitated by the coiled-coil domains, which are essential for microtubule binding (Short2002MID1).

MID2's interaction with Astrin (SPAG5) is notable for its role in cytokinesis. MID2 promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Astrin, which is crucial for proper cytokinesis and preventing cytokinetic arrest (Zanchetta2019Emerging). These interactions highlight MID2's involvement in complex cellular processes and its potential impact on developmental disorders.
