# SYT15

## Overview
SYT15 is a gene that encodes the protein synaptotagmin 15, a member of the synaptotagmin family, which is characterized by its role as a calcium sensor in regulated exocytosis. Synaptotagmin 15 is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking, particularly in neurons and neuroendocrine and endocrine cells, where it plays a crucial role in neuroactive signal transduction and neurotransmitter release at synaptic junctions (Wang2023SYT2111315). The gene's expression has been studied in various clinical contexts, including its downregulation in lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer, where it is associated with immune cell infiltration and cancer prognosis (Yang2021Comprehensive; Wang2023SYT2111315). The potential of SYT15 as a prognostic biomarker in cancer highlights its significance in both normal physiological processes and disease states.

## Function
Synaptotagmin 15 (SYT15) is a member of the synaptotagmin family, which are evolutionarily conserved membrane proteins involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking. These proteins are proposed to act as calcium (Ca2+) sensors in regulated exocytosis, particularly in neurons and neuroendocrine and endocrine cells. SYT15 is implicated in neuroactive signal transduction, which is crucial for the release of neurotransmitters at synaptic junctions, a process essential for proper neuronal communication and function (Wang2023SYT2111315).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SYT15 is downregulated, and its expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, particularly correlating with CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. This suggests that SYT15 may have a role in modulating immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (Wang2023SYT2111315). The protein-protein interaction network analysis indicates that SYT15 interacts with various other proteins, suggesting its involvement in complex cellular pathways (Wang2023SYT2111315). However, the specific molecular activities and cellular localization of SYT15 in healthy human cells are not detailed in the available context.

## Clinical Significance
SYT15 (synaptotagmin 15) has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SYT15 is downregulated compared to normal tissue. High expression levels of SYT15 are associated with longer overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in LUAD patients, suggesting its potential as a favorable prognostic biomarker. SYT15 is also linked to immune infiltration, correlating with CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (Wang2023SYT2111315). The gene's expression is significantly correlated with clinical stages and primary therapy outcomes, indicating its diagnostic value in LUAD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.963. High SYT15 expression is associated with a favorable prognosis, while SYT13 is linked to a poor prognosis (Wang2023SYT2111315).

In gastric cancer (GC), SYT15 is significantly downregulated, although the specific clinical implications in GC are not detailed in the available context (Yang2021Comprehensive). The methylation of specific CpG sites in SYT15 is significantly associated with prognosis, indicating its potential clinical significance in cancer (Wang2023SYT2111315). These findings highlight the importance of SYT15 in cancer prognosis and its potential role in immune modulation.
