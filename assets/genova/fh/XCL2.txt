# XCL2

## Overview
XCL2 is a gene that encodes the protein X-C motif chemokine ligand 2, a member of the C-chemokine subfamily. This protein plays a crucial role in the immune system by regulating chemokine signaling pathways, primarily through its interaction with the XCR1 receptor. XCL2 is characterized by its ability to exist in two distinct conformational states: a monomeric form that activates G protein-coupled receptors and a dimeric form that binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the extracellular matrix. These structural states are essential for its function in establishing chemokine gradients that guide immune cell migration to sites of inflammation or infection (Fox2015Structural). The gene is expressed in various immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells, and its expression is modulated in response to immune challenges (Fox2015Structural). XCL2's involvement in immune responses and its altered expression in diseases such as cancer and infectious diseases underscore its clinical significance (Xu2023New; Cao2008Mycobacterium).

## Structure
XCL2, a member of the C-chemokine subfamily, exhibits a unique conformational equilibrium between two structural states: a chemokine-like monomer (Ltn10) and a novel dimeric structure (Ltn40) (Fox2015Structural). This equilibrium is influenced by temperature and salt concentration, with both conformations equally present under physiological conditions (Fox2015Structural). The monomeric form is responsible for activating the XCR1 receptor, while the dimeric form is important for binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (Fox2015Structural).

The primary structure of XCL2 is highly similar to its paralog XCL1, with specific differences at amino acid positions 7 and 8, which may influence its activity as an XCR1 agonist (Fox2015Structural). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D shape of the protein, which is analyzed using NMR spectroscopy to study its conformational states (Fox2015Structural). XCL2 has a slightly higher affinity for heparin than XCL1, particularly at pH levels below 7, attributed to the Ltn40 conformation and possibly the protonation of His7 (Fox2015Structural). The regulation of XCL2 expression is controlled by NFAT transcription factors, and the protein may undergo various post-translational modifications (Fox2015Structural).

## Function
XCL2, a member of the C chemokine subfamily, plays a significant role in immune response regulation by binding to the XCR1 receptor, which is involved in chemokine signaling pathways. This interaction leads to cellular responses such as calcium release, cell polarization, and chemotactic migration, which are crucial for directing immune cells to sites of inflammation or infection (Fox2015Structural). XCL2 exists in two conformational states: a monomeric form that activates G protein-coupled receptors and a dimeric form that binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the extracellular matrix. This dual conformation is essential for establishing concentration gradients that facilitate cellular migration (Fox2015Structural).

In healthy human cells, XCL2 is constitutively expressed in unstimulated natural killer (NK) cells and inactive CD8+ T cells, with expression levels increasing upon T cell activation (Fox2015Structural). The protein's interaction with heparin, particularly at acidic pH levels, suggests a role in inflammatory conditions where local acidosis occurs (Fox2015Structural). XCL2's ability to induce chemotaxis in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells highlights its importance in cell-mediated immunity and immune surveillance (Cao2008Mycobacterium).

## Clinical Significance
XCL2, a member of the C chemokine subfamily, is associated with various clinical conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. Increased expression of XCL2 has been linked to cancer progression, particularly in epithelial ovarian and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is expressed at higher levels in patients with indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia compared to healthy individuals (Fox2015Structural). In the context of COVID-19, XCL2 expression levels rise from moderate to severe disease stages but normalize in critical cases (Xu2023New).

XCL2 expression is also stimulated by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen Wag31 in macrophages, suggesting a role in the immune response to tuberculosis infection (Cao2008Mycobacterium). This interaction highlights the potential of XCL2 in modulating immune responses during infections.

Despite these associations, there is no direct mention of diseases or conditions caused by specific mutations in the XCL2 gene. However, its altered expression in various diseases underscores its clinical significance in immune regulation and cancer progression (Fox2015Structural; Cao2008Mycobacterium). The potential for therapeutic targeting of XCL2 in these contexts remains an area of interest.

## Interactions
XCL2, a member of the C-chemokine subfamily, interacts with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein Wag31. This interaction was identified using a modified split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid system, which screened a macrophage cDNA library with Wag31 as bait. The interaction was further confirmed by in vitro GST pull-down assays and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating a direct interaction between Wag31 and XCL2. This interaction is significant as Wag31 specifically stimulates the expression of XCL2 in macrophages, suggesting a role in the immune response to tuberculosis (Cao2008Mycobacterium).

XCL2 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin, with a slightly higher affinity compared to its paralog XCL1. This interaction is influenced by the protonation of specific amino acids, such as His7, under certain pH conditions. The binding to GAGs is important for the structural and functional properties of XCL2, affecting its role in chemokine signaling and cellular migration (Fox2015Structural). These interactions highlight the complex role of XCL2 in immune processes and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
