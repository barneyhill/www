# GBGT1

## Overview
The GBGT1 gene encodes the enzyme globoside alpha-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of the Forssman antigen, a glycolipid component of the globoseries synthesis pathway. This enzyme facilitates the transfer of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine to globoside, forming the Forssman glycolipid. In humans, the GBGT1 gene is typically non-functional due to inactivating mutations, resulting in the absence of Forssman antigen expression in healthy cells. Despite this, GBGT1 mRNA is present in various tissues, suggesting potential alternative roles or altered enzyme specificity. The Forssman antigen has been detected in certain cancer cells, indicating that the gene may become active under specific pathological conditions (Yamamoto2017Crosstalk; Yamamoto2012Molecular; Hult2017The).

## Structure


## Function
The GBGT1 gene encodes the enzyme globoside alpha-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the Forssman antigen, a glycolipid that is part of the globoseries synthesis pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) to the terminal GalNAc residue of globoside by an α1-3 linkage, forming the Forssman glycolipid (Gb5) (Yamamoto2012Molecular; Yamamoto2019ABO). In humans, the GBGT1 gene is typically non-functional due to inactivating mutations, such as Gly230Ser and Gln296Arg, which prevent the synthesis of the Forssman antigen, making humans generally Forssman-negative (Yamamoto2017Crosstalk).

Despite the presence of GBGT1 mRNA in various human tissues, the structural defects caused by these mutations result in the absence of Forssman antigen expression in healthy human cells (Yamamoto2012Molecular). The gene's function in healthy human cells remains unclear, as it does not appear to synthesize the Forssman antigen, and its high RNA expression suggests a possible altered enzyme specificity (Hult2017The). The Forssman antigen has been detected in certain cancer cells, indicating that somatic changes or other mechanisms might activate the GBGT1 gene under specific conditions (Yamamoto2017ABO).

## Clinical Significance
The GBGT1 gene is associated with the synthesis of the Forssman antigen, which is typically inactive in humans due to specific mutations. These mutations, such as the common inactivating missense mutations c.688G.A (p.Gly230Ser) and c.887A.G (p.Gln296Arg), result in the loss of glycosyltransferase activity necessary for Forssman antigen production (Yamamoto2012Molecular). A rare single point mutation, 887G>A, can activate the Forssman synthase enzyme, leading to the expression of the Forssman antigen and the rare A pae phenotype (Kaczmarek2014P1PK).

Alterations in GBGT1 expression have been observed in certain cancers, such as ovarian cancer, where its expression is epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation. This regulation can lead to differential expression in cancerous versus normal tissues, although GBGT1 expression does not correlate with clinical outcomes like survival in ovarian cancer patients (Jacob2014Expression). The presence of Forssman antigen in human carcinomas suggests a potential role in cancer biology, although the clinical significance of GBGT1 mutations in terms of disease association remains unclear (Kaczmarek2014P1PK). The gene's expression and its regulation by DNA methylation may have implications for understanding its role in disease (Jacob2014Expression).
