# GBP5

## Overview
GBP5 (guanylate binding protein 5) is a gene that encodes the guanylate-binding protein 5, a member of the large GTPase family involved in the innate immune response. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and is classified as an interferon-inducible GTPase. GBP5 plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including autophagy and inflammasome activation, by facilitating the trafficking of proteins and enhancing immune signaling pathways. It is particularly significant in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, linking interferon signaling to immune responses against pathogens. GBP5's interactions with other proteins, such as its dimerization with other guanylate-binding proteins and its inhibition of the protease furin, underscore its importance in antiviral defense mechanisms (Braun2019Guanylate-Binding; Man2016Interferon-inducible). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various inflammatory diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Haque2021Regulation; Li2022The).

## Structure
GBP5 (guanylate binding protein 5) is a member of the guanylate-binding protein family, characterized by its large GTPase domains. The primary structure of GBP5 includes a globular N-terminal G-domain, which harbors GTPase activity, and a C-terminal helical domain (CTHD) (Hotter2016Guanylate). The protein is approximately 68 kDa in size and contains a CaaX motif at the C-terminus, which allows for geranylgeranylation, a post-translational modification that facilitates membrane association (Hotter2016Guanylate; Ince2017The).

The secondary structure of GBP5 includes flexible regions, particularly in the C-terminal domain, which lacks some of the salt-bridges found in related proteins like hGBP-1, resulting in a more open and flexible arrangement (Kutsch2018Homo). The tertiary structure of GBP5 is suggested to resemble that of dynamin-related proteins, with a large GTPase domain and a GTPase effector domain (GED) that is more flexible compared to hGBP-1 (Ince2017The).

In terms of quaternary structure, GBP5 cycles between monomeric and dimeric forms, influenced by nucleotide binding. It forms dimers in the presence of GTP analogs and GDP•AlF X (Ince2017The). A splice variant, hGBP-5ta, lacks the ability to dimerize and remains monomeric (Ince2017The).

## Function
Guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5) is an interferon-inducible GTPase that plays a significant role in the innate immune response. In healthy human cells, GBP5 is involved in several molecular processes, including the trafficking of mono-ubiquitinated protein cargo into autolysosomes, which is part of the cellular autophagy process. This function is facilitated by its localization in the perinuclear region and its association with the Golgi apparatus, aided by isoprenylation of its C-terminal CaaX motif, which anchors it to endomembrane organelles (Zhang2021When).

GBP5 is also crucial for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune response. It links interferon signaling to inflammasome activation, promoting the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to specific stimuli, such as ATP and nigericin, in IFN-gamma-primed macrophages (Man2016Interferon-inducible). This process involves GBP5 tetramerization, which facilitates interactions between its GTPase domain and the pyrin domain of NLRP3 (Man2016Interferon-inducible).

Additionally, GBP5 is involved in antiviral immune signaling pathways, enhancing the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory factors, which are essential for the immune response against viral infections (Zhang2021When).

## Clinical Significance
Guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5) has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in immune response modulation. In inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, GBP5 is associated with proinflammatory processes. Its expression is notably higher in Crohn's disease compared to ulcerative colitis, suggesting a role in the early inflammatory cascade, potentially through a caspase-11-dependent pathway responding to bacterial components like lipopolysaccharide (Li2022The). GBP5 is also involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, contributing to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in IBD patients (Li2022The).

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), GBP5 is upregulated in synovial tissues and plays a regulatory role in proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathways. Knockdown of GBP5 in synovial fibroblasts leads to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, exacerbating inflammation and tissue destruction. Conversely, overexpression of GBP5 can reduce these effects, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for RA (Haque2021Regulation).

GBP5 also plays a role in the host response to Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus infection, where a specific intronic SNP in GBP5 affects its expression and splicing, influencing the immune response to the virus (Koltes2015Identification).

## Interactions
GBP5 (guanylate-binding protein 5) is known to participate in various protein interactions, primarily through its ability to form both homo- and heterodimers. GBP5 can homodimerize and heterodimerize with other guanylate-binding proteins such as GBP-1 and GBP-2. These interactions are influenced by the binding of GTP analogues, which induce dimerization (Kutsch2018Homo). The heterodimerization of GBP5 with GBP-1 and GBP-2 affects their subcellular localization, with GBP-1 recruiting GBP-5 and GBP-2 into its compartment, and GBP-5 being able to reposition GBP-2 (Britzen-Laurent2010Intracellular).

GBP5 also interacts with the cellular protease furin, inhibiting its activity. This interaction affects the maturation and priming of viral glycoproteins, thereby exerting antiviral effects against viruses such as HIV-1 and influenza (Braun2019Guanylate-Binding). The interaction with furin is suggested to be indirect, as GBP5 does not directly bind viral components, which may prevent the development of viral resistance (Braun2019Guanylate-Binding).

These interactions highlight GBP5's role in immune response and intracellular trafficking, with its dimerization and prenylation being crucial for its function and localization within the cell (Britzen-Laurent2010Intracellular).
