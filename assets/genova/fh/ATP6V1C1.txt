# ATP6V1C1

## Overview
ATP6V1C1 is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit C1, a critical component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is part of the V1 domain, which is essential for the ATP-driven translocation of protons across intracellular membranes, thereby playing a pivotal role in the acidification of various cellular compartments such as lysosomes and endosomes. The V-ATPase complex is integral to numerous cellular processes, including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release. ATP6V1C1 is particularly significant in osteoclasts, where it contributes to bone resorption by facilitating the acidification necessary for this process. Additionally, the protein interacts with the cytoskeleton, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular structure and function. Dysregulation of ATP6V1C1 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and bone disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease (Feng2008Atp6v1c1; McConnell2017Osteoclast; Inoue2005Cysteinemediated).

## Structure


## Function
The ATP6V1C1 gene encodes a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, specifically the V1 domain, which is crucial for proton transport across intracellular membranes. This complex is essential for acidifying intracellular compartments, such as lysosomes and endosomes, which is vital for various cellular processes including protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (OteroRey2008Intracellular; Inoue2005Cysteinemediated).

In osteoclasts, ATP6V1C1 is highly expressed and plays a significant role in bone resorption by contributing to the acidification necessary for this process. It is involved in the formation of F-actin rings, which are critical for the osteoclast's bone-resorbing activity, and localizes to the ruffled border of activated osteoclasts, where it interacts with other subunits of the V-ATPase complex (Feng2008Atp6v1c1).

The protein also interacts with the cytoskeleton, binding to both polymeric F-actin and monomeric G-actin, which suggests a role in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and facilitating cellular movement or transport (Vitavska2005The). This interaction is important for the structural integrity and function of the V-ATPase complex, contributing to cellular pH regulation and homeostasis (Inoue2005Cysteinemediated).

## Clinical Significance
The ATP6V1C1 gene is implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and bone disorders. In breast cancer, ATP6V1C1 is often overexpressed or amplified, which is associated with increased tumor growth, metastasis, and poorer clinical outcomes. This overexpression is linked to the activation of the mTORC1 pathway, a critical regulator of cell growth and proliferation, contributing to the aggressive nature of certain breast cancers (McConnell2017Osteoclast). Knockdown studies in breast cancer models have shown that reducing ATP6V1C1 expression can significantly inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Feng2013Silencing).

In bone-related disorders, ATP6V1C1 plays a crucial role in osteoclast function, particularly in bone resorption. Dysregulation of ATP6V1C1 impairs osteoclast acidification and bone resorption, which can lead to conditions such as osteopetrosis, characterized by excessive bone density due to defective bone resorption (Feng2008Atp6v1c1). The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining bone health and its potential impact when dysregulated.

## Interactions
ATP6V1C1, a subunit of the V-ATPase complex, participates in several critical interactions essential for its function. It interacts with the a3 subunit, a vital component of the osteoclast ruffled border V-ATPase, which is crucial for linking the V1 and V0 domains of the V-ATPase complex (Feng2008Atp6v1c1). This interaction is significant for osteoclast function, particularly in bone resorption and acidification activities (Feng2008Atp6v1c1).

In cancer cells, ATP6V1C1 is involved in the assembly of the V0 and V1 domains of the V-ATPase complex, interacting with subunits v0a, v1g, and v1e. This assembly is crucial for the enzymatic activity of V-ATPase, which regulates pH levels within cells (Feng2013Silencing). ATP6V1C1 also interacts with the mTORC1 pathway, facilitating its activation, which is essential for cancer cell growth and metastasis (McConnell2017Osteoclast).

The C subunit of ATP6V1C1 acts as an anchor protein, connecting the V-ATPase to the actin cytoskeleton, and is involved in the reversible dissociation of the V1V0 holoenzyme. This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of the V-ATPase complex (Alves2015VATPases).
