# DNASE1L1

## Overview
DNASE1L1 is a gene that encodes the protein deoxyribonuclease 1 like 1, which is a member of the DNase I family of enzymes. This protein functions primarily as an ectoenzyme, anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues. The enzyme plays a critical role in the degradation of extracellular DNA, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating immune responses. It is activated by divalent cations such as Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ and is inhibited by chelating agents like EDTA and EGTA. DNASE1L1 is also implicated in interactions with pathogens, serving as a receptor for certain bacteria, and is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including muscle maintenance and immune regulation (Mori2022Origin; Lauková2020Deoxyribonucleases; Engavale2021Dnase1).

## Function
DNASE1L1 is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the degradation of extracellular DNA, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and immune regulation. It is part of the DNase I family and is expressed predominantly in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, as well as at basal levels in various other tissues (Mori2022Origin; Lauková2020Deoxyribonucleases). The enzyme is anchored to the outer cell membrane as an ectoenzyme due to a C-terminal GPI-anchor signal, which is essential for its function in preventing the endocytosis-mediated transfer of foreign DNA (Mori2022Origin).

DNASE1L1 is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphodiester bonds in DNA molecules, a process activated by Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions and inhibited by EDTA/EGTA (Lauková2020Deoxyribonucleases). This activity is vital for clearing extracellular DNA, thereby preventing the accumulation of self-DNA that could lead to immune system activation or tissue dysfunction (Mori2022Origin). The enzyme's role in degrading DNA is crucial for maintaining low concentrations of extracellular DNA, which helps prevent excessive immune activation and inflammation (Lauková2020Deoxyribonucleases).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DNASE1L1 gene have been linked to various diseases and conditions. Although the specific function of DNASE1L1 is not fully understood, it is known to play a role in extracellular DNA degradation, particularly in muscle tissues. Alterations in DNASE1L1 expression have been associated with muscle-related pathologies, such as vacuolar myopathy, where an accumulation of DNASE1L1 transcript is observed in myocyte vacuoles (Bai2023Pan‑cancer). A deletion polymorphism in DNASE1L1 has been linked to fatal infantile Pompe disease, a metabolic disorder characterized by myopathy and respiratory weakness (Santa2021The; Bai2023Pan‑cancer).

Recent studies have also suggested potential associations between DNASE1L1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other conditions, including type 1 diabetes, schizophrenia, and ANCA-associated vasculitis, indicating that DNASE1L1 may have broader implications in disease through its role in regulating the immunostimulatory potential of circulating cell-free DNA (Santa2021The). In the context of cancer, DNASE1L1 expression has been linked to the tumor microenvironment, with varying prognostic implications across different cancer types, such as a favorable prognosis in adrenocortical carcinoma and sarcoma, but a poor prognosis in glioblastoma multiforme and other cancers (Bai2023Pan‑cancer).

## Interactions
DNASE1L1, also known as DNase X, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It serves as a cellular receptor for Ehrlichia species, the causative agents of ehrlichiosis. These bacteria utilize DNASE1L1 to facilitate their entry into host cells by targeting its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which aids in their internalization into host phagocytes like neutrophils. The Ehrlichia protein EtpE binds to DNASE1L1, promoting phagocytosis and allowing the bacteria to replicate within cytoplasmic vacuoles by preventing phagolysosomal fusion (Engavale2021Dnase1).

DNASE1L1 is also suggested to interact with nucleic acids, potentially degrading DNA complexed with transfection reagents, although its natural substrates and detailed mechanisms remain poorly understood (Santa2021The). Despite these insights, specific information about DNASE1L1's participation in multiprotein complexes or other transitory interactions is limited. The enzyme's role in muscle tissues is indicated by studies showing that Dnase1l1-deficient mice exhibit reduced fatigue tolerance and muscle fiber damage, suggesting a specific function in muscle tissue maintenance (Santa2021The).
