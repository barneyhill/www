# EIF1

## Overview
EIF1 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (eIF1), a protein integral to the initiation phase of eukaryotic translation. As a translation initiation factor, eIF1 plays a pivotal role in ensuring the fidelity of start codon recognition during mRNA translation. It is a component of the 43S pre-initiation complex, which is essential for the accurate assembly of the 48S initiation complex at the start codon. The protein's structure is characterized by a compact, globular form with specific surface charge distributions that facilitate its interactions with ribosomal RNA and other initiation factors. EIF1's function is tightly regulated in response to cellular conditions, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ali2017Eukaryotic; GOLOBSCHWARZL2020New).

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1 (EIF1) is a protein involved in the initiation phase of eukaryotic translation. Its primary structure consists of a specific sequence of amino acids, with a tightly folded domain covering residues 29-113. The secondary structure of EIF1 includes two α-helices on one side of a five-stranded β-sheet (Lomakin2003Position). The tertiary structure of EIF1 is compact and globular, resembling a cone with positively charged sides near rRNA and/or P-site tRNA, and a negatively charged base that is solvent-exposed (Lomakin2003Position). 

EIF1 does not typically form quaternary structures as it functions as a monomer. The protein's surface potential is characterized by a positively charged patch that binds to rRNA, while the opposite side is hydrophobic to acidic (Rabl2011Crystal). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, affecting its activity and interactions. EIF1 is involved in maintaining the fidelity of initiation codon selection, similar to the role of IF3 in prokaryotes, and binds to conserved ribosomal regions, which imposes common demands on its shape, size, and surface charge distributions (Lomakin2003Position).

## Function
EIF1, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1, is a crucial protein in the initiation phase of eukaryotic translation. It plays a significant role in the accurate recognition of the start codon during mRNA translation. EIF1 is a component of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC), which includes the 40S ribosomal subunit, eIF2.GTP-Met-tRNAi, eIF1A, eIF3, and possibly eIF5. This complex attaches to the mRNA and scans the 5' untranslated region to locate the start codon, leading to the formation of the 48S initiation complex (Ali2017Eukaryotic).

EIF1 specifically binds near the ribosomal P-site, enhancing the discrimination against near-cognate codons and ensuring accurate translation initiation. It is essential for the formation of the 48S complex and binding at the initiation codon, working synergistically with eIF1A to promote the assembly of the 48S complex at the initiation codon (Ali2017Eukaryotic; Pestova1998Eukaryotic). EIF1 also prevents untimely hydrolysis of eIF2.GTP to eIF2.GDP by eIF5 GAP, which is crucial for stopping downstream events (Ali2017Eukaryotic). In healthy cells, EIF1's function is tightly regulated and sensitive to cellular conditions such as nutrient availability and stress, ensuring proper protein synthesis and cellular function (Ali2017Eukaryotic).

## Clinical Significance
EIF1 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a highly aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Studies have shown that EIF1 is significantly down-regulated in PDAC tissues compared to non-neoplastic pancreatic tissues. This down-regulation is observed in both well and poorly differentiated PDAC samples, as well as in high-grade tumors (GOLOBSCHWARZL2020New). The decreased expression of EIF1 is associated with poorer overall survival in PDAC patients, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker for the disease (GOLOBSCHWARZL2020New).

The dysregulation of EIF1 in PDAC is linked to its involvement in the initiation step of protein synthesis, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. This process is regulated by key signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MAPK, which are often dysregulated in cancer. The altered expression of EIF1 may contribute to the oncogenic pathways that support tumor development, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (GOLOBSCHWARZL2020New). The findings from these studies highlight the clinical significance of EIF1 in PDAC and underscore its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in this malignancy (GOLOBSCHWARZL2020New).

## Interactions
EIF1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids during the translation initiation process. It forms part of a multifactor complex with eIF2, eIF3, eIF5, and initiator tRNA, which is crucial for translation initiation. The amino-terminal segment of the eIF3 subunit NIP1 can interact simultaneously with eIF1 and eIF5, forming a stable ternary complex that enhances the interaction between eIF1 and eIF5 (Asano2000A). EIF1 also interacts with eIF4G1, with specific binding sites identified on eIF4G1 for eIF1, which are involved in anchoring eIF1 near the P-site of the ribosome (Haimov2018Dynamic).

EIF1's interaction with the 40S ribosomal subunit is essential for initiation codon selection. It binds near the ribosomal P-site, influencing the conformation of the 40S subunit and the positions of mRNA and initiator tRNA (Lomakin2003Position). This interaction is stabilized by the presence of other initiation factors such as eIF2, eIF3, and eIF1A (Lomakin2003Position). EIF1 also interacts with the PN2 subcomplex of eIF3, which includes eIF5 and HCR1, facilitating ribosome binding of mRNA and tRNA (Phan2001A).
