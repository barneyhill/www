# CEBPZOS

## Overview
CEBPZOS is a gene that encodes the CEBPZ opposite strand protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including energy metabolism and immune response regulation. The protein is categorized as a mitochondrial protein, playing a crucial role in the metabolic pathways of cells, particularly in the context of cancer. Alterations in the expression of CEBPZOS have been linked to several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and liver cancer, where it may serve as a biomarker for disease risk and prognosis (Xu2022Identification; Sun2021A). In hepatocellular carcinoma, CEBPZOS is associated with immune cell infiltration, influencing the tumor microenvironment and patient survival outcomes (YANG2022Pathological). These associations underscore the gene's potential clinical significance in both oncology and neurodegenerative disease research.

## Clinical Significance
CEBPZOS has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In Alzheimer's disease, lower predicted expression of CEBPZOS is associated with an increased risk, with an odds ratio of 0.97, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for the disease (Sun2021A). In liver cancer, CEBPZOS is identified as a novel mitochondrial protein that may influence the energy metabolism of tumor cells, affecting tumor development and patient prognosis. It is part of an energy metabolism-related gene signature that correlates with overall survival in liver cancer patients (Xu2022Identification). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CEBPZOS is one of the prognostic genes associated with immune cell infiltration. It shows a positive correlation with CD8+ T cells and fibroblasts, and a negative correlation with hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting its involvement in the tumor immune microenvironment (YANG2022Pathological). Additionally, CEBPZOS is part of a prognostic model that predicts survival outcomes in HCC, indicating its clinical relevance in assessing patient risk (YANG2022Pathological). These findings highlight the significance of CEBPZOS in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.
