# INO80E

## Overview
The INO80E gene encodes a protein that serves as a subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a critical role in various DNA-based processes such as transcription, replication, and repair. The protein, known as INO80 complex subunit E, is primarily located in the nucleus and is associated with chromatin, reflecting its regulatory function in gene expression. INO80E is involved in maintaining genomic stability by participating in the resolution of R-loops, RNA:DNA hybrid structures that can impede DNA replication. The gene's expression and its interactions with other proteins, such as TFPT, are crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription. Alterations in INO80E expression have been linked to several cancers, including breast cancer, highlighting its potential role in oncogenic processes (Ryczek20235’; Prendergast2020Resolution; Cox2017Global).

## Function
The INO80E gene encodes a subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, which is involved in various DNA-based processes, including transcription, replication, and repair. In healthy human cells, INO80E plays a regulatory role in gene expression, particularly through its interaction with the HIRIP3 gene. This interaction is influenced by R-loop formation, which can affect transcription by causing RNA polymerase II pausing or promoting transcription through epigenetic changes. The presence of R-loops in the 5'UTR region of the INO80E-201 transcript can block its transcription and impact the expression of overlapping HIRIP3 transcripts. Overexpression of RNase H1, which resolves R-loops, has been shown to increase the expression of both INO80E-201 and HIRIP3 transcripts, indicating that R-loop formation inhibits their transcription (Ryczek20235’).

INO80E is primarily located in the nucleus and is associated with chromatin, supporting its regulatory function. Despite the silencing of INO80E-201, the INO80E protein levels remain unchanged in certain cell types, suggesting that its regulatory role does not directly affect protein levels (Ryczek20235’). The INO80E subunit is also involved in the regulation of gene expression changes, as evidenced by its role in maintaining embryonic stem cell pluripotency through the regulation of genes like Sox2 (Cox2017Global).

## Clinical Significance
The INO80E gene, a component of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability. Alterations in INO80E expression are associated with several types of cancer, including breast cancer, where its expression is elevated in cancer cells compared to normal cells (Ryczek20235’). The INO80E gene is also linked to cervical cancer and melanoma, highlighting its potential role in oncogenic processes (Sahu2020The).

The interaction of INO80E with other proteins is crucial for its function. For instance, the SUMOylation of TFPT, a subunit of the INO80 complex, enhances its interaction with INO80E. This modification is important for the regulation of chromatin remodeling and gene transcription, suggesting that disruptions in these interactions could contribute to disease (Cox2017Global).

The INO80E gene's involvement in transcriptional regulation is further complicated by its overlap with the HIRIP3 gene. This overlap can lead to transcriptional interference, affecting the expression of both genes and potentially contributing to cancer progression (Ryczek20235’). Understanding these interactions and expression changes is crucial for developing potential therapeutic strategies targeting INO80E-related pathways.

## Interactions
INO80E, a subunit of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the TFPT protein, and this interaction is significantly enhanced by the SUMOylation of TFPT, particularly by SUMO2. The C-terminal SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of INO80E is crucial for binding to the SUMO2-modified form of TFPT, as demonstrated by in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Cox2017Global). INO80E can also interact with unmodified TFPT, and this interaction is enhanced in the absence of SUMOylated TFPT, indicating a competitive binding scenario (Cox2017Global).

INO80E is also involved in resolving R-loops, which are RNA:DNA hybrid structures that can impede DNA replication. The INO80 complex, including INO80E, is recruited to R-loop-enriched sites, facilitating their resolution and promoting DNA replication. This interaction is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and cancer cell proliferation (Prendergast2020Resolution). INO80E's role in R-loop resolution is further supported by experiments showing that its tethering to specific genomic loci reduces R-loop signals, similar to the effect of RNAse H1 (Prendergast2020Resolution).
