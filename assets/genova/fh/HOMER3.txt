# HOMER3

## Overview
HOMER3 is a gene that encodes the homer scaffold protein 3, a member of the Homer family of proteins, which are integral to synaptic signaling and cellular communication. The protein is characterized as a scaffold protein, facilitating the organization and regulation of various signaling pathways within cells. Homer scaffold protein 3 is involved in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton, cell polarity, and synaptic plasticity, playing a crucial role in processes such as chemotaxis and signal transduction in immune cells (Ishiguro2004Homer3; Wu2015Homer3). The protein's structure includes an EVH1 domain, essential for protein-protein interactions, and coiled-coil domains that enable oligomerization, which are vital for its function in cellular signaling networks (Ishiguro2004Homer3; M.Soloviev2000Molecular). HOMER3's expression and function have been implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including its role in cancer progression, where it influences cell motility and metastasis (Sun2023HOMER3; Liu2021HOMER3).

## Structure
HOMER3 encodes the Homer-3 protein, which is part of the Homer family involved in synaptic signaling. The primary structure of Homer-3 includes a linear sequence of amino acids, with specific domains such as the EVH1 domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions (Ishiguro2004Homer3). The secondary structure features coiled-coil domains, which are important for the protein's oligomerization capabilities (M.Soloviev2000Molecular). These coiled-coil domains are located in the C-terminal region and are responsible for forming dimers and tetramers, facilitated by leucine zipper motifs (Ishiguro2004Homer3).

Alternative splicing of HOMER3 results in multiple isoforms, including long forms with coiled-coil domains and short forms lacking these domains, which affects their ability to oligomerize (M.Soloviev2000Molecular). The splicing events can lead to insertions or deletions of short amino acid sequences, influencing the protein's structure and function (M.Soloviev2000Molecular). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, alter Homer-3's affinity for target molecules and its solubility, impacting synaptic plasticity and signaling (Mizutani2008Phosphorylation).

## Function
HOMER3, a member of the Homer protein family, functions as a scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes. It plays a critical role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and establishing cell polarity, particularly in neutrophils. HOMER3 is essential for organizing polarized actin assembly, which is crucial for efficient chemotaxis and cell motility. It binds to F-actin and active Rac1-GTP, integrating signals to enable neutrophils to maintain a persistent leading edge during migration (Wu2015Homer3).

In T cells, HOMER3 is involved in signal transduction, particularly in the regulation of the serum response element (SRE) activation. It is recruited to the immunologic synapse upon T-cell receptor engagement and translocates into the nucleus, where it negatively regulates SRE activation through its EVH1 domain (Ishiguro2004Homer3).

HOMER3 is also expressed in various tissues, including the thymus and cochlear hair cells, where it may play roles in immune cell signaling and auditory function, respectively. Its interaction with other proteins, such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β and amyloid precursor protein, suggests its involvement in broader cellular signaling pathways (Parisiadou2008Homer2; Reibring2020Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
HOMER3 has been implicated in various cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and bladder cancer. In TNBC, HOMER3 is essential for EGF-mediated aggressiveness, with its silencing reducing invasive capabilities of cancer cells. High HOMER3 expression correlates with increased β-Catenin activity, promoting metastasis and poor survival outcomes (Liu2021HOMER3). In NSCLC, HOMER3 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. Its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer growth and metastasis through mitochondrial metabolism mediated by GABPB1 (Sun2023HOMER3). In bladder cancer, HOMER3 is identified as a glycoprotein with altered expression under hypoxia and glucose deprivation, linked to aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Its expression is associated with changes in glycosylation pathways, contributing to cancer cell motility and immune escape (Peixoto2021Glycoproteomics). These findings suggest that HOMER3 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
HOMER3 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and synaptic transmission. It specifically binds to the S8 ATPase, a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the proteasome, through coiled-coil domains. This interaction is part of a physiological complex involving the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1α (mGluR1a) and the 26S proteasome in the endoplasmic reticulum (Rezvani2012Proteasomal).

HOMER3 also interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP), particularly the APP751 isoform, through its EVH1 domain. This interaction inhibits amyloid-beta production by affecting APP processing and trafficking, as well as the maturation of β-secretase (BACE1) (Parisiadou2008Homer2).

In neutrophils, HOMER3 binds to actin filaments and active Rac1-GTP, facilitating the organization of actin into a polarized distribution necessary for cell motility and chemotaxis. It also interacts with Gαi2, a component of the G-protein complex, to support neutrophil polarity and motility (Wu2015Homer3).

HOMER3's interaction with the PAX6 protein, specifically its PST domain, has been identified, although this interaction may be weak or context-dependent (Cooper2005A).
