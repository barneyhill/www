# LCNL1

## Overview
The LCNL1 gene encodes the protein lipocalin-like 1, which is a member of the lipocalin protein family. Lipocalins are small, secreted proteins known for their ability to bind and transport small hydrophobic molecules, such as lipids, hormones, and vitamins. The lipocalin-like 1 protein is characterized by its conserved barrel-shaped structure, which facilitates its role in molecular transport and cellular signaling. Although the specific biological functions of lipocalin-like 1 are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in various physiological processes, including cellular homeostasis and immune response modulation. The gene's expression and the protein's activity are subjects of ongoing research, particularly in the context of their potential involvement in disease pathways and therapeutic applications (Qiu2020aarFDC).
