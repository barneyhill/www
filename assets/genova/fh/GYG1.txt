# GYG1

## Overview
The GYG1 gene encodes the protein glycogenin-1, a glycosyltransferase enzyme that plays a pivotal role in glycogen biosynthesis. Glycogenin-1 acts as a primer for glycogen synthesis by autoglucosylating itself, thereby initiating the formation of a glucose polymer that serves as a substrate for further elongation by glycogen synthase and branching enzymes. This protein is crucial for energy storage and release, particularly in muscle and liver cells, and is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis. Mutations in the GYG1 gene can lead to various glycogen storage diseases, characterized by abnormal glycogen accumulation and associated with muscle and cardiac dysfunctions (Desikan2018GYG1; Malfatti2014A). Glycogenin-1's interaction with glycogen synthase is vital for its function, although glycogen synthesis can occur independently of glycogenin-1, as demonstrated in knockout models (Visuttijai2019Glycogenin).

## Structure
The GYG1 gene encodes the glycogenin-1 protein, which plays a crucial role in glycogen biosynthesis by serving as a primer for glycogen synthesis through autoglucosylation. The primary structure of glycogenin-1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains essential for its function. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Visuttijai2019Glycogenin).

Glycogenin-1's tertiary structure is globular, allowing it to interact effectively with other proteins involved in glycogen synthesis. It can form homodimers, which is part of its quaternary structure, facilitating its role in initiating glycogen synthesis (Visuttijai2019Glycogenin). The protein contains a helix-turn-helix motif that interacts with glycogen synthase (GYS1), specifically engaging with helices α4, α9, and α10 of GYS1 through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (McCorvie2021Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of glycogenin-1 include phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions with other proteins (McCorvie2021Molecular). The protein may have different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and regulation in glycogen metabolism (Visuttijai2019Glycogenin).

## Function
The GYG1 gene encodes glycogenin-1, a glycosyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycogen biosynthesis in healthy human cells. Glycogenin-1 initiates the formation of glycogen by autoglucosylation, a process where it adds glucose units to itself, creating a short glucose polymer of approximately 10 glucose residues. This polymer serves as a primer for further elongation and branching by glycogen synthase and the branching enzyme, which are the other main enzymes involved in glycogen biosynthesis (Desikan2018GYG1; Malfatti2014A).

In the cytoplasm, particularly in muscle and liver cells, glycogenin-1 facilitates energy storage and release, essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis in the body. The enzyme's activity is critical for the proper synthesis of glycogen, which is a vital energy reserve in skeletal muscle. Defects in glycogen synthesis or degradation can lead to glycogen storage diseases, highlighting the importance of glycogenin-1 in maintaining normal muscle function (Desikan2018GYG1; Malfatti2014A).

Mutations in the GYG1 gene can lead to reduced, absent, or functionally abnormal glycogenin-1, resulting in defective priming of glycogen synthesis and abnormal glycogen accumulation, which can manifest in various glycogen storage diseases (Desikan2018GYG1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GYG1 gene, which encodes glycogenin-1, are associated with several glycogen storage diseases, primarily affecting muscle and cardiac tissues. One such condition is late-onset polyglucosan body myopathy, characterized by progressive limb-girdle muscle weakness and exercise intolerance. This condition is linked to a homozygous intronic mutation (c.143 + 3G > C) that disrupts normal splicing, leading to impaired glycogenin-1 biosynthesis and polyglucosan accumulation in muscle fibers (Malfatti2014A; Akman2016Lateonset).

Another mutation, c.634C>T (p.His212Tyr), affects the enzyme's auto-glucosylation ability, resulting in muscle weakness and glycogen storage issues (Luo2015Muscle). GYG1 mutations can also lead to glycogen storage cardiomyopathy, presenting with heart failure and abnormal glycogen storage in cardiac tissues. This is often due to mutations that abolish the enzyme's autoglucosylation function, such as the p.Asp102His mutation (Hedberg‐Oldfors2016Cardiomyopathy).

The clinical presentation of GYG1 mutations is variable, with some patients experiencing both skeletal myopathy and cardiomyopathy, while others may have isolated symptoms. The variability in symptoms is attributed to different mutations and their effects on glycogenin-1 function (Ben2017Clinical; Desikan2018GYG1).

## Interactions
Glycogenin-1, encoded by the GYG1 gene, is known to interact with glycogen synthase, a key enzyme in glycogen biosynthesis. This interaction is primarily mediated by the COOH-terminal region of glycogenin-1, which contains 33 amino acid residues. The COOH-terminal fragments of glycogenin-1, specifically residues 301-333, 297-333, and 263-333, have been shown to strongly interact with glycogen synthase. This interaction was confirmed through two-hybrid analysis and in vitro studies using GST-fusion proteins, demonstrating that these glycogenin fragments can effectively pull down glycogen synthase from mouse skeletal muscle homogenates (Skurat2006Interaction).

The interaction between glycogenin-1 and glycogen synthase is crucial for the initiation of glycogen synthesis. Glycogenin-1 autoglucosylates itself, forming a substrate for glycogen synthase, which then elongates the glycogen chain. This interaction is not only observed in skeletal muscle but also with the liver isoform of glycogen synthase, indicating a broad role in glycogen metabolism across different tissues (Skurat2006Interaction).

Despite the strong interaction with glycogen synthase, the functional importance of glycogenin-1 in glycogen synthesis is not fully understood, as glycogen synthesis can occur without it, as seen in glycogenin knockout models (Visuttijai2019Glycogenin).
