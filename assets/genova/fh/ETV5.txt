# ETV5

## Overview
ETV5, or ETS variant transcription factor 5, is a gene that encodes a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, which are characterized by their conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. The ETV5 protein plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. As a transcription factor, ETV5 is involved in maintaining the self-renewal of neural progenitor cells and modulating fibroblast growth factor signaling, which is essential for neural development and tissue homeostasis (Liu2019ETV5). Additionally, ETV5 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders, due to its role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and its involvement in oncogenic pathways (Wei2023E26; di2019ETV5). The protein's function is regulated by its structural features, including a C-terminal inhibitory domain that mediates autoinhibition, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions (Currie2017Structured; Cooper2015Structures).

## Structure
ETV5, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, features a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain characterized by a variant helix-turn-helix (winged helix) structure. This domain comprises three α-helices and a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, with the α3 helix playing a crucial role in DNA binding by inserting into the major groove of the DNA (Cooper2015Structures). The ETV5 protein also includes a C-terminal inhibitory domain (CID) that interacts with the ETS domain to mediate autoinhibition of DNA binding. This interaction involves an α-helix termed H4, which, when truncated, can lead to a loss of autoinhibition (Currie2017Structured).

The tertiary structure of ETV5 involves significant conformational changes upon DNA binding, particularly in the recognition helix, which is essential for scanning DNA for high-affinity sites (Cooper2015Structures). ETV5 can form disulfide-linked dimers, which inhibit DNA binding, suggesting a redox-dependent regulatory mechanism (Cooper2015Structures). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, also play a role in regulating ETV5's DNA-binding activity (Cooper2015Structures). The protein's structure and function are further influenced by the dynamic equilibrium between its autoinhibited and active conformations, modulated by the N-terminal and C-terminal inhibitory domains (Currie2017Structured).

## Function
ETV5 (ETS variant transcription factor 5) is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. It is part of the ETS family of transcription factors, which are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. ETV5 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to modulate the transcription of target genes (Zhang2021Biological).

In neural progenitor cells (NPCs), ETV5 is crucial for maintaining self-renewal and inhibiting premature neuronal differentiation. It achieves this by repressing the expression of the proneural gene NEUROG2, thereby preserving NPC identity and promoting the formation of GABAergic neurons over glutamatergic neurons (Liu2019ETV5). ETV5 interacts with the transcriptional corepressor CoREST to mediate this repression, which is essential for the specification of neuronal subtype identities (Liu2019ETV5).

ETV5 is also involved in the regulation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which is important for maintaining the multipotent state of NPCs and inducing neurogenesis and gliogenesis (Liu2019ETV5). This highlights its role in neural development and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The ETV5 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions, primarily due to its dysregulation and involvement in multiple signaling pathways. In cancer, ETV5 is often overexpressed and contributes to tumor progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. It is associated with several cancer types, including prostate, thyroid, lung, endometrial, colorectal, ovarian, and bladder cancers (Wei2023E26; di2019ETV5). In prostate cancer, ETV5 gene fusions, such as with TMPRSS2 and SLC45A3, protect it from degradation and promote oncogenic transformation (Wei2023E26). In neuroblastoma, ETV5 is a target of activated ALK, contributing to increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (Mus2020The).

ETV5 also plays a role in metabolic disorders. It is linked to obesity and glucose intolerance, where its loss of function results in reduced diet-induced obesity and severe glucose intolerance (Wei2023E26). In the immune system, ETV5 is involved in allergic airway inflammation and intestinal inflammation, influencing the production of IL-17 and affecting Th17 cell differentiation (Wei2023E26). These findings highlight ETV5's significance as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, as well as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
ETV5, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its role in cellular processes. In endometrial carcinoma, ETV5 interacts with the lipoma-preferred partner (LPP), functioning as a sensor of extracellular signals. This interaction promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for tumor invasion and metastasis. LPP acts as a transcriptional co-activator with ETV5, enhancing its transcriptional activity and facilitating the relocalization of LPP from cell-cell contacts to focal adhesions, which supports further invasion (Colas2012ETV5).

ETV5 also interacts with the Zeb1 promoter region, inducing Zeb1 expression, which represses E-Cadherin transcription, a hallmark of EMT. This interaction is demonstrated through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and luciferase reporter assays, highlighting ETV5's role in modulating gene expression related to EMT (Colas2012ETV5).

In neuroblastoma, ETV5 is regulated by the ALK gene and is part of the ERK-ETV5-RET pathway. ETV5 binds to the RET promoter, driving its expression and contributing to oncogenesis. This interaction is confirmed by ChIP-seq analysis, which identifies ETV5 binding sites on the RET promoter and an upstream enhancer (LopezDelisle2018Activated).
