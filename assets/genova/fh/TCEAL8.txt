# TCEAL8

## Overview
TCEAL8, or Transcription Elongation Factor A (SII)-Like 8, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transcription elongation factor A-like family. This protein is involved in the regulation of transcription elongation, a critical process in gene expression. TCEAL8 is categorized as a transcription factor and plays a significant role in modulating cellular processes, particularly in cardiomyocytes, where it interacts with other proteins to influence cell cycle activity and cell viability. The protein encoded by TCEAL8 is part of a larger network within the Bex/Tceal superfamily, which is involved in coordinating cellular decisions related to death, division, and differentiation. The expression of TCEAL8 is developmentally regulated, particularly in the heart, suggesting its importance in cardiomyocyte maturation and function (Judd2019Defined). Additionally, alterations in TCEAL8 expression have been observed in various cancers, indicating its potential role in disease pathogenesis and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Lin2007Gene; Aisa2022Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TCEAL8 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), TCEAL8 is significantly upregulated compared to normal tissues, although it does not show significant prognostic value for overall survival (Aisa2022Comprehensive). In precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-T LBL), TCEAL8 is over-expressed in SCL/LMO1 tumors, suggesting a potential role in the growth and proliferation of these cancer cells (Lin2007Gene).

In the context of cardiomyocytes, TCEAL8 plays a protective role by inhibiting E2f2-induced cell cycle re-entry, which can lead to cell death. This function is crucial in maintaining cell viability, indicating its potential therapeutic relevance in cardiac diseases involving loss of cardiomyocytes (Judd2019Defined). The gene's interaction with cell cycle regulators and its ability to modulate cell proliferation and death decisions highlight its importance in cardiomyocyte development and maturation (Judd2019Defined).

Overall, while TCEAL8's specific clinical significance is not fully understood, its altered expression in certain cancers and its regulatory role in cardiomyocytes suggest it may be a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
TCEAL8, a member of the transcription elongation factor A-like family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of cardiomyocytes, TCEAL8 interacts with E2f2, a transcription factor known to induce cell death when overexpressed. TCEAL8 can rescue cell viability by inhibiting E2f2-induced cell cycle re-entry and suppressing the expression of Cyclin E and Cyclin A2, thereby blocking cell cycle activity (Judd2019Defined). This interaction suggests a regulatory role for TCEAL8 in modulating E2f2-mediated gene transcription.

TCEAL8 is also part of a broader network of interactions within the Bex/Tceal superfamily, which includes BEX1. While both TCEAL8 and BEX1 can rescue cell death induced by E2f2, they have distinct effects on cell cycle re-entry, with TCEAL8 preventing S-phase re-entry at lower multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (Judd2019Defined). These interactions highlight the role of TCEAL8 as a signaling hub, coordinating cellular decisions related to death, division, and differentiation during heart development (Judd2019Defined). The expression of TCEAL8 is developmentally regulated in the heart, which may be significant for cardiomyocyte maturation (Judd2019Defined).
