# HTRA3

## Overview
HTRA3 is a gene that encodes the HtrA serine peptidase 3, a serine protease involved in various cellular processes, including protein quality control and apoptosis. The protein exists in two isoforms, a long form (HtrA3L) and a short form (HtrA3S), which result from alternative splicing. The long form contains a PDZ domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the short form lacks this domain. HtrA serine peptidase 3 is characterized by a chymotrypsin-like fold and forms a trimeric structure, similar to other members of the HtrA family. It plays a significant role in regulating the insulin-like growth factor system and interacts with the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, influencing signaling pathways. The protein is implicated in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and is considered a tumor suppressor, although its expression and function can vary across different cancer types, highlighting its complex role in tumorigenesis (Bowden2010Hightemperature; Glaza2015Structural; NIE2003Identification).

## Structure
The HTRA3 protein exists in two isoforms: a long form (HtrA3L) and a short form (HtrA3S), resulting from alternative splicing. The long form includes a signal peptide, an insulin/insulin-like growth factor binding domain (IGFBP), a Kazal-type inhibitor motif, a serine protease domain, and a PDZ domain. The short form lacks the PDZ domain and has a unique seven amino acid sequence at the C-terminus (Glaza2015Structural; NIE2003Identification).

The serine protease domain of HTRA3 adopts a chymotrypsin-like fold, characterized by two 6-stranded β-barrel lobes. The active site is formed by a catalytic triad consisting of His191, Asp227, and Ser305, although in some studies, the serine is replaced by alanine to render the protein inactive (Glaza2015Structural; ZurawaJanicka2017Structural). The PDZ domain, which is not essential for proteolytic activity, influences trimer formation and is involved in protein-protein interactions (Glaza2015Structural; ZurawaJanicka2017Structural).

HTRA3 forms a trimeric structure, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions involving phenylalanine residues. This trimeric assembly is similar to other HtrA family members, such as HtrA1 and HtrA2 (Glaza2015Structural; ZurawaJanicka2017Structural). The protein is involved in apoptosis and is considered a tumor suppressor, with its activity potentially regulated by post-translational modifications like phosphorylation (Glaza2015Structural).

## Function
HTRA3 is a serine protease involved in several critical cellular processes, including protein quality control and apoptosis. It is expressed in various tissues, with notable activity in the heart, ovary, and placenta (NIE2003Identification). HTRA3 exists in two isoforms, a long form and a short form, produced through alternative splicing. The long form contains a PDZ domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, while the short form lacks this domain (Bowden2010Hightemperature; NIE2003Identification).

In healthy human cells, HTRA3 plays a role in regulating the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, which is crucial for ovarian processes such as follicle maturation, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation and regression (Bowden2010Hightemperature). It also interacts with members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, potentially inhibiting signaling pathways like BMP-4, BMP-2, and TGF-β1 (Bowden2010Hightemperature).

HTRA3 is involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, where it is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol upon treatment with cytotoxic agents, triggering apoptosis (Glaza2015Structural). Its activity is highly temperature-dependent, and it is known to degrade misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Glaza2015Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HTRA3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it may function as a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context. In ovarian cancer, HTRA3 expression is significantly decreased, with a dramatic reduction in mRNA and protein levels across tumor groups, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Narkiewicz2008Changes). Similarly, in endometrial cancer, HTRA3 levels decrease with increasing tumor grades, indicating its involvement in tumor progression (Bowden2006Serine).

In contrast, HTRA3 is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues, where it is associated with poor prognosis and advanced clinical features, suggesting a role in promoting tumor progression in this context (Ji2020HTRA3). In lung cancer, HTRA3 expression is generally downregulated, correlating with increased risk of postoperative recurrence and reduced sensitivity to chemotherapy, particularly in patients with a history of heavy smoking (Rosochowicz2024Exploring).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, high HTRA3 expression is linked to poorer survival outcomes and may facilitate tumor immune evasion, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression and as a target for precision immunotherapy (Xu2021Multiomics). These findings underscore the complex role of HTRA3 in cancer, where its expression and function can vary significantly across different tumor types.

## Interactions
HTRA3 (HtrA serine peptidase 3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with integrin β1 (Itgβ1) in endothelial cells, facilitating the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which is crucial for angiogenesis and tip cell specification (Guo2021HtrA3‐Mediated). HTRA3 degrades collagen IV in the extracellular matrix, exposing ligands that activate Itgβ1, linking extracellular matrix interactions to intracellular signaling pathways (Guo2021HtrA3‐Mediated).

HTRA3 also interacts with peptides such as AMVKLYC and GMMMRFC, which bind to its allosteric sites, inducing conformational changes that affect its catalytic activity (Acharya2019Identification). These interactions highlight the role of HTRA3 in allosteric regulation and substrate specificity.

The PDZ domain of HTRA3, although not essential for its enzymatic activity, is crucial for maintaining its trimeric structure, which is important for its function in apoptosis and tumor suppression (Glaza2015Structural). The PDZ domain may also mediate interactions with other proteins, influencing HTRA3's regulatory functions (Glaza2015Structural).
