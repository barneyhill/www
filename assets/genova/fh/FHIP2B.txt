# FHIP2B

## Overview
FHIP2B is a gene that encodes the protein FHF complex subunit HOOK interacting protein 2B, which is a crucial component of the cytoplasmic FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex. This protein is involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly in linking cytoplasmic dynein-1 to various cellular cargos, thereby facilitating dynein-mediated transport. FHIP2B interacts with Hook proteins (Hook1, Hook2, and Hook3) to form complexes that are essential for the transport of cellular components such as endosomes and mitochondria. The protein is notably associated with Golgi and mitochondria-associated proteins, indicating its role in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network transport and mitochondrial function (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

## Function
FHIP2B is a protein involved in intracellular transport processes, particularly in the context of the FTS-Hook-FHIP (FHF) complex. This complex plays a crucial role in linking cytoplasmic dynein-1 to various cellular cargos, contributing to the diversity of dynein-mediated transport. FHIP2B interacts with all three Hook proteins (Hook1, Hook2, and Hook3), forming complexes that associate with motile dynein/dynactin complexes, which are essential for cargo transport within cells (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

FHIP2B is notably associated with Golgi-associated proteins and is involved in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) transport. Its interactome is enriched with mitochondria-associated proteins, suggesting a specific role in mitochondrial function and potentially in the dynein-mediated transport of mitochondria (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). The protein's interactions with Hook proteins and its presence in the FHF complex indicate its involvement in linking dynein to specific cellular cargos, such as endosome-to-Golgi transport intermediates and mitochondria, without altering dynein's motility (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

In summary, FHIP2B is active in the cytoplasm, contributing to cellular organization and vesicle transport, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function.

## Interactions
FHIP2B is involved in several protein-protein interactions, primarily within the FHF (FTS-Hook-FHIP) complex. It interacts with all three Hook proteins (Hook1, Hook2, and Hook3), forming complexes that are crucial for various cellular processes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that 3XFLAG-tagged FHIP2B can coimmunoprecipitate with Hook2 and Hook3, indicating its ability to form stable complexes with these proteins (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

The FHIP2B interactome is enriched with Golgi-associated proteins and proteins involved in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network transport, such as TBC1D23, FAM91A1, GOLGA4, and GOLGA5. This suggests a role for FHIP2B in intracellular transport processes (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic). Additionally, FHIP2B is associated with a significant number of mitochondria-associated proteins, particularly those linked to the outer mitochondrial membrane, including AKAP1, GRP75, TRAK1, and DRP1. This association implies a potential role in dynein-mediated transport of mitochondria or related functions (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).

The study of FHIP2B's interactions did not reveal any direct interactions with nucleic acids, focusing instead on its role in protein complexes and cellular transport mechanisms (Christensen2021Cytoplasmic).
