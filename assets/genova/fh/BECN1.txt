# BECN1

## Overview
The BECN1 gene encodes the protein beclin 1, a key regulator in the autophagy pathway, which is a cellular process responsible for degrading and recycling cellular components. Beclin 1 is categorized as an autophagy-related protein and is integral to the formation of autophagosomes, the vesicles that sequester cytoplasmic material for degradation. The protein's structure is characterized by several domains, including an intrinsically disordered region, a flexible helical domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a β-α-repeated autophagy-specific domain, which facilitate its interactions with various proteins and its role in autophagy (Mei2016Conformational). Beclin 1's interactions with other proteins, such as PI3KC3/Vps34, Atg14L, and UVRAG, are crucial for autophagosome nucleation and function (He2015Divergent; Kang2011The). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, and Machado-Joseph disease, where alterations in beclin 1 expression or function can contribute to disease pathogenesis (Qu2003Promotion; Kazachkova2017Promoter; Pickford2008The).

## Structure
The BECN1 (beclin 1) protein is a 450-residue protein with a complex domain architecture that includes several distinct regions. It begins with an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) spanning residues 1-140, which is rich in disorder-promoting residues and contains several binding motifs crucial for protein-protein interactions (Mei2016Conformational). This IDR transitions into a flexible helical domain (FHD) from residues 141-171, which can trimerize and is important for autophagy regulation (Mei2016Conformational).

The coiled-coil domain (CCD), covering residues 175-265, forms a left-handed coiled-coil structure with 26 heptad repeats, facilitating homodimerization and interactions with other proteins (Mei2016Conformational). The β-α-repeated autophagy-specific domain (BARAD), spanning residues 266-450, features a novel fold with three repeats of a β-sheet followed by an α-helix, forming a three-helix bundle essential for membrane binding and autophagy induction (Mei2016Conformational).

BECN1's structure is characterized by its conformational flexibility, allowing it to interact with various proteins and participate in autophagy and other cellular processes. This flexibility is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate its activity and interactions (Mei2016Conformational; Menon2018Beclin). The protein's ability to form both homodimers and heterodimers is crucial for its function in autophagy (Ranaghan2017The).

## Function
The BECN1 gene encodes the Beclin 1 protein, which plays a pivotal role in the autophagic process, a cellular mechanism for degrading and recycling cellular components. Beclin 1 is essential for the formation of autophagosomes, vesicles that sequester cytoplasmic material for degradation, and is involved in the nucleation of autophagic vesicles (Kang2011The; Sahni2014Gene). It forms a core complex with PI3KC3/Vps34 and Vps15, which is crucial for the initiation of autophagy (He2015Divergent; Kang2011The). Beclin 1 interacts with various cofactors, such as Atg14L and UVRAG, to regulate the lipid kinase Vps34, promoting the formation of autophagosomes (He2015Divergent; Kang2011The).

In healthy human cells, Beclin 1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and organelles like the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (Kang2011The; Sahni2014Gene). It is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating the lysosome-mediated recycling of damaged organelles and cellular components, contributing to cell survival under stress conditions (Copetti2009p65RelA; Sahni2014Gene). Beclin 1's function is also linked to the regulation of apoptosis, as it interacts with anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2, which can inhibit autophagy (Kang2011The; Sahni2014Gene).

## Clinical Significance
The BECN1 gene, encoding the autophagy-related protein beclin 1, is implicated in several diseases due to its role in autophagy. In Machado-Joseph disease/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (MJD/SCA3), variants in the BECN1 promoter, such as rs60221525 and rs116943570, affect transcription factor binding and alter beclin 1 expression levels. The rs60221525 C allele is associated with decreased BECN1 expression, leading to earlier disease onset and more severe symptoms, while the rs116943570 T allele is linked to increased expression, potentially alleviating disease severity (Kazachkova2017Promoter).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), reduced expression of beclin 1 is observed in the brains of patients, particularly in early stages. This deficiency is associated with increased amyloid β accumulation, synaptic degeneration, and neuronal loss, suggesting a role in AD pathogenesis (Pickford2008The). Beclin 1 deficiency disrupts autophagy, contributing to the accumulation of amyloid β and neurodegeneration (Pickford2008The).

In cancer, BECN1 acts as a haplo-insufficient tumor-suppressor gene. Heterozygous disruption of BECN1 in mice leads to increased spontaneous tumorigenesis, including lung and liver cancers, and lymphomas, highlighting its role in tumor suppression (Qu2003Promotion).

## Interactions
Beclin 1 (BECN1) is a central player in autophagy, forming multiprotein complexes essential for autophagosome formation. It interacts with class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3/VPS34) and other proteins such as PIK3R4/VPS15 and ATG14/Barkor, which are crucial for autophagosome nucleation (Lee2019Structural). Beclin 1's coiled-coil domain (CCD) facilitates interactions with proteins like UVRAG, Atg14L, and Rubicon, influencing autophagy and endosomal trafficking (Kaur2020The).

Beclin 1 contains a BCL2 homology 3 (BH3) domain, which mediates interactions with anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins, including BCL2 and BCL-XL. These interactions can inhibit autophagy by preventing Beclin 1 from associating with PI3KC3/VPS34 (Lee2019Structural; Maiuri2007Functional). Phosphorylation of Beclin 1 at specific sites, such as T119 by DAPk, can promote its dissociation from BCL2 and BCL-XL, thereby activating autophagy (Zalckvar2009Phosphorylation).

Beclin 1 also interacts with Ambra1, which promotes phosphorylation and the formation of PI3KC3 Complex I, facilitating autophagy nucleation (Mei2016Conformational). Additionally, Beclin 1's interaction with CAV1 under oxidative stress conditions is crucial for its mitochondrial localization and the induction of mitophagy (Nah2017Phosphorylated).
