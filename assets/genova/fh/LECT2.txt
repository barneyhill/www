# LECT2

## Overview
The LECT2 gene encodes the protein leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2, a multifunctional cytokine primarily secreted by the liver. This protein is involved in various biological processes, including immune response regulation, hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis, and liver function. Structurally, LECT2 is characterized by a unique configuration that includes a zinc-binding site, although it lacks enzymatic activity typical of metalloendopeptidases (Zheng2016Crystal). Functionally, LECT2 acts as a chemotactic factor and interacts with several receptors, such as CD209a and Tie1, influencing processes like immune cell recruitment, liver fibrogenesis, and angiogenesis (Xu2019LECT2; Lu2016LECT2). Clinically, LECT2 is significant in conditions such as hepatocellular carcinoma, liver fibrosis, and metabolic disorders, where its expression and interactions can impact disease progression and prognosis (Qin2022Prognostic; Liu2024Global). The protein's ability to form amyloid fibrils also links it to amyloidosis, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Richards2023CryoEM).

## Structure
The LECT2 protein is a 151-residue polypeptide encoded by the LECT2 gene, with a mature form consisting of 133 residues following the cleavage of an 18-residue signal peptide (Tsiolaki2019Delving). Structurally, LECT2 features a six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a three-stranded β-sheet, connected by four loops, forming a groove similar to zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidases (Zheng2016Crystal; Tsiolaki2019Delving). The protein includes a Zn(II) ion coordinated by His 35, Asp 39, His 120, and a water molecule, although it lacks enzymatic activity due to the absence of a catalytic histidine, replaced by Tyr 86 (Zheng2016Crystal).

LECT2 has a unique N-terminal IC loop and three disulfide bonds that contribute to its stability (Zheng2016Crystal). The protein's structure is distinct from other M23 family members, with variations in loop regions and an additional wall surrounding the Zn(II)-binding site, which may prevent substrate binding (Zheng2016Crystal). LECT2 can form amyloid fibrils, with a core structure stabilized by polar ladders and hydrophobic zippers, particularly involving residues 55-75 (Richards2023CryoEM). The loss of bound Zn(II) may facilitate this amyloid transition (Richards2023CryoEM).

## Function
LECT2 (leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2) is a multifunctional cytokine primarily secreted by the liver, playing a significant role in immune response regulation and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis. In healthy human cells, LECT2 influences HSC expansion and mobilization by interacting with macrophages and osteolineage cells that express the LECT2 receptor CD209a. This interaction leads to an increase in HSCs in the bone marrow and their mobilization into the bloodstream, which is crucial for enhancing protective immunity, particularly in conditions like sepsis (Lu2016LECT2).

LECT2 also modulates the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis, which is important for HSC migration, by decreasing CXCR4 expression and increasing CD26 activity, facilitating HSC mobilization (Lu2016LECT2). Additionally, LECT2 acts as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils, influencing their migration and potentially playing a role in immune cell recruitment to sites of inflammation (Ovejero2004Identification).

In the context of liver function, LECT2 is identified as a direct target gene of β-catenin, suggesting its involvement in liver-related processes and possibly in liver cancer, particularly in tumors with altered Wnt pathway signaling (Ovejero2004Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The LECT2 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases and conditions through mutations, altered expression levels, and disrupted interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LECT2 expression is reduced, correlating with poor prognosis and decreased survival rates. Its expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors, affecting the tumor immune microenvironment (Qin2022Prognostic; Zhu2023The). LECT2 also plays a role in liver fibrogenesis, where its overexpression contributes to fibrosis by interacting with the Tie1 receptor, inhibiting portal angiogenesis, and promoting sinusoid capillarization (Xu2019LECT2).

LECT2 is implicated in metabolic disorders such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where it promotes liver fat accumulation and inflammation (Liu2024Global). In rheumatoid arthritis, LECT2 acts as a suppressor, with deficiency leading to more severe symptoms (Liu2024Global). It is also associated with amyloidosis, where misfolding leads to tissue deposits affecting organ function (Zhu2023The). These findings highlight LECT2's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
LECT2 (leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various biological processes. One of its primary interactions is with the Tie1 receptor, where LECT2 acts as a ligand. This interaction is crucial in liver fibrogenesis, as LECT2 binds to the Ig3 domain of Tie1, leading to the dephosphorylation of Tie1 and the phosphorylation of Tie2. This binding shifts the balance from Tie1/Tie2 heterodimers to Tie2/Tie2 homodimers, activating signaling pathways such as MAPK, PPAR, and MMP, which inhibit endothelial cell migration and tube formation (Xu2019LECT2).

LECT2 also interacts with VEGFR2, inhibiting its phosphorylation and downstream signaling pathways, which are essential for angiogenesis. This interaction is particularly relevant in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, where LECT2 suppresses VEGF165-induced endothelial cell activities, including proliferation, migration, and tube formation (Chen2016Inhibition).

These interactions highlight LECT2's role as an anti-angiogenic factor, influencing both liver fibrosis and tumor angiogenesis through its interactions with Tie1 and VEGFR2 (Xu2019LECT2; Chen2016Inhibition).
