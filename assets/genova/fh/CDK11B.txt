# CDK11B

## Overview
Cyclin-dependent kinase 11B (CDK11B) is a gene that encodes the serine/threonine kinase protein, cyclin-dependent kinase 11B. This kinase is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and RNA splicing. CDK11B is located on human chromosome 1 band p36.3 and is expressed throughout the cell cycle, indicating its roles extend beyond mitotic control to include transcriptional regulation and RNA processing (Zhou2016The; Wright2019Differential). The protein forms complexes with cyclins, such as Cyclin L, which are necessary for its activation and function (Klein2020Cyclindependent). CDK11B is implicated in several cancers, where its expression levels correlate with tumor progression and patient prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Ahmed2019CDK11; Kren2015Preclinical).

## Structure
CDK11B, a cyclin-dependent kinase, is encoded by the CDC2L2 gene and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The protein is composed of a kinase domain located in the carboxy-terminal half, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Loyer2020Roles; Zhou2016The). The primary structure of CDK11B includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, with a molecular weight of approximately 110 kDa (Roskoski2019Cyclindependent).

The secondary structure of CDK11B likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of serine/threonine kinases, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional conformation of the protein, which is essential for its function, but specific structural details are not available (Klein2020Cyclindependent).

CDK11B forms complexes with cyclins, such as Cyclin L, which is necessary for its activation. This interaction is part of its quaternary structure, involving dimerization with other proteins (Klein2020Cyclindependent). CDK11B undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is critical for its activation and function (Karimbayli2024Insights). The protein also exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with CDK11 p110, p58, and p46 being the predominant forms, each with distinct cellular roles (Loyer2020Roles; Zhou2016The).

## Function
CDK11B, a serine/threonine kinase, plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and RNA splicing. It is encoded by the CDC2L1 gene and is located on human chromosome 1 band p36.3. CDK11B is involved in both cell cycle control and RNA transcription regulation, with its activity being crucial for mitosis and cellular proliferation (Zhou2016The). The protein is composed of an N-terminal regulatory region with multiple nuclear localization signals and a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain responsible for its kinase activity. It binds to L-type cyclins and coordinates transcription and RNA processing, particularly alternative splicing (Zhou2016The).

CDK11B is expressed throughout the cell cycle, indicating roles beyond mitotic control, such as transcriptional regulation and RNA processing (Wright2019Differential). It is a crucial component of the mediator complex involved in mRNA transcription, interacting with various transcription factors and RNA processing factors, such as RNAP II (Zhou2016The). CDK11B also plays a role in autophagy, where its knockdown leads to an accumulation of autophagosomes, indicating its importance in autophagosome turnover and cellular homeostasis (Wilkinson2011The).

## Clinical Significance
CDK11B is implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell proliferation and survival. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CDK11B expression is significantly higher compared to normal breast tissues. Its downregulation in TNBC cell lines leads to reduced cell viability and tumor growth, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Kren2015Preclinical). In osteosarcoma, high CDK11 expression correlates with poor survival outcomes, and its knockdown results in inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, suggesting its critical role in tumor progression (Duan2012Systematic).

In melanoma, CDK11B alterations are associated with poor prognosis. Downregulation of CDK11 in melanoma cells leads to cell cycle dysfunction and reduced cell viability, highlighting its importance in melanoma cell survival (Ahmed2019CDK11). CDK11B is also involved in liposarcoma, where its expression is significantly higher compared to benign lipomas, suggesting its role in tumor growth and proliferation (Thiel2022The).

Overall, alterations in CDK11B expression and function are linked to cancer cell survival and poor clinical outcomes across multiple cancer types, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Loyer2020Roles).

## Interactions
CDK11B, specifically the CDK11 p58 isoform, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. CDK11 p58 interacts with Plk4, a master regulator of centriole duplication, to facilitate its recruitment to mitotic centrosomes. This interaction is essential for centriole duplication and is demonstrated through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a direct physical association between CDK11 p58 and Plk4 (Franck2011CDK11p58).

CDK11 p58 also plays a role in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion at centromeres by interacting with Bub1 and Sgo1. These interactions are necessary for the localization of Bub1 and Sgo1 at centromeres, which protect chromatid cohesion during mitosis. CDK11 p58's kinase activity is crucial for these interactions, as its depletion leads to the loss of Bub1 and Sgo1 signals at centromeres (Rakkaa2014CDK11p58).

Additionally, CDK11 p58 is associated with mitotic centrosomes and interacts with the 14-3-3σ protein to control mitotic translation. It phosphorylates the eIF3F subunit of the translation factor eIF3 complex, which is important for normal mitotic processes (Loyer2020Roles).
