# EPS8L2

## Overview
EPS8L2 is a gene that encodes the EPS8-like 2 protein, which is a member of the EPS8 family known for its involvement in actin cytoskeleton remodeling. This protein plays a significant role in cellular processes such as endocytosis, cell migration, and the maintenance of cell shape and motility. EPS8-like 2 is particularly crucial in the auditory system, where it is found at the stereocilia tips of cochlear and vestibular hair cells, contributing to hearing function. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the nuclear envelope phosphatase Ctdnep1, underscore its importance in nuclear positioning and actin filament stabilization. Mutations in the EPS8L2 gene have been linked to progressive hearing loss and other clinical conditions, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Dahmani2015EPS8L2; CaleroCuenca2021Ctdnep1).

## Function
EPS8L2 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton remodeling, which is crucial for maintaining cell shape, motility, and signaling. The protein is a member of the EPS8 family, which includes EPS8 and other EPS8-like proteins, and is known for its role in regulating actin dynamics by interacting with other proteins. In healthy cells, EPS8L2 is active in cellular processes such as endocytosis and cell migration, contributing to tissue development and maintenance (Dahmani2015EPS8L2).

In the auditory system, EPS8L2 is detected at the stereocilia tips of cochlear and vestibular hair cells. It plays a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of stereocilia in mature hair cells, which are essential for hearing. Eps8L2 knockout mice exhibit progressive hearing loss due to disorganized hair bundles in inner and outer hair cells, highlighting its importance in auditory function (Dahmani2015EPS8L2).

While EPS8L2 shares functional redundancy with other EPS8 family members in actin remodeling pathways, its specific expression patterns and roles in different tissues suggest distinct functions in cellular processes (Welsch2007Eps8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EPS8L2 gene have been implicated in childhood onset autosomal recessive progressive hearing loss (ARNSHL). A study identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion in exon 12 of the EPS8L2 gene in an Algerian family, leading to a frameshift and premature termination of translation. This mutation was associated with progressive hearing loss in affected siblings, while the parents and an unaffected sibling were heterozygous carriers. The mutation was absent in a control population, supporting its pathogenic role (Dahmani2015EPS8L2).

In Rhodesian Ridgeback dogs, a 12-bp deletion in the EPS8L2 gene is associated with early onset adult deafness (EOAD). This deletion results in the removal of four amino acids from a conserved region of the protein, potentially causing an in-frame shift. The mutation was found in all affected dogs and absent in controls, suggesting a specific association with EOAD (Kawakami2022Early).

Alterations in EPS8L2 expression have also been linked to cancer. In rhabdomyosarcoma, EPS8L2 is identified as a promising urinary biomarker for early disease detection (Xu2023Quantitative). Elevated EPS8L2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Di2019Searching).

## Interactions
EPS8L2 interacts with the nuclear envelope phosphatase Ctdnep1, a relationship crucial for nuclear positioning during cell migration. This interaction is independent of Ctdnep1's phosphatase activity and is essential for the formation of transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines, which are important for nuclear movement. Eps8L2 colocalizes with dorsal actin cables at TAN lines, and its interaction with Ctdnep1 is necessary for the regulation of Eps8L2's actin-bundling activity, which stabilizes actin filaments and organizes LINC complexes into TAN lines (CaleroCuenca2021Ctdnep1).

Eps8L2 is also involved in the regulation of dorsal actin cables, which are crucial for nuclear movement. The interaction between Ctdnep1 and Eps8L2 helps maintain the thickness of these cables, although the exact mechanism of how Ctdnep1 controls Eps8L2 activity remains unclear (CaleroCuenca2021Ctdnep1).

In the context of integrin and EGFR crosstalk, Eps8L2 is identified as part of a two-hop intersect of α5β1 integrin and EGFR interactors, although it shows limited co-localization with talin-positive focal adhesion structures, suggesting a less direct role in adhesion regulation compared to Eps8 (Paul2018Eps8).
