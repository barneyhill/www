# TET3

## Overview
TET3 is a gene that encodes the protein tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3, which is a member of the TET family of dioxygenases. This protein plays a critical role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through its involvement in DNA demethylation processes. As an enzyme, tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, a key step in the active DNA demethylation pathway (Yang2020The; Levy2021Deficiency). The protein is characterized by a catalytic domain that includes a cysteine-rich domain and double-stranded β-helix regions, essential for its enzymatic activity (Zhang2023TET). TET3 is involved in various biological processes, including erythropoiesis and neuronal development, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and cardiac fibrosis (Yan2017Distinct; Rath2024Loss).

## Structure
TET3 is a member of the TET family of proteins, characterized by a catalytic domain at the carboxy-terminal end. This domain includes a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and two double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) regions, which are essential for binding cofactors like α-ketoglutarate and Fe(II) necessary for its catalytic activity (Zhang2023TET). The DSBH domain is connected to the CRD by zinc fingers, forming a compact catalytic core (Zhang2023TET).

TET3 also contains a CXXC domain in the amino-terminal region, which binds to CpG dinucleotides and is crucial for its biological function, particularly in DNA demethylation processes (Zhang2023TET; Jin2016Tet3). The CXXC domain has a crescent-shaped architecture with two C4-type zinc clusters, allowing it to interact with DNA through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions (Xu2012Tet3; Jin2016Tet3).

TET3 exists in multiple isoforms, including Tet3FL, Tet3s, and Tet3o, which differ in their domain composition and tissue-specific expression (Jin2016Tet3). The full-length isoform, Tet3FL, is particularly important in neurons and is involved in maintaining unmethylated CpG islands at transcription start sites (Jin2016Tet3). The CXXC domain's ability to accommodate certain cytosine modifications, such as 5caC, further influences TET3's function (StroynowskaCzerwinska2018Specificity).

## Function
TET3 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 3) is a crucial enzyme involved in the process of DNA demethylation, which is essential for regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular identity. In healthy human cells, TET3 catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a key step in the demethylation pathway that influences gene expression patterns (Yang2020The; Levy2021Deficiency). This enzymatic activity is vital for various biological processes, including erythropoiesis, where TET3 ensures proper terminal differentiation and maturation of erythroid cells (Yan2017Distinct).

TET3 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in epigenetic regulation by maintaining proper DNA methylation patterns. This regulation is crucial for normal development and cellular function, as disruptions in TET3 activity can lead to genome-wide DNA hypermethylation and associated disorders (Levy2021Deficiency). In the context of erythropoiesis, TET3 is particularly important for the final stages of erythroid differentiation, ensuring proper enucleation and preventing multinucleation of erythroblasts (Yan2017Distinct).

Overall, TET3's function in healthy cells is integral to the dynamic regulation of gene expression, contributing to the maintenance of cellular identity and the proper execution of developmental processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the TET3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, high TET3 expression is associated with poor prognosis, shorter overall survival, and progression-free survival. This overexpression is linked to advanced stages and chemotherapy resistance, particularly to carboplatin, suggesting TET3 as a potential oncogene and therapeutic target (Cao2019Increased). In gastric and colorectal cancers, TET3 acts as a tumor suppressor gene, with downregulation and frameshift mutations observed in high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) cases. These mutations lead to reduced TET3 expression, contributing to tumorigenesis (Mo2020Somatic).

In glioblastoma, TET3 is epigenetically downregulated, resulting in decreased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and increased tumorigenic potential. Restoring TET3 expression can reduce tumor growth, indicating its role in glioblastoma progression (Carella2019Epigenetic). TET3 is also involved in cardiac fibrosis, where its loss leads to increased DNA damage and fibroblast proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for cardiac conditions (Rath2024Loss). These findings underscore the clinical significance of TET3 in cancer and other diseases, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
TET3 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in DNA demethylation and gene regulation. One of its key interactions is with PGC7, which suppresses TET3's enzymatic activity, protecting DNA methylation at imprinting loci during early embryogenesis. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal catalytic DSBH domain of TET3 and a specific region of PGC7 (Bian2013PGC7). 

TET3 also interacts with transcription factors such as FOXA2 and HNF4α, which recruit it to specific DNA sites, enhancing target gene transcription (Zhang2023TET). Additionally, TET3 forms complexes with O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), promoting OGT activity and influencing H3K4 methylation through the SET1/COMPASS complex. This interaction is crucial for transcriptional regulation, as TET3 and OGT co-localize on chromatin at active promoters enriched for H3K4me3 (Deplus2013TET2).

TET3 contains a CXXC-type zinc finger domain that specifically recognizes and binds to 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) in DNA, enhancing its genomic specificity and processivity (Pfeifer2020Protein). This domain is involved in preventing aberrant methylation of CpG islands in differentiated cells (Tsagaratou2021Deciphering).
