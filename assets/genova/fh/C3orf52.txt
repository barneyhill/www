# C3orf52

## Overview
C3orf52 is a human gene that encodes the protein chromosome 3 open reading frame 52, which plays a significant role in hair follicle morphogenesis. The protein is primarily expressed in the inner root sheath of hair follicles, where it interacts with lipase H to facilitate the conversion of phosphatidic acid into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a critical component in hair follicle development. This interaction is essential for modulating the TGFα-EGFR signaling pathway, which influences hair growth and maintenance (Malki2020Lossoffunction). Mutations in C3orf52 are linked to localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis, a condition characterized by reduced hair growth, and the gene is also implicated in various cancers, including clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and cervical squamous cell carcinoma, where it may function as a tumor suppressor (Malki2020Lossoffunction; Mlcochova2016Epithelialmesenchymal; Roychowdhury2017Integrative).

## Function
The human gene C3orf52 is involved in hair follicle morphogenesis through its interaction with lipase H, which catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA plays a crucial role in hair follicle development by binding to the LPAR6 receptor and modulating the TGFα-EGFR signaling pathway (Malki2020Lossoffunction). C3orf52 is predominantly expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) of hair follicles, where it is coexpressed with lipase H. This expression pattern suggests a significant role in hair follicle development and maintenance (Malki2020Lossoffunction).

In healthy cells, the wild-type C3orf52 protein is located along the cell membrane, facilitating its interaction with lipase H, which is essential for normal LPA biosynthesis. This interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of lipase H, as mutations in C3orf52 can inhibit LPA production, leading to reduced TGF-α release levels, which are important for hair follicle growth (Malki2020Lossoffunction). The presence of C3orf52 in the IRS is vital for the proper molding, adherence, and keratinization of the growing hair shaft, indicating its role in the structural integrity and function of hair follicles (Malki2020Lossoffunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C3orf52 gene are associated with localized autosomal recessive hypotrichosis (LAH), a condition characterized by reduced hair growth on the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes. The study identified two homozygous nonsense variants, c.492T>A and c.34G>T, which lead to premature termination codons and are predicted to be highly deleterious. These variants result in reduced mRNA levels and mislocalization or absence of the C3orf52 protein, disrupting normal hair follicle function and leading to hypotrichosis (Malki2020Lossoffunction).

C3orf52 is also implicated in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is downregulated in tumor tissues, correlating with the stage and overall survival of patients. Decreased expression of C3orf52 is associated with shorter overall survival and is considered a potential prognostic marker in ccRCC, particularly in relation to metastasis and survival outcomes (Mlcochova2016Epithelialmesenchymal).

In cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), C3orf52 is identified as a novel gene potentially involved in tumor progression. The study highlights its role among differentially expressed genes that may contribute to the development of advanced CSCC (Roychowdhury2017Integrative).

## Interactions
C3ORF52 is known to interact with lipase H, a relationship that is crucial for normal lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) biosynthesis. This interaction is significant for hair follicle morphogenesis, as it modulates the TGFα-EGFR signaling pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated an association between C3ORF52 and lipase H in HeLa cells. However, this interaction is disrupted when a C3ORF52 construct carrying the LAH-causing c.492T>A variant is present, leading to inhibited LPA biosynthesis compared to the wild-type protein (Malki2020Lossoffunction).

The interaction between C3ORF52 and lipase H is supported by data from the BioPlex 2.0 network, which suggests that both proteins are involved in common lipid metabolism-associated pathways. Immunostaining of normal skin biopsies has shown colocalization of C3ORF52 and lipase H to the inner root sheath of hair follicles, further supporting the possibility of their interaction (Malki2020Lossoffunction).

The BioPlex network, a large-scale effort to map the human interactome, includes C3ORF52 among the proteins analyzed, although specific interactions involving C3ORF52 are not detailed in the provided data (Huttlin2015The).
