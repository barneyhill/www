# SLITRK5

## Overview
SLITRK5 is a gene that encodes the SLIT and NTRK-like family member 5 protein, a transmembrane protein characterized by its extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. This protein is primarily involved in synaptogenesis, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of synapses within the nervous system. The LRR domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as TrkB and PTPδ, which are essential for synaptic signaling and neuronal communication (Song2017Rare; Song2015Slitrk5). SLITRK5 is predominantly expressed in striatal neurons, where it influences synaptic balance and neuronal signaling pathways, impacting behaviors related to neuropsychiatric conditions (Schroeder2018Leucinerich; Salesse2020Opposite). Beyond the nervous system, SLITRK5 also acts as a negative regulator of hedgehog signaling in osteoblasts, affecting bone formation and homeostasis (Sun2021SLITRK5). Mutations in the SLITRK5 gene have been linked to disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Song2017Rare; Salesse2020Opposite).

## Structure
SLITRK5 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains and an intracellular carboxyl terminus. The protein contains two LRR domains, which are crucial for its role in synaptogenesis and protein-protein interactions (Sun2021SLITRK5; Song2015Slitrk5). These LRR domains facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as TrkB and PTPδ, which are important for synapse formation and signaling (Song2017Rare; Song2015Slitrk5).

SLITRK5's structure includes a single transmembrane domain, followed by an intracellular domain that interacts with other molecules to mediate biological functions like synapse formation and neuronal survival (Won2019Synaptic). The protein's extracellular domain is involved in binding to hedgehog ligands and interacting with PTCH1, indicating its role in hedgehog signaling regulation (Sun2021SLITRK5).

SLITRK5 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may affect its function and interactions. The protein may also have multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Song2015Slitrk5).

## Function
The SLITRK5 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in synaptogenesis, particularly in the formation and maintenance of synapses in the nervous system. SLITRK5 is involved in trans-synaptic interactions, notably with presynaptic protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPδ), which is crucial for synapse formation and function (Song2017Rare). In healthy human cells, SLITRK5 facilitates synapse formation through its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which enable interactions with other proteins essential for neuronal communication (Song2017Rare).

SLITRK5 is primarily expressed in striatal neurons, where it regulates the expression of glutamate receptors, influencing synaptic protein composition and neuronal signaling pathways (Schroeder2018Leucinerich). It is also involved in the regulation of synaptic balance, promoting inhibitory synapse formation and affecting dendritic complexity in midbrain dopaminergic neurons (Salesse2020Opposite). This regulation is crucial for maintaining the excitatory/inhibitory balance in neurons, impacting motor activity and potentially influencing behaviors related to neuropsychiatric conditions (Salesse2020Opposite).

SLITRK5's role extends beyond the nervous system, as it acts as a negative regulator of hedgehog signaling in osteoblasts, affecting bone formation and homeostasis (Sun2021SLITRK5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLITRK5 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. SLITRK5 is associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as rare mutations in this gene can impair synaptogenesis, particularly in the striatum, a brain region involved in OCD. Knockout mice lacking SLITRK5 exhibit OCD-like behaviors, such as excessive grooming, which can be alleviated by serotonin reuptake inhibitors, a common treatment for OCD (Song2017Rare). Functional assays have shown that OCD-associated SLITRK5 mutations impair synapse formation, suggesting a role in the disorder's pathophysiology (Song2017Rare).

SLITRK5 is also linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Alterations in its expression can affect motor behavior, with studies indicating that SLITRK5 modulates inhibitory synapse formation in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, impacting hyperactivity behavior (Salesse2020Opposite). Additionally, SLITRK5 expression is upregulated in tumors marked by active Hedgehog signaling, such as Hedgehog-dependent medulloblastoma, suggesting a potential role in oncogenesis (Sun2021SLITRK5).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLITRK5 in various conditions, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric disorders and bone repair (Sun2021SLITRK5).

## Interactions
SLITRK5 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in synaptic regulation and signaling pathways. It physically interacts with the TrkB receptor, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, through its extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains. This interaction is specific to SLITRK5 and TrkB, as it does not occur with other SLITRK family members or the TrkC receptor. The interaction is modulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which enhances the SLITRK5-TrkB interaction and is crucial for the recycling and resensitization of TrkB receptors in neurons (Song2015Slitrk5).

SLITRK5 also interacts with the presynaptic adhesion molecule PTPδ under basal conditions. This interaction shifts from a trans to a cis configuration with TrkB in the presence of BDNF, indicating a competitive binding scenario between PTPδ and TrkB for SLITRK5 (Song2015Slitrk5). Additionally, SLITRK5 binds to Rab11-FIP3, facilitating the recruitment of TrkB receptors into Rab11-positive endosomes, which is essential for their recycling (Song2015Slitrk5).

In osteoblasts, SLITRK5 acts as a negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling by interacting with Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Patched1 (PTCH1), modulating osteoblast differentiation (Sun2021SLITRK5).
