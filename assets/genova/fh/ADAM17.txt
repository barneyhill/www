# ADAM17

## Overview
ADAM17, also known as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 17, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in the proteolytic cleavage of various cell surface proteins. The protein, often referred to as TACE (tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme), is a member of the ADAM family of proteins, which are characterized by their metalloproteinase and disintegrin domains. ADAM17 plays a pivotal role in numerous physiological processes, including inflammation, immune response, and cell signaling, by mediating the shedding of cytokines, growth factors, and receptors from the cell surface (Zunke2017The; Saftig2011The). Its activity is tightly regulated through post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, which influence its localization and function. Dysregulation of ADAM17 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, such as inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer, making it a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Imoto2021Functionally; Wang2022Immunomodulatory).

## Structure
ADAM17, also known as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17, is a type I transmembrane protein with a complex multi-domain structure. The protein includes an N-terminal signal peptide, a prodomain, a metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin-like domain, a membrane-proximal domain (MPD), a stalk region containing the conserved CANDIS motif, a transmembrane helix, and a cytosolic tail (Zunke2017The; Düsterhöft2019Status). The metalloproteinase domain features a zinc-binding motif characterized by the HExGHxxGxxHD sequence, which coordinates a Zn2+ ion, essential for its catalytic activity (Düsterhöft2019Status).

The prodomain acts as a chaperone, inhibiting the enzyme's catalytic activity until cleaved by furin-like proprotein convertases in the Golgi (Zunke2017The). The disintegrin-like domain interacts with integrins, such as α5β1-integrin, which can inhibit protease activity through steric hindrance (Düsterhöft2019Status). The MPD is targeted by extracellular protein disulphide isomerases, which can alter its conformation and inactivate ADAM17 (Düsterhöft2019Status).

ADAM17 is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by kinases such as ERK and p38 MAPK, which influence its activity (Düsterhöft2019Status). The protein is involved in the shedding of various substrates, including TNFα and IL6R, playing significant roles in inflammation and cell signaling (Düsterhöft2019Status). The structural differences between ADAM17 and other ADAMs suggest it should be considered a separate subgroup within the family (Düsterhöft2019Status).

## Function
ADAM17, also known as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17, is a crucial enzyme involved in the proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane proteins, which is essential for their systemic activity. It is responsible for the shedding of various cell surface proteins, including cytokines, growth factors, and receptors, thereby regulating numerous physiological processes in healthy human cells (Zunke2017The; Saftig2011The). 

ADAM17 plays a significant role in the immune system by converting membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) into its soluble form, which is vital for cytokine production and inflammatory responses (Saftig2011The; Blaydon2011Inflammatory). It also processes ligands for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), such as transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), which are crucial for cell signaling and development (Zunke2017The; Saftig2011The).

In the central nervous system, ADAM17 is involved in neuronal development and homeostasis by cleaving substrates like L1 and NCAM, and it acts as an α-secretase, producing neuroprotective soluble fragments from the amyloid precursor protein (Zunke2017The). The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated, primarily through its cellular localization and activation of its shedding process (Lorenzen2016Control).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADAM17 gene are linked to various diseases and conditions. Loss-of-function mutations in ADAM17 are associated with neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease 1 (NISBD1), characterized by symptoms such as erythroderma, recurrent skin infections, sepsis, and prolonged diarrhea. These mutations lead to a loss of ectodomain shedding activity, crucial for normal inflammatory responses (Imoto2021Functionally).

In cardiovascular diseases, ADAM17 plays a complex role. Its increased activity is linked to coronary microvascular dysfunction and adverse cardiac events, particularly in aged or obese patients. Inhibition of ADAM17 can prevent cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by angiotensin II, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kawai2021Contribution).

ADAM17 is also implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD), where its upregulation is associated with kidney fibrosis and inflammation. It is considered a risk factor for CKD progression and cardiovascular events, with its inhibition showing protective effects against kidney fibrosis (Palau2019Role; Maas2023ADAM10).

In cancer, ADAM17 is highly expressed in various types, including cervical, liver, and colorectal cancers. It influences tumor growth and progression through pathways like EGFR/PI3K/Akt and is involved in the regulation of tumor-associated macrophages, contributing to a tumor-supportive environment (Wang2022Immunomodulatory).

## Interactions
ADAM17, also known as TACE, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that regulate its activity and function. It interacts with SAP97, a protein containing PDZ domains, through its cytoplasmic tail. This interaction is mediated by the PDZ3 domain of SAP97 and is crucial for the binding, as mutations in the C-terminal sequence of ADAM17 affect this interaction (Peiretti2003Identification).

ADAM17 also interacts with the Four and Half LIM domain 2 protein (FHL2), which connects it to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction involves the amino acid sequence from position 721 to 739 of ADAM17 and is important for its localization and activity regulation (Canault2006FHL2).

The tetraspanin CD9 is another binding partner of ADAM17, influencing its sheddase activity. This interaction occurs in multiprotein complexes on the cell surface and is mediated by the large extracellular loop domain of CD9 (GutiérrezLópez2011The).

ADAM17 also interacts with integrin α5β1, promoting cell adhesion and spreading. This interaction is mediated by the disintegrin domain of ADAM17 and is RGD-dependent, highlighting its role in cell adhesion processes (Bax2004Integrin).
