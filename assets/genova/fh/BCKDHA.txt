# BCKDHA

## Overview
The BCKDHA gene encodes the E1 alpha subunit of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), a mitochondrial multienzyme complex essential for the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The protein product of BCKDHA, the branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase E1 subunit alpha, functions as a component of the BCKDC, which is involved in the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain alpha-keto acids (BCKAs). This process is crucial for energy production and metabolic regulation, as it leads to the formation of succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, intermediates that enter the Krebs cycle or contribute to lipogenesis (Chuang1993Characterization; Chuang2006Lessons). The E1 alpha subunit operates in a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent manner and is regulated by phosphorylation, ensuring proper metabolic function and energy homeostasis (Chuang2006Lessons). Mutations in the BCKDHA gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2019An).

## Structure


## Function
The BCKDHA gene encodes the E1 alpha subunit of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), a crucial mitochondrial multienzyme complex involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine (Chuang1993Characterization; Chuang2006Lessons). This complex facilitates the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain alpha-keto acids (BCKAs), which are derived from the transamination of BCAAs, leading to the production of succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. These products can enter the Krebs cycle or serve as precursors for lipogenesis, thus playing a vital role in energy production and metabolic regulation (Chuang2006Lessons).

The E1 component of BCKDC, which includes the BCKDHA gene product, catalyzes the initial decarboxylation step in a thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent manner (Chuang2006Lessons). The activity of this enzyme complex is regulated by a specific kinase and phosphatase through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycles, ensuring proper metabolic function and energy homeostasis in cells (Chuang1993Characterization). Proper function of the BCKDHA gene is essential for maintaining amino acid balance and preventing the toxic accumulation of BCAAs and their byproducts, which can lead to metabolic disorders such as maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) (Zhang2019An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BCKDHA gene are associated with Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. MSUD is characterized by the accumulation of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their corresponding α-keto acids in the body, leading to severe neurological damage and other health issues if untreated (Ma2021Identification; FernándezLainez2018In). The BCKDHA gene encodes the E1α subunit of the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex, which is crucial for the catabolism of BCAAs such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine (Ævarsson2000Crystal).

Clinical manifestations of MSUD include poor feeding, developmental delay, seizures, and potentially coma or death, with symptoms typically appearing shortly after birth (Zeynalzadeh2018Four; Ma2021Identification). Various mutations in the BCKDHA gene, such as missense mutations, frameshift mutations, and deletions, have been identified in patients with MSUD. These mutations can disrupt the structural integrity and function of the BCKD complex, leading to reduced enzyme activity and the classic MSUD phenotype (Ævarsson2000Crystal; RodríguezPombo2006Mutational). The Y393N-α mutation, known as the 'Mennonite' mutation, is particularly notable for its prevalence and impact on enzyme assembly (Ævarsson2000Crystal).

## Interactions
The BCKDHA protein is a subunit of the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids. BCKDHA interacts with other subunits within the BCKD complex, including BCKDHB (E1 subunit beta), DBT (E2 subunit), and DLD (E3 subunit), forming a multienzyme complex essential for the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain keto acids (Du2022The; FernándezLainez2018In).

BCKDHA has been shown to interact with apolipoprotein E (APOE) in the context of the mitochondrial BCKD complex. This interaction was identified through co-immunoprecipitation experiments and confirmed by proximity ligation assays in cultured cells. The interaction is modulated by dietary conditions, being stronger under dietary restriction in APOE transgenic mice (Rueter2023The).

BCKDHA is also regulated by phosphorylation through the action of BCKDK, a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the BCKD complex. This phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism for BCKD activity, influencing metabolic pathways (Du2022The; Cheon2019The). The interaction of BCKDHA with BCKDK is crucial for maintaining the balance of branched-chain amino acid metabolism.
