# PPP2R5B

## Overview
The PPP2R5B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B'beta, a crucial component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzyme. PP2A is a major serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell growth, division, and apoptosis. The B56β subunit, encoded by PPP2R5B, is a regulatory subunit that modulates the substrate specificity and activity of PP2A, thereby influencing key signaling pathways such as the PI3K/AKT cascade. This subunit is particularly significant in neurodevelopment, with high expression levels in the brain and a role in neuronal differentiation. Mutations in PPP2R5B have been linked to overgrowth syndromes and other disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions (Verbinnen2021Protein; Loveday2019Corrigendum:).

## Structure
The PPP2R5B gene encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), specifically the B56β subunit. This protein is part of the PP2A holoenzyme, which is a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic 'C' subunit, a structural 'A' subunit, and a regulatory 'B' subunit. The B56β subunit, encoded by PPP2R5B, plays a crucial role in determining the substrate specificity of the PP2A enzyme (Loveday2019Corrigendum:).

The structure of the B56β subunit includes a core domain with 18 alpha helices organized into HEAT-like repeats. These repeats form a concave surface adjacent to the catalytic site, enriched with negatively charged amino acids, which creates a cleft for substrate binding. This structural arrangement is essential for substrate recognition and orientation, impacting the phosphatase activity of PP2A (Loveday2019Corrigendum:).

Mutations in PPP2R5B have been identified in a highly conserved region within the substrate specificity loop of the B56 subunit. These mutations may impair substrate-specific phosphatase activity by affecting substrate recognition and positioning, which is critical for the protein's function in various cellular pathways, including the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade (Loveday2019Corrigendum:).

## Function
PPP2R5B encodes a regulatory B subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), specifically the B56β subunit, which plays a crucial role in modulating the enzyme's substrate specificity and activity. PP2A is a major serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular signaling pathways, impacting processes such as cell growth, division, and apoptosis. The B56β subunit is highly expressed in the brain and is particularly important during embryonic brain development. Its expression is upregulated at the protein level upon neuronal growth factor-induced differentiation, indicating its role in neurodevelopment (Verbinnen2021Protein).

PPP2R5B is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell cycle regulation and signal transduction pathways. The subunit's involvement in substrate recognition is critical, as it affects the binding of specific proteins, such as tyrosine hydroxylase, to the PP2A complex. This interaction is facilitated by a conserved acidic loop within the B56β subunit, which is essential for its function in healthy cells (Verbinnen2021Protein). The precise role of PPP2R5B in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but its regulatory functions in PP2A activity suggest significant implications for cellular homeostasis and neurobiological processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPP2R5B gene, which encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), have been implicated in human overgrowth syndromes. These conditions are characterized by excessive growth parameters and often include intellectual disability. The mutations are typically de novo and have been identified in a specific region of the protein sequence, suggesting they may affect substrate binding and the ability of PP2A to dephosphorylate protein substrates, thereby impacting the PI3K/AKT growth regulatory cascade (Loveday2019Corrigendum:).

The B56 family of PP2A isoforms, including PPP2R5B, is involved in various cellular processes such as apoptotic control, cell cycle progression, and mitotic regulation. Alterations in PPP2R5B can affect AKT signaling, potentially influencing conditions like overgrowth syndromes (Ruvolo2016The). Although the specific diseases associated with PPP2R5B mutations are not extensively detailed, the gene's role in critical signaling pathways suggests its involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders and possibly cancer (Ruvolo2016The; Verbinnen2021Protein). The absence of distinctive clinical features in some cases highlights the genetic heterogeneity of conditions associated with PPP2R5B mutations (Loveday2019Corrigendum:).

## Interactions
PPP2R5B, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It forms a complex with the catalytic and scaffolding subunits of PP2A, contributing to the holoenzyme's substrate specificity and cellular localization (Ruvolo2016The). PPP2R5B interacts with AKT, a key player in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and is involved in the dephosphorylation of AKT, which affects its activity (Papke2021A). This interaction is crucial for regulating cell growth and survival signals.

PPP2R5B also participates in the regulation of protein stability through interactions with GSK3, where it is involved in a phosphorylation cascade that primes proteins for degradation (Ruvolo2016The). Additionally, PPP2R5B has been shown to associate with microtubule crosslinking factor 1 (MTCL1), although this interaction is weaker compared to other PP2A subunits like PPP2R5E (Hyodo2016A).

Mutations in PPP2R5B, particularly in a conserved acidic loop, can affect its ability to bind substrates, such as tyrosine hydroxylase, which is important for its regulatory functions (Verbinnen2021Protein). These interactions highlight the role of PPP2R5B in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes.
