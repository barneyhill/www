# ZBTB48

## Overview
ZBTB48 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 48, also known as TZAP or HKR3. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA and RNA binding, and a BTB domain that mediates protein-protein interactions. ZBTB48 plays a crucial role in telomere biology by binding to telomeric DNA sequences and regulating telomere length, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Jahn2017ZBTB48). Additionally, it functions as a transcriptional activator and is involved in RNA metabolism, influencing m6A/m6Am RNA methylation through its interaction with the demethylase FTO (NabeelShah2024Recruitment). The protein's involvement in telomere maintenance and gene expression regulation underscores its significance in cellular processes, including aging and cancer development (Jahn2017ZBTB48).

## Structure
The ZBTB48 protein, also known as HKR3 or TZAP, is characterized by its zinc finger and BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domains. It contains 11 C2H2-type zinc finger domains located towards its C-terminus, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capabilities, particularly to telomeric and subtelomeric repeat sequences (NabeelShah2024Recruitment; Jahn2017ZBTB48). Among these, the zinc finger 11 (ZnF11) is essential for binding to telomeric DNA, as mutations in this region result in a complete loss of telomere-binding ability (Jahn2017ZBTB48). The protein also contains a BTB domain at its N-terminus, which is involved in protein-protein interactions, such as its interaction with the m6A/m6Am demethylase FTO (NabeelShah2024Recruitment).

ZBTB48 is involved in telomere length regulation and acts as a transcriptional activator for certain genes, including those related to mitochondrial function (Jahn2017ZBTB48). The protein's structure allows it to bind both DNA and RNA, with its zinc fingers facilitating RNA binding, particularly to U-rich sequences (NabeelShah2024Recruitment). The presence of splice variant isoforms may contribute to structural diversity, affecting its function and interactions. However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ZBTB48 gene encodes a protein that functions as both a telomere-binding protein and a transcriptional activator in vertebrates. It specifically binds to telomeric DNA sequences, particularly the TTAGGG repeats, through its zinc finger 11 (ZnF11) domain, which is crucial for its association with telomeres (Jahn2017ZBTB48). ZBTB48 acts as a negative regulator of telomere length, preventing excessive elongation and maintaining genome stability (Jahn2017ZBTB48). It is active in the nucleus, where it co-localizes with telomeric markers such as TRF2, and is involved in telomere maintenance (Jahn2017ZBTB48).

In addition to its role in telomere biology, ZBTB48 influences RNA metabolism by modulating m6A/m6Am RNA methylation. It recruits the demethylase FTO to target RNAs, affecting the stability and expression of m6A-modified transcripts (NabeelShah2024Recruitment). This interaction is important for regulating gene expression and cellular processes, as ZBTB48's depletion leads to altered expression levels of m6A-containing transcripts (NabeelShah2024Recruitment). ZBTB48 also functions as a transcriptional activator, regulating the expression of specific genes, including those involved in mitochondrial function (Jahn2017ZBTB48).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the ZBTB48 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In glioma, ZBTB48 is upregulated and contributes to ferroptosis resistance, correlating with poorer patient prognosis and shorter survival times. High ZBTB48 expression is associated with more aggressive glioma types, and its overexpression can restore cell viability and proliferation in glioma stem cells affected by circRNF10 silencing (Wang2023CircRNF10). In colorectal cancer, ZBTB48 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its depletion leads to increased proliferation of colorectal cancer cells, suggesting its role in inhibiting cellular proliferation. ZBTB48 modulates m6A levels in MTA1 mRNA, affecting mRNA stability and cell proliferation (NabeelShah2024Recruitment).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZBTB48 expression is linked to poorer survival outcomes. Although its expression levels are similar in HCC and non-tumorous tissues, higher ZBTB48 expression is associated with shorter overall and disease-free survival (Jung2022Clinical). ZBTB48's role in telomere maintenance and transcriptional regulation suggests it may influence cancer development and aging, potentially acting as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts (Jahn2017ZBTB48).

## Interactions
ZBTB48, also known as TZAP, is a zinc finger protein that interacts with both proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in telomere maintenance and RNA metabolism. It binds to telomeric DNA through its zinc finger 11 (ZnF11), which is crucial for its interaction with telomeric regions. This binding is specific, as mutations in ZnF11 result in a complete loss of telomeric DNA binding (Jahn2017ZBTB48). ZBTB48 also competes with TRF2 for binding sites on telomeres, indicating its role in telomere length regulation (Jahn2017ZBTB48).

In addition to its DNA-binding capabilities, ZBTB48 interacts with RNA, particularly mRNAs, through its zinc fingers. It has a distinct RNA-binding profile, with a preference for untranslated regions and a U-rich consensus sequence (NabeelShah2024Recruitment). ZBTB48 is involved in the recruitment of the m6A/m6Am demethylase FTO to target RNAs, influencing mRNA metabolism and stability. This interaction is specific, as FTO does not co-purify with other C2H2 zinc finger proteins (NabeelShah2024Recruitment). ZBTB48's interaction with FTO is crucial for modulating m6A/m6Am levels on mRNAs, impacting gene expression and cell proliferation (NabeelShah2024Recruitment).
