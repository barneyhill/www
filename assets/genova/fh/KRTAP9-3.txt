# KRTAP9-3

## Overview
KRTAP9-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 9-3, a member of the ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family. These proteins are integral to the structural composition of hair, contributing to its mechanical strength and resilience through the formation of disulfide bonds facilitated by their high cysteine content. The KRTAP9-3 gene is located on chromosome 17q21.2 and is predominantly expressed in the differentiated portion of the hair cortex, where it plays a significant role in the keratinization process. The protein encoded by KRTAP9-3 interacts with keratin intermediate filaments, thereby influencing the structural integrity and texture of hair (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
KRTAP9-3 is part of the ultrahigh sulfur keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family, which plays a crucial role in the structure and function of hair. These proteins are characterized by their high sulfur content, primarily due to cysteine residues, which facilitate the formation of disulfide bonds. These bonds are essential for the mechanical strength and resilience of the hair shaft (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP9-3, along with other KAP9 family members, is involved in the formation of the hair shaft by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments. This interaction contributes to the structural integrity and texture of hair. The KAP9 proteins are noted for their heterogeneous size and the presence of repeat structures containing cysteine, proline, serine, and glycine, with serine being particularly abundant (Rogers2006Human).

The gene is located on chromosome 17q21.2, and its expression is primarily observed in the differentiated portion of the hair cortex, where it likely plays a role in the keratinization process. This localization suggests that KRTAP9-3 is active in the hair follicle, influencing hair texture and quality (Rogers2006Human). The specific function of KRTAP9-3 in healthy human cells, beyond its structural role in hair, is not detailed in the available literature.
