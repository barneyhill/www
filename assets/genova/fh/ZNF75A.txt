# ZNF75A

## Overview
ZNF75A is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 75A, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains that enable it to bind DNA and regulate the expression of various genes. Zinc finger protein 75A plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as nucleic-acid metabolism and gene expression, and it is subject to regulation through post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by the MAPK signaling pathway. The gene's expression and methylation status have been implicated in certain diseases, such as gastric marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type, highlighting its potential significance in disease pathogenesis (dugge2021tumor; Su2015Special).

## Function
ZNF75A, a zinc finger protein, functions primarily as a transcriptional regulator in healthy human cells. It is characterized by the presence of a C2H2-zinc finger domain, which facilitates its binding to DNA, allowing it to modulate the transcription of target genes. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including nucleic-acid metabolism, gene expression, and transcriptional regulation, often being low in abundance and subject to various post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Su2015Special).

ZNF75A is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell. It is predicted to be phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling network, specifically by p38 MAPK on certain sites. This phosphorylation suggests a potential role in MAPK signaling pathways, which are crucial for regulating cellular activities such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Su2015Special).

In the context of disease, ZNF75A has been observed to have decreased expression and increased methylation in long-course gastric marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type (MZBL), indicating that DNA methylation may influence its gene expression regulation (dugge2021tumor).
