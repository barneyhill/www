# KIAA1549

## Overview
KIAA1549 is a gene that encodes a ciliary protein involved in the function and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This protein is particularly significant in the connecting cilium of these cells, playing a crucial role in retinal health and function. KIAA1549 is expressed in various tissues, with a notable abundance in the retina, suggesting a specialized role in this tissue. The protein's localization to the connecting cilium and outer plexiform layer indicates its involvement in synaptic vesicle trafficking and retinal structure. Additionally, KIAA1549 is implicated in oncogenic processes through the formation of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein, a recurrent driver in certain cancers such as pilocytic astrocytoma. This fusion results from a tandem duplication event and is associated with dysregulated kinase activity, highlighting the gene's dual significance in both retinal diseases and cancer (Subbiah2014Targeted; de2018Homozygous).

## Function
The KIAA1549 gene encodes a ciliary protein that plays a significant role in the function of photoreceptor cells in the retina. This protein is involved in ciliary processes, particularly in the connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells, which is crucial for maintaining retinal health and function (de2018Homozygous). KIAA1549 has two major isoforms: a long isoform, which is expressed at low to moderate levels in various tissues, and a short isoform, which is abundantly expressed in the retina, indicating a retina-specific function (de2018Homozygous).

The protein localizes to the connecting cilium and the outer plexiform layer of photoreceptor cells, suggesting its involvement in synaptic vesicle trafficking and retinal structure (de2018Homozygous). Although KIAA1549 does not directly affect cilium formation, as shown by knockdown experiments in hTERT-RPE1 cells, it may be involved in other ciliary processes essential for photoreceptor function (de2018Homozygous). The gene's expression and localization patterns imply a potential role in maintaining normal retinal function, with disruptions potentially leading to retinal degeneration (de2018Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KIAA1549 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. One of the most notable is its involvement in pediatric low-grade gliomas, particularly pilocytic astrocytomas. These tumors often feature a fusion between KIAA1549 and the BRAF gene, resulting from a tandem duplication on chromosome 7q34. This fusion leads to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, promoting tumorigenesis and serving as a diagnostic marker and potential therapeutic target (Roth2014Chromosome; Appay2018Duplications; Jones2008Tandem).

In addition to its role in gliomas, KIAA1549 is implicated in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP), a degenerative retinal disease. Homozygous variants in KIAA1549, such as frameshift and missense mutations, have been identified in patients with arRP, leading to symptoms like night blindness and progressive vision loss. These mutations are thought to affect the gene's function in retinal cells, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (de2018Homozygous). The gene's expression in the retina and its involvement in ciliary processes underscore its significance in maintaining retinal health (de2018Homozygous).

## Interactions
KIAA1549 is known to interact with TMEM17, a component of the Meckel syndrome protein complex located in the ciliary transition zone. This interaction is thought to facilitate cilium formation, although knocking down KIAA1549 in hTERT-RPE1 cells did not affect cilium formation, suggesting it may not have a direct role in this process (de2018Homozygous). KIAA1549 is also involved in the formation of the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein, which is a recurrent oncogenic driver in certain cancers, such as pilocytic astrocytoma and malignant spindle cell neoplasms. This fusion protein retains the kinase domain and ATP binding pocket of BRAF, while losing the N-terminal conserved regions CR1 and CR2, leading to dysregulated kinase activity (Subbiah2014Targeted). The KIAA1549-BRAF fusion is a result of a tandem duplication event, and its presence has been associated with a response to targeted therapies, including sorafenib, which inhibits the BRAF kinase domain conserved in the fusion protein (Subbiah2014Targeted). These interactions highlight KIAA1549's involvement in both retinal diseases and oncogenic processes.
