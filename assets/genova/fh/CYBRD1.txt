# CYBRD1

## Overview
The CYBRD1 gene encodes the protein duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb), a transmembrane hemoprotein that plays a pivotal role in iron metabolism. Dcytb is a member of the cytochrome b 561 family and is primarily involved in the reduction of dietary ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+), facilitating its absorption in the duodenum. The protein is characterized by its di-heme b-containing structure, which enables electron transport, and is expressed predominantly at the brush border membrane of duodenal enterocytes. In addition to its role in iron metabolism, Dcytb also functions as a cupric reductase, contributing to copper uptake. The activity of Dcytb is regulated by iron levels and is upregulated under conditions such as iron deficiency and hypoxia. Despite its significant role, studies suggest that Dcytb is not essential for dietary iron absorption, indicating the presence of compensatory mechanisms (Oakhill2008Functional; Liu2011Highyield; Gunshin2005Cybrd1).

## Structure
The CYBRD1 gene encodes the protein duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb), which is a transmembrane hemoprotein involved in iron metabolism. Dcytb is a member of the cytochrome b 561 family and is characterized by its di-heme b-containing structure, which facilitates electron transport (Liu2011Highyield). The protein is a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of six transmembrane α-helices. The N- and C-termini are located on the cytoplasmic side (Ganasen2018Structural). Each monomer contains two heme b molecules, coordinated by four conserved histidine residues, which are crucial for its function as an oxidoreductase (Ganasen2018Structural; Ludwiczek2007Recombinant).

The tertiary structure of Dcytb reveals that the heme groups are sandwiched between transmembrane helices and are hexacoordinate, with bis-histidyl coordination (Ganasen2018Structural; Ludwiczek2007Recombinant). The protein's quaternary structure is a homodimer, exhibiting crystallographic twofold symmetry, with monomers interacting through hydrophobic contacts (Ganasen2018Structural). Dcytb also features ascorbate-binding sites, which are important for electron transfer from ascorbate to the heme group, facilitating the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ (Ganasen2018Structural). The protein's structure is integral to its role in promoting dietary iron absorption.

## Function
The CYBRD1 gene encodes the duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb) protein, which functions primarily as a ferric reductase in the duodenum. This protein is crucial for the reduction of dietary ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+), a necessary step for iron absorption in the gut. Dcytb is highly expressed at the brush border membrane of duodenal enterocytes, where it facilitates iron uptake by the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) (Oakhill2008Functional; Choi2012Duodenal).

Dcytb is part of the cytochrome b 561 family and is characterized by its ability to transfer electrons from ascorbate across membranes. It contains six alpha-helical transmembrane domains and conserved histidine residues that act as heme ligands, essential for its electron transfer and iron reduction functions (Oakhill2008Functional). The protein's activity is regulated by iron levels and is upregulated in conditions such as iron deficiency, hypoxia, and anemia (Oakhill2008Functional).

In addition to its role in iron metabolism, Dcytb also functions as a cupric reductase, facilitating the reduction of copper for uptake by copper transporter 1 (Ctr1) (Wyman2008Dcytb). Despite its significant role in iron and copper reduction, studies in knockout mice suggest that Dcytb is not essential for dietary iron absorption, indicating potential compensatory mechanisms (Gunshin2005Cybrd1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CYBRD1 gene, also known as cytochrome b reductase 1, have been associated with several clinical conditions, particularly those related to iron metabolism. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CYBRD1 gene, rs884409, has been identified as a genetic modifier in hereditary hemochromatosis, a disorder characterized by excessive iron accumulation. This SNP is associated with a 30% decrease in promoter activity, potentially reducing iron absorption and protecting against iron overload in individuals with the HFE C282Y mutation (constantine2009novel; Lane2015Duodenal).

In chronic hepatitis C patients, the rs884409 polymorphism in CYBRD1 is linked to variations in serum transferrin saturation and ferritin concentration, as well as liver inflammation and steatosis. The major allele of this SNP is associated with a lower frequency of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence, suggesting a protective role against cancer development (Wróblewska2023Polymorphisms).

In colorectal cancer, CYBRD1 expression is regulated by the DDX17/miR-149-3p pathway, influencing metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Altered CYBRD1 expression correlates with increased intracellular iron levels, promoting cancer cell proliferation and inhibiting adhesion, which may contribute to cancer progression (Zhao2022DDX17).
