# POTEJ

## Overview
POTEJ is a gene that encodes the protein POTE ankyrin domain family member J, which is part of the POTE gene family known for its ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains. The POTEJ protein is characterized by its structural features, including an actin module resulting from an in-frame β-actin retrogene insertion, which suggests its involvement in protein-protein interactions and association with cell membranes (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary; Barger2018Expression). As a member of the ankyrin repeat protein family, POTEJ is implicated in cellular signaling pathways and cytoskeletal regulation, particularly in cancer cell proliferation and motility (Ramdas2019Tocotrienols). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as S-nitrosylation and S-sulfenylation, which may influence its function and interactions (Wojdyla2016Acetaminopheninduced). POTEJ's involvement in various cellular processes and its potential role in disease contexts, including its up-regulation in activated hepatic stellate cells and interactions in the SARS-CoV-2 protein network, underscore its clinical significance (Guo2021Integrative; Qin2012Alteration).

## Structure
The POTEJ protein is a member of the POTE gene family, characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats and coiled-coil domains. It contains 15 exons, including a full-length LIR sequence and an in-frame β-actin retrogene insertion, which results in an actin module within the protein (Maggiolini2020Evolutionary). The ankyrin repeat domain of POTEJ interacts with other domains through its convex surface residues, contributing to its structural differences compared to other ankyrin repeat proteins (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

The POTEJ protein is susceptible to post-translational modifications, such as S-nitrosylation and S-sulfenylation, particularly at the cysteine site C880, which shows high oxidation occupancy upon acetaminophen treatment (Wojdyla2016Acetaminopheninduced). These modifications can impact the protein's function, potentially affecting metal binding and disulfide bond formation.

The POTEJ protein shares structural similarities with ACTB, which can lead to misidentification in certain assays due to the presence of highly similar regions (Zhang2021ACTB). The presence of ankyrin repeats and the actin module suggests a role in protein-protein interactions and association with cell membranes (Barger2018Expression).

## Interactions
POTEJ, a member of the POTE gene family, is involved in various protein interactions primarily through its ankyrin repeat domains. These domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting POTEJ's role in cellular signaling pathways. In human plasma, POTEJ is part of significant protein-interaction networks and may be released as part of protein complexes susceptible to degradation by endogenous tryptic peptide activities (Dufresne2017The). 

In breast cancer cells, POTEJ is involved in the cytoskeletal regulation via the RHO GTPase signaling pathway, interacting with proteins such as PFN1, ACTA1, ACTA2, and ACTB. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer cell proliferation and motility (Ramdas2019Tocotrienols). 

POTEJ is also up-regulated in activated hepatic stellate cells, indicating its involvement in cellular processes related to actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion (Qin2012Alteration). 

In the context of SARS-CoV-2, POTEJ has been identified as a potentially relevant protein due to its interactions with other proteins in the virus's network, although specific interaction partners are not detailed (Guo2021Integrative). 

These interactions highlight POTEJ's potential role in various cellular processes and disease contexts.
