# REG3G

## Overview
REG3G, or regenerating islet-derived protein 3-gamma, is a gene that encodes a C-type lectin protein involved in the innate immune response, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract. The protein, also referred to as REG3G, is primarily expressed in the pancreas and small intestine, where it plays a critical role in maintaining gut homeostasis by exerting antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria. It achieves this by binding to bacterial peptidoglycans, thereby protecting the intestinal epithelium and supporting the integrity of the gut barrier (Vaishnava2011The; Shin2023Reg3γ:). Beyond its antimicrobial functions, REG3G is implicated in inflammatory responses, wound healing, and metabolic processes, including glucose homeostasis and β-cell regeneration (Shin2023Reg3γ:). The protein's expression is modulated by cytokines and gut microbiota, highlighting its role in mediating host-microbe interactions and its potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases, including gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, and metabolic diseases (Zhao2018Survival; Shin2023Reg3γ:).

## Structure
REG3G, also known as regenerating islet-derived protein 3-gamma, is a C-type lectin protein involved in antimicrobial activity. The primary structure of REG3G consists of a specific amino acid sequence that forms the basis for its functional properties. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of REG3G results in a stable, globular shape, which is crucial for its interaction with bacterial cell walls. The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which may enhance its binding capabilities and functional efficacy.

REG3G contains a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which is essential for its ability to bind to bacterial cell walls. This domain is a characteristic feature of C-type lectins and plays a significant role in the protein's antimicrobial function. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in REG3G and can affect its stability and function, potentially influencing its role in gut immunity. The protein is primarily expressed in the pancreas and small intestine, where it contributes to the host's immune defense by maintaining spatial segregation between gut bacteria and the host (Shin2023Reg3γ:).

## Function
REG3G, also known as regenerating islet-derived protein 3-gamma, is a C-type lectin involved in the innate immune response, primarily in the intestine. It is secreted by Paneth cells and enterocytes in the small intestine, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining gut homeostasis by binding to bacterial peptidoglycans, thereby exerting antimicrobial activity (Vaishnava2011The; Shin2023Reg3γ:). This protein helps protect the intestinal epithelium from pathogenic bacteria and supports the integrity of the gut barrier by maintaining a physical separation between the microbiota and the intestinal epithelial surface, which is essential for preventing excessive bacterial colonization and limiting immune activation (Vaishnava2011The).

REG3G is also involved in the inflammatory response and wound healing, particularly in skin lesions, where it is regulated by cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-33 (Shin2023Reg3γ:). In the context of metabolic processes, REG3G is implicated in glucose homeostasis and β-cell regeneration, with its expression being modulated by factors like bariatric surgery and dietary interventions, which improve metabolic outcomes (Shin2023Reg3γ:). The protein's expression is influenced by the presence of beneficial gut bacteria, suggesting its role in mediating the beneficial effects of gut microbiota on host physiology (Shin2023Reg3γ:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the REG3G gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of acute gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), REG3G plays a crucial role in maintaining gastrointestinal epithelial integrity. Its absence leads to increased apoptosis in crypt cells and greater histologic damage, indicating its importance in preventing crypt apoptosis and maintaining crypt homeostasis (Zhao2018Survival). Elevated serum levels of REG3A, the human homolog of REG3G, are associated with poor outcomes in GVHD, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for the disease (Chen2019Four).

In pancreatic cancer, REG3G expression is significantly upregulated in response to Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide, suggesting a link between periodontal disease and pancreatic cancer development (Hiraki2020P.). REG3G is also involved in colorectal cancer, where its expression is upregulated in organoids co-cultured with cancer-associated fibroblasts, indicating a potential role in tumor microenvironment interactions (Naruse2021Reexpression).

In metabolic diseases, REG3G is associated with glucose regulation and may modulate the effects of diabetes treatments like metformin. It is involved in pathways that improve glucose metabolism and reduce oxidative damage, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes (Shin2023Reg3γ:).

## Interactions
REG3G, also known as regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma, is a C-type lectin that plays a significant role in the innate immune response by interacting with bacterial peptidoglycans. It is primarily known for its antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-positive bacteria. REG3G exhibits bactericidal effects on specific Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes, while Lactobacillus species, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), show resistance to its antimicrobial properties (Frazier2020High).

REG3G also interacts with the mucus layer in the gut, where it may stabilize mucus structure by crosslinking mucins. This interaction helps trap bacteria within the mucus, allowing other antimicrobial proteins to act more effectively. Although REG3G is not directly bactericidal against certain pathogens like Salmonella enteritidis, it aids in trapping these bacteria, facilitating the action of other antimicrobial agents (Loonen2014REG3γdeficient).

In addition to its antimicrobial functions, REG3G is involved in modulating immune responses. It influences the composition and function of immune cells, such as macrophages, through interactions with gut microbiota, particularly Lactobacillus species. This interaction is mediated by STAT3 signaling pathways, leading to the induction of anti-inflammatory macrophages, which play a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis (Huang2017Gut).
