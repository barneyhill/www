# DNAH3

## Overview
DNAH3, or dynein axonemal heavy chain 3, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the dynein motor protein family, specifically involved in the function of axonemal dyneins. These proteins are critical for the motility of cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular processes, including sperm motility and respiratory function. The DNAH3 gene is predominantly expressed in the testis, where it plays a vital role in the development and function of sperm flagella, contributing to male fertility. Mutations in DNAH3 have been linked to conditions such as primary asthenoteratozoospermia and are also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer treatment responses. The protein encoded by DNAH3 is integral to the structural and functional integrity of the axonemal dynein arms, facilitating microtubule sliding through ATP hydrolysis, which is necessary for the bending and movement of cilia and flagella (Wang2024DNAH3; Maiti2000Identification).

## Function
DNAH3 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 3) is a crucial component of the axonemal dynein motor protein complex, which is essential for the movement of cilia and flagella in human cells. This protein is primarily active in the axoneme, the core structural component of cilia and flagella, where it facilitates the sliding of microtubule doublets. This sliding action is powered by ATP hydrolysis and is necessary for the bending and movement of these organelles, which is critical for their motility functions (Wang2024DNAH3; Maiti2000Identification).

In healthy human cells, DNAH3 is predominantly expressed in the testis, where it plays a significant role in the development of sperm flagella during spermatogenesis. It is involved in the assembly and function of the inner dynein arms (IDAs) of the sperm flagella, which are essential for sperm motility. Proper function of DNAH3 ensures the structural integrity of the flagellar axoneme, contributing to normal sperm morphology and motility, which are vital for male fertility (Wang2024DNAH3). DNAH3's activity is not limited to the testis; it is also expressed in other ciliated tissues, although its specific roles in these tissues remain less understood (Wang2024DNAH3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH3 gene are associated with male infertility, particularly primary asthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology. Studies have identified biallelic pathogenic variants of DNAH3 in infertile men, leading to disrupted expression of the gene and resulting in multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF), such as coiled, short, bent, irregular, and/or absent flagella. These mutations cause disordered axonemal arrangements and mitochondrial defects in sperm, contributing to infertility (Wang2024DNAH3).

In addition to its role in male infertility, DNAH3 has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disability. The Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study identified de novo missense variants in DNAH3 in patients with these conditions, suggesting it as a candidate gene for intellectual disability (Järvelä2021Exome).

DNAH3 mutations have also been linked to chemotherapy response in gastric adenocarcinoma. Patients with DNAH3 mutations showed higher chemotherapy response rates, particularly to platinum-based treatments, indicating a potential role in influencing chemosensitivity and survival outcomes in cancer patients (Zhu2019Somatic).

## Interactions
DNAH3, a component of the dynein motor protein complex, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. Although specific physical interactions of DNAH3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, some studies suggest potential interactions and roles. DNAH3 is reported to interact with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF123, which is involved in DNA damage responses through the turnover of the ATR kinase. This interaction implies a possible role for DNAH3 in cellular responses to DNA damage (Gupta2021Genes).

In the context of ciliary function, DNAH3 is part of a cluster of genes associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia and is involved in complex interactions with other genes such as DNAH9, WDR63, and CFAP70/TTC18. These interactions suggest a deleterious aggregation integration, particularly in the context of transposition of the great arteries (TGA) (De2022Clustering). Additionally, a novel predicted interaction between DNAH3 and SOD1 has been identified, indicating potential involvement in neurogenesis and Alzheimer's disease pathways (Karunakaran2020Cilia). However, detailed physical interactions of DNAH3 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored in the current literature.
