# CRISPLD1

## Overview
CRISPLD1, or cysteine-rich secretory protein LCCL domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the CRISP/Antigen 5/PR-1 (CAP) superfamily, which is known for its role in ion channel regulation. The CRISPLD1 protein is involved in various biological processes, including calcium handling and signaling, particularly within cardiomyocytes, where it acts as a negative regulator of calcium cycling. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cardiac function and is implicated in the pathophysiology of heart failure (Khadjeh2020CRISPLD1:). Additionally, CRISPLD1 plays a role in craniofacial development and may influence cell adhesion and communication within the extracellular matrix (Chiquet2010Nonsyndromic). The gene's polymorphisms have clinical significance, affecting the efficacy of treatments such as clopidogrel in coronary artery disease and being associated with breast cancer aggressiveness (Wang2018CRISPLD1).

## Function
CRISPLD1, or cysteine-rich secretory protein LCCL domain containing 1, is involved in several molecular processes, particularly in calcium handling and signaling within cardiomyocytes. It is part of the CRISP/Antigen 5/PR-1 (CAP) superfamily, which includes proteins known for their ion channel regulatory activity. In cardiomyocytes, CRISPLD1 appears to act as a negative regulator of calcium cycling, influencing calcium transient amplitude and decay, which are crucial for maintaining cardiac function (Khadjeh2020CRISPLD1:). The protein is expressed at low levels in normal myocardium but is upregulated during cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, suggesting a role in the transition to heart failure (Khadjeh2020CRISPLD1:).

CRISPLD1 is also implicated in craniofacial development, potentially through interactions with the folate pathway and other genes like CRISPLD2. Although its specific function in healthy human cells is not fully characterized, it is suggested to contribute to processes such as cell adhesion and communication within the extracellular matrix (Chiquet2010Nonsyndromic). The protein's activity in the extracellular matrix may influence morphogenesis and development, particularly in craniofacial regions (Suzuki2019MicroRNA374a).

## Clinical Significance
CRISPLD1 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in calcium handling and gene expression regulation. In the context of heart failure, CRISPLD1 is upregulated during the transition to heart failure in both humans and mice. This upregulation is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling and dysregulated calcium handling, which are key factors in heart failure progression (Khadjeh2020CRISPLD1:). Knockout studies in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes have shown that loss of CRISPLD1 function leads to changes in calcium transient properties, suggesting its role as a negative regulator of calcium cycling in cardiomyocytes (Khadjeh2020CRISPLD1:).

CRISPLD1 polymorphisms have also been linked to the antiplatelet potency of clopidogrel in coronary artery disease patients. Specifically, the CRISPLD1 rs12115090 polymorphism increases the antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel, indicating a potential role in modulating treatment response in these patients (Wang2018CRISPLD1).

In breast cancer, CRISPLD1 is among the top dysregulated hub genes associated with tumor aggressiveness and recurrence. Its high expression in breast ductal carcinoma suggests a role in processes such as proliferation and metastasis (Hamad2024Unveiling).
