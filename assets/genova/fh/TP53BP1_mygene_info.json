protein that functions in the DNA double-strand break repair pathway choice, promoting non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways, and limiting homologous recombination.

These roles are also important during V(D)J recombination, class switch recombination and at unprotected telomeres. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.
