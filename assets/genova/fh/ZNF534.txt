# ZNF534

## Overview
ZNF534 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 534, a member of the KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating the transcriptional activity of numerous genes. ZNF534 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development, and plays a significant role in brain development by modulating gene expression patterns. It is also implicated in interactions with transposable elements, influencing chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Clinically, alterations in ZNF534 have been associated with conditions such as breast cancer and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its potential role in disease predisposition and symptom heterogeneity (Talli2022Novel; Singh2023Transposable; Shahi2019Identification; Farmiloe2020Widespread).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF534, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. This protein is involved in binding to gene promoters, influencing the transcriptional activity of a wide array of genes. ZNF534, along with other KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZNFs), binds to a substantial number of gene promoters, including those not associated with transposable elements, indicating a broad regulatory function beyond transposable element repression (Farmiloe2020Widespread).

In the context of brain development, ZNF534 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression patterns. Approximately 45% of human genes have promoters bound by at least one KZNF, with ZNF534 being one of the proteins contributing to this regulatory network. This binding is crucial for the modulation of gene expression during brain development, suggesting that ZNF534 may play a role in neuronal differentiation and development (Farmiloe2020Widespread).

ZNF534 is active in the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription factor. By binding to specific DNA sequences, it modulates the transcription of target genes, thereby influencing various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development (Farmiloe2020Widespread).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF534 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, ZNF534 has been identified as a candidate cancer predisposing gene. High-impact mutations in ZNF534 were found in multiple breast cancer patients who were negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, suggesting a potential association with breast cancer predisposition (Shahi2019Identification).

ZNF534 is also associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It has been highlighted as an informative gene in the 'Memory mild' sub-phenotype of autism and is common in all severe sub-phenotypes except 'Attention severe'. This suggests that genetic variations in ZNF534 may contribute to the heterogeneity of ASD symptoms, particularly in cognitive domains like memory and attention (Talli2022Novel).

In the context of early embryonic development, ZNF534 is involved in the regulation of gene expression. Its diminished expression is noted to relieve repressive chromatin from stem cell-associated retroviral sequences (SCARS) loci, facilitating SCARS activation, which may have implications for gene regulation during embryogenesis (Glinsky2021Genomics-Guided). However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with ZNF534 gene mutations in this context are not detailed.

## Interactions
ZNF534, a KRAB-containing zinc finger protein, is involved in interactions with transposable elements (TEs) and other proteins, influencing gene expression and chromatin accessibility. In the context of HIV-1 elite controllers, ZNF534 is anticorrelated with the expression of the HERVH/LTR7 TE family, suggesting a repressive interaction. This repression is mediated by ZNF534 binding to these elements and recruiting corepressors such as KAP1, which in turn recruit chromatin-modifying factors, affecting chromatin accessibility and potentially influencing immune responses (Singh2023Transposable).

In human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and human embryonic kidney 293 cells, ZNF534 preferentially binds to the LTR7up subfamily of TEs. However, this binding does not correlate with transcriptional activity in ESCs, nor with the binding of KAP1 or the repressive histone mark H3K9me3, possibly due to low expression levels of ZNF534 in these cells (Carter2021Mosaic). In HEK293 cells, ZNF534 binds more extensively to ESC-transcribed 7up elements when overexpressed, indicating a potential repressive role in different cellular contexts (Carter2021Mosaic). These interactions highlight ZNF534's role in modulating gene expression through its interactions with TEs and associated proteins.
