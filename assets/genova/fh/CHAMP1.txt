# CHAMP1

## Overview
CHAMP1, or Chromosome Alignment Maintaining Phosphoprotein 1, is a gene that encodes a zinc finger phosphoprotein crucial for proper chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division. The protein, also named CHAMP1, is involved in maintaining kinetochore-microtubule attachments during mitosis and plays a significant role in DNA repair processes, particularly through the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. It achieves this by interacting with various proteins, including REV7, to facilitate DNA repair and maintain genomic stability. The CHAMP1 protein is categorized as a phosphoprotein due to its involvement in phosphorylation processes that are essential for its function in chromosome alignment and DNA repair. Mutations in the CHAMP1 gene are linked to a rare form of syndromic intellectual disability, highlighting its importance in neurodevelopmental processes (Tanaka2015De; Levy2023Prospective; Yoshizaki2024CHAMP1).

## Structure


## Function
The CHAMP1 gene encodes a zinc finger phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in maintaining kinetochore-microtubule attachment during mitosis, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation and cell division (Tanaka2015De; Levy2023Prospective). This protein is involved in the proper localization of the MAD2L2 protein to the mitotic spindle, ensuring correct alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (Tanaka2015De). CHAMP1 is also active in the nucleus, where it participates in DNA repair processes, specifically through the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. It promotes HR repair by forming a complex with POGZ and HP1, which helps retain BRCA1 at DNA double-strand break sites, facilitating DNA end resection and repair (Li2021REV7FANCV; Yoshizaki2024CHAMP1).

The C-terminal region of CHAMP1, containing zinc-finger domains, is crucial for its function in both chromosome alignment and HR repair (Hempel2015De; Yoshizaki2024CHAMP1). CHAMP1's interaction with REV7, a key player in DNA repair, further supports its role in promoting HR by sequestering REV7 from the Shieldin complex, thereby facilitating DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (Li2021REV7FANCV).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHAMP1 gene are associated with a rare syndromic form of intellectual disability (ID) characterized by impaired speech, hypotonia, microcephaly, and facial dysmorphy (Isidor2016De). These mutations are typically de novo and include frameshift and nonsense mutations, which lead to truncated proteins that disrupt normal chromosomal alignment and segregation during cell division (Dong2021First). The clinical presentation of individuals with CHAMP1 mutations often includes global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features such as hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, and a short philtrum (Tanaka2015De).

Behavioral abnormalities, including aggressive behavior, self-injurious actions, and hyperactivity, are also observed in some cases (Tanaka2015De). Seizures, including febrile seizures, have been reported, with some resolving over time (Tanaka2015De). Additional features may include ophthalmologic issues like hyperopia and strabismus, gastrointestinal problems such as GERD and constipation, and muscle tone abnormalities like hypotonia and spasticity (Garrity2021Neurodevelopmental).

CHAMP1 mutations can lead to defects in homologous recombination repair, contributing to the pathogenesis of intellectual disability through haploinsufficiency (Yoshizaki2024CHAMP1). The gene's role in chromosome alignment and segregation is crucial, and its disruption can result in significant neurodevelopmental disorders (Hempel2015De).

## Interactions
The CHAMP1 protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in chromosome alignment and DNA repair processes. It interacts with the REV7 protein, a member of the HORMA family, by binding to its seatbelt domain. This interaction is crucial for promoting homologous recombination (HR) repair by sequestering REV7 from the Shieldin complex, which is involved in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. CHAMP1 competes with other proteins like SHLD3 and REV3 for binding to REV7, thereby influencing DNA repair pathways (Li2021REV7FANCV).

CHAMP1 is also part of a heterochromatin complex that includes HP1α, LEDGF, HDGFRP2, and POGZ, which further promotes HR repair. This complex helps sequester REV7 away from error-prone repair pathways under specific conditions (Li2021REV7FANCV). Additionally, CHAMP1 interacts with proteins involved in the microtubule and kinetochore networks, such as BUBR1 and MAD2L2, which are essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division (Garrity2021Neurodevelopmental). These interactions highlight CHAMP1's role in maintaining genomic stability and its potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.
