# AKAP8

## Overview
AKAP8, or A-kinase anchoring protein 8, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various nuclear processes, including transcription regulation, RNA splicing, and chromatin dynamics. The protein, also known as AKAP95, belongs to the A-kinase anchoring protein family, which is characterized by its ability to bind the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and localize it within the cell (Collas1999The). AKAP8 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating R-loop formation and interacting with proteins such as DDX5 to resolve these structures, thereby influencing transcriptional regulation (Wang2023AKAP8). Additionally, AKAP8 is involved in chromatin remodeling and cell cycle regulation, interacting with various proteins to mediate these processes (Baarsma2020Disruption). Its involvement in cancer and cardiovascular diseases highlights its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Wang2023AKAP8; Shen2018miR‑21).

## Structure
AKAP8 is a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein family, characterized by its ability to bind the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and localize it within the cell. The protein structure of AKAP8 includes several distinct domains. It contains an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) from amino acids 101-210, which is crucial for its phase-liquid dynamic status in the nucleus and affects RNA splicing (Wang2023AKAP8). The N-terminal region (1-100 amino acids) interacts with RNA processing proteins, including splicing factors and RNA helicase, playing a key role in RNA splicing regulation and nuclear distribution (Wang2023AKAP8).

AKAP8 also features two zinc finger domains in its middle region, which are involved in chromatin condensation and RNA motif binding, potentially influencing RNA splicing by binding with pre-mRNA (Wang2023AKAP8). The protein includes a PKA binding domain, which is essential for its nuclear targeting and interaction with DDX5 (Wang2023AKAP8). AKAP8's ability to form dynamic liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates is linked to its regulatory functions in transcription and splicing (Wang2023AKAP8). The protein's interaction with DDX5 is mediated by the NMTS domain, which is sufficient for its nuclear localization (Wang2023AKAP8). Specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of AKAP8 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
AKAP8, also known as A-kinase anchoring protein 8, is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily within the nucleus. It plays a crucial role in regulating transcription and splicing by binding to RNA and forming liquid-like condensates, which are essential for its regulatory functions (Wang2023AKAP8). AKAP8 is involved in maintaining the balance of genomic R-loop formation, which are RNA:DNA hybrid structures formed during transcription. It interacts with the R-loop resolution protein DDX5, enhancing its chromatin-associated levels, which is vital for resolving R-loops and promoting transcriptional regulation (Wang2023AKAP8).

In addition to its role in transcription, AKAP8 is implicated in chromatin remodeling and RNA processing. It contains zinc finger domains that mediate chromatin condensation and RNA motif binding, suggesting its involvement in RNA splicing by binding with pre-mRNA (Wang2023AKAP8). AKAP8 also influences cell cycle regulation by interacting with cyclin D1, indicating its potential involvement in cell cycle transitions (Baarsma2020Disruption). These functions highlight AKAP8's significant role in maintaining normal cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and splicing, in healthy human cells (Wang2023AKAP8).

## Clinical Significance
AKAP8 has been implicated in various cancers, particularly lung carcinoma and breast cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma, AKAP8 interacts with DDX5 to regulate R-loop balance, which is crucial for cell growth. High expression of AKAP8 is associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma patients, as it correlates with increased tumor tissue expression compared to normal tissue (Wang2023AKAP8). AKAP8's role in regulating the UCP2 gene, which is linked to mitochondrial metabolism, further underscores its significance in lung cancer progression (Wang2023AKAP8).

In breast cancer, AKAP8 is amplified and upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), correlating with poorer patient survival. Its depletion in TNBC cell lines reduces cell growth and accelerates epithelial-mesenchymal transition, enhancing metastatic potential (Wang2023AKAP8).

AKAP8 is also involved in cardiomyocyte injury, where its expression is modulated by miR-21. This regulation reduces apoptosis and reactive oxygen species production, suggesting a protective role against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced damage (Shen2018miR‑21).

These findings highlight AKAP8's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
AKAP8, also known as AKAP95, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the RIIα regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), anchoring PKA to chromatin, which is essential for maintaining chromatin condensation during mitosis. Disruption of this interaction leads to premature chromatin decondensation, highlighting its importance in chromatin dynamics (Collas1999The).

AKAP8 also interacts with minichromosome maintenance protein 2 (MCM2), a regulator of DNA replication. This interaction is crucial for the initiation and elongation phases of DNA replication, as disrupting it abolishes replication in G1-phase nuclei (Eide2003Protein).

In the context of cancer, AKAP8 interacts with the splicing regulator hnRNPM, inhibiting its activity to regulate alternative splicing and suppress epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in breast cancer (Hu2020The). AKAP8 also binds with DDX5 to regulate R-loop balance, which is involved in lung carcinoma cell growth. This interaction is crucial for maintaining R-loop balance and affects transcriptional regulation (Wang2023AKAP8).
