# POP5

## Overview
POP5 is a gene that encodes the POP5 homolog, a protein subunit integral to the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes. These complexes are crucial for the processing of precursor tRNA and rRNA, playing a significant role in RNA maturation and cellular function. The POP5 protein is characterized by its α-β sandwich fold, which is similar to the RNA recognition motif (RRM) fold, and it forms a heterodimer with Rpp30, essential for its function within the RNase P complex (Wilson2006Structure). This protein is evolutionarily conserved, indicating its fundamental role across different species in RNA processing and cellular regulation (Perederina2011Interactions). In humans, POP5 is also implicated in the regulation of telomere length, highlighting its broader significance in genomic stability (Keener2023Validation).

## Structure
The POP5 protein, a subunit of the ribonuclease P and MRP complexes, exhibits a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure of POP5 includes an α-β sandwich fold, characterized by a central four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. This arrangement is similar to the RNA recognition motif (RRM) fold, although it includes additional structural elements such as longer β-strands and an extra short helix compared to typical RRM domains (Wilson2006Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, POP5 forms a hydrophobic core with its β-sheet and α-helices, while the other face is more solvent-exposed. This configuration suggests a potential role in RNA binding, utilizing aromatic and apolar side chains exposed from the central β-sheet (Wilson2006Structure). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a heterodimer with Rpp30, which is essential for its function in the RNase P complex (Wilson2006Structure).

The protein's structure is evolutionarily conserved, indicating a similar function across different species, including interactions with catalytic RNA and substrate precursor-tRNA (Perederina2011Interactions).

## Function
POP5 is a subunit of the ribonuclease P and MRP complexes, which are essential for RNA processing in eukaryotic cells. These complexes are involved in the maturation of precursor tRNA and rRNA, crucial for protein synthesis and cell function (Rosenblad2006Inventory). In humans, POP5 is part of the RNase P/MRP complex, which has been implicated in the regulation of the telomerase holoenzyme complex, suggesting a role in telomere length regulation (Keener2023Validation). 

The protein is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to RNA cleavage and processing, maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the ribonucleases P and MRP (Rosenblad2006Inventory). POP5 forms a heterodimer with Rpp1, which binds to the catalytic domain of RNase MRP, playing a role similar to that of bacterial RNase P (Perederina2011Interactions). This interaction is crucial for the maturation of 5.8S rRNA and the regulation of the cell cycle by cleaving the 5' UTR of cyclin B2 mRNA (Perederina2011Interactions). The involvement of POP5 in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and genomic stability.

## Interactions
The POP5 protein is a subunit of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes, which are involved in the processing of tRNA and rRNA, respectively. In yeast, POP5 forms a heterodimer with the Rpp1 protein, which is essential for its solubility and function. This heterodimer specifically binds to the catalytic domain of RNase MRP RNA, forming a stable RNA-protein complex. The binding is specific, as no interaction is observed with control yeast tRNA or other RNA fragments (Perederina2011Interactions). The interaction of the Pop5/Rpp1 heterodimer with RNase MRP RNA is characterized by a dissociation constant of approximately 60 nM, indicating a strong binding affinity (Perederina2011Interactions).

In archaea, the Pop5 protein interacts with Rpp30, forming a functional pair that can partially reconstitute RNase P activity. This interaction is supported by yeast two-hybrid experiments and NMR chemical shift perturbations, suggesting that Pop5 and Rpp30 form a functional pair that can reconstitute the catalytic domain of RNase P RNA (Wilson2006Structure). The structural analysis of Pop5 reveals a hydrophobic surface that likely interacts with a similar patch on Rpp30, supporting their interaction (Wilson2006Structure).
