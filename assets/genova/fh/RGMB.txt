# RGMB

## Overview
RGMB, or repulsive guidance molecule b, is a gene that encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein known as the repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor b. This protein is a member of the RGM family and plays a pivotal role in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including neuronal development, immune regulation, and epithelial function. The RGMB protein is characterized by its structural features, including a beta sandwich structure and a GPI anchor, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins such as neogenin and BMPs. These interactions are essential for modulating signaling pathways that influence neurite extension, axonal regeneration, and immune responses. RGMB's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular integrity and tissue homeostasis, as well as its potential implications in disease contexts such as cancer and immune disorders (Zhang2024Repulsive; Shi2015Dragon; Healey2015Repulsive).

## Structure
The RGMB protein, also known as Dragon, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein involved in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Its primary structure includes an N-terminal signal peptide of approximately 50 residues and a C-terminal GPI anchor domain of about 35 amino acids (Zhang2024Repulsive). The protein is characterized by a tightly packed beta sandwich structure extended by four short helices at the C terminus, with the N and C termini linked by disulfide bonds (Bell2013Structure). RGMB contains 14 cysteine residues, indicating it is a disulfide-binding protein, although the specific disulfide-binding mode requires further research (Zhang2024Repulsive).

RGMB is a member of the RGM family, which includes RGMa and RGMc, and is involved in forming complexes with neogenin and BMPs, acting as a structural bridge in these interactions (Healey2015Repulsive). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation at two asparagine-linked sites (Zhang2024Repulsive). The RGMB-NEO1 complex is characterized by a 2:2 stoichiometry, with RGMB acting as a staple to bring two NEO1 receptors together (Bell2013Structure).

## Function
The RGMB gene encodes the repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor b, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein involved in several critical biological processes in healthy human cells. RGMB is primarily active at the cell membrane, where it modulates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, a pathway essential for various cellular functions, including neurite extension and axonal regeneration (Zhang2024Repulsive; Severyn2009Molecular).

In the nervous system, RGMB plays a significant role in neuronal development by promoting intercellular adhesion and inhibiting axonal overgrowth through the RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway (Zhang2024Repulsive). It interacts with neogenin, a receptor that influences neuronal cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, and is involved in the development of trigeminal, facial, and optic nerves (Zhang2024Repulsive).

RGMB also contributes to immune regulation by interacting with programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2) on dendritic cells, which inhibits CD8+ T-cell responses, thus modulating immune tolerance (Zhang2024Repulsive). Additionally, RGMB is involved in epithelial function, where it enhances intercellular tight junctions and transepithelial resistance via the Smad1/5/8 pathway (Zhang2024Repulsive). These functions underscore RGMB's importance in maintaining cellular integrity and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RGMB gene, also known as repulsive guidance molecule b, have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), RGMB, referred to as Dragon, is overexpressed and promotes tumor growth by enhancing BMP signaling pathways, specifically through BMP4 and the Smad1/5/8 and Erk1/2 pathways. This overexpression is associated with increased proliferation of colon cancer cells and progression of the disease, suggesting RGMB as a potential therapeutic target for CRC treatment (Shi2015Dragon).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RGMB expression is downregulated, and this reduction is linked to poor prognosis. The lncRNA RGMB-AS1 is upregulated in NSCLC and inversely correlates with RGMB expression, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that may contribute to cancer progression (Li2015Study). In contrast, RGMB acts as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC by inhibiting the Smad1/5/8 pathway, and its decreased expression is associated with advanced disease stages (Zhang2024Repulsive).

RGMB is also involved in immune regulation, where it enhances the suppressive activity of the soluble form of CTLA-4, potentially affecting immune responses in cancer and autoimmune diseases (Sekiya2019RGMB). These findings highlight the complex role of RGMB in cancer biology and immune modulation.

## Interactions
RGMB, also known as repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor b, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with neogenin (NEO1), forming a complex that plays a crucial role in BMP signaling pathways. This interaction is essential for the structural integrity and function of the signaling hub, facilitating the clustering of BMPs and NEO1 at the cell surface, which enhances BMP signaling (Healey2015Repulsive). RGMB also acts as a co-receptor for BMPs, forming a ternary complex with BMP2 and NEO1, which is crucial for BMP-mediated signaling (Healey2015Repulsive).

RGMB's interaction with BMPs is pH-dependent, suggesting a mechanism where RGMB-mediated activation of BMP signaling occurs through endocytosis and subsequent dissociation in endosomes (Healey2015Repulsive). Additionally, RGMB interacts with programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), forming a signaling supercomplex that regulates immune responses, particularly in the context of tumorigenesis and immune tolerance (Zhang2024Repulsive). These interactions highlight RGMB's role in modulating signaling pathways that are critical for neural development, immune regulation, and disease progression.
