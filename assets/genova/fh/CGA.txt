# CGA

## Overview
The CGA gene encodes the glycoprotein hormones, alpha polypeptide, which is a critical component of several heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones, including luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). These hormones are essential for regulating reproductive and thyroid functions in humans. The CGA protein, characterized by a cystine-knot motif, belongs to the cystine-knot protein superfamily and is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its structural integrity and function (Querat2021Unconventional). The protein's interaction with specific beta subunits forms active hormones that engage with leucine-rich repeat G protein-coupled receptors, initiating signaling pathways vital for physiological processes (Querat2021Unconventional). Beyond its role in hormone synthesis, CGA is involved in the regulation of secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells, influencing various biological systems, including endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune systems (D’amico2014Biological). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in clinical contexts, particularly in cancer chemoresistance, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Cao2022A).

## Structure
The CGA gene encodes the alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones, which are heterodimeric proteins composed of a common alpha subunit and a specific beta subunit. The primary structure of the CGA protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a cystine-knot motif, a characteristic feature of the cystine-knot protein superfamily, particularly the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) subfamily (Querat2021Unconventional). This motif is stabilized by disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's tertiary structure. The alpha subunit contains 10 cysteine residues, with three pairs involved in forming the cystine-knot motif, which is crucial for the protein's stability and function (Querat2021Unconventional).

The quaternary structure of the CGA protein involves non-covalent interactions with beta subunits, forming heterodimers that are stabilized by a 'seatbelt' mechanism. This involves an intramolecular cysteine bridge that encircles loop 2 of the alpha subunit (Querat2021Unconventional). The CGA subunit is glycosylated, with two N-glycosylation sites at conserved positions, which are important for the stability and function of the hormone (Querat2021Unconventional). These structural features enable the CGA subunit to activate specific leucine-rich repeat G protein-coupled receptors through a Gs-dependent cAMP pathway (Querat2021Unconventional).

## Function
The CGA gene encodes the alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones, which are crucial for various physiological processes in humans. This subunit pairs with hormone-specific beta subunits to form active glycoprotein hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). These hormones are secreted by the pituitary gland and placenta and play significant roles in regulating reproductive and thyroid functions, including ovulation, spermatogenesis, and thyroid hormone production.

In addition to its role in hormone formation, CGA is involved in the regulation of secretory granules in neuroendocrine cells. It is a major soluble protein co-stored and co-released with catecholamines, functioning as a pro-hormone that gives rise to several bioactive peptides. These peptides influence various systems, including the endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune systems, and are involved in glucose and calcium homeostasis (D’amico2014Biological). The CGA gene is expressed in endocrine and neuroendocrine cells, where it plays a crucial role in regulated hormone secretion and the formation and targeting of secretory granules (Mouland1994Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CGA gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones, have been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of gastric cancer (GC). The CGA gene is involved in a positive feedback circuit with EGFR and GATA2, contributing to chemoresistance in GC. This circuit enhances EGFR signaling, which is crucial for cell survival and chemoresistance, and is dependent on CGA's N-glycosylation. Elevated CGA levels have been observed in chemoresistant GC cells and patient samples, suggesting its role as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Targeting this circuit with anti-EGFR therapies or microRNAs has been proposed to restore chemotherapy sensitivity (Cao2022A).

CGA is not considered a bona fide EGFR ligand due to its low sequence similarity to EGF, but it can still activate EGFR signaling, leading to downstream effects that promote chemoresistance. The study suggests that CGA overexpression in GC cells confers resistance to chemotherapeutic agents like fluorouracil, which can be overcome by blocking EGFR (Cao2022A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CGA in cancer treatment resistance.
