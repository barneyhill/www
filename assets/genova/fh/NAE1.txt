# NAE1

## Overview
The NAE1 gene encodes the NEDD8 activating enzyme E1 subunit 1, a crucial component of the NEDD8-activating enzyme complex involved in the neddylation pathway. This pathway is essential for the post-translational modification of proteins, particularly the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target proteins, which primarily include cullin-RING ligases (CRLs). These ligases play a significant role in regulating protein degradation, cell cycle progression, and signal transduction (Santonico2019New; Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like). The NAE1 protein functions as part of a heterodimer with UBA3, facilitating the activation of NEDD8 through ATP-dependent processes. This activation is critical for the transfer of NEDD8 to its substrates, thereby influencing various cellular processes, including DNA synthesis and mitosis (Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like). NAE1's role in these pathways makes it a target for cancer therapies, as its dysregulation is associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Barghout2020E1; Santonico2019New).

## Structure
The NAE1 gene encodes a subunit of the NEDD8-activating enzyme E1, which is crucial for the neddylation pathway. The NAE1 protein forms a heterodimer with UBA3, another subunit of the E1 enzyme complex. This complex is responsible for the activation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8. The NAE1-UBA3 heterodimer has a distinct domain architecture that includes an adenylation domain, a catalytic cysteine-containing domain, and a ubiquitin-fold domain (UFD) (Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like).

The adenylation domain of UBA3, which is part of the NAE1-UBA3 complex, is involved in the ATP-dependent adenylation of NEDD8's C-terminus, forming a thioester intermediate. This domain is characterized by a C-terminal MoeB and ThiF-like repeat, which is common among E1 enzymes (Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like). The UFD of UBA3 binds to the E2 enzyme UBC12, and its rotation is essential for the transfer of NEDD8 from E1 to E2 (Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like).

NAE1 has been targeted in cancer therapies, with inhibitors like MLN4924 binding to the ATP-binding site in UBA3, disrupting protein turnover and inducing apoptosis (Santonico2019New). The molecular structure of NAE1 itself is not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
NAE1, also known as NEDD8 activating enzyme E1 subunit 1, is a critical component of the NEDD8-activating enzyme complex, which plays a vital role in the neddylation process. This process involves the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target proteins, primarily cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), which are essential for regulating protein degradation, cell cycle progression, and signal transduction (Santonico2019New; Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like). 

NAE1 functions as part of a heterodimer with UBA3, facilitating the initial activation step of NEDD8 by binding NEDD8 and ATP, and forming a thioester linkage with NEDD8. This activation is crucial for the subsequent transfer of NEDD8 to the E2 enzyme, UBC12, and ultimately to its substrates (Santonico2019New; Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like). 

The activity of NAE1 is essential for maintaining proper cell cycle progression and cellular homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including DNA synthesis and mitosis, and is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Santonico2019New; Schulman2009Ubiquitin-like). The specificity of NEDD8 for its E1 enzyme is determined by specific interactions at the interface of the APPBP1-UBA3 heterodimer and NEDD8, ensuring the distinct pathway of NEDD8 from ubiquitin (Santonico2019New).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NAE1 gene have significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly cancer. In cancer biology, NAE1 is involved in the neddylation pathway, which regulates the activity of proteins crucial for cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Dysregulation of this pathway can contribute to cancer development and progression. High expression levels of NAE1 are associated with poor clinical outcomes in several cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and glioblastoma, although in thyroid cancer, high NAE1 expression correlates with a favorable prognosis (Barghout2020E1).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, NAE1/APP-BP1 expression levels influence radiosensitivity. Overexpression of NAE1/APP-BP1 increases radioresistance by inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity, while its downregulation enhances radiosensitivity in a p53-dependent manner (GUIHARD2012The).

NAE1 mutations have also been implicated in the activation of the NRF2 pathway in certain cancers, such as a novel subtype of uterine leiomyomas. These mutations can lead to defective neddylation, contributing to oncogenic NRF2 activation (Mehine2022A). In breast cancer, NAE1 is involved in the neddylation pathway affecting tamoxifen sensitivity, with its inhibition leading to resistance to endocrine therapies (MendesPereira2011Genomewide).

## Interactions
NAE1, as part of the NEDD8-activating enzyme complex, interacts with UBA3 to form a heterodimer that is essential for the activation of NEDD8. This complex facilitates the ATP-dependent adenylation of NEDD8's C-terminus, followed by its transfer to the catalytic cysteine in UBA3, forming a thioester intermediate (Santonico2019New; Enchev2014Protein). NAE1 also interacts with cullin proteins, which are substrates for neddylation, a process crucial for the activation of cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), a family of ubiquitin E3 ligases (Enchev2014Protein).

The NAE1-UBA3 complex interacts with NEDD8 through three contact sites: a hydrophobic surface, an electrostatic interaction, and a partial stiffening of NEDD8's C-terminal tail. These interactions are critical for the specificity of NEDD8 for its E1 enzyme (Santonico2019New). The E1-E2 interface involves two surfaces, one shared with other E1-E2 pairs and another unique to the NEDD8 pathway, which helps isolate it from the ubiquitin enzymatic cascade (Santonico2019New).

NAE1 is also a target for cancer therapies, with inhibitors like MLN4924 disrupting its activity to interfere with protein turnover and induce apoptosis in cancer cells (Santonico2019New).
