# RAB28

## Overview
RAB28 is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. The RAB28 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including phagocytosis of cone outer segments by the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), lysosomal and nuclear delivery, and activation of NF-κB. It plays a significant role in glucose transporter trafficking and intraflagellar transport, highlighting its importance in cellular signaling and sensory perception (Ying2018The). RAB28 is particularly crucial in the context of ciliary function, where it is associated with the BBSome complex and intraflagellar transport, indicating its involvement in membrane shedding and protein trafficking essential for photoreceptor cell maintenance (Jensen2016WholeOrganism). Mutations in the RAB28 gene are linked to autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophies, underscoring its clinical significance in retinal health (Iarossi2020Expanding).

## Structure


## Function
RAB28 is a small GTPase that plays a crucial role in the phagocytosis of cone outer segments by the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), a process essential for the renewal and maintenance of photoreceptor cells in the retina. In healthy human cells, RAB28 is involved in several cellular processes, including lysosomal delivery, nuclear delivery and activation of NF-κB, glucose transporter trafficking, and intraflagellar transport (Ying2018The). It interacts with various proteins, such as the prenyl-binding protein phosphodiesterase 6 δ-subunit (PDE6D) and the voltage-gated potassium channel KCNJ13, which are important for its trafficking and function in the RPE (Ying2018The). RAB28's interaction with PDE6D is dependent on its prenylation, which is crucial for its targeting to the outer segments of photoreceptor cells (Ying2018The).

RAB28 is also associated with the BBSome and intraflagellar transport, indicating its role in ciliary function. It is expressed in ciliated neurons and localizes along the entire cilium, suggesting its involvement in sensory perception and cellular signaling (Jensen2016WholeOrganism). In the context of ciliary function, RAB28 is linked to the regulation of membrane shedding and protein trafficking, which are vital for maintaining photoreceptor cell health and function (Ying2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAB28 gene are associated with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophies (CORDs), a group of progressive inherited retinal diseases. These conditions are characterized by an initial loss of cone photoreceptors followed by rod degeneration, leading to symptoms such as poor visual acuity, impaired color vision, photophobia, and potential night vision and peripheral vision loss in later stages (Iarossi2020Expanding). Specific mutations, including homozygous nonsense and splicing variants, as well as a missense variant in compound heterozygosis, have been identified in Italian families. These mutations result in a complete or partial loss of function of the RAB28 protein, affecting its ability to bind Mg2+ and GTP, which is crucial for its function (Iarossi2020Expanding).

In Rab28 knockout mice, which serve as a model for human cone-rod dystrophy 18 (CRD18), the absence of RAB28 leads to impaired disc shedding and phagocytosis of cone outer segments by the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), resulting in cone degeneration (Ying2018The). This dysfunction is linked to the interaction of RAB28 with proteins such as PDE6D and KCNJ13, which are involved in its trafficking and function in the RPE (Ying2018The).

## Interactions
RAB28, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. In the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) of mice, RAB28 interacts with the prenyl-binding protein phosphodiesterase 6 δ-subunit (PDE6D) and the voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily J member 13 (KCNJ13). These interactions are essential for the phagocytosis of cone outer segments, with PDE6D facilitating the delivery of RAB28 to the outer segments and KCNJ13 potentially collaborating with RAB28 to enhance phagocytosis (Ying2018The).

RAB28 is also associated with the BBSome complex and intraflagellar transport (IFT) in C. elegans, where it acts as an IFT cargo. Its localization to the periciliary membrane and association with IFT trains depend on GTP-binding and interactions with the BBSome subunit orthologue, BBS-8 (Jensen2016WholeOrganism). The BBSome, along with ARL-6 and PDE6D, regulates RAB28's ciliary localization, impacting extracellular vesicle biogenesis and shedding (Akella2019A).

In Trypanosoma brucei, RAB28 interacts with components of the retromer and ESCRT pathways, such as Vps23 and Vps26, playing a role in endosomal trafficking and protein turnover (Lumb2011Rab28). These interactions highlight RAB28's involvement in diverse cellular functions across different organisms.
