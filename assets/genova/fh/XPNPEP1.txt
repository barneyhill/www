# XPNPEP1

## Overview
XPNPEP1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme X-prolyl aminopeptidase 1, a cytosolic aminopeptidase involved in the cleavage of N-terminal proline residues from peptides. This enzyme plays a critical role in peptide metabolism, particularly in the processing of biologically active peptides that contain a penultimate proline, which is crucial for their function and stability (Yoon2012Developmental). X-prolyl aminopeptidase 1 is a manganese-dependent enzyme, distinguishing it from its membrane-bound zinc-dependent counterparts, and is predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues, where it contributes to synaptic function and plasticity (Cottrell2000Cloning; Yoon2021Altered). The gene is located on chromosome 10q25.3 and encodes a protein that forms a dimeric structure essential for its enzymatic activity (Li2011Human). Mutations in XPNPEP1 are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neuronal function and cognitive processes (Bae2022Suppression).

## Structure
The XPNPEP1 protein, also known as human cytosolic X-prolyl aminopeptidase, is a dimeric enzyme with a molecular weight of approximately 140 kDa under nondenaturing conditions, with each monomer weighing about 70 kDa (Li2011Human). The monomer is a 'C'-shaped molecule, approximately 70 Å in length, 60 Å in width, and 35 Å in height, and consists of three domains (Li2011Human). 

Domain I and Domain II each contain a six-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by six α-helices. Domain III features a conserved 'pita-bread' fold, which includes a strongly curved five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and two additional antiparallel β-sheets, with six α-helices on the outer face (Li2011Human). The active site of XPNPEP1 contains two manganese ions per subunit, essential for its catalytic activity, and is coordinated by several conserved residues, including Asp415, Asp426, Glu523, and Glu537 (Wu2012Weak; Li2011Human).

The dimerization of XPNPEP1 involves hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and charged interactions, primarily involving residues in domain III, with Trp477 playing a crucial role in dimer formation (Li2011Human). The enzyme is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 10q25.3 and consists of 623 amino acids (Li2011Human).

## Function
XPNPEP1 encodes the enzyme aminopeptidase P1, which is involved in the cleavage of N-terminal proline residues from peptides. This enzyme plays a crucial role in peptide metabolism by processing biologically active peptides that contain a penultimate proline, which is essential for their biological activity and resistance to degradation (Yoon2012Developmental). Aminopeptidase P1 is a cytosolic protein predominantly found in the somato-dendritic compartments of neurons, indicating its significant role in neuronal function (Yoon2021Altered).

In healthy human cells, aminopeptidase P1 is involved in the degradation of peptides such as bradykinin and substance P by hydrolyzing the X-Pro bond. This activity is manganese-dependent, distinguishing it from the membrane-bound form of the enzyme, which contains zinc (Cottrell2000Cloning). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal peptide processing, preventing the accumulation of undigested peptides, and ensuring proper synaptic function (Bae2022Suppression).

Aminopeptidase P1 is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in the brain, where it is primarily expressed in neurons rather than glial cells. This distribution suggests its involvement in neuronal processes and synaptic plasticity, which are vital for cognitive functions (Yoon2021Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XPNPEP1 gene, which encodes aminopeptidase P1, are associated with inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) that lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. These disorders include developmental delay, microcephaly, and epilepsy. The deficiency of aminopeptidase P1 disrupts NMDA receptor (NMDAR) homeostasis, resulting in synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus. This dysfunction is characterized by enhanced NMDAR activity and long-term potentiation (LTP), which are linked to neurological and behavioral deficits (Bae2022Suppression).

In Xpnpep1-deficient mice, excessive NMDAR activity leads to neurodegeneration, hyperactivity, and cognitive dysfunction. Chronic treatment with memantine, an NMDAR antagonist, has been shown to ameliorate these deficits by suppressing exaggerated NMDAR activity and restoring downstream signaling (Bae2022Suppression). The deficiency also results in increased excitability of CA3 pyramidal neurons, which may lead to selective excitotoxic cell death and altered glial cell populations, contributing to hippocampal dysfunction (Yoon2021Altered).

These findings suggest that pharmacological interventions targeting altered NMDAR activity could be effective in treating neurodevelopmental and cognitive deficits associated with XPNPEP1 mutations (Bae2022Suppression).
