# PRODH

## Overview
The PRODH gene encodes the enzyme proline dehydrogenase 1, a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a pivotal role in proline metabolism. This enzyme, categorized as an oxidoreductase, catalyzes the conversion of proline to pyrroline-5-carboxylate, a reaction integral to cellular energy production and redox homeostasis (Bender2005Functional). Proline dehydrogenase 1 is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis and autophagy, and is regulated by the tumor suppressor p53, linking it to cellular stress responses (Natarajan2012Proline). Mutations in the PRODH gene have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and hyperprolinemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Jacquet2002PRODH; Mitsubuchi2014Biochemical). The enzyme's structure, characterized by a TIM barrel fold, facilitates its enzymatic function and interaction with other cellular components (Tanner2019Structural).

## Structure
Proline dehydrogenase 1 (PRODH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of proline to pyrroline-5-carboxylate. The primary structure of PRODH consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the PRODH gene. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a variant of the (βα)8 barrel fold, known as the TIM barrel, which is common in nature and supports diverse enzymatic functions (Tanner2019Structural). 

The tertiary structure of PRODH involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, with the active site located at the carboxyl termini of the strands of the TIM barrel structure. The isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor, which is the redox center, is tightly packed against specific strands and loops of the barrel, forming part of the proline-binding site (Tanner2019Structural). 

In terms of quaternary structure, PRODH forms a classic ALDH domain-swapped dimer, where the oligomerization domain of one protomer contacts the GSALDH catalytic domain of the opposite protomer, as well as the PRODH barrel, the PRODH-GSALDH linker, and the α-domain of the opposite protomer (Tanner2019Structural). This arrangement is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic mechanism by sequestering intermediates in a substrate-channeling tunnel.

## Function
The PRODH gene encodes proline dehydrogenase (POX), a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a crucial role in proline metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of proline to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) (Bender2005Functional). This process is essential for cellular energy production and redox balance, as it involves the transfer of electrons to cytochrome c, which can lead to ATP production or the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Huynh2020Understanding). The enzyme's activity is influenced by the availability of proline, which is primarily sourced from collagen (Huynh2020Understanding).

PRODH is involved in several cellular processes, including apoptosis and autophagy. It can induce apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, with the extrinsic pathway involving the expression of TRAIL and activation of caspases (Huynh2020Understanding). The enzyme is upregulated by the tumor suppressor p53, linking it to cellular stress responses and apoptosis (Natarajan2012Proline).

In addition to its role in apoptosis, PRODH is implicated in protecting cells against oxidative stress. It helps maintain ATP levels and the NADPH/NADP+ ratio during oxidative stress, supporting cell survival (Natarajan2012Proline). The enzyme's activity is also associated with the regulation of neurotransmitter levels, potentially influencing cognitive functions (Bender2005Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRODH gene, which encodes proline dehydrogenase, are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and hyperprolinemia. Hyperprolinemia type I is caused by impaired proline dehydrogenase activity due to PRODH mutations, leading to elevated plasma proline levels. This condition is often linked to neurological symptoms and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, particularly in individuals with the 22q11 deletion syndrome, which includes the PRODH gene (Jacquet2002PRODH; Mitsubuchi2014Biochemical).

Specific mutations, such as L441P and L289M, have been identified in schizophrenic patients and are associated with increased plasma proline levels. These mutations can lead to mild to severe reductions in proline oxidase activity, contributing to the clinical severity of hyperprolinemia (Jacquet2002PRODH; Bender2005Functional). The presence of these mutations in the PRODH gene may also affect neurotransmitter pathways, potentially altering glutamate metabolism and increasing the risk of psychiatric conditions (Namavar2021Psychiatric).

Research suggests that variations in the PRODH gene can impact fronto-striatal processing, a neural circuit involved in cognitive and emotional functions, thereby contributing to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Kempf2008Functional).
