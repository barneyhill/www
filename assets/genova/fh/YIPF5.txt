# YIPF5

## Overview
YIPF5 is a gene that encodes the Yip1 domain family member 5 protein, a multi-span transmembrane protein primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein is characterized by its involvement in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the transport of COPII-coated vesicles from the ER to the cis-Golgi, which is crucial for protein synthesis and processing (Pollin2020YIPF5; Shaik2019Characteristics). Yip1 domain family member 5 is part of a larger family of proteins that maintain Golgi structure and function through interactions with other proteins, such as YIF1A and components of the COPII vesicle coat protein complex (Yoshida2008YIPF5; Angelotti2022Exploring). Mutations in YIPF5 have been linked to conditions such as neonatal diabetes and microcephaly, highlighting its role in cellular homeostasis and β cell survival (E2021YIPF5; De2020YIPF5).

## Structure
YIPF5 is a multi-span transmembrane protein primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is characterized by five transmembrane helices, with the N-terminus exposed to the cytoplasm and the C-terminal hydrophilic regions exposed to the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (Yoshida2008YIPF5; Shaik2019Characteristics). The transmembrane region is well conserved and is annotated as the 'Yip1 domain' (Shaik2019Characteristics). 

The YIPF5 protein interacts with components of the COPII vesicle coat protein complex, which is crucial for ER-to-Golgi transport (Yoshida2008YIPF5; Angelotti2022Exploring). It forms complexes with other proteins, such as YIF1A, and these complexes are involved in maintaining the Golgi structure (Yoshida2008YIPF5). YIPF5 is part of a larger group of YIPF protein complexes that localize to different compartments of the Golgi apparatus, forming oligomers of approximately 4-8 mer in HeLa cells (Shaik2019Characteristics).

Mutations in YIPF5 can affect its structure and function, leading to conditions such as neonatal diabetes and microcephaly through endoplasmic reticulum stress (E2021YIPF5). The protein's role in β cells is significant, as its deficiency enhances ER stress and sensitizes β cells to apoptosis (E2021YIPF5).

## Function
The YIPF5 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in intracellular trafficking, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. In healthy human cells, YIPF5 is involved in the transport of COPII-coated vesicles from the ER to the cis-Golgi, a process essential for the proper synthesis and processing of proteins like proinsulin (Pollin2020YIPF5). YIPF5 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and pancreatic islets, and is crucial for maintaining ER homeostasis and β cell survival by preventing ER stress and ensuring proper protein trafficking (E2021YIPF5).

The protein localizes at ER exit sites, the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, and part of the cis-Golgi, cycling between these compartments to facilitate cargo exit from the ER (E2021YIPF5). YIPF5 interacts with components of the COPII vesicle coat protein complex, which is essential for its function in vesicle-mediated transport (E2021YIPF5). In β cells, YIPF5 is vital for proinsulin trafficking, and its deficiency can lead to increased ER stress and apoptosis, highlighting its role in β cell function and survival (Pollin2020YIPF5; E2021YIPF5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the YIPF5 gene are linked to a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by neonatal diabetes, severe microcephaly, and epilepsy. These mutations lead to increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a key factor in the pathogenesis of these conditions (E2021YIPF5; De2020YIPF5). The YIPF5 protein is involved in ER-to-Golgi trafficking, and its deficiency results in the retention of proinsulin in the ER, causing marked ER stress and β cell failure (De2020YIPF5). This stress sensitizes β cells to apoptosis, contributing to the development of diabetes (De2020YIPF5).

The mutations in YIPF5 affect various regions of the protein, including the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains, and are predicted to impair protein stability and function (E2021YIPF5). While β cells are highly dependent on YIPF5 for survival and function, α cells can survive without it, highlighting the gene's critical role in β cell health (De2020YIPF5). The study of YIPF5 mutations provides insights into the mechanisms of ER stress-related diseases and underscores the importance of maintaining ER homeostasis for cellular function (Pollin2020YIPF5).

## Interactions
YIPF5, a member of the Yip1 domain family, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in vesicular trafficking. YIPF5 forms a complex with YIF1A, a protein that shares a similar role in maintaining Golgi structure. This complex is essential for the stability of both proteins, as knockdown of YIPF5 affects YIF1A expression and vice versa (Yoshida2008YIPF5). YIPF5 also interacts with components of the COPII vesicle coat protein complex, specifically Sec23 and Sec24, which are critical for ER-to-Golgi transport (Yoshida2008YIPF5; Angelotti2022Exploring).

YIPF5 is part of a complex that includes GOT1A and GOT1B, proteins involved in ER export. This complex is sensitive to the secretion inhibitor FLI-06, indicating a role in a FLI-06-sensitive step of ER export (Cramer2023A). YIPF5's interaction with these proteins suggests its involvement in a feedback mechanism regulating ER export (Cramer2023A).

Additionally, YIPF5 interacts with REEP5, a mammalian ortholog of yeast Yop1p, indicating a conserved function across species (Angelotti2022Exploring). These interactions highlight YIPF5's role in maintaining Golgi structure and function, as well as its involvement in intracellular transport processes.
