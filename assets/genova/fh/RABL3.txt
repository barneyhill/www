# RABL3

## Overview
RABL3 is a gene that encodes the protein RAB, member of RAS oncogene family like 3, which is classified as a small GTPase. This protein is integral to the process of ciliogenesis, particularly in the early stages of primary cilia formation and maturation in human cells. Primary cilia are sensory organelles that play a crucial role in various signaling pathways. The RABL3 protein interacts with RAB11, another small GTPase, to facilitate the formation of ciliary vesicles, which are essential for ciliary membrane assembly. RABL3's localization around the centrosome and its interaction with the Golgi apparatus underscore its importance in the maturation of ciliary structures. The protein's activity is regulated by its GTP-binding state, suggesting a role for guanine nucleotide exchange factors in its activation (Kobayashi2022Atypical).

## Function
RABL3 is a small GTPase that plays a critical role in the early stages of ciliogenesis in human cells. It is essential for the formation and maturation of primary cilia, which are sensory organelles involved in various signaling pathways. RABL3 interacts with the small GTPase RAB11, a protein crucial for ciliary vesicle (CV) formation, and this interaction is vital for RABL3's function in ciliogenesis. RABL3 localizes around the centrosome during early ciliogenesis, co-localizing with RAB11 and the Golgi apparatus, and positively influences CV formation (Kobayashi2022Atypical).

The protein is involved in the removal of CP110 from the mother centriole and the accumulation of GFP-Rabin8 vesicles around the centrosome, processes necessary for the maturation of ciliary vesicles. This maturation involves the loading of ciliary membrane proteins, such as GFP-SMO, which are essential for the assembly of ciliary membrane structures (Kobayashi2022Atypical). RABL3's function is dependent on its GTP-binding state, and it is hypothesized to be activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) at the centrosome to promote CV maturation (Kobayashi2022Atypical).
