# MOB1A

## Overview
MOB1A is a gene that encodes the MOB kinase activator 1A protein, a pivotal component of the Hippo signaling pathway. This pathway is integral to the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and organ size. The MOB1A protein functions primarily as a kinase activator, interacting with large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2) to exert its tumor suppressive effects. Structurally, MOB1A is characterized by a small globular α-helical configuration, with a core domain comprising nine α-helices and a Zn²⁺ ion that is essential for its structural integrity. The protein's activity is modulated through phosphorylation, which influences its interactions with other proteins and its role in the Hippo pathway. Dysregulation of MOB1A, through mutations or altered expression, has been implicated in various cancers, underscoring its significance in cellular architecture and function (Florindo2012Human; Kim2016Structural; Nishio2012Cancer).

## Structure
MOB1A is a small globular α-helical protein involved in the Hippo signaling pathway. Its molecular structure consists of a core domain made up of nine α-helices (H1-H9) and two small β-strands forming a hairpin-like structure. The protein is characterized by a four-helix bundle, with a Zn²⁺ ion coordinated by specific cysteine and histidine residues, which is essential for its structural integrity (Lee2020The; Kim2016Structural).

The N-terminal extension (NTE) of MOB1A plays a crucial role in its function, serving as a docking site for downstream substrates and interacting with other proteins like LATS1 and NDR2. This region is involved in autoinhibition, which is relieved upon phosphorylation at specific threonine residues (T12 and T35), facilitating binding and activation of downstream components (Lee2020The; Kim2016Structural).

MOB1A shares a high sequence identity with its homolog MOB1B, and both proteins are functionally redundant. The phosphorylation of MOB1A is a common post-translational modification that affects its interaction with other proteins and its role in the Hippo pathway (Ni2015Structural; Kim2016Structural).

## Function
MOB1A (MOB kinase activator 1A) is a crucial component of the Hippo signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. In healthy human cells, MOB1A functions as a tumor suppressor by interacting with and activating large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2), which are essential for controlling organ size and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Nishio2012Cancer). MOB1A is involved in the regulation of mitotic exit and cytokinesis, particularly during the abscission phase, where it controls microtubule stability and ensures proper cell division (Florindo2012Human).

MOB1A is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell cycle control by modulating the transition between different phases of the cell cycle. It is necessary for centriole cohesion and is localized to the centrosome, kinetochores, central spindle, and midbody during cell division (Florindo2012Human). The protein's phosphorylation by MST1 and MST2 kinases is a regulatory mechanism that delays mitotic exit, preventing excessive cell proliferation (Praskova2008MOBKL1AMOBKL1B). The loss of MOB1A function can lead to increased cell motility, cytokinesis failure, and tumor development, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular architecture and function (Florindo2012Human; Nishio2012Cancer).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MOB1A gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer development. MOB1A is a critical component of the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. Inactivation or reduced expression of MOB1A is associated with various cancers, including melanoma, breast, colorectal, and non-small-cell lung cancers (Nishio2012Cancer). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), decreased MOB1 expression correlates with poor tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and advanced clinical stages, making it a potential biomarker for PDAC prognosis (Quan2020Lysine).

In liver cancer, particularly combined hepatocellular and cholangiocarcinoma (cHC-CC) and intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC), MOB1A acts as a tumor suppressor. Its deficiency leads to liver tumorigenesis, highlighting its role in maintaining liver cell quiescence (Nishio2015Dysregulated). The loss of MOB1A results in the activation of YAP1, a downstream target, which is a significant driver of liver cancer (Nishio2015Dysregulated).

In glioblastoma, the ubiquitin ligase praja2 targets MOB1 for degradation, attenuating Hippo signaling and promoting tumor growth. This suggests that MOB1A's interaction with praja2 is crucial for maintaining normal cell cycle regulation (Lignitto2013Proteolysis).

## Interactions
MOB1A is a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, interacting with several proteins to regulate cell growth and apoptosis. It acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the activation of LATS1/2 kinases by binding to them and promoting their phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for the tumor suppressive functions of the Hippo pathway (Ni2015Structural; Kulaberoglu2017Stable). MOB1A also interacts with MST1/2 kinases, although stable binding to these kinases is not essential for development and tissue growth control (Kulaberoglu2017Stable).

MOB1A's interaction with LATS1/2 is phosphorylation-dependent, with specific threonine residues on MOB1A being phosphorylated to relieve autoinhibition and enhance binding (Ni2015Structural). The protein also forms complexes with NDR1/2 kinases, with its binding to NDR2 being enhanced by prior phosphorylation by MST1/2 (Kulaberoglu2017Stable).

In the context of pathogenic interactions, the Legionella pneumophila kinase LegK7 exploits MOB1A by phosphorylating it, which activates LegK7's kinase activity. This interaction is characterized by a competitive binding mechanism, where MOB1A acts as an allosteric activator for LegK7, similar to its role with LATS1/2 and NDR1/2 (Lee2020The).
