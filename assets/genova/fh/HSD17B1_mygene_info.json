The encoded protein catalyzes the last step in estrogen activation, using NADPH to convert estrogens E1 and E2 and androgens like 4-androstenedione, to testosterone. It has an N-terminal short-chain dehydrogenase domain with a cofactor binding site, and a narrow, hydrophobic C-terminal domain with a steroid substrate binding site. This gene is expressed primarily in the placenta and ovarian granulosa cells, and to a lesser extent, in the endometrium, adipose tissue, and prostate. Polymorphisms in this gene have been linked to breast and prostate cancer. A pseudogene of this gene has been identified. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
