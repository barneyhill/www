# ARRDC4

## Overview
ARRDC4 (arrestin domain containing 4) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of extracellular vesicle biogenesis, metal ion transport, and glucose metabolism. The protein, also named ARRDC4, is categorized as an arrestin-like adaptor protein, which plays a crucial role in the trafficking and internalization of membrane proteins. It is particularly significant in the male reproductive system, where it aids in sperm maturation by facilitating the release of extracellular vesicles from epididymal epithelial cells. Additionally, ARRDC4 is implicated in the modulation of immune responses, particularly in antiviral defense mechanisms, and has been associated with several clinical conditions, including prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Its diverse functions and interactions underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a biomarker in various diseases (Meng2017ARRDC4; Foot2021Arrdc4‐dependent; Mackenzie2016Regulation; Oh2021ARRDC4).

## Function
ARRDC4 (arrestin domain containing 4) is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the biogenesis and release of extracellular vesicles (EVs). These vesicles are crucial for cell-to-cell communication, especially in the male reproductive system, where they are essential for sperm maturation. ARRDC4 is involved in the production of larger EVs by epididymal epithelial cells, which are necessary for sperm to acquire motility and fertilization capabilities as they pass through the epididymis (Foot2021Arrdc4‐dependent).

In addition to its role in reproductive biology, ARRDC4 is implicated in the regulation of the divalent metal ion transporter DMT1. It acts as an adaptor for Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases, facilitating the release of DMT1 in EVs, which is important for metal ion transport and homeostasis (Mackenzie2016Regulation). ARRDC4 also participates in glucose metabolism by inhibiting glucose uptake through its arrestin-like domains (Meng2017ARRDC4).

ARRDC4 is active in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it influences cellular responses and maintains homeostasis by interacting with membrane proteins and facilitating their internalization and degradation (Meng2017ARRDC4).

## Clinical Significance
ARRDC4 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling and protein trafficking. In prostate cancer, alterations in ARRDC4 expression are associated with tumor aggressiveness. Knockdown studies in prostate cancer cell lines have shown that reduced ARRDC4 expression can inhibit cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker for aggressive prostate cancer (Oh2021ARRDC4).

In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), ARRDC4 has been identified as a potential biomarker. Studies have shown that ARRDC4 expression is decreased in insulin-resistant mice, and it is associated with immune cell infiltration, indicating a role in immune response modulation in T2D (Liu2024Identification).

ARRDC4 is also linked to congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). A minimally deleted region containing only ARRDC4 was identified in an infant with a small 15q26 deletion, and a unique nucleotide substitution in ARRDC4 was found in another CDH case, though its causal role remains unclear (Clugston2008Gene).

Additionally, ARRDC4 is involved in energy metabolism, as it inhibits glucose uptake in adipocytes, which may contribute to insulin resistance (Irvin2011Genes).

## Interactions
ARRDC4 interacts with MDA5, a key protein in the antiviral immune response, through its arrestin-like N domain. This interaction is crucial for the innate immune response to Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. ARRDC4 facilitates the K63 polyubiquitination of MDA5 via the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM65, enhancing the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, which are involved in the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Meng2017ARRDC4).

ARRDC4 also acts as an adaptor, promoting the interaction between MDA5 and TRIM65, which is essential for MDA5 oligomerization and activation (Meng2017ARRDC4). The PY motif of ARRDC4 is important for interactions with WW domain-containing proteins, such as ubiquitin ligases like Nedd4 (Meng2017ARRDC4).

In the context of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) trafficking, ARRDC4 is localized on the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles and can co-immunoprecipitate with the V2 vasopressin receptor and endogenous β-arrestins, indicating potential interactions independent of receptor activation (Kang2014Role). However, ARRDC4 did not show detectable interactions with ESCRT components or HECT ubiquitin ligases in certain experimental conditions (Rauch2011Multiple).
