# PTGES3

## Overview
PTGES3, also known as p23, is a gene that encodes the protein prostaglandin E synthase 3, which functions as a co-chaperone within the HSP90 complex. This protein plays a critical role in protein folding and stabilization, particularly influencing the activity of steroid hormone receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Sinclair2013Dysregulation; Patwardhan2013Gedunin). PTGES3 is characterized by the presence of a CS domain, essential for its interaction with HSP90, and it is involved in various cellular processes, including stress response and protein folding (Patel2015Altered). Additionally, PTGES3 has been implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and macrophage migration, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular function (de2021P23). Clinically, PTGES3 is associated with several diseases, including cancer and autism spectrum disorder, where its expression levels can influence disease prognosis and therapeutic responses (Wang2023Comprehensive; Patel2015Altered).

## Structure
PTGES3, also known as p23, is a co-chaperone protein associated with the HSP90 complex. The primary structure of PTGES3 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the PTGES3 gene. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of PTGES3 involves the overall 3D folding, forming a globular shape that is essential for its interaction with other proteins. PTGES3 functions as a monomer and therefore lacks a quaternary structure.

A significant feature of PTGES3 is the presence of a CS domain, which is crucial for its interaction with the HSP90 complex. This domain plays a vital role in the protein's function as a co-chaperone, assisting in the stabilization and hormone-binding potential of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)/HSP90 complex in the cytosol (Patel2015Altered). Common post-translational modifications of PTGES3 include phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of PTGES3 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties and interactions within the cell. These structural features enable PTGES3 to perform its role in various cellular processes, including stress response and protein folding.

## Clinical Significance
PTGES3, also known as p23, has significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly cancer. Alterations in PTGES3 expression are associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), esophageal cancer, mesothelioma, and lung adenocarcinoma, while it is linked to a favorable prognosis in colorectal and ovarian cancers (Wang2023Comprehensive). In breast cancer, PTGES3 is part of a six-gene signature that correlates with higher risk scores and poorer prognosis. Its expression is elevated in breast cancer tissues, and its knockdown reduces cell viability and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yin2024The).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), PTGES3 mRNA levels are significantly increased, which may contribute to dysregulated stress responses due to its role in glucocorticoid receptor regulation (Patel2015Altered). PTGES3 also influences the tumor immune microenvironment, affecting immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, which can impact responses to immunotherapy (Wang2023Comprehensive). These findings highlight PTGES3's role in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PTGES3, also known as p23, is a co-chaperone protein that interacts with the Hsp90 complex, playing a crucial role in protein folding and stabilization. It directly binds to Hsp90, influencing the stability and function of various client proteins, including steroid hormone receptors like the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Sinclair2013Dysregulation; Patwardhan2013Gedunin). PTGES3 stabilizes the GR-Hsp90 complex in the cytoplasm and also acts in the nucleus to inhibit GR-mediated gene transcription (Sinclair2013Dysregulation).

PTGES3 interacts with gedunin, a natural product that inactivates PTGES3, leading to the disruption of the Hsp90 chaperoning machinery and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. Gedunin binds to specific amino acids on PTGES3, altering its interaction with Hsp90 and affecting the stability of the p23-Hsp90 complex (Patwardhan2013Gedunin).

PTGES3 also functions as an RNA-binding protein, interacting with mRNA, such as Kif15 mRNA, which affects mRNA stability and macrophage migration. This interaction is modulated in response to inflammatory stimuli like lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (de2021P23). PTGES3's interaction with casein kinase 2 (CK2) and HSP90 is enhanced in LPS-stimulated cells, leading to increased enzymatic activity and prostaglandin E2 production (de2021P23).
