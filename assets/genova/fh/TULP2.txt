# TULP2

## Overview
TULP2, or Tubby Like Protein 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the tubby-like protein family, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of male fertility. The protein encoded by TULP2 is primarily associated with spermatid differentiation and sperm motility, playing a critical role in spermiogenesis. As a cytoplasmic protein, TULP2 interacts with other proteins such as CCT8, which is essential for its proper folding and function. The regulation of TULP2 involves post-translational modifications, including acetylation and ubiquitination, which influence its stability and degradation. Mutations in the TULP2 gene have been linked to male infertility and are also being investigated for potential associations with ocular diseases, given its expression in the retina and its chromosomal location (Zheng2021TULP2; North1997Molecular; Kerek2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TULP2 gene have been associated with male infertility, particularly affecting spermatid differentiation and sperm motility. Research has identified three potentially deleterious missense mutations in TULP2 in patients with dyszoospermia, suggesting a link between these mutations and male reproductive issues (Zheng2021TULP2). TULP2 knockout mice exhibit male sterility due to increased apoptosis of elongated spermatids, restricted spermatid release, and abnormal differentiation, leading to defective sperm tail structures and reduced ATP content, which affects sperm motility (Zheng2021TULP2). These findings indicate that TULP2 is crucial for maintaining male fertility and that its disruption can lead to conditions such as oligoastheno-teratozoospermia, characterized by reduced sperm count, motility, and structural defects (Zheng2021TULP2).

In addition to its role in male fertility, TULP2 has been implicated in ocular diseases. It is expressed in the retina and maps to chromosome 19q13.1, a region linked to cone-rod dystrophy, suggesting that mutations in TULP2 could be candidates for diseases exhibiting similar phenotypes to tubby, such as progressive retinal degeneration (North1997Molecular). However, the clinical significance of TULP2 gene mutations in human diseases requires further investigation.

## Interactions
TULP2, a member of the tubby-like protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in spermatid differentiation and male fertility. TULP2 interacts with CCT8 (T-complex protein 1 subunit theta), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells and wild-type mice testis. This interaction suggests that TULP2 may be recognized by CCT8 and correctly folded by the CCT complex to function in spermiogenesis (Zheng2021TULP2).

The regulation of TULP2 is influenced by acetylation and ubiquitination processes. Acetylation of TULP2 by p300 increases its protein levels, while treatment with C646, an inhibitor of p300, reduces TULP2 levels. This indicates that p300 plays a significant role in the stability of TULP2. TULP2 is also subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, as treatment with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, increases its levels (Kerek2021A).

These interactions and regulatory mechanisms highlight the complex role of TULP2 in cellular processes related to male fertility, particularly in the context of spermatid differentiation and sperm quality.
