# CD33

## Overview
CD33 is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, also known as Siglec-3, which is part of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) family. The CD33 protein is primarily expressed on myeloid cells, including microglia in the central nervous system, and functions as an inhibitory receptor. It plays a significant role in immune regulation by modulating immune responses through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which recruit SHP family phosphatases to suppress signaling pathways and inhibit immune cell activation (Macauley2014Siglec-mediated; Smith2021The). CD33 is involved in distinguishing 'self' from 'non-self' by recognizing sialylated glycans, thereby preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Macauley2014Siglec-mediated). The gene is clinically significant due to its association with diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), where variations in CD33 expression and genetic mutations can influence disease progression and treatment outcomes (Estus2019Evaluation; Molica2021CD33).

## Structure
The CD33 protein, also known as Siglec-3, is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) family. It is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein characterized by having two immunoglobulin (Ig)-like extracellular domains: a V-set domain and a C2-set domain (Freeman1995Characterization; Taylor1999The). The V-set domain is involved in sialic acid binding and contains conserved aromatic residues and an arginine motif (Perez-Oliva2011Epitope). The cytoplasmic tail of CD33 includes two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are crucial for its role in inhibitory signaling (Taylor1999The).

CD33 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which affects its molecular weight and antibody recognition (Perez-Oliva2011Epitope). The protein exists in two isoforms, CD33M and CD33m, generated by alternative splicing. CD33M is the full-length isoform, while CD33m lacks the V-Ig-like domain, affecting its ligand-binding capabilities (Perez-Oliva2011Epitope; Hernández-Caselles2006A). Both isoforms are expressed on the cell membrane and within the Golgi compartment, suggesting a role in immune regulation (Perez-Oliva2011Epitope). The presence of these isoforms indicates a complex regulatory mechanism for CD33 in immune functions.

## Function
CD33, also known as Siglec-3, is a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin primarily expressed on myeloid cells, including microglia in the central nervous system. It functions as an inhibitory receptor, playing a crucial role in immune homeostasis by modulating immune responses. CD33 achieves this by recruiting SHP family phosphatases to its immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which suppresses other signaling pathways and inhibits immune cell activation (Macauley2014Siglec-mediated; Smith2021The).

In healthy human cells, CD33 is involved in regulating phagocytosis, cytokine production, and cell adhesion. It helps distinguish 'self' from 'non-self' by recognizing sialylated glycans, which are markers of self, thus preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Macauley2014Siglec-mediated). CD33's inhibitory signaling is crucial for maintaining immune balance and preventing overactivation of immune cells (Smith2021The).

In the context of neurodegeneration, CD33 is expressed on microglial cells and is associated with Alzheimer's disease. It negatively regulates microglial phagocytosis of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, suggesting a role in modulating microglial activity to prevent excessive inflammation (Macauley2014Siglec-mediated; Malik2013CD33).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD33 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AML, the CD33 antigen is expressed on the majority of leukemic cells, with 85-90% of adult and pediatric cases being CD33-positive. High levels of CD33 expression in AML are linked to specific genetic mutations, such as FLT3-ITD and NPM1, and are associated with intermediate cytogenetic risk. Conversely, lower CD33 expression is linked to adverse risk (Molica2021CD33). The expression levels of CD33 can influence the efficacy of treatments like gemtuzumab ozogamicin, with certain genetic variations, such as the rs12459419 SNP, affecting patient outcomes (Molica2021CD33).

In Alzheimer's disease, the CD33 gene is implicated through its genetic variations, particularly the rs3865444 allele. This allele is associated with reduced CD33 expression and a decreased risk of AD. The minor allele of rs3865444 increases the proportion of a CD33 isoform lacking exon 2, which affects microglial function and is linked to a lower amyloid burden in the brain (Estus2019Evaluation; Malik2013CD33). These findings suggest that CD33 genetic variations can modulate microglial activity and influence AD pathology (Walker2015Association).

## Interactions
CD33, a myeloid-specific sialic acid-binding receptor, interacts with protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 through its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in the cytoplasmic tail. These interactions are crucial for CD33's function as an inhibitory receptor. The phosphorylation of CD33, particularly at tyrosine residues Y340 and Y358, facilitates the recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2. SHP-1 shows a higher affinity for the phosphorylated Y340 site, primarily through its amino-terminal SH2 domain, while SHP-2 can bind to both Y340 and Y358, although with varying affinities (Paul2000Myeloid; Taylor1999The).

The interaction with SHP-1 is significant for CD33's inhibitory role, as it can downregulate cell activation processes, such as CD64-induced calcium mobilization in myeloid cells (Paul2000Myeloid). CD33's phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 are mediated by Src family kinases, with Lck preferentially phosphorylating Y340 (Paul2000Myeloid). These interactions suggest that CD33 modulates immune cell signaling by acting as an inhibitory receptor, similar to CD22 in B cells (Taylor1999The).
