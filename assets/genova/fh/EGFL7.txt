# EGFL7

## Overview
EGFL7, or epidermal growth factor-like domain multiple 7, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and vascular development. The protein, also referred to as epidermal growth factor-like protein 7, is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal signal peptide, a cysteine-rich EMI domain, and two EGF-like repeat domains. These domains facilitate its interactions with the extracellular matrix and cell surface receptors, playing a crucial role in endothelial cell function and blood vessel formation (Heissig2021The; Hong2018EGFL7:). EGFL7 is primarily expressed in endothelial cells and is integral to various signaling pathways, such as Notch and integrin, which are essential for cell migration, adhesion, and survival (Nikolic2010EGFL7; Hong2018EGFL7:). The protein's involvement in angiogenesis and its implications in cancer progression underscore its significance in both physiological and pathological processes (de2023Low; Hong2018EGFL7:).

## Structure
EGFL7, also known as VE-STATIN, is a protein encoded by the EGFL7 gene, located on chromosome 9 in humans. The human EGFL7 protein is 29.6 kDa and consists of 273 amino acids (Hong2018EGFL7:). Structurally, EGFL7 contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a cysteine-rich EMI domain, and two centrally located EGF-like repeat domains. These EGF-like domains include regions homologous to the Delta-Serrate-LAG-2 (DSL) domain, which interacts with the Notch receptor, and another domain that binds to ionic calcium, inducing structural changes (Heissig2021The; Hong2018EGFL7:). The protein also features a cell attachment site known as the RGD motif and a coiled coil region (Hong2018EGFL7:).

EGFL7 is known to form oligomers and can be deposited in the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Heissig2021The). It shares sequence similarities with secreted and ECM-bound proteins like EMILIN and laminin, indicating its role in vascular development and endothelial cell function (Hong2018EGFL7:). The protein's structure was modeled using I-TASSER and refined with DeepView Swiss-Pdb Viewer, visualized via Protean 3D software (Hong2018EGFL7:). EGFL7 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and stability.

## Function
EGFL7, also known as epidermal growth factor-like domain-containing protein 7, is a critical regulator of angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation. It is primarily expressed in endothelial cells and plays a significant role in vascular development during embryogenesis and organogenesis. EGFL7 modulates several key signaling pathways, including Notch, integrin, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) cascades, which are essential for endothelial cell migration, adhesion, and survival (Hong2018EGFL7:).

EGFL7 contains structural domains such as an N-terminal signal peptide, a cysteine-rich EMI domain, and two EGF-like repeat domains, which facilitate its interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell surface receptors (Hong2018EGFL7:). It binds to integrins, such as αvβ3, activating signaling pathways like ERK1/2 and STAT3, which are crucial for endothelial cell migration and vessel formation (Hong2018EGFL7:). EGFL7 also interacts with the Notch signaling pathway, modulating angiogenesis by binding to Notch receptors and influencing their activation (Nikolic2010EGFL7).

In addition to its role in angiogenesis, EGFL7 is involved in maintaining endothelial cell homeostasis and protecting these cells from stress-induced apoptosis (Johnson2013AntiEGFL7). It is also implicated in the regulation of placental vascularization and embryonic development, highlighting its importance in various physiological processes (Hong2018EGFL7:).

## Clinical Significance
EGFL7 is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), low EGFL7 expression is associated with increased lymph node spread and lymphatic vessel invasion, suggesting a role in cancer progression. However, it does not significantly impact overall survival (de2023Low). High EGFL7 expression is linked to poor prognosis in several tumors, including malignant gliomas, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it promotes metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through pathways like EGFR-Akt-Snail (Luo2014Epidermal; Hong2018EGFL7:).

EGFL7 also plays a role in angiogenesis, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. It is involved in pathways such as PI3K/Akt and MAPK, which are crucial for cancer pathogenesis (Shi2020A; Hong2018EGFL7:). In pancreatic and breast cancers, EGFL7 is associated with poor survival and increased tumor growth, respectively (Hong2018EGFL7:). Despite its potential as a therapeutic target, anti-EGFL7 therapies have shown limited efficacy in clinical trials, indicating challenges in targeting this gene for cancer treatment (de2023Low).

## Interactions
EGFL7, or epidermal growth factor-like protein 7, engages in several significant physical interactions with other proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It binds to integrins, particularly ITGAV:ITGB3, through its RGD domain, which leads to FAK autophosphorylation and competes with extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules like fibronectin, MMP2, and collagen IV for integrin binding (Heissig2021The). This interaction is crucial for endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, as it activates signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 and STAT3 (Hong2018EGFL7:).

EGFL7 also interacts with the Notch signaling pathway by binding to Notch receptors 1-4 and Notch ligands DLL4 and Jag1 through its Emilin-like region, thereby suppressing Notch signaling and reducing transcription of Hey1/2 and Hes1 (Nikolic2010EGFL7; Heissig2021The). This interaction affects the formation and sprouting of endothelial tip cells, essential for blood vessel formation (Hong2018EGFL7:).

Additionally, EGFL7 binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), activating signaling pathways such as ERK and AKT, which enhances cell migration and metastasis in certain cancer cells (Heissig2021The). It also interacts with lysyl oxidase (LOX) and LOXL2, influencing ECM stiffness and endothelial adhesion molecule expression (Heissig2021The).
