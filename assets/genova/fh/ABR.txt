# ABR

## Overview
The ABR gene encodes the ABR activator of RhoGEF and GTPase, a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins. This protein is characterized by its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity and is homologous to the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) protein, although it lacks the serine/threonine kinase domain found in BCR, indicating distinct cellular functions (Heisterkamp1993Human; Tan1993The). The ABR protein contains a Dbl-homology (DH) domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which are involved in stimulating guanine nucleotide binding to Rho family proteins, specifically Rac1, Rac2, and CDC42Hs (Chuang1995Abr; Cho2007Abr). Predominantly expressed in the brain, the ABR protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression (Chuang1995Abr; Tan1993The). Its dual regulatory mechanism, involving both GAP and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains, allows it to coordinate the activation and inactivation of different Rho family proteins, potentially influencing cytoskeletal events involved in cell migration, mitosis, or neuronal development (Chuang1995Abr). The ABR gene has also been implicated in tumor suppression, with its deletion observed in several solid tumors and its expression levels correlating with clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (Namasu2017ABR).

## Structure
The ABR protein is characterized by its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity and shares significant homology with the BCR protein, with 68% identical amino acid residues over 813 positions (Heisterkamp1993Human; Tan1993The). The ABR protein contains a GAP domain, which is crucial for its function, and a Dbl-homology (DH) domain that stimulates guanine nucleotide binding to Rho family proteins (Chuang1995Abr; Cho2007Abr). The protein also includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is part of the tandem DH-PH domain structure (Cho2007Abr).

ABR lacks the serine/threonine kinase domain present in BCR, indicating distinct cellular functions (Heisterkamp1993Human). The protein is expressed in two isoforms, with predicted molecular masses of 93.5 kDa and 92.3 kDa, differing in their 5' coding sequences (Heisterkamp1993Human). The ABR protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, with weaker expression in other tissues such as the heart, lung, and muscle (Tan1993The). The protein's GAP activity is specific for Rac1 and Cdc42Hs, but not RhoA, and is comparable to that of p190 GAP (Heisterkamp1993Human; Tan1993The).

## Function
The ABR gene encodes a protein that functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and is involved in the regulation of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins, specifically Rac1, Rac2, and CDC42Hs, but not RhoA, Rap1A, or Ha-Ras (Chuang1995Abr). The ABR protein is homologous to the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) protein and shares similar functions, including stimulating the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42Hs and Rac1, which are crucial for various cellular processes such as signal transduction pathways (Tan1993The).

In healthy human cells, the ABR protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, with weaker expression in the heart, lung, and muscle, indicating its significant role in neural functions (Tan1993The). The protein's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and cell cycle progression (Chuang1995Abr). The ABR protein's dual regulatory mechanism, involving both GAP and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains, allows it to coordinate the activation and inactivation of different Rho family proteins, potentially influencing cytoskeletal events involved in cell migration, mitosis, or neuronal development (Chuang1995Abr).

## Clinical Significance
The ABR gene is implicated in various diseases, particularly in its role as a tumor suppressor. In several solid tumors, such as medulloblastoma, astrocytomas, and breast cancer, the deletion of the ABR gene has been observed, suggesting its involvement in tumor suppression (Namasu2017ABR). In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ABR expression is notably repressed at diagnosis compared to healthy controls. High expression of ABR in AML patients is associated with improved outcomes, including longer overall survival and better response to azacitidine therapy (Namasu2017ABR). The gene contributes to myeloid differentiation by regulating the transcription factor C/EBPα, which is crucial for this process and often impaired in leukemia. Inhibition of ABR expression leads to reduced C/EBPα levels and impaired myeloid differentiation, while overexpression enhances differentiation (Namasu2017ABR). Additionally, ABR negatively regulates RAC1, a protein overexpressed in AML, and its inhibition leads to increased C/EBPα expression (Namasu2017ABR). Low ABR expression is associated with mutations in the NPM1 gene, correlating with worse clinical outcomes in AML (Namasu2017ABR). These findings suggest that ABR has significant tumor suppressor potential and could be targeted in therapeutic strategies for leukemia.

## Interactions
The ABR protein, a rho-regulating protein, is known to interact with several members of the Rho family of GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, Rac2, Rac3, and Cdc42. These interactions have been confirmed through immunoprecipitation studies and Western blot analysis, which demonstrated detectable bands for these GTPases in ABR-overexpressing osteoclasts, indicating strong interactions (Farhana2023Abr). The ABR protein contains both a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain and a Dbl-homology domain, which exhibit distinct functional specificities. The GAP domain is active on Rac1, Rac2, and CDC42Hs, but not on RhoA, Ras, or Rap1A, suggesting a specific substrate preference (Chuang1995Abr). The Dbl-homology domain stimulates guanine nucleotide binding to Rho family proteins, with the highest activity toward CDC42Hs and RhoA (Chuang1995Abr).

ABR also interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), a protein involved in the catabolism of poly(ADP-ribose) to ADP-ribose. This interaction was confirmed through SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, identifying a 110 kDa protein band as PARG. The interaction with PARG suggests a role in modulating osteoclastogenesis by enhancing lamellipodia formation (Farhana2023Abr).
