# VIL1

## Overview
The VIL1 gene encodes villin 1, a multifunctional actin-binding protein predominantly expressed in the microvilli of epithelial cells, particularly within the intestinal and renal systems. Villin 1 is categorized as an actin-modulating protein due to its ability to sever, cap, nucleate, and bundle actin filaments, activities that are finely regulated by calcium levels and tyrosine phosphorylation (Ferrary1999In; Khurana2008Regulation). The protein's structural complexity, featuring six homologous gelsolin-like domains and a C-terminal headpiece domain, underpins its diverse functional capabilities (Ghoshdastider2013The; Arango2012Villin). Villin 1 plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and absorptive function of epithelial cells by facilitating the assembly and maintenance of the brush border (George2007Dimerization). Additionally, it contributes to cell survival and homeostasis, acting as an anti-apoptotic factor and influencing cellular pathways that maintain mitochondrial integrity (Wang2008A; Khurana2008Regulation). The clinical significance of VIL1 is underscored by its altered expression in various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases, where it serves as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target (VanDussen2018Abnormal; Xu2020Transcriptome).

## Structure
Villin 1 (VIL1) is a protein characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes six homologous gelsolin-like domains and a C-terminal headpiece domain. These gelsolin-like domains are approximately 120 amino acids in length and share about 45% sequence identity, contributing to the protein's ability to bind and modulate actin filaments (Arango2012Villin). The headpiece domain is crucial for actin-binding and contains a prominent villin headpiece fold, which is essential for its actin-bundling function (Ghoshdastider2013The).

The protein's structure is organized into two tandem homologous halves, each consisting of three gelsolin homology (GH) domains, which are believed to have evolved through gene triplication and duplication events (Ghoshdastider2013The). Villin's ability to sever, cap, nucleate, and bundle actin filaments is attributed to these structural features (George2007Dimerization).

Villin can form dimers, which are essential for its actin-bundling function. This dimerization occurs through specific sites within the amino-terminal domain, and the presence of dimers is crucial for the protein's role in microvilli assembly (George2007Dimerization). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity (Arango2012Villin). Multiple splice variants of VIL1 exist, contributing to its functional diversity (Arango2012Villin).

## Function
Villin 1, encoded by the VIL1 gene, is a critical actin-binding protein involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics within epithelial cells. It is predominantly active in the microvilli of intestinal and renal epithelial cells, where it plays a vital role in maintaining cell structure and function. Villin 1 exhibits multiple molecular activities, including actin filament severing, capping, nucleating, and bundling, which are regulated by calcium concentration and tyrosine phosphorylation (Ferrary1999In; Khurana2008Regulation).

In healthy human cells, villin 1 is essential for the assembly and maintenance of the brush border, a specialized structure that enhances the absorptive capacity of epithelial cells. It facilitates the formation of organized actin structures necessary for the absorptive functions of tissues (George2007Dimerization). Villin 1 also plays a role in cell survival and homeostasis by acting as an anti-apoptotic protein, maintaining mitochondrial integrity, and inhibiting the activation of apoptotic pathways (Wang2008A; Khurana2008Regulation).

Villin 1's interaction with actin and its modulation by calcium and phosphorylation are crucial for its functions in cell migration and epithelial cell morphology, contributing to the overall structural and functional integrity of epithelial tissues (Wang2008A; Khurana2008Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
The VIL1 gene, encoding the villin 1 protein, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its altered expression levels. In cervical adenocarcinoma, VIL1 is notably overexpressed, correlating with the presence of HPV18 E7, and is suggested as a potential diagnostic marker for cases with poor radioresponse. Its overexpression is linked to its function as an anti-apoptotic protein, maintaining mitochondrial integrity and influencing pathways like phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphorylated Akt, which are involved in cell survival (Xu2020Transcriptome).

In contrast, VIL1 expression is decreased in Crohn's Disease (CD), where it is associated with reduced microvilli length in the ileum. This decrease suggests a potential alteration in microvilli rootlet actin bundling, contributing to the structural defects observed in the intestinal epithelium of CD patients. The reduced expression of VIL1 and related genes in CD is linked to the chronic nature of the disease, as these alterations may impact the functional capacity of enterocytes, leading to epithelial malfunction (VanDussen2018Abnormal).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of VIL1 in both cancer and inflammatory bowel diseases, where its expression levels and interactions play crucial roles in disease pathology.

## Interactions
Villin 1 (VIL1) is an actin-binding protein that participates in various interactions influencing actin filament dynamics. It interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which modulates its actin-severing and bundling activities. Villin has a higher affinity for PIP2 than phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-γ1), potentially inhibiting PLC-γ1 activity (Khurana2008Regulation). Tyrosine phosphorylation of villin, regulated by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-src, decreases its affinity for F-actin and alters its interaction with PIP2 and PLC-γ1. This phosphorylation is crucial for villin's role in cell migration and actin depolymerization (Khurana2008Regulation).

Villin also interacts with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which competes with PIP2 for binding sites and inhibits all actin regulatory functions of villin (Khurana2008Regulation). The protein's ability to form dimers is essential for its actin-bundling function, with a specific amino-terminal dimerization site facilitating this self-association (George2007Dimerization). These interactions are critical for villin's role in organizing actin filaments into ordered bundles, particularly in the microvilli of epithelial cells (Khurana2008Regulation).
