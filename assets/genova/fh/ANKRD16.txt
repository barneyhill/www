# ANKRD16

## Overview
ANKRD16 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 16 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, contributing to the protein's role in cellular signaling and structural integrity (Vo2018ANKRD16; Rubio2020Aminoacyl-tRNA). The ankyrin repeat domain 16 protein functions as an editing co-factor, particularly interacting with alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) to enhance translational fidelity by preventing the misincorporation of serine during protein synthesis. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proteostasis and preventing neurodegeneration, especially in neurons (Vo2018ANKRD16). ANKRD16 is vertebrate-specific and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control, with implications in various clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases, IgA nephropathy, and breast cancer susceptibility (Jeong2019Genomewide; Zheng2013Fine).

## Structure
ANKRD16 encodes a protein characterized by nine ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Vo2018ANKRD16). These motifs typically form a helix-turn-helix structure, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) forms a concave surface that facilitates protein-protein interactions, while the convex surface provides structural stability (Chakrabarty2022Sequence). The tertiary structure of ANKRD16 is likely influenced by the arrangement of these repeats, potentially forming a solenoid shape, although specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

The protein interacts specifically with the catalytic domain of alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), preventing serine misincorporation and enhancing translational fidelity (Vo2018ANKRD16; Rubio2020Aminoacyl-tRNA). ANKRD16's interaction with AlaRS is direct and specific, involving lysine residues that accept misactivated serine (Vo2018ANKRD16). The presence of a cryptic exon in certain strains leads to a premature stop codon, affecting the expression of ANKRD16 and its splice variant isoforms (Vo2018ANKRD16). However, detailed information on post-translational modifications is not provided in the context.

## Function
ANKRD16 encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the fidelity of protein synthesis by interacting with alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS). This interaction is crucial for preventing the misincorporation of serine in place of alanine during protein synthesis, which can lead to toxic protein misfolding and neuron loss. ANKRD16 acts as an editing co-factor, capturing misactivated serine and removing it from the pool available for protein synthesis, thereby enhancing the translational fidelity of AlaRS (Vo2018ANKRD16).

The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control. ANKRD16's function is particularly important in neurons, where it helps prevent neurodegeneration by reducing the formation of misfolded protein aggregates and maintaining proteostasis (Vo2018ANKRD16). The protein's role in modulating serine-dependent ATPase activity in AlaRS mutants further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular health (Vo2018ANKRD16).

ANKRD16 is a vertebrate-specific protein containing ankyrin repeats, which facilitate its protein-protein interactions, crucial for its function in cellular signaling and structural integrity (Rubio2020Aminoacyl-tRNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANKRD16 gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative conditions. ANKRD16 plays a crucial role in preventing neuron loss by interacting with alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS) to reduce the misincorporation of serine, which can lead to neurodegeneration. In mice with a mutation in the editing domain of AlaRS, known as sticky (sti) mutant mice, the absence of ANKRD16 results in extensive neurodegeneration, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells, and early embryonic lethality (Vo2018ANKRD16). The gene's protective role against mistranslation is dose-dependent, and its loss can lead to the formation of protein aggregates and neuron death (Martin2020Overlapping; Vo2018ANKRD16).

ANKRD16 has also been associated with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in a Korean population. A genome-wide association study identified a significant association between the SNP rs2296136 in the ANKRD16 gene and IgAN, suggesting that this SNP could serve as a candidate marker for predicting IgAN susceptibility (Jeong2019Genomewide).

Additionally, ANKRD16 has been implicated in breast cancer susceptibility. A study identified SNP rs11255602 in the 3′ untranslated region of ANKRD16 as significantly associated with breast cancer risk in women of African ancestry (Zheng2013Fine).

## Interactions
ANKRD16 is known to interact specifically with alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS), a crucial interaction that enhances translational fidelity by reducing the misincorporation of serine into proteins. This interaction is direct and specific, as ANKRD16 does not bind to other tRNA synthetases such as tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase or tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (Vo2018ANKRD16). ANKRD16 binds to the aminoacylation domain of AlaRS, influencing its function by enhancing pre-transfer editing and restoring serine-dependent ATPase activity in AlaRS mutants (Vo2018ANKRD16). 

ANKRD16 also plays a role in capturing misactivated serine, preventing its incorporation into proteins, which is crucial for maintaining translation fidelity and proteostasis in neurons (Vo2018ANKRD16). The interaction between ANKRD16 and AlaRS involves specific lysine residues in ANKRD16 that accept misactivated serine, and mutations in these residues result in a loss of function (Vo2018ANKRD16). This interaction is vital for protecting against mistranslation and subsequent neurodegeneration, as demonstrated in studies involving Ankrd16 deletion in mice (Vo2018ANKRD16).
