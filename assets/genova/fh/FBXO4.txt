# FBXO4

## Overview
FBXO4 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 4, a crucial component of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is responsible for targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and genomic stability. The F-box protein 4 is characterized by its F-box domain, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins within the SCF complex, and its function as a tumor suppressor. It is involved in the degradation of key regulatory proteins, including cyclin D1 and Trf1, and its activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Mutations or dysregulation of FBXO4 have been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Qie2022The).

## Structure
The FBXO4 protein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is part of the SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box) complex, which targets proteins for degradation. Structurally, FBXO4 consists of several distinct domains: a dimerization domain (D domain), an F-box domain, a linker region, and a substrate binding domain (Qie2022The). The F-box domain is crucial for forming the SCF complex, facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for its function (Uddin2016Involvement). The protein is inactive in its monomeric form and requires dimerization for activity, which is facilitated by a connecting loop between the linker region and substrate binding domain (Qie2022The).

FBXO4 has four isoforms: α, β, γ, and δ. The α isoform is primarily cytoplasmic, while the others are found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Qie2022The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), are essential for its activation, particularly at specific serine residues (Qie2022The). This phosphorylation promotes dimerization, which is necessary for its E3 ligase activity (Qie2022The). Mutations in the dimerization and F-box domains can lead to a loss of function, impacting its role as a tumor suppressor (Qie2022The).

## Function
FBXO4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in protein degradation pathways, particularly through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In healthy human cells, FBXO4 is involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression by targeting cyclin D1 for degradation. Cyclin D1 is a key regulator of the cell cycle, and its degradation by FBXO4 prevents its accumulation, thereby maintaining normal cell proliferation and preventing oncogenic transformation (Qie2022The). FBXO4 facilitates the poly-ubiquitylation of cyclin D1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation, which is essential for the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase of the cell cycle (Qie2022The).

FBXO4 also interacts with other proteins such as Trf1, a component of the shelterin complex, which is crucial for telomere maintenance and genomic stability (Qie2022The). Additionally, FBXO4 is implicated in the regulation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, by mediating its ubiquitylation and degradation (Qie2022The). The activity of FBXO4 is dependent on its phosphorylation and the formation of a complex with S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 and Cullin1 (Qie2022The). These functions underscore FBXO4's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FBXO4 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. FBXO4 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating the degradation of oncogenic proteins such as cyclin D1 and Fxr1. Loss of FBXO4 expression or function can lead to the accumulation of these proteins, contributing to tumorigenesis. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), reduced FBXO4 levels correlate with increased Fxr1 expression, promoting cancer progression (Qie2017Fbxo4mediated). 

FBXO4 mutations have been identified in various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and melanoma, where they disrupt its tumor suppressor activities (Qie2022The). These mutations can affect the gene's ability to form the SCF complex, leading to the stabilization of cyclin D1 and other oncogenic substrates, thereby facilitating cancer development (Qie2022The). 

In breast cancer, low levels of FBXO4 are associated with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Qie2022The). FBXO4's role in regulating cell cycle progression and genomic stability underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Qie2022The).

## Interactions
FBXO4 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in their ubiquitylation and degradation. It forms a complex with αB-crystallin and cyclin D1, facilitating the ubiquitylation and turnover of cyclin D1. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286 by GSK-3β, which is essential for its degradation (Lin2006PhosphorylationDependent; Qie2016Cyclin). FBXO4 also interacts with Fxr1, a member of the fragile X-related protein family, through its C-terminus. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitylation and degradation of Fxr1, with specific amino acids in FBXO4 (Glu-379, -380, and Ile-377) and Fxr1 (Val-178) being essential for their binding (Qie2017Fbxo4mediated; Qie2022The).

FBXO4 is involved in the degradation of Mcl-1, a pro-survival factor, which increases sensitivity to apoptotic inducers in non-small cell lung cancer cells (Qie2022The). It also binds to the intracellular region of ICAM-1, leading to its ubiquitylation and degradation, which is significant in tumor development and progression (Qie2022The). Additionally, FBXO4 interacts with the telomeric protein Trf1, a key component of the shelterin complex, affecting telomere maintenance (Qie2022The). These interactions underscore FBXO4's role in regulating cell cycle progression, proliferation, survival/apoptosis, and migration/invasion, supporting its classification as a tumor suppressor (Qie2022The).
