# FAM133A

## Overview
FAM133A is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 133 member A. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including those related to immune function and apoptosis, and is categorized as a non-kinase protein. The gene has garnered attention due to its significant role in the pathogenesis of several cancers, such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma, low-grade gliomas, multiple myeloma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. FAM133A's expression levels have been linked to tumor progression, metastasis, and patient prognosis, making it a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment strategies (Teng2022Recurrence; Wang2020Clinical; Yu2022An; Bai2021Integrating).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FAM133A has been implicated in several cancers, with alterations in its expression linked to disease progression and prognosis. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), FAM133A is identified as a hub gene associated with tumor metastasis and is significantly enriched in immune-related functions and apoptotic pathways. Its role in regulating oncogenic mechanisms suggests its involvement in the complex pathogenesis of PAAD (Bai2021Integrating).

In low-grade gliomas (LGG), FAM133A is part of a gene signature model that predicts recurrence and malignant progression. It is considered a protective factor in this context, contributing to the stratification of patients into risk groups with differing prognoses (Teng2022Recurrence).

FAM133A is also included in a prognostic model for multiple myeloma (MM), where its expression is associated with the low-risk group, indicating a potential role in the prognosis of MM (Yu2022An).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), FAM133A is one of the top protein-coding genes co-expressed with the long non-coding RNA DUXAP8, suggesting its involvement in tumor biology, although specific clinical significance in HCC is not detailed (Wang2020Clinical).
