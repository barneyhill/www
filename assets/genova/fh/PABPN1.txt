# PABPN1

## Overview
PABPN1 (polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1) is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in the regulation of mRNA polyadenylation, a critical process for mRNA stability and translation efficiency. The protein, also known as poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1, is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which facilitates high-affinity binding to the poly(A) tail of pre-mRNA. This binding is essential for determining the length of the poly(A) tail, thereby influencing mRNA stability and export. PABPN1 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including mRNA export, nonsense-mediated decay, and muscle cell differentiation. Mutations in the PABPN1 gene are linked to oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), a genetic disorder marked by muscle weakness, particularly in the eyelids and throat. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as hnRNPs and Hsp70 chaperones, further underscore its multifaceted role in RNA processing and cellular function (Bear2003Nuclear; Kühn2009Poly(A); Banerjee2013PABPN1: page 5 of 11).

## Structure
The human PABPN1 protein is composed of 306 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 32.8 kDa. Its structure includes an N-terminal acidic region, a central RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, and a C-terminal segment. The N-terminal domain contains a sequence of 10 consecutive alanine residues, which is largely unstructured (Winter2012Polyalanineindependent). The central RRM domain is crucial for high-affinity RNA binding and is characterized by a canonical fold consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and two helices (Ge2008Crystal). This domain is essential for the protein's specificity in poly(A) binding (Ge2008Crystal).

The C-terminal domain contains a nuclear localization signal and 13 asymmetric dimethylated arginine residues, which are common post-translational modifications (Winter2012Polyalanineindependent). PABPN1 typically forms homodimers, with dimerization occurring through interactions between beta-strands and additional forces from loop1 and helix a1 (Ge2008Crystal). The dimer interface is significantly nonpolar, suggesting functional dimer characteristics (Ge2008Crystal). Splice variants of PABPN1 may alter its functional domains, impacting its role in mRNA processing and stability.

## Function
PABPN1 (poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1) is a crucial component in mRNA metabolism, primarily involved in the regulation of polyadenylation, a process essential for mRNA stability and translation efficiency. PABPN1 binds to the poly(A) tail of pre-mRNA in the nucleus, influencing the length of the poly(A) tail by interacting with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and poly(A) polymerase. This interaction ensures the synthesis of poly(A) tails to a defined length of approximately 250 nucleotides, which is critical for mRNA stability and efficient translation initiation (Kühn2009Poly(A) page 0 of 8; Kühn2009Poly(A) page 1 of 8).

PABPN1 is associated with RNA polymerase II during transcription and remains bound to the mRNA ribonucleoprotein complex until it reaches the nuclear pore, where it is displaced by cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein PABP1 (Bear2003Nuclear). It also plays a role in mRNA export and nonsense-mediated decay, contributing to the regulation of gene expression (Bear2003Nuclear).

In addition to its role in mRNA processing, PABPN1 is involved in muscle cell differentiation and function, with mutations in the PABPN1 gene linked to oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, highlighting its importance in muscle cell biology (Bear2003Nuclear; Kühn2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PABPN1 gene are primarily associated with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), a late-onset genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, particularly affecting the eyelids and throat muscles. The disease is caused by an expansion of a GCN trinucleotide repeat in the PABPN1 gene, leading to an extended stretch of alanines in the protein's N-terminal domain. This mutation results in the formation of nuclear aggregates in muscle tissue, which are a hallmark of OPMD and similar to those found in other protein aggregation disorders (Banerjee2013PABPN1:).

The pathogenesis of OPMD may involve both a toxic gain-of-function due to the formation of these aggregates and a loss-of-function resulting from the sequestration of essential proteins and RNAs, disrupting normal cellular functions (Banerjee2013PABPN1:). The disease is primarily autosomal dominant, and the severity of symptoms can be influenced by specific genetic polymorphisms, such as the GCG 7 polymorphism, which can modify the disease phenotype (Banerjee2013PABPN1:).

Research has also indicated that reduced expression levels of PABPN1, which naturally occur with aging, may contribute to muscle wasting and the manifestation of OPMD symptoms by affecting polyadenylation site utilization and gene expression (Riaz2016PABPN1Dependent). Gene therapy approaches are being explored to address the underlying genetic cause of OPMD by replacing the mutant PABPN1 with a functional version (Malerba2017PABPN1).

## Interactions
PABPN1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in RNA processing and regulation. It binds to the poly(A) tails of mRNA, influencing mRNA stability and export (Kühn2003The). PABPN1 interacts with hnRNP proteins, specifically hnRNP A1 and A/B, which are involved in mRNA packaging and export. These interactions occur at the C-terminal domain of PABPN1, which does not overlap with its RNA binding domain, allowing simultaneous binding to RNA and hnRNP proteins (Fan2003hnRNP). 

PABPN1 also interacts with Hsp70 chaperones, which bind with higher affinity to expanded PABPN1 variants associated with oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). This interaction is thought to be an effort to prevent aggregate formation, although it may also sequester Hsp70, reducing its availability for other cellular functions (Tavanez2009Hsp70). 

Additionally, PABPN1 is involved in the splicing of certain pre-mRNAs. Its depletion leads to increased levels of unspliced RNA, highlighting its role in enhancing the recruitment of splicing factors like U2AF65 and phosphorylated SF3b155 to terminal introns (Muniz2015Poly(A) page 5 of 7).
