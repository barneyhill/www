# TMEM258

## Overview
TMEM258 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 258, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein processing and binding, and is expressed in multiple tissues. The gene's expression and genetic variations have been linked to several diseases, particularly certain types of cancer, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer. TMEM258's role in these diseases suggests its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target, although further research is necessary to fully understand its functions and implications in disease pathogenesis (Ye2023The; Orlando2016Variation).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM258 has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), TMEM258 is associated with B-lineage lymphocytes, where its increased expression is linked to protein processing and binding. This alteration may contribute to the transformation from B cells to plasma cells, affecting the tumor microenvironment and potentially influencing tumor phenotype and heterogeneity (Ye2023The).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), TMEM258 is mentioned in relation to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associated with CRC risk. Although specific details about TMEM258's role in CRC are not provided, the gene is noted in the context of genetic variations that influence CRC risk, suggesting a potential involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Orlando2016Variation).

Overall, changes in TMEM258 expression and its genetic variations may play a role in the development and progression of certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target. However, further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in these conditions.
