# ISL2

## Overview
ISL2, or ISL LIM homeobox 2, is a gene that encodes a LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) protein functioning as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its two LIM domains and a homeodomain, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and DNA-binding specificity, respectively. As a transcription factor, ISL2 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during developmental processes, including cell fate determination and organogenesis. The ISL2 protein is highly conserved across species and is expressed in various human tissues at both embryonic and adult stages, underscoring its importance in tissue differentiation and maintenance. In particular, ISL2 is vital for motor neuron development, influencing the formation and connectivity of motor pools in the spinal cord. Its interactions with specific gene promoters, such as VEGFA and ANGPT2, highlight its involvement in angiogenesis and tumor progression, particularly in cancers like oligodendroglioma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Lee2022Transcriptional; Jiang2020The; Li2006Cloning).

## Function
The ISL2 gene encodes a LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) protein, which functions as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression during development. The ISL2 protein contains two LIM domains and a homeodomain, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions and DNA-binding specificity, respectively (Li2006Cloning). These domains enable ISL2 to participate in transcriptional regulation by binding to DNA and influencing the transcription of target genes, thereby impacting processes such as cell fate determination and organogenesis (Li2006Cloning).

ISL2 is expressed in all human tissues examined at both adult and embryonic stages, suggesting its involvement in tissue differentiation and maintenance (Li2006Cloning). The protein is highly conserved across species, indicating its potential importance in developmental processes (Li2006Cloning). In the context of motor neuron development, ISL2 plays a critical role in the formation and connectivity of motor pools, particularly in the spinal cord, where it regulates genes involved in motor neuron differentiation, axon development, and synapse organization (Lee2022Transcriptional). The absence of ISL2 can lead to disorganized motor pools and impaired neuromuscular junctions, highlighting its essential role in motor function (Lee2022Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
The ISL2 gene is implicated in various cancers, notably pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and oligodendroglioma. In PDAC, ISL2 functions as an epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor. Its downregulation, primarily due to DNA methylation, is observed in over 60% of primary PDAC tumors and is associated with increased cell proliferation, tumor growth, and poor patient survival outcomes. The loss of ISL2 leads to metabolic reprogramming in PDAC cells, favoring oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation over glycolysis, which creates vulnerabilities to specific metabolic inhibitors (Tufan2020ISL2). 

In oligodendroglioma, ISL2 is associated with malignant transformation and tumor progression. Its expression is linked to increased angiogenesis and tumor malignancy, correlating with markers such as VEGFA and CD31. Higher ISL2 levels are found in malignantly transformed oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas, with a negative correlation to patient survival, particularly in IDH wild-type low-grade glioma patients. This suggests that ISL2 could serve as a biomarker for oligodendroglioma progression and a potential therapeutic target (Chen2022Case). 

These findings highlight the dual role of ISL2 in different cancers, acting as a tumor suppressor in PDAC and a promoter of malignancy in oligodendroglioma.

## Interactions
ISL2 (ISL LIM homeobox 2) is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. ISL2 is known to bind directly to the promoters of specific genes, such as VEGFA and ANGPT2, influencing their transcriptional activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays have demonstrated that ISL2 interacts with the VEGFA promoter in glioma stem cells, enhancing its expression and promoting angiogenesis (Jiang2020The). Similarly, ISL2 binds to the ANGPT2 promoter, as confirmed by ChIP assays and dual-luciferase reporter assays, which show increased promoter activity in the presence of ISL2. This interaction is crucial for modulating angiogenesis and tumor progression in oligodendroglioma (Qi2020ISL2).

ISL2 also regulates the expression of U2AF2 by binding to its promoter, as evidenced by luciferase reporter assays and ChIP assays. This interaction is part of a feedback loop involving U2AF2, circRNA ARF1, and miR-342-3p, which regulates glioma tumorigenesis and angiogenesis through VEGFA-mediated signaling pathways (Jiang2020The). These interactions highlight ISL2's role in transcriptional regulation and its involvement in complex signaling pathways that contribute to tumor development and progression.
