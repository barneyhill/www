# ZNG1B

## Overview
ZNG1B is a gene that encodes the protein Zn regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1B, which plays a crucial role in cellular zinc homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a GTPase, a type of enzyme that hydrolyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein synthesis. The activity of Zn regulated GTPase metalloprotein activator 1B is essential for the regulation of metalloproteins, which are proteins that require metal ions to function properly. Dysregulation of this gene or its protein product can have significant implications for cellular function and has been implicated in various pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
