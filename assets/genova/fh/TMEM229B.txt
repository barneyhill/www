# TMEM229B

## Overview
TMEM229B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 229B, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including those related to immune response and cellular signaling pathways. TMEM229B has been studied for its role in different diseases, such as bladder urothelial carcinoma and diabetes, where its expression levels have been linked to disease progression and patient outcomes. Although its involvement in Parkinson's disease has been investigated, no significant genetic association has been established (Zhao2022Genetic; Aleem2024Expression; Yu2022Clinical).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM229B has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In bladder urothelial carcinoma, TMEM229B is identified as a hub gene associated with M1 macrophage-related pathways. Lower expression of TMEM229B, along with FBXO6 and OAS1, correlates with reduced overall survival in bladder cancer patients. The gene's expression is influenced by pathways such as GRAFT VS. HOST DISEASE, CELL ADHESION MOLECULES CAMS, and CHEMOKINE SIGNALING PATHWAY, and its expression level serves as a prognostic indicator for patient outcomes and potential response to immunotherapy and chemotherapy (Yu2022Clinical).

In the context of diabetes, TMEM229B expression is significantly suppressed in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats, which is linked to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells and subsequent insulin deficiency. This suggests a role for TMEM229B in glucose metabolism and its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of diabetes (Aleem2024Expression).

In Parkinson's disease, TMEM229B has been studied for its genetic variants, but no significant association with the disease has been found. The gene's expression in the substantia nigra of PD patients does not significantly differ from controls, indicating a limited role in PD (Zhao2022Genetic).
