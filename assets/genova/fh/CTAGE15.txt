# CTAGE15

## Overview
CTAGE15 is a gene that encodes the CTAGE family member 15 protein, which is integral to cellular processes involving protein transport and secretion. This protein is primarily associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates vesicle-mediated transport, a critical component of the secretory pathway. The CTAGE15 protein plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring the efficient trafficking of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, thereby supporting proper cellular function and organismal health. While CTAGE15 has been implicated in various cellular processes, its specific role in disease contexts, such as cancer, remains an area of active research, with studies exploring its genetic and epigenetic alterations in different cancer types (Peng2020Integrated; Daugaard2016Identification).

## Function
CTAGE15, a member of the CTAGE family, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as protein transport and secretion. This protein is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in vesicle-mediated transport. The CTAGE15 protein is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring proper protein trafficking within the cell. Its function is essential for the efficient transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, a critical step in the secretory pathway. This process is vital for the correct delivery of proteins to their intended destinations, which is necessary for the proper functioning of cellular activities and overall organismal health. The involvement of CTAGE15 in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining the balance and functionality of cellular systems, contributing to the stability and efficiency of protein transport mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
CTAGE15 has been studied in the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), where it was initially identified as a differentially methylated region (DMR) in a genome-wide methylation screening. However, subsequent validation efforts did not confirm significant hypomethylation of CTAGE15 in primary tumors compared to normal tissue, suggesting that its methylation status may not be a reliable biomarker for LAC (Daugaard2016Identification).

In the context of lung squamous cell carcinoma, CTAGE15 was mentioned in a study analyzing intratumoral genetic heterogeneity. The study identified nonsynonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in CTAGE15 within primary tumors, indicating potential genetic alterations in this gene in cancerous tissues (Peng2020Integrated).

While CTAGE15 is part of the MIA/cTAGE family, which is involved in protein secretion processes, specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from mutations or dysregulation of CTAGE15 have not been extensively documented. The gene's role in secretion processes suggests it may have broader implications in cellular function and disease, but further research is needed to clarify its clinical significance (Feng2021Tales).
