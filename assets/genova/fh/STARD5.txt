# STARD5

## Overview
STARD5 is a gene that encodes the protein StAR-related lipid transfer domain containing 5, which is a member of the START domain protein family. This protein is characterized by its lipid-binding domain, which plays a pivotal role in the intracellular transport and metabolism of lipids, particularly cholesterol. The STARD5 protein is primarily involved in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis, especially within the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. It is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidney, with significant roles in immune-mediating cells. The protein's expression is notably induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress, which is relevant in various metabolic disorders. STARD5 functions as a non-vesicular transporter of cholesterol, potentially acting as a cholesterol buffer to prevent lipotoxicity and maintain membrane fluidity (RodriguezAgudo2019StarD5:; Clark2011The).

## Structure
STARD5 is a protein characterized by the presence of a START domain, which is a lipid-binding domain involved in lipid transfer and metabolism. The primary structure of STARD5 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain that is approximately 205-233 amino acids in length (RodriguezAgudo2019StarD5:). The secondary structure includes a 'helix-grip' fold, with a central antiparallel β-sheet flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal α-helices, forming a hydrophobic tunnel capable of accommodating lipid molecules such as cholesterol (Alpy2005Give).

The tertiary structure of STARD5 is defined by the START domain, which forms a hydrophobic pocket for lipid binding. This domain is crucial for the protein's function in lipid exchange and sensing (RodriguezAgudo2019StarD5:; Alpy2005Give). The START domain's structure includes two narrow openings, suggesting that ligand entry or exit requires structural rearrangement, potentially involving the C-terminal α4 helix (Alpy2005Give).

There is limited information on the quaternary structure of STARD5, but it is suggested that the protein may function as a monomer. The protein is involved in cholesterol homeostasis and is abundant in immune-mediating cells, with its expression induced upon endoplasmic reticulum stress (RodriguezAgudo2019StarD5:).

## Function
STARD5 is a member of the START domain protein family, primarily involved in the intracellular transport of cholesterol and other lipids. It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular lipid homeostasis, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) (Clark2011The). STARD5 is predominantly expressed in the liver and kidney, with notable localization in Kupffer cells and proximal tubules, respectively (Clark2011The). In macrophages, STARD5 is found in perinuclear regions and colocalizes with the Golgi apparatus, suggesting its involvement in cholesterol transport between the Golgi, ER, and PM (Clark2011The).

STARD5 expression is induced by ER stress, which is relevant in various metabolic disorders (Clark2011The). It is not regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) or liver X receptors (LXRs), but its expression increases significantly in response to ER stress (Soccio2005Differential). The protein is involved in the non-vesicular transport of cholesterol, potentially affecting PM fluidity and membrane function (RodriguezAgudo2019StarD5:). STARD5 may also act as a cholesterol buffer, binding free cholesterol to prevent lipotoxicity (Clark2011The). Its role in cholesterol homeostasis is crucial for preventing cellular damage from excess cholesterol in healthy human cells (Clark2011The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STARD5 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). STARD5 is downregulated in HCC tissues, and this reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter time to recurrence and overall survival in patients (Li2023Eleven). The deficiency of STARD5 contributes to increased invasion and migration of cancer cells, as it is linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer metastasis. Knockdown of STARD5 results in increased mesenchymal markers and decreased epithelial markers, promoting cell invasion and migration, while overexpression of STARD5 reverses these effects (Li2023Eleven).

STARD5 is also implicated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, playing a key role in ER cholesterol homeostasis. Its expression is influenced by ER stress, which can trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR), a network of adaptive signals that tumors exploit to promote EMT, invasion, and metastasis (Li2023Eleven). Mutations in the STARD gene family, including STARD5, may lead to autoimmune diseases or cancer, highlighting its broader significance in disease pathology (Li2023Eleven).
