# TTC33

## Overview
TTC33 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 33, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that TTC33 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. While the specific functions of the TTC33 protein are not fully elucidated, proteins with TPR domains are often involved in the assembly of multiprotein complexes, regulation of the cell cycle, and protein transport. The TTC33 gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their roles in cellular physiology and potential implications in human health and disease.
