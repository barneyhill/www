# PPP1R7

## Overview
PPP1R7 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 7, also known as SDS22. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit within the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in numerous cellular processes. PPP1R7 is characterized by leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that facilitate its interaction with the catalytic subunit of PP1, known as PP1c, thereby modulating its activity. The protein plays a critical role in the regulation of the mitotic cycle, cell shape, and polarity, as well as in maintaining cardiac function and chromatin structure. It acts as a molecular 'sponge' for PP1c, influencing the binding of other interactors and is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Casamayor2020Controlling; Grusche2009Sds22; Chiang2015Alterations). Alterations in the PPP1R7 gene have been linked to acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Wang2022PPP1R7).

## Function
PPP1R7, also known as SDS22, is a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP1R7 is involved in the regulation of the mitotic cycle by targeting PP1C to mitotic kinetochores, which is essential for the completion of mitosis (Casamayor2020Controlling). It encodes a protein with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) that interact with PP1C, inhibiting its activity and maintaining PP1 in an inactive state until holoenzyme assembly is required (Casamayor2020Controlling).

PPP1R7 also influences cell shape and polarity by regulating the phosphorylation state of proteins involved in the actin cytoskeleton, such as Moesin and Myosin Light Chain. This regulation is crucial for maintaining epithelial cell integrity and morphology (Grusche2009Sds22). In cardiac tissues, PPP1R7 acts as a competitive molecular 'sponge' for PP1c, sequestering it and affecting the binding of other interactors, which is important for maintaining cardiac function (Chiang2018Rearrangement). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays roles in chromatin structure and gene expression regulation (Chiang2015Alterations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PPP1R7 gene have been implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A study identified a novel chromosomal translocation involving PPP1R7 and the core binding factor beta subunit gene (CBFB) in a case of AML. This translocation, t(2;16)(q37;q22), results in a CBFB::PPP1R7 fusion, marking PPP1R7 as a novel partner gene for CBFB rearrangements in AML. This finding is significant as it expands the understanding of genetic alterations in AML, where CBFB is typically rearranged with MYH11 (Wang2022PPP1R7).

The study involved a 58-year-old patient with AML who initially achieved remission with chemotherapy but relapsed with a complex karyotype, including the novel translocation. The presence of the CBFB::PPP1R7 fusion was confirmed using PCR and Sanger sequencing, and the patient underwent further treatment, including a stem cell transplant (Wang2022PPP1R7). This translocation was identified as rare, with only one case found in a 21-year retrospective database search, highlighting its uniqueness in AML cases (Wang2022PPP1R7).

The discovery of PPP1R7 as a translocation partner in AML suggests potential implications for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease, particularly in cases lacking typical CBFB fusions.

## Interactions
PPP1R7, also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 7, is a key interactor within the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) interactome. It acts as a regulatory subunit that modulates the activity of PP1, a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. PPP1R7 is known to bind strongly to PP1c, the catalytic subunit of PP1, and is suggested to function as a molecular 'sponge' that sequesters PP1c, thereby influencing the binding of other interactors (Chiang2018Rearrangement).

In the context of heart failure progression, PPP1R7's interaction with PP1c increases, although its global expression levels remain unchanged. This suggests a compensatory mechanism rather than a pathogenic one (Chiang2018Rearrangement). Knockdown experiments in HeLa cells have shown that reducing PPP1R7 levels leads to an increase in other PP1c interactors, supporting its role as a competitive interactor (Chiang2018Rearrangement).

PPP1R7 also interacts with specific proteins such as UXT, YBX3, and TPRN, which may rely on PPP1R7 for indirect binding to PP1c (Chiang2018Rearrangement). These interactions highlight the complexity and regulatory capacity of PPP1R7 within the PP1 interactome.
