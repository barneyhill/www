# RTBDN

## Overview
The RTBDN gene encodes the protein retbindin, which is a retina-specific protein crucial for retinal health and function. Retbindin is primarily located at the interface between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), where it plays a significant role in the transport and regulation of riboflavin and its derivatives, such as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) (Kelley2015Retbindin; Zhao2022The). These flavins are essential cofactors in various metabolic processes, including the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation, which are vital for the high metabolic demands of photoreceptors (Kelley2015Retbindin). Retbindin acts as a metabolite carrier, facilitating nutrient exchange between the retina and the RPE, thereby supporting photoreceptor metabolism and providing neuroprotection against light-induced damage (Sinha2020Flavins; Zhao2022The). The absence of retbindin can lead to metabolic dysregulation and retinal degeneration, underscoring its importance in maintaining retinal homeostasis (Zhao2022The).

## Function
Retbindin (RTBDN) is a retina-specific protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining retinal health and function. It is primarily localized at the interface between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), where it is involved in the transport and regulation of riboflavin and its derivatives, such as flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) (Kelley2015Retbindin; Zhao2022The). These flavins are essential cofactors in metabolic processes, including the citric acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation, which are vital for the high metabolic demands of photoreceptors (Kelley2015Retbindin).

Retbindin's ability to bind riboflavin suggests it acts as a metabolite carrier, facilitating the exchange of nutrients between the retina and the RPE, thereby supporting photoreceptor metabolism and protecting against metabolic dysregulation (Sinha2020Flavins; Zhao2022The). The protein also provides neuroprotection to retinal cells, particularly under conditions of high light exposure, by preventing flavin-sensitized light damage, which can lead to lipid peroxidation and cell damage (Zhao2022The; Kelley2018Retbindin). The absence of retbindin results in reduced flavin levels, metabolic breakdown, and retinal degeneration, highlighting its importance in maintaining retinal homeostasis (Zhao2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the RTBDN gene, which encodes retbindin, have been implicated in several retinal conditions. The absence of retbindin in mouse models leads to premature retinal aging and increased susceptibility to light-induced damage, suggesting a protective role against these conditions (Fan2021Retbindin). In particular, the lack of retbindin results in increased apoptosis, activation of microglia, and loss of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, which are indicative of retinal stress or damage (Fan2021Retbindin). 

The absence of retbindin also affects the normal shedding of outer segment discs in the retina, leading to decreased phagocytotic activity, a feature associated with premature aging (Fan2021Retbindin). This condition is characterized by age-related morphological changes, such as the deposition of EFEMP1/Fibulin 3 and calcification along Bruch's membrane, which are characteristic of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (Fan2021Retbindin). 

While no specific human diseases have been directly linked to RTBDN mutations, the gene's role in maintaining retinal health and its involvement in light damage mediation suggest that alterations in RTBDN expression could contribute to retinal degenerative diseases like retinitis pigmentosa and AMD (Zhao2022The; Fan2021Retbindin).
