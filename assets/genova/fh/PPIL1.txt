# PPIL1

## Overview
Peptidylprolyl isomerase like 1 (PPIL1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cyclophilin family, which is characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. The PPIL1 protein plays a crucial role in the spliceosome, a complex responsible for pre-mRNA splicing, a fundamental process in gene expression regulation. Structurally, PPIL1 shares similarities with other cyclophilins, featuring a canonical cyclophilin fold and an active site that facilitates protein folding through isomerization of peptide bonds preceding proline residues (Xu2006Solution; Stegmann2010The). Despite its enzymatic activity, PPIL1 primarily functions as an adaptor protein within the spliceosome, stabilizing its structure and ensuring the integrity of RNA splicing (Chai2021Mutations). The protein's interactions with various spliceosomal components, such as SKIP and PRP17, underscore its importance in cellular processes and its potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Rajiv2018Structural; Stegmann2010The).

## Structure
The human PPIL1 protein is a member of the cyclophilin family, characterized by its peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity. The primary structure of PPIL1 consists of 166 amino acid residues, sharing 41.6% identity with human cyclophilin A (Xu2006Solution). The secondary structure of PPIL1 features an antiparallel eight-stranded β-barrel capped by two α-helices, with a short 3_10 helix within a loop (Xu2006Solution). The tertiary structure of PPIL1 resembles the canonical cyclophilin fold, similar to cyclophilin A, with an active site located on strands β3 and β4 (Stegmann2010The). 

PPIL1's structure is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions among conserved amino acids, particularly in helix α2 (Xu2006Solution). The protein can form a ternary complex with cyclosporin A and SKIP, indicating its ability to engage in multiple protein-protein interactions (Xu2006Solution). PPIL1 is involved in the spliceosome, interacting with various proteins such as SNW1, RBM22, and CDC5L, and is part of the PRP19 complex (Rajiv2018Structural). The protein's interaction with SKIP does not involve its PPIase active site, suggesting a role as an adaptor protein within the spliceosome (Stegmann2010The).

## Function
PPIL1 (peptidylprolyl isomerase like 1) is a cyclophilin family member involved in pre-mRNA splicing, a critical process for gene expression regulation in higher organisms. It functions as part of the spliceosome complex, specifically associating with the 35 S U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle and the 45 S activated spliceosome (Xu2006Solution). PPIL1 is recruited into the spliceosome by SKIP, another essential component, just before the catalytic step 1, and it remains a core component throughout the splicing process (Xu2006Solution; Stegmann2010The).

PPIL1 exhibits peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity, facilitating the isomerization of peptide bonds preceding proline residues, which is important for protein folding (Stegmann2010The). Despite its enzymatic capabilities, PPIL1's predominant role in the spliceosome appears to be non-enzymatic, stabilizing certain spliceosomal structures to maintain RNA splicing integrity (Chai2021Mutations). This stabilization is crucial for neuronal survival and brain development, as disruptions in splicing can lead to neurodegenerative conditions (Chai2021Mutations).

PPIL1 interacts with various proteins within the spliceosome, including SKIP, PRP17, and others, playing a significant role in the activation and remodeling of the spliceosome (Rajiv2018Structural; Stegmann2010The). These interactions are essential for the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, highlighting PPIL1's importance in cellular processes and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PPIL1 gene are associated with neurodegenerative conditions, particularly pontocerebellar hypoplasia with microcephaly (PCHM). This condition is characterized by congenital microcephaly, hypotonia, difficulty swallowing, seizures, and delayed motor and language development. Brain MRI of affected individuals often shows cortical changes, including a simplified gyri pattern. The mutations in PPIL1 are typically biallelic and hypomorphic, leading to unstable proteins with reduced levels and increased aggregation propensity. These mutations segregate with the phenotype according to recessive inheritance patterns (Chai2021Mutations).

The loss of PPIL1 affects alternative splicing of genes involved in protein translation, DNA repair, and noncoding RNA processing, which are critical for neuronal survival. This disruption is particularly pronounced in the brain, contributing to neurodegenerative conditions like PCHM (Chai2021Mutations). Mutations in PPIL1, along with PRP17, result in pontocerebellar hypoplasia types 14 and 15, characterized by developmental delay, seizures, and microcephalus (Ghasemi2024Broadening).

Alterations in PPIL1 expression have also been linked to cancer, as its upregulation in human colon cancer cells is associated with reduced cell viability upon knockdown, indicating a potential role in cancer cell survival (Stegmann2010The).

## Interactions
PPIL1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the spliceosome complex. It binds to the SKIP protein, a component of the spliceosome, through a distinct binding site separate from its active site. This interaction involves a minimal linear binding epitope on SKIP, specifically residues 61-68, which is sufficient for binding PPIL1. This suggests that SKIP may recruit PPIL1 into the spliceosome, potentially participating in spliceosome activation by delivering PPIL1 to sites requiring remodeling (Stegmann2010The).

PPIL1 also forms a ternary complex with cyclosporin A and nSKIP, binding them on different interfaces simultaneously. This interaction does not affect the binding of SKIP to PPIL1, indicating that PPIL1 can engage in multiple interactions concurrently (Xu2006Solution).

In addition to SKIP, PPIL1 interacts with PRP17, another spliceosomal component. This interaction is crucial for RNA splicing and neuronal survival, although the isomerization of PRP17 by PPIL1 is not essential for their functions, suggesting a non-enzymatic role for PPIL1 in the spliceosome (Chai2021Mutations). These interactions highlight PPIL1's role in maintaining RNA splicing integrity and its potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases (Chai2021Mutations).
