# MMP10

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 10 (MMP10), also known as stromelysin-2, is a gene that encodes a zinc-dependent endoproteinase belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase family. This family of enzymes is characterized by their ability to degrade extracellular matrix components, although MMP10 primarily processes bioactive proteins rather than degrading the matrix itself. The MMP10 protein plays a crucial role in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and cellular migration by modulating the extracellular environment. It is involved in the cleavage of cell adhesion proteins and secreted bioactive mediators, which are essential for various physiological processes, including cell migration and wound healing (Schlage2015Matrix). MMP10's activity is regulated through interactions with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and its expression and mutations have been implicated in several diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, kidney diseases, and cancer (Deraz2011MMP10Stromelysin2; Verovenko2024Identification; Sun2022Matrix).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 10 (MMP10), also known as stromelysin-2, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, characterized by a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding motif. The primary structure of MMP10 includes a pro-peptide domain, a catalytic domain, and a hemopexin-like C-terminal domain. The catalytic domain of MMP10, referred to as MMP-10cd, exhibits the classic metzincin fold, which consists of three α-helices, four parallel β-strands, one antiparallel β-strand, and several long connecting loops. This structure is stabilized by three calcium ions and two zinc ions (Batra2013Matrix).

The tertiary structure of MMP10 involves the coordination of the catalytic zinc ion by histidine residues, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The N-terminal amine of inhibitors like TIMP-2 directly coordinates with the catalytic zinc in the MMP-10 active site, highlighting the importance of this metal ion in the enzyme's function (Batra2013Matrix).

In terms of quaternary structure, MMP10 can form complexes with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), such as TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. These interactions involve significant surface area burial and are stabilized by multiple hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Batra2013Matrix). The structural analysis of these complexes provides insights into the specificity and regulation of MMP10 activity.

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 10 (MMP10) is a zinc-dependent endoproteinase involved in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and cellular migration by modulating the extracellular environment. MMP10 is primarily active in the extracellular space, where it processes bioactive proteins rather than degrading components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Schlage2015Matrix). It is involved in the cleavage of cell adhesion proteins and secreted bioactive mediators, which are crucial for cell migration and wound healing (Schlage2015Matrix).

MMP10 is known to cleave substrates such as the integrin alpha-6 subunit, dermokine, and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61, which are involved in cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation (Schlage2015Matrix). It also plays a role in the breakdown of adhesion complexes and degradation of basement membrane components, facilitating keratinocyte migration (Schlage2015Matrix). MMP10's activity extends to processing bioactive mediators, including cell surface receptors and cytokines, which are crucial for cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and immune response (Schlage2015Matrix). This positions MMP10 as a precise modulator of diverse biological processes rather than a simple tissue degrader.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MMP10 gene have been implicated in various diseases. A notable missense variant, p.L245P, in the MMP10 gene is associated with premature myocardial infarction. This variant affects the interaction between MMP10 and its inhibitor TIMP1, leading to increased macrophage adhesion and decreased migration, which may contribute to atherosclerosis and plaque destabilization (Verovenko2024Identification).

In kidney-related conditions, MMP10 expression is elevated in patients with diabetes, correlating with diabetic nephropathy and albuminuria. It is also implicated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where its expression is linked to disease progression and poor survival outcomes. MMP10's role in kidney diseases suggests it could serve as a biomarker for kidney dysfunction (Sun2022Matrix).

In cancer, particularly head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), high MMP10 expression is associated with aggressive invasion patterns, advanced tumor stages, and metastasis. This expression correlates with poor prognosis, indicating MMP10 as a potential marker for tumor aggressiveness and a target for therapeutic intervention (Deraz2011MMP10Stromelysin2).

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 10 (MMP10) interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), specifically TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, which regulate its enzymatic activity. MMP10 shows reduced sensitivity to these inhibitors compared to MMP3, another member of the stromelysin family. The inhibition constants (K_i) for TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 with MMP10 are significantly weaker than those with MMP3, attributed to differences in the molecular interface, including the number of hydrogen bonds and the extent of surface area buried in the complex (Batra2012Matrix).

The structural analysis of the MMP-10/TIMP-2 complex reveals that TIMP-2 interacts with MMP10 through an extended surface involving multiple segments of its N- and C-terminal domains. This interaction results in the burial of significant accessible surface areas on both proteins, featuring two salt bridges and 18 additional interfacial hydrogen bonds (Batra2013Matrix). The N-terminal domain of TIMP-2, responsible for MMP inhibitory activity, interacts with the MMP-10 substrate-binding cleft, highlighting the structural changes in TIMP-2 upon binding to MMP10 (Batra2013Matrix).

MMP10 also interacts with a single-domain antibody, H3, which acts as an orthosteric inhibitor by binding to the active site of MMP10, showing strong inhibition with an IC50 of 657 picomolar (Razai2020Selective).
