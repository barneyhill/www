# SLC7A1

## Overview
The SLC7A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 7 member 1 (CAT1), which functions as a cationic amino acid transporter. This transmembrane protein is integral to the transport of essential amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and histidine across cell membranes, playing a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including protein synthesis and nitric oxide production (Hatzoglou2004REGULATION; Closs2006Structure). CAT1 is characterized by its 14 transmembrane domains, which facilitate its function as a transporter, and is subject to regulation by factors such as cytokines and hormones, reflecting its importance in cellular metabolism and growth (Hatzoglou2004REGULATION; Closs2006Structure). The gene's expression and function are implicated in several health conditions, including hypertension and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Yang2008Mechanistic; Shen2018Upregulation).

## Structure
The SLC7A1 gene encodes the cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1), a protein involved in the transport of cationic amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and histidine. The primary structure of CAT1 consists of 622 amino acids, and it is predicted to have 14 transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in transporting amino acids across cell membranes (Bai2019CAT1SLC7A1; Closs2006Structure). The protein's secondary structure includes these transmembrane domains, which are likely composed of alpha helices that span the lipid bilayer (Closs2006Structure).

The tertiary structure of CAT1 involves the folding of these transmembrane domains to form a functional transporter, with specific extracellular loops playing a role in binding and transport activity. Notably, the third extracellular loop contains glycosylation sites, which are conserved and crucial for the protein's function (Closs2006Structure). The quaternary structure may involve the formation of homodimers or heterodimers, although specific details on dimerization are not provided in the context.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for CAT1's activity and interaction with other molecules (Ellingsen2020Sequence). These structural features enable CAT1 to function effectively as a transporter in various cellular contexts.

## Function
The SLC7A1 gene encodes the cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT-1), which is crucial for the transport of essential amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and ornithine across the plasma membrane of cells. This transport is Na+-independent and plays a significant role in various metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, nitric oxide (NO) production, and polyamine biosynthesis (PALACÍN1998Molecular; Hatzoglou2004REGULATION). CAT-1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with its expression levels varying significantly, indicating a regulated expression pattern influenced by factors such as cytokines, growth factors, and hormones (Hatzoglou2004REGULATION).

In endothelial cells, CAT-1 is involved in insulin-stimulated L-arginine transport, which is essential for endothelial function and vascular relaxation. This process is mediated by the transcription factor Sp1, which enhances SLC7A1 expression, leading to increased NO synthesis and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (González2011Insulin‐stimulated). The transporter is also implicated in maintaining amino acid gradients across the plasma membrane, which is vital for cellular metabolism and growth, particularly in rapidly proliferating cells such as T and B lymphocytes and during liver regeneration (PALACÍN1998Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC7A1 gene have been implicated in several health conditions, particularly hypertension. A polymorphism in the 3' UTR of SLC7A1, known as ss52051869, affects the binding of the transcription factor SP1. The major allele of this polymorphism binds to SP1, while the minor allele does not, leading to differential gene expression. This variation is associated with changes in L-arginine transport and nitric oxide metabolism, which are linked to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension (Yang2008Mechanistic).

The SLC7A1 gene is also involved in the uptake of arginine, a precursor for nitric oxide production, which is crucial for blood pressure regulation. Although a study in a Finnish cohort found no significant association between the rs41318021 polymorphism in SLC7A1 and hypertension at age 50, there was a slight increase in diastolic blood pressure over time in individuals with certain variants, suggesting a modest effect on blood pressure regulation (Määttä2013Contribution).

In the context of cancer, SLC7A1 expression has been studied in papillary thyroid carcinoma, where it was associated with BRAF mutation status, although not directly linked to patient mortality or other clinical features (Shen2018Upregulation).

## Interactions
The SLC7A1 gene, encoding the cationic amino acid transporter 1 (hCAT-1), is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function and regulation. One significant interaction is with the transcription factor SP1, which binds to the 3' UTR of the SLC7A1 gene. This binding is allele-specific, with the major allele (C) binding to SP1, while the minor allele (T) does not. This differential binding affects the expression of SLC7A1, potentially impacting nitric oxide production and endothelial function, which are relevant to hypertension (Yang2008Mechanistic).

In the context of insulin signaling, SP1 also plays a role in regulating SLC7A1 expression. Insulin increases the transcriptional activity of the SLC7A1 promoter and enhances the nuclear abundance and DNA binding activity of SP1. This interaction is crucial for insulin-stimulated L-arginine transport and the associated relaxation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (González2011Insulin‐stimulated).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving SLC7A1, which are essential for its role in cellular processes such as amino acid transport and vascular function.
