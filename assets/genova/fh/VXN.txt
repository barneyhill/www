# VXN

## Overview
The VXN gene encodes the protein vexin, which plays a significant role in neurogenesis and is categorized as a regulatory protein involved in transcriptional processes. Vexin is a direct target of neural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, such as Atoh7, Neurod1, and Neurog2, which are crucial for neural differentiation (Moore2018C8orf46). It functions by enhancing the stability of proneural proteins and interacting with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Xic1 to modulate neurogenic processes (Moore2018C8orf46). Additionally, VXN has been identified as a marker in Alzheimer's disease, associated with granulovacuolar degeneration, indicating its potential involvement in neurodegenerative pathways (Hondius2021The).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The VXN gene encodes the protein vexin, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its role in neurogenesis. Vexin is a direct target of neural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors such as Atoh7, Neurod1, and Neurog2, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation during neural differentiation (Moore2018C8orf46). Vexin cooperates with these neural bHLH factors to promote neurogenesis, potentially by enhancing the stability of proneural proteins (Moore2018C8orf46). 

Vexin also interacts with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Xic1, which is necessary for its function in inhibiting cell proliferation and enhancing neurogenesis. This interaction is demonstrated by co-injection experiments where Vexin and p27Xic1 functionally depend on each other to modulate neurogenic processes (Moore2018C8orf46). 

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, VXN is identified as a marker associated with granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD), where it is localized to GVD bodies. This suggests a potential interaction with other proteins involved in neurodegenerative processes, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Hondius2021The).
