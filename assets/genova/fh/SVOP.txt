# SVOP

## Overview
SVOP (SV2 related protein) is a gene that encodes a synaptic vesicle protein, which is part of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters. This protein is characterized by its evolutionary conservation and structural similarities to the SV2 protein family, particularly in its transmembrane regions. Unlike SV2, SVOP is a nonglycosylated protein, suggesting distinct functional roles despite their shared topology. The SVOP protein is primarily expressed in the brain and is thought to be involved in synaptic vesicle transport and neurotransmitter regulation, although its precise physiological function remains to be fully elucidated. It is highly enriched in synaptic vesicles across various brain regions, indicating a potential role in synaptic function and vesicular transport of charged molecules (Janz1998SVOP).

## Structure
SVOP (SV2 related protein) is a synaptic vesicle protein characterized by its evolutionary conservation and structural similarities to the SV2 family. The primary structure of SVOP consists of 548 amino acids, as identified in rat brain cDNA clones (Janz1998SVOP). The protein is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, a feature it shares with SV2 proteins, indicating a complex transmembrane topology (Janz1998SVOP).

SVOP is a nonglycosylated protein, as confirmed by experiments showing no change in molecular weight after treatment with PNGase F, which contrasts with the glycosylated nature of SV2 (Janz1998SVOP). The protein's hydrophobic nature is consistent with its role as a transporter, potentially for charged molecules, supported by conserved negatively charged amino acids in the first transmembrane region (Janz1998SVOP).

SVOP shares 20-22% sequence identity with SV2 isoforms and exhibits a similar transmembrane topology, though it lacks the large intravesicular glycosylated loop found in SV2 (Janz1998SVOP). The evolutionary conservation of SVOP, with 48% amino acid sequence identity between vertebrate and invertebrate forms, suggests a fundamental role across species (Janz1998SVOP).

## Function
SVOP (SV2 related protein) is a synaptic vesicle protein that is evolutionarily conserved and primarily expressed in the brain. It is thought to play a role in synaptic vesicle transport and neurotransmitter regulation, although its exact physiological function remains unclear (Janz1998SVOP). SVOP shares structural similarities with the SV2 protein family, particularly in the transmembrane regions, but differs in other structural aspects, such as the intravesicular loops and terminal regions (Janz1998SVOP). 

SVOP is highly enriched in synaptic vesicles, similar to SV2, and is present throughout various brain regions, including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (Janz1998SVOP). It is suggested that SVOP may function as a vesicular transporter for charged molecules, supported by the presence of conserved negatively charged amino acids in its transmembrane region, which may facilitate the transport of positively charged molecules (Janz1998SVOP). Despite these insights, no specific transport activity has been identified for SVOP, and further studies are needed to elucidate its precise role in synaptic function (Janz1998SVOP).

## Interactions
SVOP (SV2 related protein) is a synaptic vesicle protein that shares structural similarities with the SV2 protein family, including 12 transmembrane regions, but it is distinct in its lack of glycosylation. Despite its structural resemblance to SV2 proteins, specific protein interactions involving SVOP are not well-characterized. The protein is evolutionarily conserved and is primarily localized to synaptic vesicles and microvesicles in the brain and endocrine cells (Janz1998SVOP).

SVOP has been shown to copurify with synaptogyrin, a synaptic vesicle marker, indicating its presence on synaptic vesicles (Janz1998SVOP). This suggests a potential role in synaptic vesicle transport, although the exact nature of its interactions remains unclear. SVOP is also capable of binding adenine nucleotides, specifically NAD, via its C-terminal extremity, which may imply a functional role in synaptic vesicle dynamics (Bartholome2017Puzzling).

While SVOP's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not explicitly detailed, its evolutionary conservation and structural characteristics suggest it may participate in complex synaptic processes, potentially involving the transport of charged molecules (Janz1998SVOP).
