# HS6ST2

## Overview
HS6ST2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 2, which is involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a critical component of the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces. This enzyme is categorized as a sulfotransferase and is responsible for the transfer of sulfate groups to the 6th position of glucosamine residues within HS chains, a modification essential for the biological activity of HS. The activity of HS6ST2 is crucial for the regulation of various cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, adhesion, and migration, through its role in modulating interactions with heparin-binding growth factors and signaling pathways such as Wnt, TGF-β, and Notch (Wang2011Downregulated; Chen2023Pancancer). Mutations in the HS6ST2 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as X-linked intellectual disability and severe myopia, highlighting its significance in human health (Paganini2018A; Ouidja2022Variability).

## Function
HS6ST2 (heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 2) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS) by catalyzing the transfer of sulfate groups to the 6th position of glucosamine residues. This sulfation process is essential for the biological activity of HS, influencing its ability to bind to various growth factors and modulate cell signaling pathways. HS6ST2 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the formation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are key components of the extracellular matrix and cell surfaces (Wang2011Downregulated; Chen2023Pancancer).

In healthy human cells, HS6ST2 is involved in regulating cell growth, differentiation, adhesion, and migration by facilitating the interaction of HSPGs with heparin-binding factors such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), transforming growth factor (TGF), Wnt proteins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (Wang2011Downregulated). These interactions protect growth factors from proteolysis, enhancing their stability and availability for cellular processes. HS6ST2 also plays a role in signaling pathways like Wnt, TGF-β, and Notch, which are crucial for normal cellular communication and function (Chen2023Pancancer). The enzyme's activity is regulated by factors such as DNA methylation and microRNA, which can influence its role in cellular processes (Chen2023Pancancer).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HS6ST2 gene have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability and severe myopia. A study involving two male twins identified a novel c.916G>C (G306R) mutation in the HS6ST2 gene, which was maternally inherited. This mutation affects the 6-O-sulfotransferase domain of the enzyme, leading to a significant reduction in its enzymatic activity. The mutation alters the substrate binding site, impacting the enzyme's function and potentially its localization within the Golgi apparatus membrane. This disruption is linked to the clinical conditions observed in the twins, including intellectual disability and severe myopia (Paganini2018A).

The HS6ST2 gene is expressed in the brain and cartilage, and changes in its expression levels have been associated with intellectual disability and myopia. Although knockout mice for this gene develop normally, the absence of deleterious phenotypes may be due to compensatory mechanisms. The gene's involvement in neurological functions is suggested by its expression patterns and associated polymorphisms (Ouidja2022Variability). Despite the lack of known pathogenic variants, polymorphisms in HS6ST2 have been linked to these conditions, indicating its potential role in disease susceptibility (Ouidja2022Variability).
