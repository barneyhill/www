# DGCR6

## Overview
The DGCR6 gene, located on chromosome 22q11.2, encodes the DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 6 protein, a nuclear phosphoprotein involved in key developmental processes. This protein is characterized by its receptor-like function, attributed to a potential single transmembrane domain and phosphorylation sites, although it lacks homology with known receptor families (Hierck2004A). DGCR6 is highly expressed in the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle, and plays a crucial role in neural crest cell migration, which is vital for the development of structures such as the heart and face (Chakraborty2012Dysregulation; Gao2015DGCR6). The gene's expression and interaction with other genes in the DiGeorge critical region, such as TBX1, UFD1L, and HIRA, are essential for normal cardiovascular development, with disruptions linked to congenital conditions like DiGeorge syndrome (Gao2015DGCR6; Hierck2004A).

## Function
The DGCR6 gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that is involved in several critical developmental processes. It is highly expressed in the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle, and during embryogenesis, it shows widespread distribution with the highest expression in the pharyngeal arches and the central and peripheral nervous systems (Gao2015DGCR6). DGCR6 is implicated in neural crest cell migration, which is essential for the development of various structures, including the heart and face (Chakraborty2012Dysregulation). 

In terms of molecular function, DGCR6 is believed to have a receptor-like function due to its potential single transmembrane domain and phosphorylation sites, although it does not show functional homology to known receptor families (Hierck2004A). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Gao2015DGCR6). 

DGCR6 also plays a role in modulating the expression of other genes within the DiGeorge critical region, such as TBX1, UFD1L, and HIRA, suggesting a functional interaction between these gene products during normal development (Hierck2004A). This modulation is crucial for proper cardiovascular development, as evidenced by studies showing that disruption of DGCR6 expression leads to cardiovascular anomalies (Hierck2004A).

## Clinical Significance
The DGCR6 gene, located in the DiGeorge critical region on chromosome 22q11.2, is implicated in several congenital conditions, particularly those associated with DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) and related 22q11.2 deletion syndromes. Alterations in DGCR6 expression have been linked to cardiovascular anomalies, such as conotruncal heart defects, which are characteristic of DGS. Studies using chicken models have shown that suppression of DGCR6 in neural crest cells can lead to severe cardiovascular anomalies, including subarterial ventricular septal defects and double outlet right ventricle, mirroring the defects observed in DGS (Gao2015DGCR6; Hierck2004A).

DGCR6 is also involved in the regulation of other genes within the DiGeorge critical region, such as TBX-1, UFD1L, and HIRA. It represses TBX-1 and UFD1L while stimulating HIRA, suggesting a complex role in modifying the expression of these genes during embryonic development (Hierck2004A). Additionally, DGCR6 haploinsufficiency has been suggested to contribute to anal atresia in the context of 22q11 deletion syndrome, although this association remains classified as a variant of unknown significance (Özyavuz2021Molecular). These findings underscore the gene's potential role in the etiology of DGS and its associated phenotypes.
