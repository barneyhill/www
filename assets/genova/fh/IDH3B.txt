# IDH3B

## Overview
The IDH3B gene encodes the beta subunit of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD(+)) 3 enzyme, a non-catalytic component of the IDH3 complex, which is integral to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This enzyme complex is crucial for the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, a reaction that contributes to cellular energy production by generating NADH. The IDH3B subunit, while not directly involved in the catalytic activity, plays a vital structural role in the assembly and regulation of the IDH3 enzyme complex, which is a heterotetramer composed of αβ and αγ heterodimers. IDH3B is particularly significant in tissues with high energy demands, such as the testis, where it supports mitochondrial metabolism during spermiogenesis. Mutations in IDH3B have been linked to retinitis pigmentosa, highlighting its importance in retinal health (Hartong2008Insights; Zhu2022Isocitrate; Bergaggio2019WildType).

## Function
The IDH3B gene encodes the beta subunit of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3) enzyme, which is a critical component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. IDH3 is responsible for the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG), a reaction that also produces NADH from NAD+. This process is essential for mitochondrial respiration and energy production in cells (Zhu2022Isocitrate; Bergaggio2019WildType).

IDH3 is a heterotetramer composed of αβ and αγ heterodimers, with the IDH3B subunit playing a structural role necessary for the assembly and allosteric regulation of the enzyme complex. While the alpha subunit is primarily responsible for the catalytic activity, the beta and gamma subunits, including IDH3B, are crucial for the structural integrity and proper function of the enzyme (Zhu2022Isocitrate; Bergaggio2019WildType).

In healthy human cells, IDH3B is particularly important in tissues with high energy demands, such as the testis, where it supports mitochondrial metabolism during spermiogenesis. It helps maintain mitochondrial bioenergetics and is involved in the biogenesis of acrosomes and flagella, which are essential for sperm development (Zhu2022Isocitrate).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IDH3B gene have been associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a group of genetic disorders characterized by progressive retinal degeneration leading to vision loss. In humans, null mutations in IDH3B can result in the development of RP during adulthood (Findlay2018Mouse). The IDH3B gene is part of the IDH3 enzyme complex, which plays a crucial role in the citric acid cycle. Alterations in IDH3B expression or function can disrupt cellular metabolism and energy production, contributing to the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration (Hartong2008Insights).

In contrast to humans, Idh3b mutant mice do not exhibit retinal degeneration or altered mitochondrial function within six months of age, suggesting species-specific differences in the impact of IDH3B mutations (Findlay2018Mouse). This discrepancy may be due to compensatory mechanisms involving other isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes, such as IDH2, which might mitigate the effects of IDH3B loss in mice (Findlay2018Mouse). The study of IDH3B mutations provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying retinitis pigmentosa and highlights the importance of this gene in maintaining retinal health in humans.

## Interactions
IDH3B is a subunit of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 (IDH3) enzyme complex, which plays a crucial role in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The IDH3 enzyme is a heterotetramer composed of αβ and αγ heterodimers, where IDH3B is essential for the structural assembly and stability of the enzyme complex. The β subunit, which includes IDH3B, is critical for the assembly or stability of the αγ heterodimer in vivo, and its loss almost completely abolishes IDH3 activity in various tissues (Zhu2022Isocitrate). 

In Drosophila, mutations in the Idh3b gene, which encodes the beta subunit of the IDH3 enzyme, suggest that IDH3B physically interacts with the alpha and gamma subunits of the IDH3 complex. A missense mutation in the Idh3b gene may result in an inactive beta subunit that interferes with the activity of the alpha and gamma subunits, indicating a direct interaction within the enzyme complex (Duncan2017Mutants). 

While the specific physical interactions of IDH3B with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its role in the IDH3 enzyme complex are not detailed, its involvement in the assembly and function of the IDH3 complex is well-documented (Zhu2022Isocitrate).
