# DDX18

## Overview
DDX18 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 18, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family. This family is characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif, which is crucial for ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activities. The protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, RNA metabolism, and pre-mRNA splicing, primarily within the nucleolus. DEAD-box helicase 18 is also involved in the regulation of type I interferon production, acting as a negative regulator to maintain immune homeostasis during viral infections. In addition to its fundamental cellular functions, DDX18 has been implicated in cancer biology, where it influences tumorigenesis through interactions with microRNA processing machinery and cell cycle regulators (Sergeeva2021RNA; Xiao2021DEADbox; Linder2011From).

## Structure
DDX18 is a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. The primary structure of DDX18 includes a helicase core composed of two RecA-like domains, which are essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis, as well as RNA binding (Linder2011From; Feng2024DDX18). These domains form a cleft that closes to facilitate ATP binding and hydrolysis, crucial for the helicase's function (Linder2011From).

The secondary structure of DDX18 likely involves α-helices and β-sheets, typical of DEAD-box proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure includes the helicase core, which is highly conserved across the DEAD-box family, allowing for the binding and unwinding of RNA (Linder2011From).

DDX18's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins or RNA, as it functions within large complexes and can act as an RNA clamp or disassemble ribonucleoprotein particles (Linder2011From). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and splice variant isoforms may exist, but specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
DDX18 (DEAD-box helicase 18) is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, DDX18 plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and RNA metabolism. It is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it facilitates the processing and assembly of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), ensuring efficient ribosome production and protein synthesis (Sergeeva2021RNA; Rocak2004DEAD-box).

DDX18 is also involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, influencing the splicing of cell cycle regulators, which is crucial for proper cell cycle progression. Mutations in DDX18 can lead to delays in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cell division (Sergeeva2021RNA).

In addition to its role in RNA processing, DDX18 is implicated in the regulation of type I interferon (IFN) production. It interacts with the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in the nucleus, inhibiting its binding to the IFN-β promoter. This action serves as a negative regulatory mechanism to prevent excessive IFN production during viral infections, thereby maintaining immune homeostasis (Xiao2021DEADbox).

## Clinical Significance
DDX18, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicases, plays a significant role in the progression of various cancers due to its involvement in RNA-associated functions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), DDX18 is upregulated and linked to poor patient survival, promoting tumor immune escape by activating STAT1 expression (Feng2024DDX18). In gastric cancer, DDX18 facilitates tumorigenesis by aiding the maturation of microRNA-21 through the AKT signaling pathway (Feng2024DDX18). 

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), DDX18 is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. Its knockdown in LUAD cell lines inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration, indicating its oncogenic role. Conversely, overexpression in non-malignant lung cells enhances proliferation and migration (Feng2024DDX18). DDX18 promotes LUAD tumorigenesis by facilitating cell cycle progression through the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) (Feng2024DDX18). Knockdown of DDX18 results in G1 cell cycle arrest and upregulation of apoptosis-related genes, such as CDKN1A (P21) and BAX, promoting apoptosis in LUAD cells (Feng2024DDX18). These findings suggest that DDX18's role in cancer is context-dependent, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Feng2024DDX18).

## Interactions
DDX18, a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, is involved in several protein and nucleic acid interactions that influence various cellular processes. In the context of antiviral responses, DDX18 interacts with the transcription factor IRF3 in the nucleus. This interaction occurs through the helicase core domain of DDX18 and results in the disruption of IRF3's binding to the interferon-β (IFN-β) promoter, thereby negatively regulating type I interferon production during viral infections (Xiao2021DEADbox).

In cancer biology, DDX18 has been shown to interact with components of the microRNA processing machinery. Specifically, it interacts with Drosha, a key enzyme in the maturation of microRNAs, such as microRNA-21, which plays a role in gastric cancer progression. This interaction affects the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, contributing to tumorigenesis (Zhang2021The).

In lung adenocarcinoma, DDX18 potentially binds to the CDK4 promoter, influencing cell cycle progression. This interaction is suggested by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, indicating a regulatory role in CDK4 transcription (Feng2024DDX18).
