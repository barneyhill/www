# DCTN3

## Overview
DCTN3 is a gene that encodes the protein dynactin subunit 3, a critical component of the dynactin complex. This complex is integral to intracellular transport processes, functioning as a linker between dynein motor proteins and their cargo, thereby facilitating the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. Dynactin subunit 3 is categorized as a structural protein within the dynactin complex, contributing to its assembly and stability, which is essential for maintaining cellular organization and function (Figley2014Profilin; Schroer2004DYNACTIN). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly near microtubule organizing centers, and plays a vital role in processes such as mitosis, endocytosis, and neuronal migration (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). Alterations in DCTN3 expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (KuźmaKozakiewicz2013Dynactin; Abba2007Breast).

## Function
DCTN3, also known as dynactin subunit 3, is a component of the dynactin complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular transport by linking dynein motor proteins to their cargo. This complex is essential for the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules, maintaining cellular organization and function (Figley2014Profilin; Schroer2004DYNACTIN). DCTN3 is involved in protein-protein interactions that contribute to the assembly and stability of the dynactin complex, facilitating its role in cellular transport mechanisms (KuźmaKozakiewicz2013Dynactin; Schroer2004DYNACTIN).

In healthy human cells, DCTN3 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly near microtubule organizing centers, where it participates in the transport of RNA-protein particles and the centripetal movement of pathogenic inclusions and protein aggregates towards the cell center (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). This activity is vital for processes such as mitosis, endocytosis, and maintaining cellular organization. The dynactin complex, including DCTN3, is also involved in organizing signaling molecules and maintaining microtubule arrays at centrosomes and spindle poles, which are essential for cell cycle progression and neuronal migration (Schroer2004DYNACTIN).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DCTN3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. In breast cancer, DCTN3 is significantly overexpressed in lymph node-positive carcinomas and is associated with tumor recurrence within six years. This overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and suggests that DCTN3 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for breast cancer progression (Abba2007Breast).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), DCTN3 is overexpressed across all age groups and is associated with poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival. This overexpression correlates with advanced cancer stages and higher tumor grades, indicating a negative impact on patient outcomes (Ullah2022A).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), DCTN3 expression is altered in the central nervous system. In sporadic ALS cases, DCTN3 protein levels are reduced in the spinal cord, which may contribute to motor neuron degeneration due to impaired axonal transport (KuźmaKozakiewicz2013Dynactin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of DCTN3 in both cancer and neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
DCTN3, a subunit of the dynactin complex, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by interacting with other proteins. It is responsible for the attachment of DCTN1 to DCTN2 within the dynactin complex, which consists of ten subunits in total (Fan2015Aberrant). This complex is essential for dynein-mediated intracellular transport, facilitating processes such as ER-to-Golgi transport, spindle formation, and chromosome movement. DCTN3, in conjunction with dynein, is involved in regulating mitosis and is suggested to play a role in the spindle assembly checkpoint by recruiting PLK1 to kinetochores, which aids in the phosphorylation of downstream targets (Fan2015Aberrant).

Overexpression of DCTN3 can disrupt the dynactin complex, leading to impaired spindle assembly and microtubule aggregation. This disruption occurs because DCTN3 binds to endogenous competitive subunits when DCTN2 expression is upregulated, destabilizing the shoulder structure that links the DCTN1 arm to the ARP1 filament. This destabilization results in reduced expression of DCTN6, which can lead to decreased PLK1 recruitment and expression (Fan2015Aberrant). The regulatory interaction between DCTN3 and PLK1 is crucial for maintaining embryonic euploidy and proper oocyte development (Fan2015Aberrant).
