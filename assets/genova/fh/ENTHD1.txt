# ENTHD1

## Overview
ENTHD1 (ENTH domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of an Epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain, which is integral to its function in cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and signal transduction. The ENTH domain facilitates the binding of phosphoinositides, which are crucial for membrane curvature and vesicle formation, thereby playing a significant role in endocytic pathways. These pathways are essential for cellular uptake and membrane dynamics, underscoring the protein's involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and communication. ENTHD1's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to endocytosis, nutrient uptake, receptor recycling, and signal transduction, highlighting its importance in cellular physiology and integrity (Li2021Differentially).

## Function
ENTHD1 (ENTH domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes such as membrane trafficking and signal transduction. The protein contains an ENTH domain, which is known for its ability to bind phosphoinositides, molecules that play a significant role in membrane curvature and vesicle formation. This binding capability is essential for the protein's involvement in endocytic pathways, which are crucial for the cellular uptake of molecules and maintaining membrane dynamics (Li2021Differentially).

In healthy human cells, ENTHD1 is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and communication by participating in endocytosis. This process is vital for the regulation of various cellular activities, including nutrient uptake, receptor recycling, and signal transduction. The protein's role in these pathways underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and organismal health (Li2021Differentially).

Although specific details about the function of ENTHD1 in healthy human cells are not extensively documented, its involvement in endocytosis and membrane dynamics suggests a fundamental role in cellular physiology and the maintenance of cellular integrity (Li2021Differentially).

## Clinical Significance
ENTHD1 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its mutations and altered expression levels. In metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), ENTHD1 is frequently mutated, suggesting a potential role in the progression of this cancer type. The gene was identified as novel and not previously characterized in any cancer type, indicating its emerging significance in cancer research (Gara2018Metastatic). 

In thyroid carcinoma, ENTHD1 is part of an eight-gene signature used to predict prognosis and immunotherapy response. This signature, derived from exhausted CD8+ T lymphocytes, correlates with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which is associated with poorer prognosis and reduced response to immunotherapy (Li2024Novel).

ENTHD1 has also been linked to developmental language disorder (DLD) through a genome-wide association study. A frameshift deletion in ENTHD1 was identified in individuals with DLD, suggesting its involvement in the genetic architecture of this condition (Kornilov2016GenomeWide). 

These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of ENTHD1 in various diseases, although further research is needed to fully understand its role and therapeutic implications.
