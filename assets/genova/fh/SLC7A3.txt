# SLC7A3

## Overview
SLC7A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 7 member 3, also known as cationic amino acid transporter 3 (CAT-3). This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 7 and functions as a transmembrane transporter, facilitating the sodium-independent transport of cationic amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and ornithine across the plasma membrane (Closs2006Structure). The transport activity of CAT-3 is crucial for maintaining amino acid homeostasis, which is essential for various cellular processes, including protein synthesis, nitric oxide production, and cellular growth (Rebsamen2022Gainoffunction). The gene is highly intolerant to variation, indicating that complete loss of function is likely lethal (Nava2015Hypomorphic). SLC7A3 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including autism spectrum disorders and papillary thyroid carcinoma, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Shen2018Upregulation; Nava2015Hypomorphic).

## Structure
The SLC7A3 gene encodes the cationic amino acid transporter 3 (CAT-3), which is part of the solute carrier family 7. This protein is characterized by 14 predicted transmembrane domains, which are typical of transporters in this family, facilitating the transport of cationic amino acids in a Na+-independent manner (Closs2006Structure). The CAT-3 protein is involved in the uptake and efflux of cationic amino acids, such as arginine, ornithine, and lysine, which are crucial for various cellular functions, including neuronal development and plasticity (Nava2015Hypomorphic).

The molecular structure of CAT-3 includes intracellular N- and C-termini, with specific amino acid sequences influencing its transport properties (Closs2006Structure). The protein's structure is similar to other members of the SLC7 family, such as CAT-1 and CAT-2B, which also have a system y+-like transporter function (Closs2006Structure). Although specific post-translational modifications for SLC7A3 are not detailed in the context, such modifications are common in transporter proteins and may include phosphorylation. The gene is highly intolerant to variation, with no premature termination codons found in large control populations, suggesting that complete loss of function is lethal (Nava2015Hypomorphic).

## Function
SLC7A3, a member of the solute carrier family 7, functions as a cationic amino acid transporter, primarily facilitating the uptake of essential amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and ornithine across the plasma membrane. This transport is crucial for maintaining amino acid homeostasis, which is vital for protein synthesis, nitric oxide production, and cellular growth (Closs2006Structure; Rebsamen2022Gainoffunction). 

In healthy human cells, SLC7A3 plays a significant role in overcoming nutrient limitations by increasing the uptake of arginine and lysine, thereby supporting cellular fitness and proliferation under conditions of amino acid scarcity (Rebsamen2022Gainoffunction). The transporter is active in the plasma membrane, where it contributes to metabolic adaptation and cell fate decisions by modulating intracellular concentrations of these amino acids (Rebsamen2022Gainoffunction). 

SLC7A3 is part of the system y+-like transporters, which operate in a sodium-independent manner, allowing the influx and efflux of cationic amino acids. This system is resistant to inhibition by large neutral amino acids in the presence of sodium, distinguishing it from other transport systems (Closs2006Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLC7A3 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), hypomorphic variants of SLC7A3 have been identified in males, leading to a loss of function of the cationic amino acid transporter 3 (CAT-3). This dysfunction is thought to impair critical metabolic pathways involving arginine, lysine, and ornithine, potentially reducing nitric oxide synthesis and impairing mTOR signaling, both of which are implicated in ASD (Nava2015Hypomorphic).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), higher expression levels of SLC7A3 are associated with poorer patient outcomes, including increased mortality. This suggests that SLC7A3 expression may serve as a prognostic marker for PTC (Shen2018Upregulation).

SLC7A3 has also been proposed as a candidate gene for epilepsy and developmental delays, as variants have been identified in patients with these neurological issues (Sourbron2021SLC7A3:).

In zebrafish, the absence of the homologous slc7a3a gene leads to hepatic steatosis during fasting, highlighting its role in lipid metabolism and nitric oxide production, which may have implications for similar conditions in humans (Gu2014Genetic).
