# SAA2

## Overview
The SAA2 gene encodes the serum amyloid A2 protein, a member of the serum amyloid A family, which plays a critical role in the acute-phase response to inflammation. This protein is primarily synthesized in the liver and is categorized as an apolipoprotein due to its association with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Serum amyloid A2 is involved in lipid metabolism and immune modulation, facilitating cholesterol transport and influencing inflammatory processes. It interacts with various receptors and molecules, including TLR2, TLR4, and glycosaminoglycans, which are essential for its function in immune signaling and potential involvement in amyloid-related diseases. The expression of SAA2 is upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli, and its dysregulation is linked to several metabolic and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Abouelasrar2023Acuteserum; Sack2020Serum; Buck2016Structure).

## Structure
Serum amyloid A2 (SAA2) is a protein composed of approximately 104 amino acids, sharing over 90% sequence identity with SAA1 (Buck2016Structure). The primary structure of SAA2 includes specific regions such as a glycine-proline-glycine-glycine sequence at residues 48-51, which is a calcium-binding site, and an arginine-glycine-asparagine sequence between residues 39 and 41, similar to a cell-binding domain of fibronectin (Buck2016Structure).

The secondary structure of SAA2 is characterized by a low alpha-helical content, approximately 15%, with the main elements being beta-sheets and turns (McCubbin1988Circulardichroism). The presence of calcium ions and glycosaminoglycans like chondroitin 6-sulphate and heparan sulphate can alter its secondary structure, affecting its alpha-helical and beta-sheet content (McCubbin1988Circulardichroism).

SAA2 can form quaternary structures as part of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) complexes, which are crucial during the acute phase response (Buck2016Structure). The protein's interaction with glycosaminoglycans and its structural dynamics are important for its function and potential role in amyloid-related diseases (Jin2019Comparative).

## Function
The SAA2 gene encodes the serum amyloid A2 protein, which is part of the acute-phase response to inflammation. In healthy human cells, SAA2 is primarily produced by the liver and plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and lipid metabolism. SAA2 proteins are highly lipophilic and function as apolipoproteins of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), facilitating cholesterol transport and recycling. They promote cholesterol ester hydrolase activity and reduce macrophage acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) activity, which aids in cholesterol transport back to the liver (Sack2020Serum).

SAA2 is also involved in the acute-phase response, where it is rapidly upregulated in response to inflammatory stimuli such as infections or trauma. This response is crucial for survival during acute polymicrobial sepsis, as demonstrated in mouse models (Sack2020Serum). The protein is active in the extracellular space, influencing processes like cell adhesion and migration, and is implicated in immune cell recruitment to sites of inflammation (Jumeau2019Expression). While the specific functions of SAA2 in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in these processes suggests a role in maintaining immune homeostasis and lipid transport.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SAA2 gene are associated with several inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Elevated levels of SAA2, along with SAA1, are observed in response to inflammatory stimuli and are linked to conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (den2023Serum). In obesity, SAA2 is overexpressed in subcutaneous white adipose tissue, particularly in individuals with LEPR mutations, and is associated with increased inflammation and amyloidosis (Poitou2005Serum). The overexpression of SAA2 in adipose tissue may contribute to systemic inflammation and the development of amyloidosis, where abnormal protein deposits accumulate in organs, potentially leading to organ dysfunction (Buck2016Structure).

SAA2 expression is also significantly elevated during acute inflammatory responses, such as sepsis and viral infections, and is considered a better predictor of coronary artery disease and cancer outcomes than C-reactive protein (CRP) (den2023Serum). The gene's expression is regulated by cytokines like IL-6, which plays a crucial role in the synergistic induction of SAA2 during inflammation (Hagihara2004IL6). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SAA2 in chronic inflammatory conditions and its potential role in disease progression.

## Interactions
Serum amyloid A2 (SAA2) is known for its interactions with various proteins and receptors, playing a significant role in inflammation and immune responses. SAA2 binds to high-density lipoproteins (HDL), becoming a major apolipoprotein associated with HDL during the acute phase response. This interaction is crucial for its role in lipid transport and metabolism (Buck2016Structure).

SAA2 also interacts with cell surface receptors such as TLR2 and TLR4, which are involved in immune signaling pathways. These interactions can influence inflammatory responses, highlighting SAA2's role in modulating immune functions (Gursky2020Structural). Additionally, SAA2 can bind to the Formyl Peptide Receptor 2 (FPR2) at both allosteric and orthosteric sites, which may explain its varied biological functions, including the regulation of T-helper 17 (Th17) cell-mediated immune responses (Abouelasrar2023Acuteserum).

SAA2's interaction with glycosaminoglycans, such as hyaluronic acid, is also significant. These interactions are implicated in the formation of amyloid fibrils, with SAA2 showing different binding interfaces compared to other SAA isoforms, which may influence its pathogenicity (Jin2019Comparative). These diverse interactions underscore the multifaceted role of SAA2 in physiological and pathological processes.
