# LELP1

## Overview
LELP1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as late cornified envelope like proline rich 1, which is involved in skin biology. This protein is categorized as part of the epidermal differentiation complex, a group of proteins that play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier. The LELP1 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD), a common inflammatory skin condition, through its association with specific genetic polymorphisms that affect disease severity and risk (Trzeciak2020Expression; Trzeciak2016Association). The expression of LELP1 is notably higher in the skin of individuals with AD compared to healthy controls, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathophysiology (Trzeciak2020Expression). Additionally, the gene is under positive selection, indicating its evolutionary importance in skin barrier function and immune response (Goodwin2017Recent).

## Clinical Significance
The LELP1 gene has been associated with atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic inflammatory skin condition. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in LELP1, rs7534334, has been linked to an increased risk and severity of AD. The CC genotype of this SNP is more prevalent in patients with AD, being present in 46% of the AD group, which is twice as frequent as in the control group. This genotype is associated with elevated serum IgE levels, eosinophilia, and concomitant asthma, indicating a more severe disease course (Trzeciak2016Association). The presence of the CC genotype and the C-allele of rs7534334 increases the risk of AD, particularly in patients without filaggrin (FLG) mutations (Trzeciak2016Association).

LELP1 expression is significantly higher in AD skin compared to healthy controls, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (Trzeciak2020Expression). The gene is also part of the epidermal differentiation complex, which is undergoing positive selection, indicating its potential role in skin barrier function and immune response (Goodwin2017Recent). These findings highlight LELP1 as a potential genetic marker for AD risk and progression.
