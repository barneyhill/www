# HAPLN1

## Overview
HAPLN1, or hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1, is a gene that encodes a vital component of the extracellular matrix, specifically a link protein that plays a crucial role in stabilizing the interactions between hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans. The protein encoded by HAPLN1 is characterized by its immunoglobulin domain and proteoglycan tandem repeat domains, which are essential for its binding functions. This protein is integral to maintaining the structural integrity of various tissues, including cartilage and the central nervous system, by facilitating the formation of proteoglycan aggregates and perineuronal nets. Beyond its structural roles, HAPLN1 is involved in cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation, with implications in reproductive biology and vascular health. Alterations in HAPLN1 expression have been linked to several pathological conditions, including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, highlighting its clinical significance (Liu2010Periovulatory; Oohashi2015The; Chen2022HAPLN1).

## Structure
HAPLN1, also known as hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1, is a component of the extracellular matrix characterized by a specific domain structure. The protein includes a signal peptide, an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, and two proteoglycan tandem repeat (PTR) domains, also referred to as link modules (Huynh2018Hyaluronan; Spicer2003A). These link modules are crucial for binding to hyaluronan, a key function of HAPLN1 (Oohashi2015The).

The link module is approximately 100 amino acids long and is essential for the protein's interaction with hyaluronan. It features a conserved backbone topology similar to the C-type lectin domain, consisting of two α-helices and two antiparallel β-sheets arranged around a large hydrophobic core (Spicer2003A). The Ig domain is important for binding to aggrecan, indicating a role in stabilizing proteoglycan aggregates (Spicer2003A).

HAPLN1 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, although the glycosylation sites are located upstream of the PTR domains (Huynh2018Hyaluronan). The protein may also exist in different splice variant isoforms, which can affect its structure and function (Huynh2018Hyaluronan).

## Function
HAPLN1, or hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1, is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in various tissues, where it stabilizes interactions between hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans. This stabilization is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues such as cartilage and the central nervous system. In cartilage, HAPLN1 facilitates the formation of proteoglycan aggregates, which are vital for the tissue's load-bearing properties (Oohashi2015The). In the brain, HAPLN1 is involved in the formation and stabilization of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are important for neuronal function and plasticity (Oohashi2015The).

HAPLN1 also plays a role in the proliferation and differentiation of cells. In the ovary, it is upregulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and promotes granulosa cell survival and differentiation into luteal cells, which is crucial for ovulation and luteal formation (Liu2010Periovulatory). In hair follicles, HAPLN1 is expressed predominantly during the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle, promoting the proliferation of hair matrix cells and contributing to hair growth (Ha2023Novel). Additionally, HAPLN1 is involved in maintaining the contractile phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells, potentially preventing pathological changes associated with atherosclerosis (Zhou2023Hyaluronic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HAPLN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), HAPLN1 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to healthy tissues, and this upregulation is associated with worse patient outcomes. It is significantly enriched in the basal subtype of PDAC, which is linked to lower overall survival rates. High HAPLN1 expression is also associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting a role in cancer progression and metastasis (Wiedmann2023HAPLN1).

In malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), HAPLN1 is overexpressed, with a 23-fold increase compared to normal peritoneum. This overexpression is linked to faster disease progression and poorer survival, indicating its protumorigenic role. The gene's locus is frequently amplified in MPM tumors, contributing to its increased expression (Ivanova2009Protumorigenic).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), HAPLN1 expression is significantly decreased, correlating with shorter survival periods. This reduction is more pronounced in advanced stages of CRC, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Wang2021Loss).

HAPLN1 is also implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, where its upregulation is associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype in fibroblast-like synoviocytes, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Chen2022HAPLN1).

## Interactions
HAPLN1, or hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1, participates in several significant protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In multiple myeloma (MM), HAPLN1 interacts with chaperonin 60 (CH60) on the plasma membrane of MM cells. This interaction is crucial for activating NF-κB signaling, which leads to the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes and contributes to drug resistance in MM cells. CH60, traditionally a mitochondrial chaperone, localizes to the plasma membrane under stress conditions and forms a complex with TLR4, facilitating HAPLN1-induced signaling (De2022Ectopic).

HAPLN1 is also involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM) by stabilizing interactions between hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans such as aggrecan and versican. These interactions are essential for the structural integrity of tissues like cartilage and the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) matrix, which is vital for ovulation and fertilization (Liu2010Periovulatory; Evanko2020A). In malignant pleural mesothelioma, the NH2-terminal immunoglobulin domain of HAPLN1 mediates tumorigenic functions, enhancing cell proliferation and motility through interactions with aggrecan and hyaluronic acid (Ivanova2009Protumorigenic).
