# VPS11

## Overview
The VPS11 gene encodes a protein that serves as a core subunit of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are integral to endosomal and lysosomal trafficking within human cells. The VPS11 protein, characterized by its RING-H2 domain, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in protein ubiquitination and stability (Zhang2016A). This protein is crucial for the fusion of endocytic vesicles with early endosomes and the subsequent fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes, processes essential for cellular homeostasis and the degradation of cellular components (Skoff2021Characterization; Zhang2016A). Structurally, VPS11 features domains such as a Clathrin repeat and a RING-H2 finger, which are vital for its functional specificity and interactions within the HOPS and CORVET complexes (Huizing2001Molecular). Mutations in the VPS11 gene have been linked to various neurodegenerative and developmental disorders, underscoring its significance in central nervous system development and function (Zhang2016A).

## Structure
The VPS11 protein is a core component of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are involved in endosomal and lysosomal trafficking. The human VPS11 mRNA is approximately 4.3 kb in length and encodes a protein of 941 amino acids with a predicted mass of 107.8 kDa (Huizing2001Molecular). The protein contains several important domains, including a Clathrin repeat domain located between amino acids 411-535 and a RING-H2 finger domain between amino acids 822-860, which are crucial for its functional specificity (Huizing2001Molecular).

Structurally, VPS11 is predicted to have an N-terminal β-propeller followed by a C-terminal α-solenoid, which are common features in vesicle coat and nuclear pore proteins (Plemel2011Subunit). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of VPS11 is essential for its role in the HOPS and CORVET complexes, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as Vps3 and Vps39 (Plemel2011Subunit). These interactions are critical for the assembly and function of the complexes, linking Rab signaling to SNARE-mediated membrane fusion (Plemel2011Subunit).

VPS11 is part of the quaternary structure of the HOPS complex, where it forms a trimer with Vps39 and Vps18, contributing to the complex's flexible and elongated architecture (Bröcker2012Molecular). The protein's RING finger domain is functionally important for endolysosomal trafficking, although it is not essential for the assembly of the HOPS complex (Plemel2011Subunit).

## Function
The VPS11 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are essential for endosomal and lysosomal trafficking in human cells. These complexes facilitate the fusion of endocytic vesicles with early endosomes and the subsequent fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes, playing a critical role in cellular homeostasis and the degradation of cellular components (Skoff2021Characterization; Zhang2016A). VPS11 contains a RING-H2 domain, which exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, crucial for regulating protein stability through ubiquitination (Zhang2016A). This activity is important for maintaining the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, which is vital for lipid metabolism and myelination (Zhang2016A).

In healthy human cells, VPS11 is involved in the regulation of autophagy, a process essential for the degradation and recycling of cellular components, particularly under conditions of nutrient starvation (Zhang2016A). It is also implicated in the proper functioning of the endolysosomal system, impacting cellular signaling and development (Segala2019Vps11). VPS11 is strongly expressed in oligodendrocytes, where it is associated with myelin maintenance and neuron-to-glial communication (Skoff2021Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the VPS11 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative and developmental disorders. A notable mutation, c.2536T>G (p.C846G), has been identified as the cause of a novel autosomal recessive leukoencephalopathy syndrome. This condition is characterized by brain myelination defects, severe motor skill deficits, cortical blindness or optic atrophy, intellectual disability, and seizures. The mutation affects the RING-H2 domain of the VPS11 protein, leading to decreased protein stability and increased ubiquitination, which likely accelerates protein turnover. This mutation is particularly prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, where it is considered a founder mutation (Zhang2016A).

The VPS11 mutation impairs autophagy flux, as demonstrated in human cells and animal models, such as zebrafish, which show reduced myelination and significant neuronal death. This suggests that VPS11 plays a crucial role in central nervous system development (Zhang2016A). Additionally, the mutation disrupts the VPS11-VPS18 complex assembly, further contributing to the pathogenesis of the leukoencephalopathy syndrome (Zhang2016A).

In another study, a different VPS11 variant, c.136C>T (p.P46S), was linked to adult-onset generalized dystonia, highlighting the gene's involvement in lysosomal and autophagic abnormalities (Monfrini2021A).

## Interactions
VPS11 is a core subunit of the CORVET and HOPS complexes, which are essential for endosomal and lysosomal trafficking. It interacts with several other proteins to form these complexes, including VPS18, VPS16, and VPS33A. These interactions are crucial for the vesicle tethering and fusion processes within the cell. VPS11 serves as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of the HOPS and CORVET complexes, which are involved in the transition from early to late endosomes and lysosome biogenesis (Morlon‐Guyot2015Toxoplasma).

In Toxoplasma gondii, VPS11 interacts with proteins such as TgRab7 and TgVps39, indicating a role in vesicular transport to vacuolar compartments and secretory organelles. The depletion of VPS11 affects the targeting of TgRab7, suggesting a potential interaction between Rab7 and the complex containing VPS11 (Morlon‐Guyot2015Toxoplasma). Additionally, VPS11 interacts with the retromer complex, as indicated by the altered labeling of TgVps35 in the absence of VPS11, suggesting a probable interaction between the retromer complex and the HOPS-like complex containing VPS11 (Morlon‐Guyot2015Toxoplasma).

VPS11 also functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, influencing signaling pathways by ubiquitinating specific proteins. It interacts with PELP1, affecting the phosphorylation of ERα, which is crucial for its activity. This interaction is independent of its role in endosomal trafficking (Segala2019Vps11).
