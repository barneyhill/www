# SCYGR8

## Overview
SCYGR8 is a gene that encodes the protein small cysteine and glycine repeat containing 8, which is characterized by its unique sequence of cysteine and glycine repeats. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are still under investigation. It is categorized as a structural protein due to its role in maintaining cellular architecture and integrity. The expression of SCYGR8 has been linked to several signaling pathways, including the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which is significant in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and regulation of SCYGR8 is crucial for elucidating its potential implications in human health and disease.
