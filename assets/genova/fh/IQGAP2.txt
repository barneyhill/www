# IQGAP2

## Overview
IQGAP2 is a gene that encodes the IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 2, a scaffolding protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell signaling pathways. This protein is characterized by several structural domains, including a calponin homology domain, a WW domain, and multiple IQ motifs, which facilitate interactions with actin filaments and calmodulin. Despite its structural similarity to RasGAPs, IQGAP2 does not exhibit GTPase-activating protein activity but instead modulates the activity of Rho family GTPases, such as Cdc42 and Rac1, by maintaining them in their active GTP-bound forms. Predominantly expressed in the liver, IQGAP2 plays a crucial role in cellular architecture, influencing cell shape and motility. It is also recognized for its tumor suppressor function, with its downregulation linked to hepatocellular carcinoma and metabolic dysregulation (Vaitheesvaran2014Role; Dai2022Comprehensive; Brill1996The).

## Structure
The IQGAP2 protein is structurally similar to IQGAP1, with a molecular mass of approximately 180,620 Da. It is composed of several key domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region contains a calponin homology (CH) domain, which is involved in actin binding and is located between residues 44 to 152 (Brill1996The). The protein also features five IQGAP-specific repeat motifs and a single WW domain, which is a putative protein interaction domain starting at residue 594 (Brill1996The).

IQGAP2 contains four IQ motifs, which are involved in calmodulin (CaM) binding. These motifs are located at residues 660, 690, 720, and 750, and are generally α-helical, although the first IQ motif forms transient interactions with CaM in the absence of calcium (Atcheson2011IQmotif; Brill1996The). The C-terminal region of IQGAP2 includes a RasGAP-related domain (GRD) that interacts with small GTPases like CDC42 and Rac1, although it does not exhibit GAP activity (Ozdemir2018Unraveling; Brill1996The).

IQGAP2 is predominantly expressed in the liver and has been observed in certain liver cancer cell lines, suggesting its expression in hepatocytes (Brill1996The). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. An alternatively spliced testicular form of IQGAP2 has been identified, which contains only three IQ motifs (Atcheson2011IQmotif).

## Function
IQGAP2 is a scaffolding protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in the liver and is involved in modulating the activity of Rho family GTPases, particularly Cdc42 and Rac1, by inhibiting their GTP hydrolysis. This inhibition suggests that IQGAP2 helps maintain these GTPases in their active GTP-bound forms, which is crucial for the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular signaling processes (Brill1996The).

IQGAP2 contains several structural domains, including a calponin homology domain, a WW domain, and multiple IQ motifs, which facilitate its interactions with actin filaments and calmodulin. These interactions are essential for its role in cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction (Brill1996The). Despite its structural similarity to RasGAPs, IQGAP2 does not stimulate the GTPase activity of Ras, indicating a unique mechanism of action distinct from traditional GTPase-activating proteins (Brill1996The).

In addition to its role in cytoskeletal dynamics, IQGAP2 is implicated in maintaining cellular architecture and influencing cell shape and motility, contributing to the overall cellular function and organismal outcomes (Brill1996The).

## Clinical Significance
IQGAP2 is a tumor suppressor gene predominantly expressed in the liver, and its downregulation or loss is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In HCC, decreased IQGAP2 levels lead to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which enhances cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Dai2022Comprehensive). IQGAP2-deficient mice exhibit a high incidence of HCC, with studies showing that over 80% of these mice develop the condition by 18-24 months of age (Schmidt2008Development). The absence of IQGAP2 results in the upregulation of IQGAP1, which destabilizes the E-cadherin-β-catenin axis, further promoting carcinogenesis (Schmidt2008Development).

IQGAP2 deficiency is also linked to metabolic dysregulation, predisposing individuals to conditions such as diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which are risk factors for HCC. Mice lacking IQGAP2 show metabolic inflexibility, fasting hyperglycemia, and obesity, with altered regulation of glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipid homeostasis (Vaitheesvaran2014Role). These metabolic changes suggest a potential link between IQGAP2 deficiency, diabetes, and cancer (Vaitheesvaran2014Role).

## Interactions
IQGAP2 is a scaffolding protein that interacts with several proteins, particularly within the Rho family of GTPases. It binds prominently to Cdc42 and, to a lesser extent, Rac1, but does not interact with other members of the Ras GTPase superfamily such as H-Ras, RhoA, RhoE, or Ran (Brill1996The). The interaction with Cdc42 and Rac1 is independent of their nucleotide binding status and involves the C-terminal half of IQGAP2 (Brill1996The). IQGAP2 inhibits both the intrinsic and RhoGAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis rates of Cdc42 and Rac1, suggesting it may stabilize their active GTP-bound forms (Brill1996The).

IQGAP2 also interacts with calmodulin through its IQ motifs, as demonstrated by coprecipitation experiments (Brill1996The). The protein contains a potential actin-binding domain, indicating a role in actin cytoskeleton organization (Brill1996The). Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that Cdc42 binds to both the Ex-domain and the RasGAP site of IQGAP2, promoting dimerization and actin polymerization, whereas Rac1 binds only to the RasGAP site (Ozdemir2018Unraveling). These interactions are crucial for cellular processes such as cell motility and metastasis (Ozdemir2018Unraveling).
