# IDS

## Overview
The IDS gene encodes the enzyme iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS), a lysosomal sulfatase critical for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. This enzyme is a glycoprotein that functions as an exosulfatase, specifically hydrolyzing the C2-sulfate ester bond from non-reducing-terminal iduronic acid residues in GAGs, thereby preventing their accumulation within lysosomes (MoralesÁlvarez2016Bioinformatic; Wilson1990Hunter). The IDS protein is characterized by a compact alpha/beta sandwich fold and is stabilized by disulfide bonds, with calcium ions playing a crucial role in its catalytic activity (Demydchuk2017Insights). Mutations in the IDS gene can lead to Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), or Hunter syndrome, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder marked by the pathological accumulation of GAGs, resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations (D’Avanzo2020Mucopolysaccharidosis; Mashima2017Minireview).

## Structure
The human gene IDS encodes the enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS), which is a glycoprotein involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans. The mature IDS protein is a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 76 kDa when glycosylated and 58 kDa when deglycosylated (Demydchuk2017Insights). The primary structure of IDS consists of a polypeptide chain of 550 amino acids, with the first 33 residues forming a signal peptide and propeptide that are cleaved during secretion (Demydchuk2017Insights).

The secondary structure of IDS includes a compact, globular alpha/beta sandwich fold, with a central 7-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices and helical turns (Demydchuk2017Insights). The protein is divided into two subdomains: SD1 (residues 34-443), which contains the catalytic core, and SD2 (residues 455-550), which consists of a twisted, 4-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (Demydchuk2017Insights).

The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, with six cysteines forming crucial disulfide bridges (Demydchuk2017Insights). The active site of IDS is located within SD1 and includes a metal ion, typically calcium, which is essential for catalytic activity (Demydchuk2017Insights). The enzyme undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, which are important for its stability and function (Demydchuk2017Insights).

## Function
The IDS gene encodes the enzyme iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS), which plays a crucial role in the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specifically heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. In healthy human cells, IDS functions as an exosulfatase within lysosomes, where it hydrolyzes the C2-sulfate ester bond from non-reducing-terminal iduronic acid residues in these GAGs. This enzymatic activity is essential for the proper breakdown and recycling of these complex molecules, preventing their accumulation within lysosomes (MoralesÁlvarez2016Bioinformatic; Wilson1990Hunter).

The enzyme is part of a family of sulfatases that hydrolyze sulfate esters in human cells, all of which are lysosomal enzymes acting on sulfated monosaccharide residues in various complex substrates. IDS displays absolute substrate specificity, a characteristic feature of the sulfatase family (Wilson1990Hunter). The proper function of IDS is critical for cellular waste management and normal tissue function, as its deficiency can lead to the accumulation of GAGs, resulting in cellular and tissue dysfunction (CoronadoPons2004Identification). The IDS gene is located on the X chromosome, and its expression is vital for maintaining normal cellular processes (Wilson1990Hunter).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IDS gene, which encodes the enzyme iduronate 2-sulfatase, lead to Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome. This is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans such as dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, resulting in a range of clinical symptoms (D’Avanzo2020Mucopolysaccharidosis; Mashima2017Minireview). MPS II presents in two main forms: a severe type with neurological involvement and an attenuated type that primarily affects visceral organs without impairing intellectual development (Galvis2014Deep; Mashima2017Minireview).

The genetic heterogeneity of MPS II is significant, with over 350 mutations identified in the IDS gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing mutations (Galvis2014Deep; D’Avanzo2020Mucopolysaccharidosis). Missense mutations are the most common, while recombination mutations involving the IDS-2 pseudogene are closely associated with the severe phenotype (Mashima2017Minireview). Frameshift and splicing errors often result in a truncated IDS protein with little to no enzyme activity, contributing to the severe form of the disease (Mashima2017Minireview). The variability in clinical presentation is attributed to the diverse mutations and their effects on enzyme expression, stability, or function (Wilson1990Hunter).

## Interactions
Iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS) is a glycoprotein involved in the lysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans. It undergoes N-linked glycosylation, which is crucial for its interaction with the ER lectin chaperone calnexin. This interaction is important for the proper folding of IDS mutants, as calnexin recognizes glycosylated proteins and assists in their refolding (Osaki2018Shutdown). IDS is also subject to interactions with components of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, such as the ubiquitin E3 ligase HRD1 and ERdj3. These interactions are significant in the context of IDS degradation, as HRD1 ubiquitinates misfolded IDS mutants, targeting them for degradation (Osaki2018Shutdown).

Mutations in IDS, such as A85T and R468Q, can lead to misfolding and impaired interactions with calnexin and other sorting systems, affecting the enzyme's stability and function (Osaki2018Shutdown). The R468Q mutant, in particular, disrupts hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, leading to severe misfolding and impaired interactions with calnexin (Osaki2018Shutdown). These interactions and the resulting degradation processes are critical in understanding the pathophysiology of mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome.
