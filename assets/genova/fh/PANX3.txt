# PANX3

## Overview
PANX3 is a gene that encodes the protein pannexin 3, which is a member of the pannexin family of large-pore channel proteins. Pannexin 3 is primarily characterized as a transmembrane protein that forms heptameric oligomers, facilitating ion conductance and ATP release across cell membranes (Hussain2024CryoEM; Hussain2022Structural). This protein plays a significant role in cellular communication and differentiation, particularly in bone and cartilage development, by functioning as both a hemichannel and an endoplasmic reticulum calcium channel (Ishikawa2011Pannexin; Ishikawa2016The). PANX3 is expressed in various tissues, including bone, cartilage, and teeth, and is involved in critical physiological processes such as osteogenesis and chondrogenesis (O’Donnell2021Pannexin). Its structural features, including a unique vestibule and wider pore radius, distinguish it from other pannexins and influence its functional interactions and channel properties (Hussain2024CryoEM).

## Structure
PANX3, or pannexin 3, is a protein that forms large-pore channels involved in ion conductance and ATP release. The primary structure of PANX3 includes a sequence of amino acids that form a heptameric oligomer assembly, similar to other pannexin isoforms like PANX1 and PANX2 (Hussain2024CryoEM; Hussain2022Structural). The secondary structure of PANX3 features four transmembrane helices and two extracellular loops, stabilized by two disulfide bonds in the extracellular domain (Hussain2022Structural).

The tertiary structure of PANX3 is characterized by a unique vestibule with two distinct chambers and a wider pore radius compared to PANX1 and PANX2, measuring 13.2 Å at its narrowest point (Hussain2024CryoEM). This structure includes a second constriction formed by residues F58, S59, and S60, which is not present in PANX1 (Hussain2024CryoEM). PANX3 also exhibits a side-tunnel with a 6.9 Å separation, suggesting a lateral portal for ion passage (Hussain2024CryoEM).

In terms of quaternary structure, PANX3 assembles into a heptameric oligomer, similar to PANX1 and PANX2 (Hussain2024CryoEM). Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation at N71, which occurs closer to the pore than in PANX1 (Hussain2022Structural). PANX3 lacks a long C-terminus that is caspase-sensitive, unlike PANX1, which may influence its channel activity (Hussain2024CryoEM).

## Function
Pannexin 3 (PANX3) is a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular communication and differentiation, particularly in bone and cartilage development. PANX3 functions as a hemichannel and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium (Ca2+) channel, facilitating the release of ATP and the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. This activity is essential for osteoblast differentiation, where PANX3 promotes the transition from preosteoblasts to mature osteoblasts by activating signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and calmodulin kinase II, which lead to the expression of osteogenic markers (Ishikawa2011Pannexin; Ishikawa2016The).

In chondrocytes, PANX3 is involved in differentiation by releasing ATP, which reduces intracellular cAMP levels and inhibits CREB signaling, thus promoting differentiation (O’Donnell2021Pannexin). PANX3 also plays a role in odontoblast differentiation, where it regulates cell cycle arrest and differentiation through its hemichannel activities and potential regulation of cell cycle-related proteins like p21 (Iwamoto2017Pannexin).

PANX3 is expressed in various tissues, including bone, cartilage, and teeth, and is involved in processes such as chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. Its activity as a Ca2+ channel and ATP-releasing hemichannel is critical for the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways that drive cellular differentiation and development (O’Donnell2021Pannexin; Ishikawa2016The).

## Clinical Significance
PANX3 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels or interactions. In osteoarthritis (OA), PANX3 expression is significantly increased in osteoarthritic cartilage, suggesting a role in the degeneration of articular cartilage, a hallmark of OA. Targeting PANX3 could potentially inhibit hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and slow OA progression (Penuela2014Pannexin; Ishikawa2016The). 

In bone biology, PANX3 is crucial for osteoblast differentiation and bone development. PANX3 knockout mice exhibit skeletal abnormalities, indicating its essential role in normal bone formation. Alterations in PANX3 expression can lead to impaired bone growth and differentiation, potentially contributing to skeletal disorders (Ishikawa2011Pannexin; Ishikawa2016The).

PANX3 is also involved in intervertebral disc degeneration, where its role varies with age and injury, indicating its involvement in biomechanical adaptation (O’Donnell2021Pannexin). In Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, PANX3 levels are reduced in dystrophic muscles, though its exact role in muscle wasting remains unclear (O’Donnell2021Pannexin). These findings suggest that PANX3 may influence disease progression and susceptibility across various tissues.

## Interactions
PANX3 interacts with other pannexin proteins, particularly PANX1, in various tissues and cell cultures. These interactions are influenced by glycosylation, which affects their cellular localization and function. Coimmunoprecipitation assays have shown that PANX1 interacts more robustly with PANX2 than with PANX3, although a moderate interaction between PANX1 and PANX3 is observed. This interaction is enhanced when PANX3 is coexpressed with PANX1, leading to increased cell surface localization of PANX3, but not with glycosylation-deficient PANX1 mutants (Penuela2009Glycosylation).

PANX3 also plays a role in osteoblast differentiation by functioning as an ER Ca2+ channel, hemichannel, and gap junction. It facilitates the release of ATP into the extracellular space, which activates purinergic receptors and signaling pathways crucial for osteoblast differentiation. The interaction of PANX3 with these signaling pathways, including the PI3K-Akt pathway, is essential for its role in promoting osteogenic differentiation (Ishikawa2011Pannexin).

The structural differences in PANX3, such as its wider pore compared to other pannexins, also influence its interactions and channel properties. These structural features may affect its interactions with inhibitors like carbenoxolone (CBX) (Hussain2024CryoEM).
