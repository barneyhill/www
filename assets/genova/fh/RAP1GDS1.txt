# RAP1GDS1

## Overview
RAP1GDS1 is a gene that encodes the protein Rap1 GTPase-GDP dissociation stimulator 1, commonly referred to as SmgGDS. This protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which is pivotal in the regulation of small GTPases, including members of the Rho and Ras families. These small GTPases are integral to various cellular processes such as cell migration, proliferation, and signaling pathways. SmgGDS facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating these GTPases and influencing their localization and function within the cell. The protein is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeats, which are essential for its role in stimulating nucleotide exchange. RAP1GDS1 is expressed in multiple tissues and has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and mitochondrial function related to aging (Xiong2023VimarRAP1GDS1; AzoulayAlfaguter2014Chaperonemediated).

## Structure
RAP1GDS1, also known as SmgGDS, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in the regulation of small GTPases. The primary structure of RAP1GDS1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the RAP1GDS1 gene. It contains specific domains such as armadillo repeats, which are similar to those found in proteins like β-catenin and karyopherin-α, and are crucial for its function in stimulating nucleotide exchange in small GTPases, including Rap1a, Rap1b, and K-Ras (AzoulayAlfaguter2014Chaperonemediated).

RAP1GDS1 has two known splice variants, SmgGDS-607 and SmgGDS-558, which play roles in the prenylation pathway and trafficking of small GTPases to the plasma membrane. These variants may differ in their functional roles due to differences in their structure, such as the presence or absence of specific armadillo motifs (AzoulayAlfaguter2014Chaperonemediated).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the activity and interactions of RAP1GDS1. These modifications may affect its binding to small GTPases and its role in their prenylation and membrane localization (Wilson2016Differences). The electronegative patch in RAP1GDS1 binds the positively charged C-terminus of Ras family members, potentially enhancing malignancy by promoting Ras plasma membrane localization (AzoulayAlfaguter2014Chaperonemediated).

## Function
RAP1GDS1, also known as SmgGDS, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a significant role in the regulation of small GTPases, including RHOA, RAC1, and KRAS. These small GTPases are crucial for various cellular processes such as trafficking, localization, and molecular chaperone functions. RAP1GDS1 facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating these GTPases, which are involved in cell migration and proliferation (Asiri2020Mutated).

In the context of cell biology, RAP1GDS1 is highly expressed in various tissues, including the brain, and is involved in the regulation of DNA synthesis induced by Rap1A. It also enhances the transformation activity of K-ras4B in many cell types (Asiri2020Mutated). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cell signaling pathways that affect cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration.

RAP1GDS1 also plays a role in mitochondrial function, particularly in the context of aging. Overexpression of RAP1GDS1 has been shown to affect mitochondrial function, leading to increased mitochondrial calcium levels and changes in mitochondrial morphology, which are associated with aging processes (Xiong2023VimarRAP1GDS1). However, the specific function of RAP1GDS1 in healthy human cells remains not fully understood (Xiong2023VimarRAP1GDS1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAP1GDS1 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. A study identified a homozygous splice acceptor site mutation (c.1444-1G) in RAP1GDS1 in individuals from two consanguineous Saudi families. This mutation leads to intellectual disability, global developmental delay (GDD), and hypotonia by causing aberrant splicing and significantly decreased mRNA expression of RAP1GDS1 (Asiri2020Mutated). 

In cancer, RAP1GDS1, also known as SmgGDS, is up-regulated in prostate carcinoma and is associated with increased cell proliferation and migration. It promotes tumor phenotypes by activating small GTPases in the Rho and Ras families, which are crucial for cancer development (Zhi2008SmgGDS). In breast and non-small cell lung cancer, the splice variants of SmgGDS influence cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis, with a high ratio of SmgGDS-607 to SmgGDS-558 linked to reduced survival in breast cancer patients (Brandt2020Splice).

RAP1GDS1 is also involved in brain aging. Overexpression in neurons is linked to premature aging, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced behavioral performance in mice, suggesting its role in age-related neurodegenerative conditions (Xiong2023VimarRAP1GDS1).

## Interactions
RAP1GDS1, also known as SmgGDS, is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that interacts with several small GTPases, including Rap1, RhoA, KRas, Rac1, and Cdc42. It facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP, thereby activating these GTPases and promoting their trafficking to the plasma membrane (AzoulayAlfaguter2014Chaperonemediated). RAP1GDS1 interacts with Miro1, a protein involved in mitochondrial calcium regulation, affecting mitochondrial morphology and function, particularly in the context of brain aging (Xiong2023VimarRAP1GDS1). This interaction is associated with mitochondrial calcium overload and fragmentation, contributing to aging-related decline in brain function (Xiong2023VimarRAP1GDS1).

In cancer biology, RAP1GDS1 plays a significant role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. It is involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and regulates gene transcription pathways in the nucleus, interacting with the DREAM complex to control the cell cycle (Gonyo2017SmgGDS). RAP1GDS1 also interacts with the RNA polymerase I transcription factor upstream binding factor (UBF), stabilizing the SmgGDS protein by preventing its degradation (Gonyo2017SmgGDS). In KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma, RAP1GDS1 forms a synthetic lethal interaction with RHOA, where the combined loss of these genes impairs cell proliferation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kelly2020Combined).
