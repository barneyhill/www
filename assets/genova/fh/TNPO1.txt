# TNPO1

## Overview
TNPO1, or transportin 1, is a gene that encodes a karyopherin protein involved in the nuclear import of proteins. The transportin 1 protein functions as a nuclear transport receptor, facilitating the translocation of proteins with nuclear localization signals (NLS) through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the nucleus. This process is essential for the regulation of various cellular activities, including circadian rhythms and mitotic processes. Transportin 1 is characterized by its solenoid shape formed by HEAT repeats, which are crucial for its interaction with cargo proteins and the nuclear pore complex. The protein plays a significant role in the nuclear import of circadian clock proteins, such as PERIOD (PER) and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), and is involved in the regulation of mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear pore formation. Additionally, TNPO1 is implicated in the transport of proteins to the primary cilium and is associated with stress granules and P-bodies, indicating its involvement in mRNA regulation and stress response (Larrieu2018Inhibition; Twyffels2014Transportin‐1; Korge2018The).

## Structure
TNPO1 (transportin 1) is a karyopherin protein involved in nuclear import. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure of TNPO1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of TNPO1 is characterized by a solenoid shape, which is typical of importins. This structure is formed by the arrangement of HEAT repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and are crucial for the transport function of TNPO1.

TNPO1 does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. The protein contains specific domains that facilitate its role in nuclear import, including regions that interact with cargo proteins and the nuclear pore complex. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, influencing the activity and interactions of TNPO1. These structural features enable TNPO1 to effectively mediate the nuclear import of various cargo proteins, maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Larrieu2018Inhibition). 

The presence of HEAT repeats and the solenoid shape are particularly important for the protein's ability to bind and transport its cargo across the nuclear envelope (Larrieu2018Inhibition).

## Function
Transportin 1 (TNPO1) is a nuclear transport receptor that plays a critical role in the import of proteins into the nucleus by recognizing and binding to nuclear localization signals (NLS) on cargo proteins. This interaction facilitates the translocation of these proteins through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the nucleus, where they can perform essential functions (Twyffels2014Transportin‐1). TNPO1 is involved in the nuclear import of several key proteins, including the PERIOD (PER) and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) protein complexes, which are crucial for maintaining circadian rhythms. TNPO1 specifically modulates the nuclear localization of the PER1 protein, affecting the timing of circadian rhythms (Korge2018The).

TNPO1 also plays a role in the regulation of mitotic processes by negatively regulating the assembly of nuclear pores and the mitotic spindle. It interacts with nucleoporins and other proteins to ensure proper assembly and function of these structures during cell division (Lau2009Transportin). Additionally, TNPO1 is involved in the transport of proteins to the primary cilium and is present in stress granules and P-bodies, indicating its involvement in mRNA regulation and stress response (Twyffels2014Transportin‐1).

## Clinical Significance
TNPO1 (transportin 1) has significant clinical implications due to its role in various diseases and conditions. In gynecologic cancers, TNPO1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, particularly in cervical and ovarian cancers. Its expression is linked to tumor growth and proliferation, especially in ARID1A-deficient cancer cells, where it facilitates the nuclear import of ARID1B, a process crucial for maintaining chromatin accessibility and cancer cell proliferation (Yang2021TNPO1mediated). Targeting TNPO1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for these cancers, as its knockdown reduces cell viability and proliferation (Yang2021TNPO1mediated).

In Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), TNPO1 is mislocalized, leading to defects in nuclear import and contributing to chromatin disorganization and altered gene expression. Inhibition of the acetyltransferase NAT10 can restore TNPO1 function, suggesting a therapeutic approach for HGPS by normalizing nucleocytoplasmic transport and ameliorating cellular defects (Larrieu2018Inhibition).

In breast cancer, TNPO1 overexpression correlates with better patient survival, indicating a potential protective role. This contrasts with its role in gynecologic cancers, highlighting the complexity of TNPO1's involvement in cancer prognosis (Mehmood2021Molecular).

## Interactions
TNPO1 (transportin 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a nuclear transport receptor. It interacts with the circadian clock protein PER1, facilitating its nuclear localization. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal PY-motifs of PER1, which are essential for binding to TNPO1. Under oxidative stress, the binding between TNPO1 and PER1 increases, affecting the nuclear import rate of PER1 and influencing circadian rhythms (Korge2018The).

TNPO1 also forms a ternary complex with Rab8 and ciliary targeting signals (CTS) from proteins such as fibrocystin, rhodopsin, and prRDH. This complex is crucial for the ciliary localization of these proteins, with Rab8-GDP enhancing the interaction between TNPO1 and CTS (Madugula2016A).

In the context of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and aging, TNPO1 interacts with NUP153, a component of the nuclear pore complex. This interaction is essential for maintaining proper nucleocytoplasmic transport and chromatin organization. Disruption of this interaction due to increased microtubule stability in HGPS leads to nuclear transport defects (Larrieu2018Inhibition).

TNPO1 also binds to the macrophage immunometabolism regulator MACIR via a PY-NLS motif, which is important for MACIR's nuclear localization (McGauran2019The).
