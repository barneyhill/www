# TTLL2

## Overview
The TTLL2 gene encodes the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like 2 protein, which is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) family. This protein is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin through polyglutamylation, a process essential for the stability and function of microtubules. Microtubules are critical components of the cytoskeleton, playing a vital role in cellular processes such as intracellular transport, cell division, and the maintenance of cell shape. The TTLL2 protein is particularly important in the respiratory system, where it contributes to the proper functioning of airway epithelial cilia by modifying tubulin to support ciliary motion. This function is crucial for clearing mucus and debris from the respiratory tract, thereby maintaining pulmonary health (Son2015FamilyBased). Additionally, TTLL2 has been implicated in various health conditions, including chronic sinusitis and lung cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Ni2013Reproducible; Son2015FamilyBased).

## Function
The TTLL2 gene encodes a protein involved in the post-translational modification of tubulin, specifically through polyglutamylation. This modification is crucial for the stability and function of microtubules, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton. In healthy human cells, TTLL2 is thought to play a significant role in maintaining the proper function of airway epithelial cilia by forming polyglutamate side chains on tubulin. This process is vital for the beating of cilia, which is necessary for clearing mucus and debris from the respiratory tract. Disruption in tubulin glutamylation, as seen with the depletion of related genes like TTLL1, can lead to impaired ciliary function and conditions such as chronic sinusitis (Son2015FamilyBased).

TTLL2's activity is also implicated in pulmonary function, as genetic studies have identified it as a candidate gene associated with spirometric measures of lung performance. The gene's influence on pulmonary function is likely linked to its role in tubulin modification, which is essential for the proper functioning of cilia in the respiratory system (Son2015FamilyBased). The protein's activity is primarily localized in regions where microtubule dynamics are critical, such as in cilia and potentially other cellular structures requiring stable microtubule networks.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TTLL2 gene have been implicated in various health conditions. TTLL2 is associated with pulmonary function, as it plays a role in tubulin glutamylation, which is crucial for the proper functioning of airway cilia. Genetic variations in TTLL2, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been linked to pulmonary function, although their effects may vary across different populations (Son2015FamilyBased).

In the context of cancer, TTLL2 has been identified as having increased mutation frequencies in circulating tumor cells from lung cancer patients, particularly in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This suggests a potential role in disease progression, possibly through its involvement in ATP binding and other cellular processes (Ni2013Reproducible).

While TTLL2 variants were detected in a study on intracranial meningiomas, they were observed in only one patient, indicating that its role in such tumors may be limited or require further investigation (Hussein2020Overlapping). Overall, the clinical significance of TTLL2 is still being explored, with ongoing research needed to fully understand its implications in various diseases.
