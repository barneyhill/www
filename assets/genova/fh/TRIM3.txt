# TRIM3

## Overview
TRIM3 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 3, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family. This protein is characterized by its RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and degradation. TRIM3 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in regulating neuronal functions and synaptic plasticity, contributing to memory and learning. Additionally, TRIM3 acts as a tumor suppressor, influencing cell growth and signaling pathways, and is implicated in several cancers and neurological disorders. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as actin and toll-like receptors, underscore its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental cues (Esposito2022Divergent; Schreiber2015Ubiquitin; Raheja2014The).

## Structure
TRIM3 is a member of the TRIM protein family, characterized by a tripartite motif that includes a RING domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, contributing to its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Raheja2014The). The RING domain of TRIM3 is monomeric and catalytically inactive in isolation, unlike its paralog TRIM2, which forms a dimer and exhibits E3 ligase activity (Esposito2022Divergent). The RING domain's inactivity is due to specific amino acid changes that prevent self-association, but its activity can be restored through hetero-dimerization with TRIM2 or by substituting with TRIM2's corresponding region (Esposito2022Divergent).

The NHL domain of TRIM3 forms a six-bladed β-propeller structure, similar to other TRIM proteins, and is involved in interactions with macromolecules like proteins and nucleic acids (Chaikuad2022Comparative). This domain exhibits a less polar shallow groove at its binding site, which may influence its interaction capabilities (Chaikuad2022Comparative).

TRIM3 is involved in post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which is crucial for its role in growth arrest and tumor suppression (Raheja2014The). The protein can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may contribute to its diverse functional roles (Wang2020TRIM3).

## Function
TRIM3 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily functioning as a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in regulating neuronal functions and synaptic plasticity. TRIM3 is involved in the cytoskeleton-associated recycling or transport complex, interacting with Myosin V and polyubiquitinating γ-actin (ACTG1), which is crucial for maintaining synaptic structure and function (Esposito2022Divergent; Schreiber2015Ubiquitin).

In the hippocampus, TRIM3 regulates synaptic γ-actin levels, influencing spine density, long-term potentiation (LTP), and memory consolidation. The absence of TRIM3 leads to increased ACTG1 levels, resulting in higher spine densities and enhanced memory functions, indicating its role as a temporal regulator of γ-actin turnover (Schreiber2015Ubiquitin). TRIM3 also interacts with the neuronal kinesin KIF21B, affecting microtubule dynamics and synapse function (Esposito2022Divergent).

Beyond its neuronal roles, TRIM3 acts as a tumor suppressor by attenuating Notch signaling and suppressing c-myc expression. It also regulates cell growth by ubiquitinating the cell-cycle regulator p21 and is downregulated in various cancers (Esposito2022Divergent).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM3 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders, due to its role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in protein ubiquitination. In glioblastomas, TRIM3 is frequently lost, with about 20% of cases showing loss of heterozygosity at its locus, suggesting its significant role in tumor suppression (Boulay2009Loss; Zhao2021The). The loss of TRIM3 expression can promote tumor development and accelerate the progression of gliomas, such as oligodendrogliomas, in experimental models (Raheja2014The). 

In breast cancer, TRIM3 is associated with estrogen receptor (ER) alpha signaling, where it acts as an E3 ligase that enhances ER alpha stability and signaling activity. Elevated TRIM3 expression is linked to poor survival in patients undergoing endocrine therapy, indicating its potential role in breast cancer progression and resistance to treatment (Zhuang2022TRIM3). 

In the nervous system, TRIM3 regulates synaptic protein levels, such as GKAP and Shank proteins, affecting dendritic spine morphology. Alterations in TRIM3 function could have implications for cognitive functions and are linked to disorders like autism spectrum disorders (Hung2010Degradation).

## Interactions
TRIM3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with TRIM2, another member of the TRIM protein family, through the filamin domain of TRIM2 and the coiled-coil domain of TRIM3. This interaction is crucial for their co-localization at lamellipodia-like protrusions, suggesting a role in cytoskeletal regulation (Esposito2022Divergent). TRIM3 also interacts with ACTG1, a form of actin, and regulates its levels at synaptic sites. This interaction involves the polyubiquitination of ACTG1, which is crucial for synaptic plasticity and learning (Schreiber2015Ubiquitin).

TRIM3 is involved in the ubiquitination of p21, a protein that regulates cell proliferation. This interaction is dependent on the RING domain of TRIM3, which facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to p21, contributing to growth arrest (Raheja2014The). Additionally, TRIM3 interacts with TLR3, a toll-like receptor, mediating its K63-linked polyubiquitination, which is essential for TLR3 signaling in immune responses (Li2020Ubiquitination). These interactions highlight TRIM3's role in regulating protein levels and signaling pathways, impacting cellular functions such as growth suppression, synaptic plasticity, and immune response.
