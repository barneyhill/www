# TIA1

## Overview
TIA1 is a gene that encodes the TIA1 cytotoxic granule associated RNA binding protein, a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and plays a critical role in the formation of stress granules, which are essential for cellular stress responses. TIA1 is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal low-complexity domain (LCD), which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins. These interactions are crucial for regulating mRNA splicing, transport, and translation, as well as for modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. The protein's ability to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation is vital for stress granule assembly, influencing cellular homeostasis and gene expression. Mutations in the TIA1 gene have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Yang2023Zinc; FernándezGómez2022The; Mackenzie2017TIA1).

## Structure
The TIA1 protein is a 43 kDa multi-domain RNA-binding protein crucial for stress granule formation in eukaryotic cells. It contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal low-complexity domain (LCD), also referred to as a prion-related domain (PRD) due to its sequence similarity to amyloid-forming proteins (Fritzsching2020Micellar; Yang2023Zinc). The RRMs are responsible for binding nucleic acids, with RRM2 primarily interacting with U-rich RNAs and RRM3 recognizing C-rich RNAs (Yang2023Zinc). The PRD is intrinsically disordered and promotes liquid-liquid phase separation, essential for stress granule assembly (Yang2023Zinc).

The TIA1 protein can form oligomers and undergoes phase separation, leading to the formation of membraneless organelles like stress granules (Fritzsching2020Micellar). The RRM2 and RRM3 domains are folded and ordered, while the RRM1 and PRD are disordered, contributing to nanoscale phase separation without forming fibrils (Fritzsching2020Micellar). The protein's structure is influenced by interactions with zinc ions (Zn2+), which can affect oligomerization and stress granule dynamics (Yang2023Zinc). TIA1 also undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, and may be subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Rayman2016TIA1).

## Function
TIA1 (TIA1 cytotoxic granule associated RNA binding protein) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression in healthy human cells. It is involved in various molecular processes, including mRNA splicing, transport, and translation regulation. TIA1 primarily localizes in the nucleus but can translocate to the cytoplasm under stress conditions, where it influences transcription, splicing, and mRNA stability by interacting with RNA polymerase II and spliceosome components (FernándezGómez2022The).

TIA1 is crucial for the formation of stress granules (SGs), which are aggregates of mRNAs and proteins that form in response to cellular stress. These granules help conserve energy and inhibit general translation, allowing cells to repair damage. TIA1's role in SG formation involves interactions with translation initiation complexes and RNA-binding proteins, contributing to a balance between mRNA stability and degradation (FernándezGómez2022The; Rayman2016TIA1).

In addition to its role in stress response, TIA1 modulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. It can promote or inhibit cell growth depending on the context, and its overexpression in tumor cells can induce cell quiescence, apoptosis, and autophagy (FernándezGómez2022The). TIA1 also influences mitochondrial functions, including respiration and fission/fusion dynamics, by regulating the translation of cytochrome c mRNA and affecting mitochondrial morphology (FernándezGómez2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TIA1 gene are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and multisystem proteinopathy (MSP). In ALS and FTD, TIA1 mutations promote liquid-liquid phase separation and alter stress granule dynamics, contributing to disease pathology by delaying stress granule disassembly and leading to the accumulation of nondynamic granules containing TDP-43, a protein linked to ALS pathology (Mackenzie2017TIA1). These mutations are found in approximately 2.2% of familial ALS and 0.4% of sporadic ALS cases (HirschReinshagen2017Clinical).

In the context of tauopathy, a neurodegenerative condition, TIA1 haploinsufficiency or knockout exacerbates neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, leading to increased microglial reactivity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (LeBlang2020Reduction). This suggests that TIA1 plays a significant role in managing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in tauopathy.

In MSP, TIA1 variants, such as TIA1-N357S, are linked to distal myopathy, characterized by muscle weakness. These variants promote phase separation and disrupt stress granule dynamics, potentially impairing stress granule clearance and contributing to muscle degeneration (Lee2018TIA1).

## Interactions
TIA1, a cytotoxic granule-associated RNA-binding protein, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular stress responses. TIA1 interacts with several proteins, including protein-L-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase (PCMT1), TARDBP, far upstream element binding protein 1 (FUBP1), fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and ribosomal protein L7 Like 1 (RPL7L1) (Gourdomichali2022In). It also binds to mitochondrial proteins such as translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40) and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L15 (MRPL15) (Gourdomichali2022In). 

In terms of nucleic acid interactions, TIA1 binds to U-rich and C-rich RNA sequences, primarily through its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), with RRM2 showing specificity for U-rich sequences and RRM3 for C-rich sequences (Waris2017TIA1). TIA1 also interacts with DNA, as demonstrated by its binding to single-stranded DNA probes corresponding to cis elements in pre-mRNA (McAlinden2007Nuclear).

TIA1 is a key component in stress granule formation, interacting with other RNA-binding proteins and ribosomal proteins to modulate mRNA translation and splicing under stress conditions (López2005Identification; Vanderweyde2016Interaction). These interactions highlight TIA1's role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis.
