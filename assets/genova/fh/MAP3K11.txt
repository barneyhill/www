# MAP3K11

## Overview
MAP3K11, also known as Mixed Lineage Kinase 3 (MLK3), is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The protein product of MAP3K11 plays a pivotal role in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascade, which is essential for regulating various cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation (Silva2018A). Structurally, the protein features several domains, including a kinase domain, tandem leucine zippers, a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif, and a proline-rich C-terminal tail, which contribute to its functional versatility (Kokoszka2018Identification). MAP3K11 is involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, influencing immune responses and developmental signals (Zhang2021A). Its activity is modulated through interactions with small GTPases and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are crucial for its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing malignant transformation (Knackmuss2015MAP3K11).

## Structure
MAP3K11, also known as MLK3, is a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. The protein is composed of several distinct domains, including a kinase domain, tandem leucine zippers, a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif, and a proline-rich C-terminal tail (Kokoszka2018Identification). A significant feature of MAP3K11 is its SH3 domain, which plays a role in autoinhibition of the kinase domain through an intramolecular interaction with a nonconsensus single proline motif. Disruption of this interaction enhances MLK3 activity (Kokoszka2018Identification).

The SH3 domain of MAP3K11 has been shown to contain two distinct peptide-binding pockets. One is a canonical site that binds proline-rich motifs, while the other is a noncanonical site defined by an extended n-Src loop, which binds a peptide ligand named 'MLK3 SH3-interacting peptide' (MIP) (Kokoszka2018Identification). This noncanonical site is conserved across MLK1-4, except for MLK2 (Kokoszka2018Identification).

In terms of post-translational modifications, MAP3K11 is subject to phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity. The protein also exists in different isoforms, with a 60-kDa variant identified in mouse sperm, distinct from the 93-kDa form found in somatic tissues (Gibbs2007CysteineRich).

## Function
MAP3K11, also known as Mixed Lineage Kinase 3 (MLK3), is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in the MAPK signaling pathway, particularly in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling cascade. This pathway is crucial for various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and differentiation (Silva2018A). MAP3K11 is involved in regulating the activation of JNK, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) in response to mitogens and cytokines, which are important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing malignant transformation (Knackmuss2015MAP3K11).

In healthy human cells, MAP3K11 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular responses to stress and developmental signals. It is involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, impacting immune responses and organismal development (Zhang2021A). The protein contains a CDC42 and Rac interacting proteins binding domain (CRIB), which is essential for its autophosphorylation and subsequent induction of JNK, mediated through interactions with Cdc42/Rac/GTP (Silva2018A). This molecular activity underscores its role in regulating apoptosis and other critical cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
MAP3K11, also known as MLK3, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in several signaling pathways. In cancer, MAP3K11 is involved in cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells by activating JNK signaling to AP-1 (Nguyen2022MAP3K). It also plays a role in prostate cancer by facilitating collagen type I-induced EMT and increasing N-cadherin expression (Nguyen2022MAP3K). In cervical cancer, blocking MAP3K11 can suppress progression through autophagy-dependent apoptosis (Nguyen2022MAP3K). MAP3K11 is also associated with resistance to the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib in melanoma by reactivating the MEK/ERK pathway (Nguyen2022MAP3K).

In non-cancerous conditions, MAP3K11 is linked to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), where a missense variant in the gene is associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis, potentially leading to heart failure (Silva2018A). In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, MAP3K11 expression is regulated by lnc-PCF and miR-344a-5p, contributing to fibrogenesis (Liu2017A). Additionally, MAP3K11 is involved in the pathogenesis of pterygium through its interaction with miR-199a-3p/5p, which regulates EMT (He2020MiR199a3p5p).

## Interactions
MAP3K11, also known as MLK3, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular signaling pathways. It is a serine/threonine kinase that participates in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, where it interacts with GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rac1 through its CDC42 and Rac interacting proteins binding domain (CRIB). This interaction mediates autophosphorylation and JNK induction, which are crucial for processes like cardiomyocyte apoptosis (Silva2018A).

In the context of pulmonary fibrosis, MAP3K11 expression is regulated by miR-344a-5p, which binds to its 3′-UTR, leading to decreased expression. The long non-coding RNA lnc-PCF acts as a competitive endogenous RNA, sequestering miR-344a-5p and preventing it from interacting with MAP3K11, thereby protecting it from degradation and promoting cell proliferation (Liu2017A).

MAP3K11 also plays a role in the structural dynamics of centrosomal proteins. It has been studied for its structural properties, showing a tendency to form helical structures that can self-associate, particularly at acidic pH levels. This suggests a potential for pH-dependent conformational changes that may influence its interactions during different cellular phases (Treviño2014Emergence).
