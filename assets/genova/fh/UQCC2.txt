# UQCC2

## Overview
UQCC2 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex assembly factor 2, which is integral to the assembly and function of mitochondrial complex III, also known as ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase. This protein is categorized as an assembly factor and plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of cytochrome b, a subunit of complex III, by interacting with UQCC1 to facilitate its translation and stabilization. UQCC2 is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributing to the stability and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is essential for cellular energy production. Mutations in the UQCC2 gene are associated with complex III deficiency, a mitochondrial disorder that can lead to severe clinical manifestations, including lactic acidosis and developmental regression (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear; Tucker2013Mutations; Feichtinger2017Combined).

## Function
The UQCC2 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the assembly and function of mitochondrial complex III, also known as ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, which is a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein plays a vital role in the biogenesis of cytochrome b, a subunit of complex III encoded by mitochondrial DNA. UQCC2 interacts with UQCC1 to facilitate the translation and stabilization of cytochrome b, ensuring its proper incorporation into the complex III assembly intermediate (Tucker2013Mutations).

In healthy human cells, UQCC2 is involved in the early stages of complex III assembly, contributing to the stability and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is crucial for cellular energy production. The protein is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it helps maintain the stability of complex III and, to a lesser extent, complex I (FernándezVizarra2015Nuclear; Tucker2013Mutations). UQCC2's function is essential for the proper assembly of the respirasome, a supercomplex that includes complexes I, III, and IV, which is important for efficient electron transport and ATP synthesis (Feichtinger2017Combined).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UQCC2 gene are linked to human complex III deficiency, a mitochondrial disorder that affects the electron transport chain, crucial for cellular energy production. This deficiency is associated with perturbed cytochrome b protein expression, leading to impaired energy generation. Clinical manifestations of UQCC2 mutations include severe intrauterine growth retardation, neonatal lactic acidosis, renal tubular dysfunction, developmental regression, seizures, and frequently death (Tucker2013Mutations). 

A specific mutation, c.214-3C.G, causes a severe defect in splicing, resulting in significantly reduced expression of the UQCC2 protein, which is essential for complex III assembly (Tucker2013Mutations). The clinical presentation of UQCC2 mutations is heterogeneous, with some patients experiencing severe symptoms such as recurrent neonatal seizures and severe lactic acidosis, while others may have milder outcomes depending on the type of mutation (Feichtinger2017Combined). 

UQCC2 mutations can also lead to combined deficiencies of complexes I and III, affecting the stability or assembly of these complexes and contributing to the observed clinical phenotype (Feichtinger2017Combined). The deficiency is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern (Feichtinger2017Combined).

## Interactions
UQCC2 is a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of mitochondrial complex III, also known as the ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex. It physically interacts with UQCC1, another protein essential for complex III assembly. These interactions are crucial for the biogenesis of cytochrome b, a key component of complex III. UQCC2 and UQCC1 co-purify, indicating a direct interaction, and are involved in the translation and stability of cytochrome b (Tucker2013Mutations). The stability of UQCC2 is dependent on UQCC1, and vice versa, highlighting their interdependent relationship (Tucker2013Mutations).

In HEK293 cells, UQCC1 and UQCC2 were shown to co-isolate, further supporting their direct interaction. Knockdown of UQCC1 led to a decrease in UQCC2 levels, affecting the assembly of complex III and, to a lesser extent, complex I (Tucker2013Mutations). UQCC2 mutations lead to a deficiency in complex III, affecting the stability of its binding partner, UQCC1, as shown by reduced levels of UQCC1 in UQCC2-deficient cells (Tucker2013Mutations). These interactions are essential for the proper assembly and function of complex III, impacting mitochondrial respiratory efficiency and energy production.
