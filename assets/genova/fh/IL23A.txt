# IL23A

## Overview
The IL23A gene encodes the interleukin-23 subunit alpha, a component of the cytokine interleukin-23 (IL-23), which is a heterodimeric protein involved in immune system regulation. The IL-23 protein is composed of the IL23A (p19) subunit and the IL12B (p40) subunit, with the p19 subunit being a non-glycosylated polypeptide characterized by a four antiparallel helix bundle (Desmyter2017Neutralization). IL-23 plays a pivotal role in the proinflammatory and regenerative activities of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and innate lymphoid cells, contributing to immune responses and tissue repair (Lim2020Inflammatory). The IL23A gene is regulated by the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which link its expression to inflammatory and mitogenic signals (Lim2020Inflammatory). Dysregulation of IL23A is associated with various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease, highlighting its clinical significance in these conditions (Li2016Characterization; Singh2015Selective; ChristodoulouVafeiadou2023A).

## Structure
The IL23A gene encodes the interleukin-23 subunit alpha, which forms part of the heterodimeric cytokine IL-23. The IL-23 protein is composed of the IL23A (p19) subunit and the IL12B (p40) subunit. The p19 subunit is a 189 amino acid polypeptide with five cysteine residues and no glycosylation sites (Desmyter2017Neutralization). Structurally, the p19 subunit is characterized by a four antiparallel helix bundle (Desmyter2017Neutralization). 

In terms of quaternary structure, IL-23 is a heterodimer, with the p19 subunit associating with the p40 subunit, which is shared with IL-12. The p40 subunit consists of three domains, each formed by a 7 β-stranded β-sandwich (Desmyter2017Neutralization). The interaction between p19 and p40 involves the insertion of the fourth helix of p19 between the first two domains of p40, with an interaction surface of approximately 900 Å² (Desmyter2017Neutralization). 

The IL-23 complex also features two saccharidic chains at Asn 200 of the p40 chains, with the core sugars being GlcNAc2-Man3 (Desmyter2017Neutralization). These structural features are crucial for the cytokine's function and interaction with its receptor, IL-23R.

## Function
The IL23A gene encodes a subunit of the cytokine interleukin-23 (IL-23), which is a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of IL12B and IL23A. In healthy human cells, IL-23 is primarily produced by dendritic cells and macrophages and plays a crucial role in the immune system by promoting the proinflammatory and regenerative activities of T helper 17 (Th17) cells and innate lymphoid cells (Lim2020Inflammatory). IL-23 is involved in maintaining a balance between pathogen surveillance and commensal tolerance in the intestinal epithelium, providing essential microenvironmental cues for the effector functions of Th17 cells and innate lymphoid cells, thereby coordinating immune responses and tissue repair (Lim2020Inflammatory).

IL23A expression is regulated by the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which are activated by inflammatory and mitogenic signals. These pathways are crucial for coupling IL23A expression with tissue growth and regeneration (Lim2020Inflammatory). In certain conditions, such as in colorectal carcinoma cells, IL23A can be secreted in a noncanonical form independent of the IL12B subunit, suggesting a unique role for IL23A in epithelial cells (Lim2020Inflammatory). This secretion is driven by inflammatory and mitogenic signals, indicating its involvement in maintaining homeostatic balance during inflammation and repair (Lim2020Inflammatory).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the IL23A gene are implicated in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Overexpression of IL23A has been linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where it contributes to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. In a transgenic mouse model overexpressing human IL23A, symptoms such as anemia, proteinuria, and the presence of circulating autoantibodies were observed, mirroring human SLE pathology. This model also demonstrated skin and renal pathologies, highlighting the role of IL23A in driving inflammation and autoimmunity in SLE (ChristodoulouVafeiadou2023A).

In multiple sclerosis (MS) and other inflammatory demyelinating diseases (IDD), genetic variants in IL23A are associated with increased disease risk. Elevated serum levels of IL23A have been observed in MS patients, suggesting its involvement in disease pathogenesis. These findings indicate that IL23A may influence susceptibility to IDD through its role in immune inflammatory responses (Li2016Characterization).

IL23A is also involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, where it plays a critical role in the IL23/IL17 axis, contributing to chronic inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies targeting IL23, such as guselkumab, have shown efficacy in treating these conditions by modulating the IL23 pathway (Singh2015Selective).

## Interactions
IL23A, encoding the p19 subunit of interleukin-23 (IL-23), participates in several interactions crucial for its function in immune responses. IL-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of the p19 subunit (IL23A) and the p40 subunit (IL12B). The p19 subunit specifically binds to the IL-23 receptor (IL23R), while the p40 subunit binds to IL12RB1, forming a receptor complex that activates downstream signaling pathways (Singh2015Selective). This interaction is essential for the activation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which subsequently phosphorylate and activate STAT3, leading to the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22 (Singh2015Selective).

IL23A is also involved in a transcriptional enhancer complex in intestinal epithelial cells, which includes proteins such as c-Jun, RelA, and RUNX family transcription factors. This complex is crucial for the regulation of IL23A expression, particularly in response to inflammatory signals (Lim2020Inflammatory). The secretion of IL23A can occur independently of IL12B in certain contexts, such as in intestinal epithelial cells, where it is regulated by the NF-κB and MAPK pathways (Lim2020Inflammatory).
