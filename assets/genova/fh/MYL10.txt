# MYL10

## Overview
MYL10, or myosin light chain 10, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the myosin light chain family, which plays a critical role in muscle contraction and cellular movement. The protein myosin light chain 10 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and is associated with calcium ion binding pathways, which are essential for muscle function and development (Fu2024Transcriptome). MYL10 is implicated in various biological processes, including the focal adhesion signaling pathway, which is crucial for skeletal muscle growth and development (Fu2024Transcriptome). Additionally, it participates in protein-protein interactions that are vital for maintaining homeostasis and stress responses in muscle cells, as observed in studies involving different animal models (Sinpru2024Revealing). The gene's expression and regulation are of particular interest in the context of muscle-related diseases, such as Pompe disease, where it is upregulated in response to therapeutic interventions (Karadağ2022To).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MYL10, or myosin light chain 10, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for muscle function and development. In the context of slow-growing Korat chickens, MYL10 is part of a protein-protein interaction network related to cytoskeleton proteins and ATP production. It interacts with proteins such as TTN and MYH7B, which are involved in maintaining homeostasis and stress in skeletal muscle cells (Sinpru2024Revealing).

In Leizhou goat muscles, MYL10 is identified as a differentially expressed gene involved in the focal adhesion signaling pathway, suggesting its role in regulating skeletal muscle growth and development (Fu2024Transcriptome). The protein is also associated with calcium ion binding pathways, which are essential for muscle contraction and development (Fu2024Transcriptome).

In the context of Pompe disease, MYL10 is upregulated in the actin cytoskeleton regulation pathway, indicating its involvement in muscle function and response to enzyme replacement therapy (Karadağ2022To). These interactions highlight MYL10's role in muscle contraction and cellular movement, influencing various cellular processes.
