# GTPBP4

## Overview
GTPBP4, or GTP binding protein 4, is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis. The protein, categorized as a GTPase, plays a crucial role in cellular processes by binding and hydrolyzing GTP, which is essential for its function in ribosome assembly and interaction with other cellular components. GTPBP4 is known for its selective binding to the p53 protein, acting as a negative modulator of p53 activity, and is implicated in various protein-protein interactions that are vital for ribosomal subunit assembly and cellular stress responses (Lunardi2010A; Li2018Identification). The gene's expression is associated with several cancers, where it can act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor, depending on the context, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Yu2016Upregulation; Liu2017Knockdown).

## Structure
GTPBP4, or GTP binding protein 4, is a nucleolar protein that plays a role in ribosome biogenesis. The primary structure of GTPBP4 is composed of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the GTPBP4 gene. This protein features GTP-binding domains, which are crucial for its function. The secondary structure of GTPBP4 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function.

The tertiary structure of GTPBP4 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules and its role in ribosome biogenesis. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple subunits, although specific details about these subunits are not provided in the context.

GTPBP4 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. These modifications are important for regulating the protein's function and its involvement in cellular processes. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of GTPBP4 can lead to structural and functional diversity, allowing the protein to perform various roles within the cell. These isoforms may differ in their amino acid sequences, potentially altering their structural and functional properties.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GTPBP4 gene have been implicated in various cancers, suggesting its significant role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), GTPBP4 is upregulated in metastatic tissues compared to primary tumor tissues, promoting metastasis by disrupting the actin cytoskeleton through repression of RhoA signaling. This makes GTPBP4 a potential target for therapeutic intervention in CRC patients with metastases (Yu2016Upregulation).

In breast cancer, GTPBP4 is overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes. Its high expression correlates with enhanced cell proliferation and migration, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Hu2022Integrated).

GTPBP4 also plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. Knockdown of GTPBP4 in HCC cells results in reduced proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, suggesting its function as an oncogene in HCC (Liu2017Knockdown).

In gastric cancer, low expression of GTPBP4 correlates with tumor stages and distal organ metastasis, highlighting its complex role in cancer progression (Zhu2020An).

## Interactions
GTPBP4, a nucleolar protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is known to bind selectively to the p53 protein, a critical regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis, but not to other members of the p53 family such as TAp63α and TAp73α. This interaction was confirmed through coaffinity purification assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that GTPBP4 acts as a negative modulator of p53 by regulating its levels and activity (Lunardi2010A).

GTPBP4 also interacts with components of the ribosome assembly machinery, including nucleolar proteins like NOP2 and nucleolin, which are involved in the assembly of ribosomal subunits (Li2018Identification). In the context of nicotine-associated oral leukoplakia, GTPBP4 has been identified as an interacting partner of Peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), with nicotine exposure upregulating this interaction (Qi2019Proteome). Additionally, GTPBP4 is part of a protein-protein interaction network in sepsis, interacting with proteins such as MYC, BYSL, and NOP14, highlighting its role in complex cellular processes (Li2018Identification).
