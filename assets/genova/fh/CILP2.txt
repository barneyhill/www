# CILP2

## Overview
CILP2, or cartilage intermediate layer protein 2, is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in the extracellular matrix of cartilage tissue. The protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of cartilage by interacting with other matrix components, thereby contributing to the organization and architecture of these tissues (Huang2020CILP2; Wu2019CILP2). Beyond its primary expression in cartilaginous tissues, CILP2 is also found in skeletal muscle and is implicated in various physiological processes, including cell adhesion, signaling, and metabolism (Wu2019CILP2). The protein's involvement in metabolic pathways, such as glucose and lipid metabolism, highlights its broader systemic roles (Wu2019CILP2). CILP2's interactions with key metabolic enzymes and signaling pathways underscore its significance in both health and disease, including its association with cancer and metabolic disorders (Liu2023The; Deng2020Association).

## Function
CILP2 (cartilage intermediate layer protein 2) is a secreted glycoprotein primarily involved in the extracellular matrix of cartilage tissue. It plays a significant role in maintaining cartilage structure and function by interacting with other matrix components, contributing to the structural organization and matrix architecture within these tissues (Huang2020CILP2; Wu2019CILP2). CILP2 is abundantly expressed in cartilaginous tissues and is also present in skeletal muscle, suggesting a role in the extracellular matrix structure and function of non-cartilaginous tissues (Wu2019CILP2).

In healthy human cells, CILP2 is involved in cellular processes such as cell adhesion and signaling, which are crucial for maintaining cartilage integrity and joint health (Huang2020CILP2). The protein is secreted into the bloodstream, where it is detectable in human serum, indicating its systemic presence and potential involvement in broader physiological processes (Wu2019CILP2). CILP2's expression patterns vary in different metabolic states, and it is primarily expressed in muscle, fat, and liver tissues in mice, suggesting its involvement in glucose and lipid metabolism (Wu2019CILP2).

## Clinical Significance
CILP2, located on chromosome 19p13, is implicated in various diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In cancer, CILP2 is upregulated in several types, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive subtypes. Its expression is linked to tumor microenvironment changes, such as increased infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages, and is correlated with the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Liu2023The).

In metabolic conditions, CILP2 is associated with lipid metabolism and cardiovascular diseases. Specific polymorphisms in CILP2 can affect cholesterol esterification rates, influencing serum lipid levels and hyperlipidemia risk. The minor T allele of CILP2 has been noted to counteract lipid elevation, suggesting a protective role against dyslipidemia (Deng2020Association).

CILP2 is also linked to musculoskeletal disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, due to its role in cartilage integrity. Alterations in CILP2 expression or mutations can disrupt normal cartilage function, contributing to disease progression (Liu2023The).

## Interactions
CILP2, or cartilage intermediate layer protein 2, is involved in several interactions that influence metabolic and disease processes. One significant interaction is with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis. CILP2 directly interacts with PEPCK, which plays a crucial role in regulating hepatic glucose production. This interaction affects glucose tolerance and insulin signaling, as CILP2 overexpression impairs glucose tolerance and increases PEPCK expression, leading to hepatic insulin resistance (Wu2019CILP2).

CILP2 also modulates the expression of CD36, a scavenger receptor, through the PPARγ signaling pathway. It increases the transcriptional activity of the CD36 promoter by interacting with two peroxisome-proliferator-responsive elements (PPREs) on the promoter. This interaction is dependent on PPARγ, as demonstrated by the inhibition of CILP2-induced CD36 transcriptional activity by the PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 (Hu2020Circulating).

In the context of cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer, CILP2 is associated with the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. It promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, potentially through interactions that facilitate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activation of the AKT pathway (Liu2023The). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed.
