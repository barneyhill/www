# OR52D1

## Overview
OR52D1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 52 subfamily D member 1, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory system. As a class-I olfactory receptor, it plays a critical role in the perception of smell by recognizing and binding to specific odor molecules, such as monocarboxylic acids and esters. The protein encoded by OR52D1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and participates in a combinatorial detection mechanism, allowing for the discrimination of a wide array of odors. This receptor's function is modulated by its interaction with different G proteins, which can influence its specificity and response to odorants (El2016Encoding; Krautwurst2008Human).

## Function
OR52D1 is an olfactory receptor encoded by a gene located on chromosome 11, belonging to the class-I olfactory receptors. It is involved in the detection of odor molecules, specifically displaying a distinct odorant profile centered around monocarboxylic acids and esters. This receptor operates through a combinatorial detection mechanism, where each receptor can recognize multiple odorants, and each odorant can activate multiple receptors, which is crucial for odor discrimination and quality determination (Krautwurst2008Human).

In cellular biology, OR52D1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is involved in the signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. When expressed in HEK-293 cells, OR52D1 couples with the promiscuous G protein a15, which significantly affects its odorant specificity. The choice of G protein can determine whether odorants act as agonists or antagonists (Krautwurst2008Human).

OR52D1 also shows different response patterns when exposed to binary mixtures of odorants, such as octanal and methional, compared to single odorants. This receptor exhibits phenomena like hyper-addition, where mixtures elicit stronger responses than individual components, highlighting the complexity of odorant processing by the olfactory system (El2016Encoding).
