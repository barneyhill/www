# MRFAP1L2

## Overview
The MRFAP1L2 gene encodes the Morf4 family associated protein 1 like 2, which is a member of the Morf4-related gene family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. MRFAP1L2 is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting a role in fundamental cellular mechanisms. The protein is categorized as a non-enzymatic regulatory protein, potentially interacting with other proteins to modulate their activity. Understanding the precise biological roles and interactions of MRFAP1L2 could provide insights into its involvement in cellular pathways and its potential implications in human health and disease.
