# TMEM238

## Overview
TMEM238 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 238, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not yet fully understood. Transmembrane proteins like TMEM238 typically span the lipid bilayer of cells and are integral to cellular signaling and transport mechanisms. The expression of TMEM238 has been observed to vary in different pathological contexts, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and ovarian cancer, suggesting a potential role in the progression of these diseases (Ye2023The; Li2023Transcriptomic). Despite these associations, the detailed biological functions and mechanisms of action of TMEM238 remain an active area of research, necessitating further studies to elucidate its role in health and disease.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM238 has been studied in the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and ovarian cancer. In PDAC, TMEM238 is identified as a differentially expressed gene with an elevated tendency of expression in malignant epithelial cells over pseudo-time, suggesting its potential role in the progression of these cells (Ye2023The). This indicates that alterations in TMEM238 expression may be associated with the malignancy and progression of pancreatic cancer.

In ovarian cancer, TMEM238 is mentioned as a weak gene within gene networks related to the disease. Although specific details on its role or association with ovarian cancer are not provided, its inclusion in the study suggests a potential, albeit not well-defined, involvement in the disease's gene network (Li2023Transcriptomic).

Overall, while TMEM238 is implicated in the context of these cancers, the precise clinical significance and the impact of its mutations or expression alterations remain to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify its role and potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in these and possibly other conditions.
