# PARVA

## Overview
PARVA is a gene that encodes the protein parvin alpha, a member of the parvin family of actin-binding proteins. Parvin alpha is characterized by its calponin homology (CH) domains, which facilitate its interaction with filamentous actin and its role in cellular adhesion and motility. As a focal adhesion protein, parvin alpha is integral to the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) complex, contributing to the regulation of integrin-mediated signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation, survival, and cytoskeletal organization. The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, underscoring its essential function in maintaining cellular architecture and dynamics (Korenbaum2001Genomic; Mongroo2004βparvin). Parvin alpha's interactions with other proteins, such as ILK and PINCH1, form complexes that are crucial for cell adhesion and survival, particularly in cardiac myocytes and metastatic tumor cells (Chen2005Role; Dylami2024Survival).

## Structure
PARVA (parvin alpha) is a protein characterized by its actin-binding capabilities, primarily facilitated through its calponin homology (CH) domains. The protein structure includes two CH domains arranged in tandem, which are crucial for its interaction with filamentous actin (F-actin) and its association with stress fibers (Mimae2015New; Korenbaum2001Genomic). The C-terminal CH domain of PARVA is particularly significant as it binds various partner molecules, including integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and paxillin, playing a role in integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion (Mimae2015New).

The primary structure of PARVA includes a specific amino acid sequence that allows for these interactions, although detailed sequence information is not provided in the context. The secondary structure likely involves alpha helices and beta sheets typical of CH domains, contributing to its stability and function. In terms of quaternary structure, PARVA forms part of a complex with ILK and PINCH1, known as the IPAP1 complex, which is essential for its role in cellular adhesion and signaling pathways (Chen2005Role).

PARVA also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions within the cell (Nicholson2018αParvin). Splice variants of PARVA are relatively rare, but alternative splicing can result in isoforms with distinct functions, affecting the protein's N-terminal region and its interaction with other cellular components (Korenbaum2001Genomic).

## Function
PARVA (parvin alpha) is a protein that plays a critical role in cell adhesion, motility, and cytoskeletal organization. It is a component of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) complex, which is essential for linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. This complex is involved in integrin-mediated signaling pathways that regulate various cellular functions, including cell proliferation and apoptosis (Mongroo2004βparvin). In healthy human cells, PARVA is implicated in promoting ILK signaling, which involves the phosphorylation of key regulatory targets such as Protein Kinase B (PKB) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Mongroo2004βparvin).

PARVA is nearly ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular functions (Korenbaum2001Genomic). It is associated with focal contacts, dynamic molecular complexes at the sites of the ventral plasma membrane where integrins interact with the extracellular matrix (Korenbaum2001Genomic). The protein is active in focal adhesions and is essential for processes like cell migration and tissue morphogenesis. The conservation of parvins across higher multicellular organisms suggests their importance in integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion (Korenbaum2001Genomic).

## Interactions
PARVA, or alpha-parvin, is a focal adhesion protein that interacts with several other proteins to form complexes crucial for cell adhesion and survival. One of the primary interactions of PARVA is with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and PINCH1, forming the IPAP1 complex. This complex localizes to costameres in cardiac myocytes and is essential for integrin signaling pathways that regulate cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and resistance to apoptosis (Chen2005Role). The IPAP1 complex is also involved in promoting cell survival by protecting against apoptosis induced by serum starvation, potentially through the activation of the Akt kinase (Chen2005Role).

PARVA interacts with actin filaments, influencing cell shape and motility. It is known to associate with actin filaments at membrane ruffles, fibrillar adhesions, and nuclei (Korenbaum2001Genomic). The interaction between PARVA and ILK is crucial for the localization and function of these proteins in cardiac myocytes, as demonstrated by studies showing altered localization when a dominant-negative mutant of ILK is expressed (Chen2005Role).

In addition to its role in cardiac myocytes, PARVA is involved in the survival, adhesion, and migration of metastatic breast tumor cells, where it interacts with integrin-linked kinase to modify tumor cell shape, migration, invasion, and survival signaling (Dylami2024Survival).
