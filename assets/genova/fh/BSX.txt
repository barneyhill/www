# BSX

## Overview
The BSX gene encodes the brain-specific homeobox protein, a transcription factor primarily expressed in the hypothalamus. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating energy balance and feeding behavior by modulating the expression of orexigenic neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) (Nogueiras2008Bsx; Sakkou2007A). As a transcription factor, BSX is involved in the recruitment of glucocorticoid receptors to the AgRP promoter, facilitating the expression of genes essential for appetite regulation, particularly during fasting (Lee2013BrainSpecific). Additionally, BSX interacts with other transcription factors, such as CREB and FoxO1, to influence neuropeptide expression in response to energy balance signals (Sakkou2007A). The gene's expression is modulated by peripheral signals, including ghrelin and leptin, underscoring its role in the neural circuits that govern energy homeostasis (Nogueiras2008Bsx).

## Function
The BSX (brain-specific homeobox) gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of energy balance and feeding behavior. BSX is primarily active in the hypothalamus, where it influences the expression of key orexigenic neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), which are crucial for appetite regulation and energy homeostasis (Nogueiras2008Bsx; Sakkou2007A). BSX functions as a target selector for glucocorticoid receptors, facilitating the recruitment of these receptors to the AgRP promoter, which is essential for the expression of orexigenic genes in response to fasting (Lee2013BrainSpecific).

BSX is also involved in the regulation of spontaneous physical activity and hyperphagic responses, acting as a master regulator for the hypothalamic expression of NPY and AgRP (Nogueiras2008Bsx). It interacts with other transcription factors, such as CREB and FoxO1, to modulate the fasting-dependent up-regulation of these neuropeptides (Sakkou2007A). The gene's expression is regulated by afferent signals reflecting peripheral energy balance, with factors like ghrelin and leptin influencing its activity (Nogueiras2008Bsx). Overall, BSX is a critical component in the neural circuits governing energy homeostasis and feeding behavior.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the BSX gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In Jacobsen syndrome, a disorder characterized by deletions on chromosome 11q, the BSX gene is located within a critical region associated with severe cognitive impairments. Patients with larger deletions that include the BSX gene exhibit more severe neurocognitive and behavioral defects, suggesting that BSX haploinsufficiency may contribute to these impairments (Coldren2008Chromosomal).

BSX is also involved in energy homeostasis and feeding behavior. Alterations in BSX expression can lead to metabolic conditions such as obesity. In mice, BSX deficiency results in reduced expression of neuropeptides NPY and AgRP, which are crucial for energy balance and feeding behavior. This deficiency can lead to reduced hyperphagia and altered locomotory behavior, indicating a potential role in metabolic regulation and obesity (Sakkou2007A).

The BSX gene's role in the hypothalamus suggests it may influence conditions related to energy balance and feeding behavior, potentially linking it to disorders such as leptin resistance and obesity (Nogueiras2008Bsx). These findings highlight the clinical significance of BSX in both neurocognitive and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
The BSX protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene regulation. In zebrafish, BSX interacts with the transcription factor Otx5 to transactivate the exorh promoter, which is essential for pineal-specific gene expression. This interaction is specific, as no synergistic action is observed when Otx5 is replaced by Crx, a factor involved in retinal gene expression (Mano2019Brainspecific). BSX binds to specific DNA sequences, particularly the octanucleotide motif TAATCGGT, which includes the pineal regulatory element (PIRE), a binding site for Crx/Otx proteins (Mano2019Brainspecific).

In the context of energy balance, BSX interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the hypothalamus. This interaction is enhanced by glucocorticoid signals, such as those induced by fasting, leading to the synergistic activation of the AgRP promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated that fasting and glucocorticoid signals increase the recruitment of GR to the AgRP promoter, which also enhances BSX binding (Lee2013BrainSpecific). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments have shown that BSX and GR form a complex, indicating a physical interaction between these proteins (Lee2013BrainSpecific).
