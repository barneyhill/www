# OR4F16

## Overview
The OR4F16 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily F member 16, which is part of the olfactory receptor family. This family of proteins is categorized as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules. The olfactory receptors, including OR4F16, play a crucial role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to the perception of odors. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is a common feature among GPCRs, allowing them to transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins (Qiu2020aarFDC).
