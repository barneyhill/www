# UCP3

## Overview
UCP3 (uncoupling protein 3) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial carrier protein primarily expressed in skeletal muscle. The protein, uncoupling protein 3, is a member of the mitochondrial uncoupling protein family, which plays a crucial role in energy metabolism by facilitating proton transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process, known as mild uncoupling, helps to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and protect cells from oxidative damage (Brand2005Physiological). UCP3 is also involved in fatty acid metabolism, assisting in the transport and oxidation of fatty acids, and its expression is modulated by metabolic states such as fasting and high-fat diets (Pohl2019Important; Schrauwen2002Skeletal). While initially considered for its potential role in thermogenesis, UCP3's primary functions are more aligned with reducing oxidative stress and managing lipid metabolism (Brand2005Physiological; Garvey2003The).

## Structure
UCP3 (uncoupling protein 3) is a mitochondrial carrier protein characterized by a primary structure consisting of a 312 amino acid peptide chain in its long form, with a molecular weight of 34.2 kDa. The protein is organized into six transmembrane domains connected by three long matrix loops and two shorter intermembrane space loops, with both the N- and C-termini located in the intermembrane space (Pohl2019Important). The secondary structure includes transmembrane alpha-helices, typical of mitochondrial carriers, and features a tripartite structure where each part is composed of two transmembrane helices joined by a matrix loop containing the conserved mitochondrial carrier motif PX[D/E]XX[K/R] (Pohl2019Important; RICQUIER2000The).

UCP3 exists in two splice variant isoforms: the long form (UCP3L) and a short form (UCP3S), which lacks the sixth transmembrane domain and has a length of 275 amino acids with a molecular weight of 29.8 kDa (Boss1997Uncoupling; RICQUIER2000The). The tertiary structure of UCP3 has been modeled based on its homology to adenine nucleotide translocase, although its precise three-dimensional conformation remains to be fully elucidated (Pohl2019Important). The quaternary structure of UCP3 is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.

## Function
UCP3 (uncoupling protein 3) is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and plays a significant role in energy metabolism and the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in healthy human cells. UCP3 is involved in the process of mild uncoupling, where it facilitates the transport of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This action reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential, which can lead to decreased production of ROS, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage (Brand2005Physiological).

UCP3 is also implicated in fatty acid metabolism. It is thought to assist in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, supporting fatty acid oxidation, or out of the mitochondria to prevent triglyceride accumulation (Pohl2019Important). The expression of UCP3 is influenced by metabolic states such as fasting and high-fat diets, indicating its role in adapting to changes in energy demand (Pohl2019Important; Schrauwen2002Skeletal).

While UCP3 has been studied for its potential role in thermogenesis, evidence suggests that its primary function is not in regulating energy expenditure under normal conditions. Instead, UCP3's role in reducing oxidative stress and managing lipid metabolism is more prominent (Brand2005Physiological; Garvey2003The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the UCP3 gene have been associated with several metabolic disorders, including obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Specific polymorphisms, such as the -55C/T variant, have been linked to changes in body mass index (BMI), cholesterol levels, and the risk of T2DM, although findings are inconsistent across different studies (de2013Associations). The rs3781907 polymorphism is associated with increased cholesterol levels and a higher risk of T2DM, while rs647126 and rs3781907 contribute to obesity risk in children (Salopuro2009Variation; Fortes2023The).

Mutations like V56M and Q252X in UCP3 have been shown to impair fatty acid oxidation and are linked to higher BMI, fat mass, and insulin levels in obese children (Musa2011Four). These mutations may also lead to altered body composition and metabolic conditions related to obesity (Musa2011Four). The UCP3 gene's expression is influenced by factors such as physical activity and is associated with changes in body weight, highlighting its role in energy metabolism and obesity (de2013Associations). Variations in the UCP3 gene cluster have been implicated in the development of T2DM and metabolic syndrome traits, including abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia (Salopuro2009Variation).

## Interactions
Uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) participates in several interactions that influence its function in mitochondrial processes. UCP3 is known to be inhibited by purine nucleotides (PNs) such as ATP, ADP, and AMP. These nucleotides bind to specific arginine residues on UCP3, with ATP being the most potent inhibitor. The inhibition potency is linked to the phosphorylation state of the nucleotides, with triphosphate forms showing the strongest inhibition (Macher2018Inhibition). 

UCP3 also interacts with free fatty acids (FFAs), which can activate its proton transport function. The presence of unsaturated fatty acids like arachidonic acid enhances UCP3's activity, although this activation is subject to competition with PNs, particularly ATP (Pohl2019Important; Macher2018Inhibition). 

Additionally, UCP3 is involved in the exchange of C4 metabolites, such as aspartate and phosphate. The protein facilitates the heteroexchange of these metabolites, with specific arginine residues playing crucial roles in binding and exchange processes (Kreiter2023Uncoupling). These interactions highlight UCP3's role in regulating mitochondrial function and energy metabolism.
