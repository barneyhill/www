# GTSE1

## Overview
GTSE1, or G2 and S-phase expressed 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics during cell division. The GTSE1 protein is primarily categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, playing a pivotal role in stabilizing microtubules during mitosis. It achieves this by interacting with and inhibiting the microtubule depolymerase MCAK, thereby ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation. This function is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and preventing chromosomal instability, which can lead to various pathologies, including cancer (Bendre2016GTSE1). GTSE1 is also involved in cellular processes such as cell migration and focal adhesion disassembly, interacting with proteins like EB1 and the TACC3-clathrin complex (Ryan2020Defining; Scolz2012GTSE1). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are tightly regulated, with implications in cancer progression, making GTSE1 a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Lei2023High; Lin2019GTSE1).

## Function
The GTSE1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in stabilizing microtubules during mitosis, which is essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation. GTSE1 achieves this by inhibiting the activity of the microtubule depolymerase MCAK, ensuring that kinetochore-microtubule attachments are dynamic enough to correct erroneous attachments while being stable enough to efficiently capture and align chromosomes. This balance is critical to prevent chromosomal instability (Bendre2016GTSE1).

GTSE1 is involved in maintaining the stability of kinetochore-microtubules, which are crucial for accurate chromosome segregation. In GTSE1-depleted cells, there is a defect in chromosome alignment and a delay in anaphase onset, indicating that the spindle assembly checkpoint is active and that these cells may struggle to establish stable kinetochore-microtubule attachments (Bendre2016GTSE1).

GTSE1 also interacts with the TACC3-clathrin complex, which is necessary for kinetochore-microtubule integrity, and its function is linked to Aurora A kinase, which controls GTSE1 localization to the spindle (Bendre2016GTSE1). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to cell proliferation and genomic stability (Monte2000Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in GTSE1 expression have been implicated in the progression of several cancers. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), GTSE1 is overexpressed and associated with poor clinical outcomes, including increased cell proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin. This suggests that GTSE1 may act as an oncogene in ccRCC, contributing to its malignant progression and making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Lei2023High).

In breast cancer, GTSE1 expression is upregulated, particularly in cases with p53 mutations. This upregulation is linked to increased malignancy, poor prognosis, and resistance to multiple chemotherapy drugs. GTSE1 promotes metastasis through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and affects cell cycle regulation by interacting with p53, leading to its degradation (Lin2019GTSE1).

GTSE1 is also implicated in acral melanoma, where its high expression correlates with advanced disease stages and poor disease-free survival. It promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, partly through its interaction with the transcription factor ITGA2, which is involved in EMT (Xu2018High).

## Interactions
GTSE1 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with EB1, a microtubule plus-end tracking protein, through SKIP-like motifs, which are crucial for GTSE1's localization to growing microtubule tips. This interaction is essential for GTSE1's role in cell migration and focal adhesion disassembly (Scolz2012GTSE1). GTSE1 also interacts with the microtubule depolymerase MCAK, inhibiting its activity and thereby stabilizing microtubules during chromosome alignment and segregation (Bendre2016GTSE1).

GTSE1 is part of the TACC3-chTOG-clathrin complex, interacting with clathrin through LIDL motifs in its clathrin interaction domain. This interaction is necessary for GTSE1's recruitment to the mitotic spindle (Ryan2020Defining). Additionally, GTSE1 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, binding to its C-terminal region. This interaction suggests a regulatory role for GTSE1 in p53-mediated apoptosis (Monte2003The).

GTSE1's interactions are regulated by phosphorylation, particularly by CDK1, which affects its ability to track microtubule tips by modulating its interaction with EB1 (Scolz2012GTSE1). These interactions highlight GTSE1's multifaceted role in cell cycle regulation and microtubule dynamics.
