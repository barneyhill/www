# ACTL7A

## Overview
The ACTL7A gene encodes the protein Actin-like 7A, which is a member of the actin family of proteins. This protein is primarily expressed in the testes and plays a critical role in spermiogenesis, particularly in the formation and function of the acrosome, a cap-like structure on the sperm head essential for fertilization (Xin2020Disruption; Ferrer2023Testisspecific). Actin-like 7A is involved in the acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette complex, contributing to the proper shaping of the sperm head and ensuring the structural integrity of the acrosome (Zhang2023Loss). The protein's interactions with various cytoskeletal components underscore its importance in maintaining cytoskeletal dynamics during sperm development (Ferrer2023Testisspecific). Mutations in the ACTL7A gene have been linked to male infertility and early embryonic arrest, highlighting its clinical significance (Xin2020Disruption; Zhang2023Loss).

## Structure
The ACTL7A gene encodes a protein consisting of 435 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 48.6 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.64 (Chadwick1999Cloning). The primary structure of ACTL7A includes a conserved actin domain and a unique intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of 70 amino acids, which is conserved in mammals and binds the LIM1-2 domains of Testin (Ferrer2023Testisspecific). Sequence analysis has identified a single conserved cAMP/cGMP-dependent phosphorylation site at residues 113-116 and six conserved protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at residues 32, 92, 106, 178, 239, and 298 (Chadwick1999Cloning). A conserved leucine zipper consensus sequence is found at position 235 to 256, which may play a role in protein-protein interactions (Chadwick1999Cloning).

The secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ACTL7A are not detailed in the available literature. However, the protein is known to interact with several other proteins, including actin-related protein 2 (ARP2), dynactin subunit 1 (DCTN1), myosin 6 (MYO6), and profilin 4 (PFN4), suggesting its involvement in complex protein interactions and cytoskeletal dynamics (Ferrer2023Testisspecific).

## Function
The ACTL7A gene encodes Actin-like 7 A, a protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of the acrosome in sperm cells. In healthy human sperm, ACTL7A is localized on the acrosome, overlapping with the sperm outer acrosomal membrane marker peanut agglutinin (PNA). This localization is essential for maintaining the proper structure and function of the acrosome, which is vital for fertilization (Xin2020Disruption). ACTL7A is involved in the formation and fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles during acrosome biogenesis, a process critical for the structural integrity of the acrosome (Xin2020Disruption).

The protein is part of the acroplaxome, a structure that contributes to the acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette complex during spermiogenesis. This complex is essential for shaping the spermatid head, and defects in its structure can lead to sperm malformation and infertility (Zhang2023Loss). ACTL7A interacts with various cytoskeletal proteins and is indispensable for subacrosomal-associated F-actin formation and acrosomal anchoring, which are crucial for male fertility (Zhang2023Loss). The protein's role in maintaining acrosomal integrity is vital for successful fertilization and subsequent embryonic development (Xin2020Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTL7A gene are associated with male infertility and early embryonic arrest. A specific homozygous mutation, c.733G>A (p.Ala245Thr), has been identified in infertile individuals, leading to acrosomal ultrastructural defects in sperm that are not detectable through conventional semen analysis. This mutation results in abnormal sperm morphology and is linked to early embryonic arrest during in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures (Xin2020Disruption).

The loss of ACTL7A disrupts the acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette complex, crucial for proper sperm head shaping, leading to small head sperm and male infertility. This defect is observed in Actl7a knockout (KO) mice, which exhibit similar sperm abnormalities to those seen in humans with the mutation (Zhang2023Loss). The mutation also affects the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, inhibiting autophagy and resulting in the accumulation of PDLIM1, which contributes to defective manchette formation and abnormal sperm head morphology (Zhang2023Loss).

Therapeutic approaches, such as artificial oocyte activation (AOA), have been shown to overcome infertility caused by ACTL7A mutations, suggesting potential treatments for affected individuals (Xin2020Disruption; Zhang2023Loss).

## Interactions
ACTL7A is involved in several interactions critical for spermiogenesis, particularly in the formation of the acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette complex. This complex is essential for shaping the sperm head. ACTL7A interacts with PDLIM1, a key mediator between autophagy and cytoskeleton organization. The accumulation of PDLIM1, due to the loss of ACTL7A, disrupts the organization of the manchette, a structure composed of microtubules and F-actin networks. PDLIM1 forms a complex with ACTN1 and PALLDA, localizing on the manchette, and its accumulation leads to random orientation of the manchette, contributing to the small head sperm phenotype observed in Actl7a-KO mice (Zhang2023Loss).

ACTL7A is also involved in the regulation of autophagy through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. The loss of ACTL7A leads to the inhibition of autophagy, resulting in the accumulation of PDLIM1, which negatively affects cytoskeleton organization (Zhang2023Loss). These interactions highlight the role of ACTL7A in maintaining proper cytoskeleton dynamics during spermiogenesis, impacting the acrosome-acroplaxome-manchette complex and sperm head morphology (Zhang2023Loss).
