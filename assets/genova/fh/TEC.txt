# TEC

## Overview
TEC is a gene that encodes the tec protein tyrosine kinase, a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. This protein is characterized by its distinct domain architecture, which includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Tec homology (TH) domain, Src homology 3 (SH3) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, and a kinase domain. These domains facilitate its role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly within hematopoietic cells, where it influences processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Smith2001The; Mano1999Tec). TEC is expressed in various stages of B-cell maturation and is involved in T-cell receptor signaling, playing a significant role in immune cell function and development (Kitanaka1998Expression; Miller2002New). Alterations in TEC expression or function have been linked to immune system dysregulation and diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiovascular conditions (Sandner2021The; Yin2022Regulation).

## Structure
The TEC protein tyrosine kinase is a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, characterized by a distinct domain architecture. It contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is crucial for binding phospholipids and membrane association in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) dependent manner (Smith2001The; Mano1999Tec). The PH domain is followed by a Tec homology (TH) domain, which includes a Btk motif and a proline-rich region, forming a binding site for GTP-bound Ga subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (Smith2001The; Mano1999Tec).

TEC also features Src homology 3 (SH3) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and regulation of kinase activity. The SH3 domain is implicated in negative regulation, with its deletion leading to activation (Mano1999Tec). The C-terminal region contains the kinase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Smith2001The).

TEC undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its activity. The phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues is crucial for its activation and function in signal transduction pathways (Mano1999Tec). The mouse Tec gene produces two isoforms differing in the SH3 domain, affecting their binding to cellular proteins (Mano1999Tec).

## Function
TEC, a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly within hematopoietic cells. It is involved in processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. TEC is active in both the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, where it participates in signaling cascades that influence immune cell function and development (Smith2001The).

TEC is expressed in various stages of B-cell maturation, including pro-B, pre-B, and mature B cells. It becomes activated upon ligation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) in mature B cells and through CD19 and CD38 in immature B cells, leading to its tyrosine phosphorylation and increased kinase activity. This suggests that TEC plays a role in B-cell development and activation, potentially complementing the function of Btk (Kitanaka1998Expression).

In T cells, TEC kinases like Itk and Rlk are involved in TCR-induced signaling, affecting thymic selection and peripheral T cell homeostasis. These kinases regulate T cell activation, differentiation, and apoptosis, highlighting their importance in lymphocyte biology (Miller2002New). TEC also modulates the Th17 response by influencing IL-23R expression and subsequent STAT3 activation, which is crucial for maintaining a balance in cytokine production and T cell differentiation (Boucheron2010The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the TEC gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving immune system dysregulation. In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), TEC plays a crucial role in regulating Th17 cell differentiation and pathogenicity. Tec-deficient CD4+ T cells exhibit enhanced Th17 differentiation and increased pathogenicity, particularly towards IFN-g+ Th17 cells, which are associated with inflammatory conditions. This suggests that alterations in TEC expression may contribute to the severity of gut-related inflammatory diseases, such as colitis, by promoting more pathogenic Th17 subsets (Sandner2021The).

TEC is also involved in cardiovascular diseases, particularly ischemic heart disease and cardiac pressure overload hypertrophy. It plays a protective role in myocardial ischemia by interacting with HIF-1α, a mediator of adenosine nucleoside-induced neuroprotection in hypoxia-stimulated cells. TEC may also contribute to cardiac protection in pressure overload hypertrophy by interacting with ROCK1, a kinase involved in reactive fibrosis (Yin2022Regulation).

In B cell development, TEC, along with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), is crucial for proper maturation. While TEC alone is not essential, its absence, combined with Btk deficiency, leads to severe B cell development issues, highlighting its compensatory role in lymphocyte development (Ellmeier2000Severe).

## Interactions
TEC (tec protein tyrosine kinase) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling. TEC is known to interact with phospholipase C-gamma (PLC-γ), specifically PLC-γ2, which is a major downstream substrate of TEC family kinases. This interaction is essential for TEC-induced NFAT activation, a process that does not require other proteins like Lyn, Syk, or Btk (Tomlinson2004Expression). The SH2 domain of TEC is implicated in coupling to an unidentified adapter for PLC-γ activation, as it does not efficiently interact with known adapters like SLP-76 and LAT (Tomlinson2004Expression).

TEC also interacts with the protein tyrosine kinase Lck, which provides an upstream signal necessary for TEC activation. This interaction is crucial for TEC-induced NFAT activation, highlighting Lck's role in TEC signaling pathways (Tomlinson2004Expression). The SH3 domain of TEC can interact with SHIP family phosphatases, which are potent inhibitors of TEC-induced NFAT activation (Tomlinson2004Expression).

TEC's interactions are not limited to these proteins, as it is part of a broader signaling network involving various kinases and phosphatases, contributing to its regulatory functions in immune responses (Smith2001The).
