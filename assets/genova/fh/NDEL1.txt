# NDEL1

## Overview
NDEL1 (nudE neurodevelopment protein 1 like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for neurodevelopmental processes, particularly in the organization of microtubules and neuronal migration. The NDEL1 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins such as LIS1 and dynein, playing a pivotal role in mitotic spindle orientation and chromosome movement during cell division (Derewenda2007The; Żyłkiewicz2011The). Functioning primarily in the cytoplasm and centrosomes, NDEL1 is involved in recruiting proteins to promote microtubule dynamics and actin polymerization, essential for neuronal precursor cell alignment and neurite outgrowth (Bradshaw2016NDE1). Additionally, NDEL1 exhibits endooligopeptidase activity, which is vital for neuronal differentiation (Hayashi2010Assessing). Clinically, mutations in the NDEL1 gene have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as pachygyria and schizophrenia, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal neuronal function and its potential as a therapeutic target (Tsai2024Novel; Bradshaw2016NDE1).

## Structure
The NDEL1 protein is characterized by a coiled-coil domain that spans approximately the first 170-200 amino acids of the protein, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins such as LIS1 and dynein (Derewenda2007The; Żyłkiewicz2011The). This domain is organized into three distinct regions: regions I and II form a stable parallel dimer, while region III is less stable and can form an antiparallel four-helix bundle (Derewenda2007The). The coiled-coil structure is maintained by hydrophobic interactions, with specific residues such as asparagines playing a significant role in stabilizing the dimeric state (Derewenda2007The).

NDEL1 forms predominantly parallel dimers in solution, but can also form higher-order oligomers, such as tetramers, under certain conditions (Derewenda2007The). The interaction with LIS1 is mediated by a specific region within the coiled-coil domain, spanning residues 103-153, which is identified as the minimal LIS1-binding domain (Derewenda2007The). The protein's structure is further regulated by phosphorylation, particularly in its unstructured C-terminal domain, which affects its interaction with dynein and microtubule organization (Żyłkiewicz2011The). NDEL1's ability to form complex structures and its interactions with other proteins are essential for its role in neurodevelopmental processes.

## Function
NDEL1 (nudE neurodevelopment protein 1 like 1) is a critical protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neurodevelopment. It plays a significant role in microtubule organization and neuronal migration by interacting with proteins such as LIS1 and dynein. This interaction is essential for the proper orientation of the mitotic spindle and chromosome movement during cell division, which is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function (Bradshaw2016NDE1; Shu2004Ndel1).

NDEL1 is active in the cytoplasm and centrosomes, where it contributes to the integrity and function of the centrosome. It recruits proteins like katanin to promote microtubule emanation and projection into neurites, affecting the alignment of the microtubule organizing center in neuronal precursor cells (Bradshaw2016NDE1). NDEL1 also modulates intermediate filaments, such as neurofilament light subunit and vimentin, and is involved in actin polymerization through the WAVE protein complex (Bradshaw2016NDE1).

In addition to its structural roles, NDEL1 has enzymatic activity, specifically endooligopeptidase activity, which is crucial for neurite outgrowth and differentiation in neuronal cells (Hayashi2010Assessing). This activity is regulated by interactions with proteins like DISC1, which are important for neuronal morphogenesis and positioning (Hayashi2010Assessing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NDEL1 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Variants in NDEL1, such as the p.R105P mutation, have been associated with pachygyria, a cortical malformation characterized by impaired neuronal migration. This mutation disrupts the interaction between NDEL1 and LIS1, affecting nucleokinesis and leading to cortical development issues (Tsai2024Novel). 

NDEL1 is also linked to schizophrenia, with copy number variations at the 16p13.11 locus, which includes NDEL1, associated with the disorder. These genetic alterations may increase vulnerability to schizophrenia, particularly when combined with other risk factors. Altered NDEL1 enzyme activity has been observed in schizophrenia patients, suggesting its potential role in the disorder's pathophysiology (Bradshaw2016NDE1).

In epilepsy, NDEL1 dysfunction is associated with synaptic and molecular changes that contribute to the condition. Mice with disrupted NDEL1 expression in forebrain excitatory neurons exhibit seizures and behavioral deficits, highlighting the gene's role in maintaining normal neuronal function (Gavrilovici2021Behavioral). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NDEL1 in understanding and potentially treating conditions like epilepsy and schizophrenia.

## Interactions
NDEL1 (nudE neurodevelopment protein 1 like 1) is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that are essential for neurodevelopmental processes. It interacts with DISC1, a protein implicated in psychiatric disorders, where specific amino acids in both proteins are crucial for their binding. The interaction between DISC1 and NDEL1 is essential for neurite outgrowth, and genetic variations in DISC1 can affect this interaction (Kamiya2006DISC1–NDEL1NUDEL).

NDEL1 also interacts with components of the dynein motor complex, including LIS1 and dynein itself. It binds to the dynein heavy chain and intermediate chain, playing a role in modulating dynein's microtubule-binding affinity and facilitating the association of LIS1 with dynein (Garrott2022Nde1; Shu2004Ndel1). NDEL1's interaction with LIS1 is crucial for neuronal migration and positioning, as it recruits LIS1 to dynein on the nuclear membrane, activating the motor complex (Chansard2011Ndel1).

NDEL1 also forms a complex with ankyrin-G (AnkG) and ankyrin-B (AnkB), which are involved in maintaining axonal polarity. These interactions are characterized by a specific stoichiometry and are mediated by the C-terminal coiled-coil domains of NDEL1 (Ye2019Mechanistic).
