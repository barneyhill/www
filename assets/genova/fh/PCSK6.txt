# PCSK6

## Overview
PCSK6, or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 6, is a gene that encodes a serine protease enzyme involved in the proteolytic processing of a diverse array of precursor proteins. This enzyme, also known as paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4), is a member of the proprotein convertase family, which plays a pivotal role in the activation of various proteins by cleaving them at specific sites. The PCSK6 protein is integral to numerous physiological processes, including cardiovascular development, blood pressure regulation, and tissue homeostasis, through its involvement in the maturation of growth factors, peptide hormones, and other signaling molecules (Wu2022Proprotein; Chen2015PCSK6mediated). Its activity is crucial in the cardiovascular system, where it influences heart formation, vascular remodeling, and cardiac repair (Wu2022Proprotein). Additionally, PCSK6 is implicated in reproductive health and disease pathogenesis, including cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting its broad biological significance (Wu2022Proprotein; Oldham2022PCSK6).

## Structure


## Function
PCSK6, also known as paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme 4 (PACE4), is a serine protease involved in the proteolytic cleavage of a wide range of proteins, including growth factors, signaling molecules, peptide hormones, proteolytic enzymes, and adhesion proteins. This cleavage is crucial for regulating protein structure and function, essential for tissue homeostasis and physiological function (Wu2022Proprotein). In the cardiovascular system, PCSK6 plays a key role in heart formation, lipoprotein metabolism, body fluid homeostasis, cardiac repair, and vascular remodeling (Wu2022Proprotein). 

PCSK6 is also critical for the activation of corin, a serine protease that regulates blood pressure through the activation of natriuretic peptides. Corin is synthesized as an inactive zymogen and requires PCSK6 for activation. Inhibition of PCSK6 results in reduced corin activation, leading to salt-sensitive hypertension (Chen2015PCSK6mediated). 

In human granulosa cells, PCSK6 is highly expressed and plays an anti-apoptotic role by regulating the secretion of local hormones such as activin A, TGFβ2, and follistatin, which are involved in apoptosis regulation (Wang2014PCSK6). PCSK6 is also implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle cell function during vascular remodeling, influencing cell migration, proliferation, and extracellular matrix organization (Rykaczewska2020PCSK6).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PCSK6 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cardiovascular biology, PCSK6 is crucial for corin activation, which is essential for normal blood pressure regulation. Deficiency in PCSK6 can lead to salt-sensitive hypertension due to impaired corin activation, resulting in high pro-ANP levels and reduced natriuretic peptide activities (Chen2015PCSK6mediated). Variants in PCSK6 are also associated with hypertension and coronary artery stenosis (Wu2022Proprotein).

PCSK6 plays a significant role in heart development, particularly in atrial septation. Mutations or alterations in PCSK6 expression are linked to atrial septal defects (ASDs). PCSK6 is part of a gene network involving Tbx5 and Osr1, which is crucial for cardiac progenitor proliferation. PCSK6 knockout mouse embryos exhibit heart defects, supporting its involvement in heart development (Zhang2016Gene).

In reproductive health, altered PCSK6 expression is associated with ovarian pathologies. Pcsk6 mutant mice show progressive loss of ovarian function and altered gene expression, leading to conditions like infertility and premature ovarian insufficiency (Mujoomdar2011Pcsk6).

PCSK6 is also implicated in cancer progression. Its expression is upregulated in various cancers, including ovarian cancer, where it may facilitate tumor invasion and migration (Wu2022Proprotein). In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, increased PCSK6 expression is associated with reduced transplant-free survival, indicating its potential role in disease progression (Oldham2022PCSK6).

## Interactions
PCSK6, a member of the proprotein convertase family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its biological functions. It is known to activate corin, a serine protease that plays a significant role in blood pressure regulation by converting pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) to ANP. This activation occurs at the cell surface, where PCSK6 and corin traffic separately before PCSK6 activates corin (Wu2022Proprotein; Chen2015PCSK6mediated).

PCSK6 also interacts with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP2 and MMP14, forming a network that regulates smooth muscle cell (SMC) function during vascular remodeling. This interaction is crucial for SMC activation, migration, and replication, especially in the context of vascular injury and atherosclerosis (Rykaczewska2020PCSK6).

In cardiac remodeling, PCSK6 is involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway, influencing collagen production and fibrosis. This interaction suggests a role for PCSK6 in cardiac repair processes, particularly after myocardial infarction (Kuhn2020Secretome). These interactions highlight PCSK6's involvement in critical physiological and pathological processes, including cardiovascular health and disease.
