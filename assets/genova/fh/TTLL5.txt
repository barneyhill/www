# TTLL5

## Overview
The TTLL5 gene encodes the tubulin tyrosine ligase like 5 protein, which is a member of the tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) family. This protein functions as a polyglutamylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of glutamate residues to target proteins, a post-translational modification essential for the proper functioning of ciliary structures, particularly in the retina (Oh2022Expanding; Smirnov2021Novel). TTLL5 is predominantly expressed in retinal photoreceptors, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these cells by modifying the RPGR ORF15 protein, which is crucial for photoreceptor cilia function (Sun2016Loss). The protein's activity is vital for vision, and mutations in the TTLL5 gene are linked to various retinal dystrophies, underscoring its clinical significance (Smirnov2021Novel; Sun2016Loss).

## Structure
The TTLL5 protein is involved in the glutamylation of RPGR ORF15, a process crucial for retinal function. It contains two major functional domains: the TTLL core domain and the cofactor interaction domain (CID) (Smirnov2021Novel). The TTLL core domain, comprising the first 569 residues, is necessary for its glutamylase activity, while the CID, spanning residues 640-851, is required for efficient interaction with RPGR ORF15 (Sun2016Loss). The CID acts as an adapter to engage the C-terminal basic domain of RPGR ORF15, facilitating the specific interaction necessary for RPGR's function in photoreceptor cilia (Sun2016Loss).

TTLL5 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with TTLL-5A and TTLL-5B being two such isoforms. The TTL domain spans amino acid residues 67-425 in TTLL-5A and 120-478 in TTLL-5B (Power2020Mutation). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may also occur, potentially affecting the protein's structure and function. Variants in TTLL5, including frameshift, splice site, and nonsense mutations, can disrupt its glutamylase function, leading to retinal dystrophies (Smirnov2021Novel).

## Function
The TTLL5 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through polyglutamylation, a process that involves the addition of glutamate residues. This modification is essential for the function of ciliary structures, particularly in the retina, where TTLL5 is highly expressed (Oh2022Expanding; Smirnov2021Novel). TTLL5 specifically targets the RPGR ORF15 variant, a protein critical for photoreceptor cilia function, by facilitating its glutamylation. This modification is necessary for maintaining the structural integrity and function of photoreceptor cells, which are vital for vision (Sun2016Loss).

In healthy human cells, TTLL5 is primarily active in the retina, where it is expressed in cone and rod photoreceptors, although at lower levels in rods (Smirnov2021Novel). The protein's activity ensures the proper function of photoreceptors by maintaining the glutamylation of RPGR ORF15, which is crucial for photoreceptor health and preventing retinal degeneration (Sun2016Loss). TTLL5 also has a role in the polyglutamylation of α-tubulin, which is important for microtubule stability and function, influencing processes such as intracellular transport and ciliary function (Oh2022Expanding; Bao2023Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTLL5 gene are associated with several retinal dystrophies, including cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), cone dystrophy (COD), and early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (EOSRD). These conditions are characterized by the degeneration of photoreceptors, leading to progressive vision loss. TTLL5 mutations disrupt the glutamylation of the RPGR ORF15 protein, a process crucial for photoreceptor function, contributing to the pathogenesis of these retinal diseases (Sun2016Loss).

Patients with TTLL5 mutations may exhibit a range of symptoms, including poor vision, night blindness, photophobia, and myopia. Clinical assessments often reveal central scotomata and color vision defects, with imaging showing macular lesions and thinning of the outer nuclear layer (Smirnov2021Novel). The phenotypic variability is notable, with some patients experiencing additional symptoms such as high-frequency hearing loss, suggesting a possible syndromic disorder (Oh2022Expanding).

TTLL5 mutations are typically recessive and include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants, as well as large deletions. These mutations often result in loss-of-function alleles, impairing the gene's glutamylase activity and leading to retinal degeneration (Smirnov2021Novel; Sun2016Loss). The presence of Alu repeats in intronic regions may contribute to these deletions (Smirnov2021Novel).

## Interactions
TTLL5 (tubulin tyrosine ligase like 5) is involved in several critical protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. TTLL5 interacts with CSAP (cilia and spindle-associated protein), forming a complex that enhances TTLL5's glutamylation activity on microtubules. This interaction is crucial for microtubule stability and function, as CSAP promotes the relocalization of TTLL5 to microtubules, thereby increasing its enzymatic activity specifically on these structures (Bompard2018CSAP). The interaction between CSAP and TTLL5 is mediated by specific domains in both proteins, with CSAP's C-terminal part binding to TTLL5's N-terminal fragment containing the TTL domain (Bompard2018CSAP).

TTLL5 also interacts with RPGR ORF15, a variant of the retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator protein. This interaction is specific to TTLL5 among the TTLL family and is essential for the glutamylation of RPGR ORF15, a modification critical for its function in photoreceptor cells. The interaction occurs via the C-terminal basic domain of RPGR ORF15 and the cofactor interaction domain of TTLL5 (Sun2016Loss). Mutations in TTLL5 that disrupt this interaction are linked to retinal dystrophy, highlighting the importance of TTLL5 in retinal health (Sun2016Loss).
