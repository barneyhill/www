# POLD3

## Overview
The POLD3 gene encodes the DNA polymerase delta 3, accessory subunit, a crucial component of the DNA polymerase delta (Polδ) complex, which is integral to DNA replication and repair processes. This protein is categorized as an accessory subunit and plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability by facilitating lagging strand synthesis and participating in DNA repair mechanisms such as homologous recombination and translesion synthesis (TLS) (Tumini2016Roles; Hirota2015The). POLD3 enhances the processivity of Polδ, particularly in bypassing DNA lesions, and interacts with other proteins, including PCNA and Rev1, to execute its functions effectively (Tumini2016Roles; Pustovalova2016Interaction). Mutations in POLD3 have been linked to various clinical conditions, including immunodeficiency and cancer susceptibility, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and disease prevention (Mehawej2024POLD3; Dunlop2012Common).

## Structure
The POLD3 protein, encoded by the human POLD3 gene, is an accessory subunit of DNA polymerase delta, which plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair. The primary structure of POLD3 consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and interaction capabilities.

The tertiary structure of POLD3 refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its interaction with other proteins and subunits. In terms of quaternary structure, POLD3 interacts with other subunits of the DNA polymerase delta complex, facilitating its role in DNA synthesis and repair processes.

POLD3 contains specific domains, such as the C-terminal domain, which is crucial for its function. This domain is involved in interactions with other proteins, such as the Rev1 C-terminal domain (Rev1-CT), through a Rev1-interacting region (RIR) motif. This interaction is characterized by specific hydrophobic and polar interactions, with key phenylalanine residues fitting into binding pockets on the Rev1-CT domain (Pustovalova2016Interaction).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity of POLD3, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. Splice variant isoforms of POLD3 can result in different functional forms of the protein, potentially affecting its interaction with other polymerase δ subunits (Reint2021Rapid).

## Function
The POLD3 gene encodes an accessory subunit of the DNA polymerase delta (Polδ) complex, which is crucial for DNA replication and repair in healthy human cells. POLD3 is involved in maintaining genome stability by participating in DNA replication, particularly in lagging strand synthesis, and in DNA repair processes such as homologous recombination and DNA double-strand break repair (Tumini2016Roles). It enhances the processivity of Polδ during translesion synthesis (TLS), a process that allows DNA replication to continue past damaged sites, such as abasic sites, by facilitating the extension of mismatched primer termini (Hirota2015The). POLD3 interacts with PCNA, and its function is enhanced in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Tumini2016Roles).

POLD3 is also implicated in the translesion synthesis pathway, interacting with Pol ζ, which is important for bypassing DNA lesions and participating in various DNA damage response pathways (Tumini2016Roles). Despite its role in TLS, POLD3 does not appear to be critical for other DNA repair pathways, such as excision repair and recombination, in vertebrate cells (Hirota2015The). The presence of POLD3 increases the efficiency of Polδ in extending beyond abasic sites, suggesting that it helps prevent Polδ from dissociating from the mismatched primer terminus, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful DNA synthesis completion (Hirota2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLD3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in DNA replication and repair. A study on a Lebanese family identified a homozygous variant, p.Ile10Thr (c.29T>C), in the POLD3 gene, which was linked to syndromic severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), neurodevelopmental delay, and hearing impairment. This mutation was found to be pathogenic and led to reduced expression of POLD1 and POLD2 proteins, destabilizing the DNA polymerase δ complex and contributing to the clinical symptoms observed in the affected individuals (Mehawej2024POLD3).

POLD3 is also implicated in maintaining genomic stability and telomere integrity. In mouse models, complete loss of Pold3 results in early embryonic lethality, while haploinsufficiency leads to impaired DNA double-strand break repair, telomere shortening, and increased chromosomal abnormalities. These defects highlight the gene's critical role in preventing genomic instability, which can lead to reproductive aging and infertility (Zhou2018Pold3is).

Alterations in POLD3 expression have been linked to cancer susceptibility. Variations near the POLD3 gene have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, suggesting that changes in its expression or function may contribute to cancer development (Dunlop2012Common).

## Interactions
POLD3, a subunit of DNA polymerase delta, participates in several critical interactions that facilitate its role in DNA replication and repair. It interacts with the Rev1 C-terminal domain (Rev1-CT) through a Rev1-interacting region (RIR) motif located in its C-terminal part. This interaction is significant for translesion synthesis (TLS), a DNA damage tolerance process, and is one of the strongest RIR-mediated interactions, with a dissociation constant of 2.3±0.6 µM (Pustovalova2016Interaction). The Rev1-CT/PolD3-RIR complex involves key residues such as F238 and F239 of the PolD3-RIR motif fitting into hydrophobic pockets on the Rev1-CT surface, forming an extensive interface that contributes to the strength of this interaction (Pustovalova2016Interaction).

POLD3 also plays a role in replication fork recovery and break-induced replication (BIR) through its ADP-ribosylation at serine 422. This post-translational modification is crucial for its assembly at stalled or damaged replication forks, a process necessary for maintaining genome stability (Richards2023Regulation). Additionally, POLD3 interacts with proteins involved in DNA repair and replication fork stability, such as RFC4, RFC5, and HMGB1, as part of a Cas9-POLD3 fusion protein used to enhance genome editing (Reint2021Rapid).
