# RFX7

## Overview
RFX7 is a gene that encodes the regulatory factor X7, a transcription factor belonging to the RFX family, which is characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain with a winged-helix structure. Unlike some other members of the RFX family, RFX7 lacks additional domains such as the activation domain, which influences its functional specificity (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization). The RFX7 protein plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including tumor suppression and neuronal development, by regulating gene expression in response to cellular stress and p53 activation (Coronel2021Transcription). It is involved in the p53 signaling pathway, influencing the expression of genes critical for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Schwab2023Multiomics). RFX7's interactions with other proteins, such as ANKRA2, further enhance its regulatory functions, particularly in the context of tumor suppression and cellular signaling pathways (Schwab2024p53). The gene's mutations are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and various cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (Schwab2022Multiomics; Harris2021Disruption).

## Structure
The RFX7 protein is a member of the RFX family of transcription factors, characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) with a winged-helix structure (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization). RFX7 contains only the DNA-binding domain, lacking other domains such as the activation domain (AD) found in some other RFX family members (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization). The protein is involved in various biological processes, including natural killer cell-mediated immunity and neuron development (Gao2020Structural).

The structural basis for the recognition of RFX7 by ankyrin repeat proteins ANKRA2 and RFXANK has been elucidated. These proteins recognize the PXLPXL motif of RFX7 through extensive hydrophobic interactions. The ANKRA2-RFX7 complex reveals that ANKRA2 consists of five ankyrin repeats forming a linear solenoid architecture, with RFX7 making hydrophobic contacts with these repeats. Key interactions include hydrophobic pockets accommodating specific residues of RFX7, such as Met90, Leu93, and Leu96, along with hydrogen bonds between RFX7 and ANKRA2 residues (Gao2020Structural).

RFX7 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its function and interactions (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization).

## Function
RFX7 (regulatory factor X7) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in gene regulation, particularly in the context of tumor suppression and neuronal processes. In healthy human cells, RFX7 is involved in the p53 signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis. It acts as a mediator of p53-dependent gene regulation, influencing the expression of several tumor suppressor genes and genes involved in neuronal development (Schwab2023Multiomics; Coronel2021Transcription).

RFX7 regulates a network of genes, including PDCD4, PIK3IP1, MXD4, and PNRC1, which are upregulated in response to stressors and p53 activation. This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular functions related to tumor suppression and promoting cell differentiation (Coronel2021Transcription). RFX7 also plays a role in inhibiting pro-survival kinases AKT and mTORC1 through its target DDIT4, contributing to its tumor suppressive functions (Schwab2022Multiomics).

In addition to its role in cancer biology, RFX7 is implicated in neuronal processes, including synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, through the regulation of genes like SYNPO (Schwab2022Multiomics). RFX7 is broadly expressed across various tissues, with significant activity in the brain, where it co-regulates brain-specific genes (SugiamanTrapman2018Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RFX7 gene are associated with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Individuals with de novo loss-of-function variants in RFX7 often exhibit language delay, global developmental delay, and various behavioral challenges such as excitability, sensory sensitivity, emotional dysregulation, aggression, and anxiety. Abnormal head size, including microcephaly and macrocephaly, and MRI abnormalities like Dandy-Walker malformation have also been reported in some cases (Harris2020Disruption; Harris2021Disruption).

RFX7 is also implicated in cancer, particularly as a tumor suppressor in lymphoid cancers. It is frequently mutated in Epstein-Barr Virus-negative Burkitt lymphoma and is involved in regulating tumor suppressor genes. RFX7 mutations and dysregulation are linked to poorer prognosis in various cancers, as it plays a role in inhibiting pathways like AKT and mTORC1, which are crucial for tumorigenesis suppression (Coronel2021Transcription; Schwab2022Multiomics).

Alterations in RFX7 expression are associated with metabolic and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and body fat distribution, highlighting its broad impact on human health (Coronel2021Transcription).

## Interactions
RFX7, a transcription factor, engages in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in tumor suppression and cellular signaling pathways. RFX7 is known to bind to the X-box motif in the promoters of target genes, such as PDCD4, where it cooperates with other proteins like ANKRA2, RFX5, RFXAP, and RFXANK. ANKRA2, in particular, acts as a critical cofactor for RFX7, enhancing its regulatory functions in the p53 signaling pathway (Schwab2024p53).

The interaction between RFX7 and ANKRA2 is characterized by the binding of ANKRA2's ankyrin domains to the PXLPXL motif of RFX7, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions. ANKRA2 exhibits a stronger binding affinity to RFX7 compared to RFXANK, which also interacts with RFX7 but does not significantly influence its target gene regulation (Gao2020Structural).

RFX7 is also involved in the regulation of the DDIT4 gene, which is crucial for the inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2-AKT signaling pathways. This regulation is mediated by p53, highlighting RFX7's role in the p53-RFX7 signaling axis (Coronel2021p53mediated).
