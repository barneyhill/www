# NPIPB3

## Overview
Nuclear pore complex interacting protein family member B3 (NPIPB3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport, a critical process for cellular homeostasis and gene expression. The protein, also referred to as a phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase-related kinase, is active in the nuclear envelope and plays a role in RNA splicing, DNA binding, and protein synthesis. NPIPB3 is implicated in immune response modulation, particularly through its interaction with the interferon-alpha promoter and the SARS-CoV ORF6 protein, which affects type I interferon signaling pathways. This interaction suggests a potential role for NPIPB3 in modulating immune defense mechanisms, especially in the context of viral infections (Huang2017Phage). Additionally, NPIPB3 has been identified as one of the downregulated genes in nonischaemic cardiomyopathy, indicating its potential relevance in cardiovascular diseases (Li2020Screening).

## Function
NPIPB3, a member of the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, plays a significant role in nucleocytoplasmic transport, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression. This protein is involved in the transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing various cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. NPIPB3 is active in the nuclear envelope, where it contributes to the regulation of these processes (Huang2017Phage).

In healthy human cells, NPIPB3 functions as an RNA splicing factor and is involved in DNA binding and protein synthesis. It is up-regulated in epithelial cells upon exposure to certain probiotics, linking it to immune response modulation (Huang2017Phage). The protein also interacts with the interferon-alpha promoter, suggesting a role in immune signaling pathways (Huang2017Phage). NPIPB3's interaction with the SARS-CoV ORF6 protein indicates its involvement in modulating type I interferon antagonism, which is a critical aspect of the host's innate immune response (Huang2017Phage). This interaction highlights NPIPB3's potential role in restoring interferon responses, thereby influencing immune defense mechanisms (Huang2017Phage).

## Interactions
NPIPB3, a member of the nuclear pore complex interacting protein family, is known to interact with the SARS-CoV ORF6 protein. This interaction was identified using a phage display technique and confirmed through in vitro co-immunoprecipitation and in vivo co-localization assays. NPIPB3, also known as phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase-related kinase SMG-1 isoform 1 homolog, exhibits the highest binding affinity to the recombinant ORF6 protein. The interaction between NPIPB3 and ORF6 is significant as it modulates the antagonistic activity of ORF6 against Type I interferons (IFNs). Overexpression of the C-terminal domain of NPIPB3 reduces the antagonistic activity of ORF6, suggesting that NPIPB3 may influence the binding interaction between ORF6 and karyopherin alpha 2, a key player in nuclear import. This interaction is crucial because ORF6 inhibits IFNβ-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, affecting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Huang2017Phage).

In the context of nonischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM), NPIPB3 is one of the top downregulated genes identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Li2020Screening).
