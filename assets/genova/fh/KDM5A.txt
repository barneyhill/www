# KDM5A

## Overview
KDM5A is a gene that encodes the protein lysine demethylase 5A, a member of the histone demethylase family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression through its enzymatic activity, which removes methyl groups from histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), a key epigenetic mark associated with active transcription. As a histone demethylase, KDM5A plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, impacting various biological processes such as development, angiogenesis, and cellular differentiation (Liefke2010Histone; Yoo2022Drawing). The protein's structure includes several domains, such as the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is essential for its catalytic function, and the ARID domain, which facilitates DNA binding (Horton2016Characterization; Torres2015Histone). KDM5A's activity and interactions with other protein complexes, such as the Notch-RBP-J repressor complex and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), underscore its multifaceted role in maintaining genomic integrity and regulating gene expression (Liefke2010Histone; Pavlenko2022Functions).

## Structure
KDM5A, also known as lysine demethylase 5A, is a protein characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The protein contains a catalytic Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is responsible for its demethylase activity, and a JmjN domain that supports the structural integrity of the catalytic site (Horton2016Characterization). The JmjC domain features a ferrous binding motif and interacts with cofactors such as α-ketoglutarate, which are essential for its enzymatic function (Horton2016Characterization).

KDM5A also includes a DNA-binding ARID domain and a C5HC2 zinc finger domain, which contribute to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Torres2015Histone). The protein has three plant homeodomain (PHD) reader domains, with the PHD1 domain playing a significant role in recognizing histone modifications and enhancing the catalytic efficiency of demethylation by binding to unmodified H3 peptides (Longbotham2019Histone).

The tertiary structure of KDM5A includes two twisted β-sheets and helices packed on the outer surfaces, with the active site asymmetrically located (Horton2016Characterization). The protein's structure is further stabilized by interactions between the JmjN and JmjC domains, which are critical for its enzymatic activity (Horton2016Characterization).

## Function
KDM5A, also known as lysine demethylase 5A, is a histone demethylase that plays a critical role in regulating gene expression by removing trimethylation marks from histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) at transcription start sites. This activity is essential for maintaining a balance of histone methylation and demethylation, which is crucial for proper gene expression and cellular function (Liefke2010Histone; Yoo2022Drawing). In healthy human cells, KDM5A is involved in various physiological processes, including development and angiogenesis. It interacts with polycomb complex 2 (PRC2) to maintain repressive histone marks, thereby silencing genes involved in angiogenesis, such as VEGF-response genes, acting as a brake to prevent excessive blood vessel growth (Yoo2022Drawing).

KDM5A is also a part of the core Notch-RBP-J repressor complex, where it interacts directly with RBP-J and is involved in the dynamic regulation of histone modifications, critical for the switch-off and switch-on of Notch target genes (Liefke2010Histone). The enzyme is highly expressed in the hematopoietic system, and its deficiency in mice results in a mild hematopoietic phenotype, suggesting some redundancy with other KDM5 family members (Liefke2010Histone). KDM5A's function in healthy cells involves maintaining proper vascular function and ensuring proper development, preventing disease (Yoo2022Drawing).

## Clinical Significance
KDM5A, a histone demethylase, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In ovarian cancer, KDM5A is overexpressed, particularly in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, and is associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to metastasis and drug resistance (Feng2017KDM5A). In prostate cancer, high KDM5A expression correlates with poor prognosis, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while reducing apoptosis. It represses miR-495, which is crucial for its role in cancer progression (Du2020Activation).

In small cell lung cancer (SCLC), KDM5A sustains neuroendocrine differentiation by repressing Notch signaling, which is crucial for tumorigenesis. Its inactivation leads to increased Notch2 expression and a shift towards a non-neuroendocrine phenotype, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Oser2019The). In pancreatic cancer, KDM5A is overexpressed and linked to poor clinical outcomes, including higher tumor grade and drug resistance, indicating its role as an oncogene (Duan2022Expression).

KDM5A is also implicated in developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders and congenital heart diseases, due to its role in histone methylation and gene regulation (Yoo2022Drawing).

## Interactions
KDM5A, a histone demethylase, is involved in various protein interactions that influence gene expression and chromatin dynamics. It is a key component of the Notch-RBP-J repressor complex, where it interacts directly with the RBP-J protein. This interaction is crucial for the repression of Notch target genes by demethylating H3K4 at RBP-J-binding sites, thereby modulating gene expression (Liefke2010Histone).

KDM5A also associates with several histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes, including NuRD, SIN3B, and CoREST. These interactions suggest a role in transcriptional repression through the coordination of H3K4 demethylation and histone deacetylation (Pavlenko2022Functions). KDM5A's interaction with the NuRD complex, particularly through ZMYND8, is important for DNA damage response and repair, highlighting its role in maintaining genome integrity (Gong2017Histone).

Additionally, KDM5A interacts with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), suggesting a coordinated regulation of histone methylation marks, specifically the demethylation of H3K4 and trimethylation of H3K27, which promotes gene silencing (Pavlenko2022Functions). These interactions underscore KDM5A's multifaceted role in chromatin regulation and transcriptional control.
