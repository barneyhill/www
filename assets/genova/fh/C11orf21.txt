# C11orf21

## Overview
C11orf21 is a gene located on chromosome 11p15.5 that encodes a protein known as chromosome 11 open reading frame 21. This protein is primarily expressed in the heart and is also found in the liver, lung, spleen, and testis, with notable absence in the brain, kidney, muscle, colon, stomach, and small intestine (Zhu2000C11orf21). In fetal tissues, its expression is observed in the heart, liver, brain, kidney, and muscle (Zhu2000C11orf21). The protein consists of 132 amino acids and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (Zhu2000C11orf21). Although the specific molecular functions of the C11orf21 protein remain unclear, it is situated in a genomic region rich in imprinted genes but exhibits biallelic expression, indicating non-imprinting in certain tissues (Zhu2000C11orf21). The gene's unique sequence suggests a potentially distinct role in cellular homeostasis and physiological functions, though these roles are not yet fully characterized (Zhu2000C11orf21).

## Function
The C11orf21 gene, located on human chromosome 11p15.5, encodes a protein that is primarily expressed in the heart, with additional expression in the liver, lung, spleen, and testis, but not in the brain, kidney, muscle, colon, stomach, and small intestine (Zhu2000C11orf21). In fetal tissues, its expression is noted in the heart, liver, brain, kidney, and muscle (Zhu2000C11orf21). The protein encoded by C11orf21 consists of 132 amino acids and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, as demonstrated by the expression of a C11orf21-EGFP fusion protein in cultured cells (Zhu2000C11orf21).

Despite its expression pattern, the specific molecular functions and pathways of the C11orf21 protein in healthy human cells remain unclear. The gene is located in a region known for containing many imprinted genes, yet C11orf21 itself exhibits biallelic expression, indicating it is non-imprinted in certain tissues like the fetal liver (Zhu2000C11orf21). The absence of significant homology to other genes suggests that C11orf21 may have a unique function, potentially involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological functions, although these roles are not fully characterized (Zhu2000C11orf21).

## Clinical Significance
C11orf21, located on chromosome 11p15.5, is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or genetic variations. It is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS), a condition characterized by overgrowth and an increased risk of childhood tumors such as Wilms' tumor and hepatoblastoma (Zhu2000C11orf21). The gene is also linked to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), with studies indicating that genetic variations in C11orf21 may influence the risk of developing CLL (Bozack2020LocusSpecific; Georgiadis2017Evolving).

In the context of cancer, C11orf21 has been identified as a prognostic biomarker for clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Hypomethylation of C11orf21 correlates with poor prognosis in ccRCC patients, suggesting that its expression levels may impact disease outcomes (Wang2019Identification). Additionally, C11orf21 has been studied in the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), where hypomethylation in the autistic brain suggests a potential role in the disorder's pathogenesis (Nardone2014DNA).

Despite its involvement in these conditions, no significant association has been found between C11orf21 and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (Ferrante2020No). The gene's clinical significance continues to be an area of active research.
