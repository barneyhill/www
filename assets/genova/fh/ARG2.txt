# ARG2

## Overview
Arginase 2 (ARG2) is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme arginase 2, which is a binuclear manganese metalloenzyme involved in the urea cycle. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea, playing a crucial role in the regulation of nitric oxide production and cellular proliferation (Mortier2017Arginase; Austin2020Structural). Unlike its cytosolic counterpart, arginase 1, arginase 2 is primarily located in the mitochondria, which influences its functional dynamics and interaction with other cellular pathways (Morris1997Human). The enzyme is involved in various physiological processes, including immune regulation and vascular function, and has been implicated in several pathological conditions such as osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, and renal diseases (Choi2019Critical; Yang2014Functions; Huang2016Genetic). Due to its involvement in these processes, ARG2 is considered a potential target for therapeutic interventions in inflammatory and metabolic disorders.

## Structure
The human ARG2 (arginase 2) protein is a binuclear manganese metalloenzyme involved in the hydrolysis of L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. Its primary structure is encoded by the ARG2 gene, and the protein is known to form a homotrimer in its quaternary structure (Mortier2017Arginase; Austin2020Structural). The enzyme's active site involves a mechanism with one hydroxide and two manganese ions, which are crucial for its catalytic function (Mortier2017Arginase).

The secondary structure of ARG2 includes regions that undergo conformational changes upon binding with specific inhibitors, such as the monoclonal antibody C0021158. This binding induces significant conformational changes, particularly in surface-exposed loops and the formation of a short helix at the antibody-enzyme interface (Austin2020Structural). The structural analysis of ARG2 in complex with C0021158 revealed subtle changes within the active site, particularly the inward reorientation of Arg39, which affects substrate binding (Austin2020Structural).

ARG2 is located in the mitochondria, distinguishing it from its paralogue ARG1, which is cytosolic. The enzyme's structure and function are influenced by its localization and the presence of specific domains that facilitate its enzymatic activity (Morris1997Human).

## Function
Arginase 2 (ARG2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a significant role in regulating nitric oxide (NO) production and cellular proliferation. In endothelial cells, ARG2 competes with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for the common substrate L-arginine, thereby modulating NO synthesis. This competition affects the availability of L-arginine, which is crucial for NO production, a key factor in vascular function and endothelial health (Topal2006Mitochondrial; Lim2007Mitochondrial). ARG2 is constitutively expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and influences NO synthesis by controlling L-arginine pools, which are not freely exchangeable with extracellular amino acids (Topal2006Mitochondrial).

In regulatory T cells (Tregs), ARG2 is involved in enhancing metabolic fitness and suppressive capacity. It is highly expressed in Tregs within healthy skin, where it helps regulate inflammation and maintain immune tolerance. ARG2 expression in Tregs is linked to the regulation of mTOR signaling, a critical pathway for cell growth and metabolism, providing Tregs with a selective advantage in tissue environments (Lowe2019Regulatory). The enzyme's activity in Tregs is crucial for their ability to suppress effector T cell proliferation by metabolizing extracellular arginine, thus contributing to their immunosuppressive function (Lowe2019Regulatory).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ARG2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In osteoarthritis (OA), overexpression of ARG2 in chondrocytes leads to increased levels of matrix metalloproteinases MMP3 and MMP13, which are crucial for cartilage destruction, indicating ARG2's role in OA pathogenesis (Choi2019Critical). ARG2 is also involved in vascular aging and atherosclerosis. It promotes vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and apoptosis, contributing to plaque formation and instability in atherosclerosis (Xiong2013Arginase‐II; Yang2014Functions). In macrophages, ARG2 enhances proinflammatory responses through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, contributing to insulin resistance and atherogenesis (Ming2012Arginase).

In the context of renal diseases, ARG2 contributes to oxidative stress and inflammation in diet-induced obesity, leading to renal damage (Huang2016Genetic). ARG2 also plays a role in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, where its deficiency reduces disease severity by modulating neuroinflammation and Th17 cell differentiation (Choudry2018Deficient). These findings suggest that ARG2 is a potential therapeutic target for various inflammatory and metabolic disorders.

## Interactions
ARG2 (arginase 2) interacts with specific monoclonal antibodies that inhibit its function through a novel non-competitive mechanism. The high-affinity monoclonal antibodies C0021158 and C0021181 bind to ARG2, inducing conformational changes that lead to inhibition. These antibodies interact with three distinct regions of ARG2, specifically residues 37-51, 79-86, and 299-308, which partially overlap with regions showing major conformational changes (Austin2020Structural). A key feature of this interaction is a hydrophobic single-turn α-helix (residues 81-85 on ARG2) that fits into a hydrophobic cleft formed by the antibody's variable regions, surrounded by a network of polar interactions (Austin2020Structural).

The binding of C0021158 to ARG2 causes a reorientation of the loop containing Arg39, resulting in the side chain of Arg39 pointing toward the active site. This reorientation forms a strong hydrogen bond with Thr265 and a weak ionic interaction with Glu296, while the guanidinium head group of Arg39 is positioned close to the side chain of His160, allowing for a favorable cation-π stacking interaction. These interactions prevent the substrate from binding in a catalytically competent position (Austin2020Structural). The antibody-induced interaction of Arg39 with His160 precludes its involvement as a proton donor in catalysis, further inhibiting ARG2's function (Austin2020Structural).
