# OR10K2

## Overview
The OR10K2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily K member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The olfactory receptor proteins, including OR10K2, are expressed in the olfactory epithelium and are responsible for initiating the signal transduction pathways that lead to odor perception (Teo2009Genomewide). Recent studies have expanded the functional repertoire of OR10K2, suggesting its involvement in non-olfactory processes such as cell migration and cancer biology, indicating that its expression and activity may extend beyond traditional olfactory tissues (Mazzei2024Functional; Yoshida2024Downregulated).

## Function
The OR10K2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. This process involves the activation of G-proteins, which subsequently trigger a cascade of intracellular events leading to neuronal responses and the eventual perception of odors (Teo2009Genomewide).

Beyond its traditional role in olfaction, OR10K2 has been implicated in other cellular processes. A CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening study identified OR10K2 as a gene that promotes human fibroblast migration, suggesting a potential role in cell migration processes. This indicates that OR10K2 may have functions beyond sensory perception, possibly involving ectopic expression and activity in non-olfactory tissues (Mazzei2024Functional). Additionally, the gene has been found to be upregulated in sarcomatoid components of sarcomatoid hepatocellular carcinoma, hinting at a role in cancer biology (Yoshida2024Downregulated). These findings suggest that OR10K2 may have diverse functions in human physiology beyond its established role in olfaction.
