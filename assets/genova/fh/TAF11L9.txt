# TAF11L9

## Overview
TAF11L9 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 9, which is involved in the regulation of transcription. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, which is essential for the initiation of gene expression. TAF11L9 is part of a larger family of TATA-box binding protein associated factors (TAFs) that interact with the TATA-box binding protein (TBP) to facilitate the transcription of specific genes. The precise function and interactions of TAF11L9 are still under investigation, but it is believed to contribute to the regulation of gene expression through its involvement in the transcription machinery (Qiu2020aarFDC).
