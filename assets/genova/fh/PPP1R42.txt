# PPP1R42

## Overview
PPP1R42 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 42, a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity. This protein plays a significant role in centrosome dynamics, cell cycle regulation, and cilia formation. It is particularly important in the development of sperm flagella, where it localizes near the basal body of elongating spermatids, indicating its role in male fertility (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein; DeVaul2013PPP1R42). PPP1R42 interacts with key cellular components such as NEK2 and Aurora A kinases, influencing processes like centrosome separation and cilia disassembly (DeVaul2013PPP1R42). Its expression and function in various cell types, including ARPE-19 cells, suggest a conserved role in centrosome function and cilia dynamics across different tissues (DeVaul2013PPP1R42).

## Function
PPP1R42 is a regulatory protein that interacts with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and plays a crucial role in centrosome dynamics and cell cycle regulation. It is highly expressed in the testis and is involved in the development of sperm flagella by localizing near the basal body of elongating spermatids (DeVaul2013PPP1R42). In ARPE-19 cells, a human retinal pigmented epithelial cell line, PPP1R42 is associated with the basal body/centrosome, suggesting a conserved role in centrosome function across different cell types (DeVaul2013PPP1R42).

PPP1R42 positively regulates PP1 at the centrosome, which in turn negatively regulates NEK2, a kinase involved in centrosome separation. Knockdown of PPP1R42 results in increased NEK2 activity, leading to centrosome separation and accumulation of cells in the G2 phase, indicating a block in mitosis (DeVaul2013PPP1R42). This suggests that PPP1R42 is crucial for proper centrosome separation and mitotic entry. Additionally, PPP1R42 may stabilize PP1, as its depletion leads to decreased PP1 levels (DeVaul2013PPP1R42).

PPP1R42 also influences cilia formation. Overexpression of PPP1R42 increases the number and length of cilia, while its depletion reduces cilia number and length, resulting in deformed cilia (DeVaul2017A).

## Interactions
PPP1R42, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It binds to PP1, forming a complex that regulates centrosome dynamics and cilia formation. In ARPE-19 cells, PPP1R42 localizes to the basal body/centrosome and interacts with PP1 to modulate the activity of NEK2, a kinase involved in centrosome separation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper centrosome number and function, as depletion of PPP1R42 leads to increased NEK2 activity and centrosome separation (DeVaul2013PPP1R42).

PPP1R42 also interacts with Aurora A kinase, a key player in mitotic progression and cilia disassembly. By enhancing PP1 activity, PPP1R42 indirectly inactivates Aurora A, which is predicted to result in lengthened cilia (DeVaul2013PPP1R42). In spermatids, PPP1R42 is localized to the base of flagella, where it interacts with PP1 to regulate cilia dynamics, affecting both the number and length of cilia (DeVaul2017A).

In the context of male fertility, PPP1R42 is identified as a specific regulatory subunit of the PPP1CC2 isoform, which is highly enriched in testis and sperm, playing a role in spermatid transformation and tail formation (Silva2017Construction; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).
