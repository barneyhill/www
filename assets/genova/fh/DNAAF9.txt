# DNAAF9

## Overview
DNAAF9, or dynein axonemal assembly factor 9, is a gene that encodes a protein crucial for the assembly and function of cilia and flagella. The protein, also known as Shulin, is categorized as a dynein axonemal assembly factor and plays a pivotal role in the preassembly of dynein arms, which are essential for ciliary motility. This process involves the packaging of outer arm dynein complexes in the cytoplasm before their transport to cilia, ensuring proper ciliary function necessary for physiological processes such as mucus clearance in the respiratory tract and sperm motility (Wang2022FBB18). DNAAF9 interacts with various proteins, including ARL3, to regulate the transport and activation of dynein arms, highlighting its significance in maintaining ciliary integrity and function (Issa2024DNAAF9). Mutations in DNAAF9 can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, underscoring its clinical importance in human health (Issa2024DNAAF9).

## Function
DNAAF9, also known as Shulin, is a dynein axonemal assembly factor involved in the preassembly of dynein arms, which are essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. In healthy human cells, DNAAF9 plays a critical role in packaging outer arm dynein complexes in the cytoplasm before they are transported to cilia. This process is crucial for the proper assembly and function of dynein arms, which are necessary for ciliary motility. Ciliary motility is important for various physiological processes, including mucus clearance in the airways and sperm movement (Wang2022FBB18).

DNAAF9 functions in conjunction with other dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs) and chaperone proteins, such as HSP90, which assist in the folding and stabilization of dynein heavy chains. This collaborative network ensures the correct assembly of dynein complexes, which are then targeted to cilia for their functional roles in cellular motility (Wang2022FBB18). The involvement of DNAAF9 in these molecular processes highlights its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and functionality of ciliary and flagellar apparatuses, thereby impacting organismal outcomes related to fluid movement across epithelial surfaces and reproductive health (OcampoOrtega2024Attenuation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the DNAAF9 gene can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetic disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ positioning, and infertility. This condition arises from defects in ciliary motility due to impaired function of the outer dynein arms (ODAs), which are crucial for ciliary movement (Issa2024DNAAF9). Although DNAAF9 variants have not been identified in PCD patient cohorts, its loss could severely impact the function of various cilia sub-types, suggesting its potential role in syndromic ciliopathies (Issa2024DNAAF9).

DNAAF9 interacts with the small GTPase ARL3, which is essential for ciliogenesis and ciliary cargo trafficking. This interaction is crucial for the transport and activation of ODAs, and disruptions in this process might contribute to ciliopathies (Issa2024DNAAF9). The inhibition of ODAs by DNAAF9 is necessary to prevent premature activation and off-target interactions during transport to cilia, and its release, facilitated by ARL3, is required for ODA motor activity inside cilia (Issa2024DNAAF9). Alterations in DNAAF9 expression or its interactions could disrupt this regulatory mechanism, potentially leading to conditions like PCD due to impaired ciliary motility (Issa2024DNAAF9).

## Interactions
DNAAF9, also known as Shulin, is involved in the regulation of ciliary Outer Dynein Arms (ODAs) through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with ARL3, a small GTPase, which is crucial for the transport and activation of ODAs. This interaction is mediated by the binding of ARL3 to the N1 domain of DNAAF9, involving hydrogen bonds and pi-pi stacking interactions. The GTP-loaded state of ARL3 facilitates this binding, while the GDP-loaded state prevents it due to steric clashes (Issa2024DNAAF9).

DNAAF9 also interacts with subunits of the human ODA holocomplex, including DNAH5, DNAH9, DNAI1, and LC3/NME9, and has been shown to co-precipitate with the ODA intermediate chain DNAI2 (Issa2024DNAAF9). It binds ODAs in the cytoplasm, maintaining them in an inhibited state to facilitate their transport across the diffusion barrier at the transition zone. Inside cilia, DNAAF9 must detach from ODAs for their activation, a process potentially triggered by ARL3 (Issa2024DNAAF9).

Proteomics studies have identified 87 common protein interactors of DNAAF9 across different stages of cell differentiation, highlighting its role in ciliary function (Issa2024DNAAF9).
