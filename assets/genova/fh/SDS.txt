# SDS

## Overview
The SDS gene encodes the enzyme serine dehydratase, a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme primarily involved in the catabolism of the amino acid serine. This enzyme is categorized as a lyase, specifically functioning to catalyze the deamination of L-serine to produce pyruvate and ammonia, a critical step in gluconeogenesis and energy production within the liver (Sun2003Crystallization). The serine dehydratase enzyme exists in multiple isoforms, including human serine dehydratase (hSDH) and a novel isoform, cSDH, which differ in their amino acid sequences and catalytic efficiencies (Ogawa2006Enzymatic). The activity of serine dehydratase is regulated by hormonal signals and is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis, particularly under conditions such as high-protein diets and starvation (Ogawa2006Enzymatic).

## Structure
The human serine dehydratase (SDS) enzyme is characterized by its primary structure, which consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The enzyme's secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of SDS involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which includes specific domains such as the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) binding domain. This domain is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity, as PLP acts as a cofactor in the deamination of serine to pyruvate (Ogawa2006Enzymatic).

The SDS enzyme exists in multiple isoforms, including the human serine dehydratase (hSDH) and a novel isoform, cSDH. These isoforms differ in their amino acid sequences, with hSDH showing higher catalytic efficiency compared to cSDH. A notable structural difference is the presence of a conserved Proline residue (Pro128) in hSDH, which is absent in cSDH. This residue is implicated in the binding of PLP and affects the enzyme's kinetic properties (Ogawa2006Enzymatic). The gene organization of these isoforms also varies, with different gene IDs and sequences, indicating the presence of splice variant isoforms (Ogawa2006Enzymatic).

## Function
The SDS gene encodes the enzyme serine dehydratase, which plays a crucial role in the catabolism of the amino acid serine. This enzyme catalyzes the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent deamination of L-serine to produce pyruvate and ammonia, a process essential for gluconeogenesis and energy production in the liver (Sun2003Crystallization). The activity of serine dehydratase is primarily localized in the liver, where it contributes significantly to maintaining glucose homeostasis, especially under conditions such as high-protein diets and starvation (Sun2003Crystallization).

In healthy human cells, serine dehydratase is involved in the conversion of serine to pyruvate, which can then enter the gluconeogenic pathway to generate glucose. This function is vital for energy production, particularly during fasting or when dietary glucose is scarce. The enzyme's activity is regulated by hormonal signals, including glucagon and glucocorticoids, which modulate its expression in response to metabolic needs (Ogawa2006Enzymatic). The structural and kinetic properties of serine dehydratase, including its affinity for substrates and catalytic efficiency, are influenced by specific amino acid residues and the presence of cofactors like PLP (Ogawa2006Enzymatic).
