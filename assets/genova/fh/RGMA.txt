# RGMA

## Overview
RGMA, or repulsive guidance molecule A, is a gene that encodes the protein repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor a, a glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes. This protein functions as a co-receptor in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, particularly enhancing the signaling of BMP-2 and BMP-4, which are crucial for numerous developmental and physiological processes (Babitt2005Repulsive). RGMA is also implicated in axonal guidance and neuronal survival, interacting with the receptor neogenin to mediate growth cone collapse, a critical step in neural development (Conrad2007NeogeninRGMa). Beyond its role in neural and developmental biology, RGMA has clinical significance in conditions such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and cancer, where its expression and function can influence disease progression and severity (Parray2022Increase; Muramatsu2011RGMa; Li2012Repulsive).

## Structure
The RGMA protein is a glycoprotein that is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is added after the removal of a conserved GPI attachment signal at the C-terminus during biosynthesis (Severyn2009Molecular). The primary structure of RGMA includes 434 amino acids in humans, with a high degree of similarity to its mouse and chicken counterparts (Severyn2009Molecular). 

RGMA features several structural motifs and domains. It contains an RGD motif, which is typically involved in integrin binding, located in a loop between two α-helices on the protein's surface (Severyn2009Molecular). The protein also includes a partial von Willebrand factor type D domain, characterized by surface-exposed α-helices and β-strands, and a site for intramolecular proteolytic cleavage between an aspartic acid and proline residue (Severyn2009Molecular). 

The tertiary structure of RGMA is predicted to be a two-lobed configuration with several disulfide bonds, although the exact pattern of these bonds is not experimentally confirmed (Severyn2009Molecular). RGMA is a disulfide-bonded two-chain protein, consisting of an N-terminal fragment and a C-terminal segment, linked to the plasma membrane by its GPI anchor (Severyn2009Molecular). The existence of other isoforms, such as single-chain or soluble forms, is currently unknown (Severyn2009Molecular).

## Function
RGMA (repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor a) functions as a co-receptor for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), specifically BMP-2 and BMP-4, enhancing BMP signaling pathways in healthy human cells. This protein is involved in the classical BMP signaling route through the Smad1/5/8 pathway, leading to increased phosphorylation of these Smad proteins and upregulation of Id1 expression, a downstream target of BMP signaling (Babitt2005Repulsive). RGMA is expressed in various tissues, including the central nervous system, where it is found in ventral horn neurons of the spinal cord, suggesting a role in BMP-mediated processes in these cells (Babitt2005Repulsive).

RGMA also plays a significant role in axonal guidance and neuronal survival. It interacts with the receptor neogenin to mediate growth cone collapse in neurons, a process crucial for axonal pathfinding. This interaction is independent of BMP signaling and involves the activation of the RhoA signaling pathway, which is necessary for the RGMA-induced response (Conrad2007NeogeninRGMa). RGMA's involvement in these molecular processes highlights its importance in neural development and the maintenance of the nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RGMA gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders and conditions. In multiple sclerosis (MS), RGMA is involved in modulating T cell responses and is expressed in chronic and active lesions of progressive MS patients. Its role in immune modulation suggests that RGMA contributes to the pathogenesis of autoimmune conditions like MS by influencing T cell activity and demyelination processes (Muramatsu2011RGMa; Huang2021Elezanumab).

RGMA expression is also linked to stroke severity. Increased RGMA levels have been observed in stroke patients, correlating with larger infarctions and more severe strokes. This suggests that RGMA may inhibit angiogenesis and increase inflammation, contributing to the severity of cerebral ischemia (Parray2022Increase).

In cancer, RGMA acts as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Altered expression of RGMA is associated with cancer progression, including breast cancer, where it is linked to poor prognosis. The mechanisms by which RGMA influences cancer processes, particularly through the Rho/Rho kinase pathway, are not fully understood (Li2012Repulsive).

## Interactions
RGMA, or repulsive guidance molecule BMP co-receptor a, participates in several significant protein interactions that influence its role in cellular signaling. RGMA acts as a co-receptor in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway, specifically binding to BMP-2 and BMP-4, but not to BMP-7 or TGF-β1. This interaction enhances BMP signaling through the Smad1/5/8 pathway, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of these Smad proteins and upregulation of Id1 expression, a downstream target of BMP signaling (Babitt2005Repulsive).

RGMA also interacts with the BMP type I receptor ALK6, forming complexes that increase the binding affinity for BMP-2, thereby enhancing BMP signal transduction (Babitt2005Repulsive). In addition to its role in BMP signaling, RGMA interacts with the transmembrane protein neogenin, which is involved in axonal guidance and neuronal survival. This interaction is crucial for regulating retinal axonal guidance and promoting neuronal survival (Severyn2009Molecular).

RGMA can form a ternary complex with neogenin (NEO1) and netrin-1 (NET1), which inhibits RGMA-induced growth cone collapse and neuron migration. This complex acts as a silencing mechanism, preventing the formation of signaling-compatible RGM-NEO1 complexes (Robinson2021Simultaneous).
