# ZBTB2

## Overview
ZBTB2 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 2 protein, which functions as a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs and a BTB domain, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, respectively. These structural features enable ZBTB2 to play a critical role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the modulation of the p53 pathway, influencing cell cycle regulation and proliferation (Jeon2009ZBTB2). ZBTB2 is implicated in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling and glucose metabolism, and has been associated with oncogenic activity in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Kim2015ZBTB2; Wang2012MicroRNA149).

## Structure
The ZBTB2 protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. The zinc finger motifs facilitate DNA binding, while the BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, allowing ZBTB2 to recruit chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones during the exit from pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (Olivieri2021The; Karemaker2018ZBTB).

The BTB domain of ZBTB2 can form homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with ZBTB25, and is essential for interactions with the NuRD and HiRA complexes. This domain is extended by a linker region, forming an 'extended BTB domain' that is crucial for binding to UBN2 and GATAD2B (Olivieri2021The). The first 44 amino acids of this linker are necessary for these interactions, suggesting a unique structural extension of the BTB domain in ZBTB2 (Olivieri2021The).

ZBTB2 also interacts with the Ep400 complex, which incorporates H2A.Z/H3.3 histones into chromatin, indicating its role in chromatin dynamics (Olivieri2021The). The protein's interaction with unmethylated CpG island promoters highlights its sensitivity to DNA methylation, which influences its binding dynamics (Karemaker2018ZBTB).

## Function
ZBTB2 is a transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of the p53 pathway, playing a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In healthy human cells, ZBTB2 represses the transcription of key genes in the p53 pathway, including ARF, p53, and p21, while activating the transcription of HDM2. This regulation results in decreased p53 activity or stability, as ZBTB2 inhibits p53 activity or stability (Jeon2009ZBTB2). ZBTB2 binds to the proximal promoter of the p21 gene, competing with transcription factors like Sp1 and p53, and recruits co-repressor-HDAC complexes that deacetylate histones, further inhibiting transcription (Jeon2009ZBTB2).

ZBTB2's activity results in increased cell proliferation by modulating the expression of genes involved in the p53 pathway, particularly by repressing the cell cycle arrest gene p21 (Jeon2009ZBTB2). It also influences glucose metabolism by modulating the expression of PDK4 and RelA/p65, contributing to a shift in glucose metabolic pathways that favor glycolysis over the TCA cycle, a pattern observed in highly proliferative cells (Kim2015ZBTB2). ZBTB2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences cellular processes and development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZBTB2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, ZBTB2 is targeted by microRNA-149, which suppresses cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by downregulating ZBTB2 expression. This interaction highlights ZBTB2's role as an oncogene in gastric cancer, where its overexpression is associated with increased tumor growth (Wang2012MicroRNA149). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, ZBTB2 is targeted by miR-488-3p, which induces apoptosis and reduces cell proliferation. The downregulation of miR-488-3p in these cancers correlates with poor prognosis, suggesting that ZBTB2 overexpression contributes to tumor progression (Yang2019MicroRNA‐488‐3p).

In glioblastoma, ZBTB2 is highly expressed and is thought to reprogram metabolic pathways to favor rapid cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer cells. This is achieved through the repression of the RelA/p65 gene, leading to increased PDK4 expression and a shift towards glycolysis (Kim2015ZBTB2). ZBTB2's involvement in these pathways underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
ZBTB2 is a transcriptional regulator that participates in various protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, playing a significant role in the regulation of gene expression. It acts as a transcriptional repressor in the p53 pathway by interacting with the p21 gene. ZBTB2 competes with p53 for binding to the distal p53 binding elements on the p21 promoter, thereby inhibiting p53-mediated transcriptional activation (Jeon2009ZBTB2). It also interacts directly with p53, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays, suggesting that ZBTB2 can inhibit p53 binding through protein-protein interactions (Jeon2009ZBTB2).

ZBTB2 also interacts with Sp1, a transcription factor, competing for binding to the GC-box on the p21 promoter. This competition inhibits Sp1's transcriptional activation, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and ChIP assays (Jeon2009ZBTB2). The POZ domain of ZBTB2 is crucial for its role in transcriptional repression, as it interacts with corepressors like SMRT, NCoR, and BCoR, recruiting HDAC complexes to deacetylate histones and repress transcription (Jeon2009ZBTB2).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, ZBTB2 recruits chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones, such as the NuRD complex and the HiRA complex, during the exit from pluripotency. It interacts with the Ep400 complex, forming distinct functional modules that regulate chromatin dynamics and gene expression (Olivieri2021The).
