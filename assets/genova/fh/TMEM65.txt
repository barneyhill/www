# TMEM65

## Overview
TMEM65 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 65, a highly conserved Type II transmembrane protein. This protein is characterized by its multipass membrane structure and is predominantly expressed in cardiac tissue, particularly in ventricular cardiomyocytes. TMEM65 plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. It interacts with key proteins such as connexin 43 (Cx43) at the intercalated disc, which is essential for maintaining gap junction function and cardiac electrical conduction (Sharma2015Evolutionarily; Garbincius2023TMEM65). Additionally, TMEM65 is involved in regulating mitochondrial calcium efflux through its interaction with the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCLX, thereby supporting mitochondrial function and preventing calcium overload (Garbincius2023TMEM65). The gene's significance extends to clinical implications, where mutations in TMEM65 are linked to mitochondrial myopathy and cardiac dysfunction, underscoring its vital role in cellular energy metabolism and cardiac health (Garbincius2023TMEM65; Nazli2017A).

## Structure
TMEM65 is a highly conserved Type II transmembrane protein with significant homology across species, including 92% similarity between mouse and human orthologues (Sharma2015Evolutionarily). It is characterized by a multipass membrane structure, featuring three transmembrane helices. The protein has a cytoplasmic N-terminus and an extracellular C-terminus (Sharma2015Evolutionarily). A notable feature of TMEM65 is the conserved glycine zipper motif (GxxxGxxxG) located in the third predicted transmembrane region, which is crucial for promoting homo-oligomerization and forming a stable dimer unique to cardiac tissue (Sharma2015Evolutionarily).

TMEM65 contains a conserved DUF2453 domain, suggesting an essential, evolutionarily conserved role, although the specific function of this domain remains unknown (Sharma2015Evolutionarily). The protein is predominantly expressed in ventricular tissue and is localized to the intercalated disc of the plasma membrane in cardiac tissue (Sharma2015Evolutionarily). TMEM65 interacts with connexin 43 (Cx43), a key protein in cardiac gap junctions, indicating its role in cardiac conduction (Sharma2015Evolutionarily). The protein's expression increases during cardiac development, suggesting its potential as a marker for cardiomyocyte maturation (Sharma2015Evolutionarily).

## Function
TMEM65 is a conserved protein located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux, primarily through its interaction with the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCLX. TMEM65 enhances NCLX activity, facilitating Na+-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing calcium overload (Garbincius2023TMEM65). This regulation is particularly important in energetically demanding tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle, where it helps maintain mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and supports normal muscle and cardiac function (Garbincius2023TMEM65).

TMEM65 is also involved in cardiac biology, where it is expressed in ventricular cardiomyocytes and interacts with connexin 43 (Cx43) at the intercalated disc. This interaction is vital for the localization and stability of Cx43, which is crucial for gap junction function and cardiac conduction. Disruption of TMEM65 expression can lead to altered cellular coupling and cardiac arrhythmias (Sharma2015Evolutionarily). Overall, TMEM65 plays a protective role in maintaining mitochondrial and cardiac function by regulating calcium homeostasis and supporting cellular energy metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TMEM65 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting mitochondrial function and cardiac health. TMEM65 is implicated in mitochondrial myopathy, characterized by muscle weakness and severe neurological manifestations. Patients with TMEM65 mutations may experience developmental regression, seizures, microcephaly, and global developmental delay. These mutations lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial DNA copy number and deficiencies in respiratory chain enzyme activities (Nazli2017A).

In the context of cardiac health, TMEM65 plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Loss of TMEM65 function can result in mitochondrial calcium overload, contributing to cell death and organ dysfunction. This is particularly significant in excitable tissues such as the heart, where TMEM65 deficiency can impair cardiac function and lead to conditions like ischemic heart failure (Garbincius2023TMEM65).

TMEM65 is also involved in the regulation of mitochondrial calcium efflux through its interaction with the mitochondrial sodium-calcium exchanger, NCLX. Disruption of this interaction can lead to excessive mitochondrial permeability transition, further exacerbating cardiac and neuromuscular dysfunction (Garbincius2023TMEM65). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TMEM65 in both mitochondrial and cardiac pathologies.

## Interactions
TMEM65 is known to participate in several critical protein interactions that influence cardiac function and mitochondrial calcium regulation. In cardiac tissue, TMEM65 interacts with connexin 43 (Cx43), a major gap junction protein, playing a crucial role in maintaining cardiac conduction. The absence of TMEM65 leads to the internalization and degradation of Cx43, impairing gap junction communication and reducing electrical conduction velocity in cardiomyocytes (Sharma2015Evolutionarily).

TMEM65 also interacts with the sodium channel β1 subunit (β1) at the intercalated discs (ICDs) in mouse hearts. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of voltage-gated sodium channel 1.5 (NaV1.5) and Cx43 to the ICDs. Silencing TMEM65 results in a reduction of NaV1.5 and β1 at the ICDs, leading to structural defects and impaired cardiac conduction (Teng2022Tmem65).

In the context of mitochondrial function, TMEM65 interacts with the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCLX. This interaction enhances sodium-dependent mitochondrial calcium efflux, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and preventing calcium overload (Garbincius2023TMEM65).
