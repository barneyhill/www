# NTMT2

## Overview
NTMT2 is a gene that encodes the protein N-terminal Xaa-Pro-Lys N-methyltransferase 2, which is a member of the methyltransferase enzyme family. This enzyme is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through N-terminal methylation, a process critical for regulating protein interactions, stability, and localization. NTMT2 primarily acts as a mono-methyltransferase but has the capacity to di- and tri-methylate specific peptides under certain conditions. The protein is characterized by a SAM-dependent class I methyltransferase structure, featuring a central seven-stranded β sheet and flanking α-helices, which are essential for its function and substrate recognition (Dong2018An). NTMT2 is expressed predominantly in muscle tissues, indicating its specialized biological roles distinct from its homologue NTMT1 (Dong2018An). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the methylation of proteins involved in DNA repair and cellular homeostasis, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular integrity (Dong2018An).

## Structure
NTMT2 is a SAM-dependent class I methyltransferase characterized by a central seven-stranded β sheet flanked by α-helices, forming its core structure. It includes two auxiliary regions: an N-terminal α-lid and a β-lid, which cover the core domain and contribute to substrate recognition (Dong2018An). The enzyme's structure also features an Ω loop that guards the substrate-binding pocket, providing a more restricted access compared to its homologue NTMT1 (Dong2018An).

The NTMT2 protein has a conserved DxGxGxGR motif involved in binding the co-factors SAH/SAM, which are nearly superimposable in the NTMT2-SAM and NTMT2-SAH-SPKRIA complexes (Dong2018An). The N89 residue acts as a gatekeeper for substrate entry, influencing substrate binding and product specificity. A mutation at this site, N89G, results in enhanced enzymatic activity and altered product specificity (Dong2018An).

NTMT2 primarily functions as a mono-methyltransferase but can also di- and tri-methylate certain peptides under specific conditions (Dong2018An). The enzyme's expression is notably strong in muscle tissues, suggesting distinct biological roles compared to NTMT1 (Dong2018An).

## Function
NTMT2, or N-terminal Xaa-Pro-Lys N-methyltransferase 2, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through N-terminal methylation. This modification is significant for various cellular processes, including protein interactions, stability, and localization. NTMT2 primarily functions as a mono-methyltransferase but can also di- and tri-methylate certain peptides, particularly those with a G-P-K/R consensus sequence at the N-terminus (Dong2018An).

The enzyme is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and function. NTMT2's activity is essential for the methylation of proteins involved in DNA repair, cell growth, and stress response. For instance, the methylation of proteins like RCC1 and DDB2 is crucial for their roles in DNA binding and repair mechanisms (Dong2018An). The absence of such methylation can lead to defects in spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair, underscoring the enzyme's importance in maintaining cellular integrity (Dong2018An).

NTMT2's enzymatic activity and substrate specificity are influenced by structural features such as the N89 residue, which acts as a gatekeeper for substrate binding, affecting the enzyme's catalytic activity and product specificity (Dong2018An).
