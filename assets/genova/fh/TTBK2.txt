# TTBK2

## Overview
Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is involved in various cellular processes, most notably in ciliogenesis, the assembly of cilia. The TTBK2 protein is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues, with particularly high expression levels in the brain regions such as the cerebellum and hippocampus. As a kinase, TTBK2 plays a pivotal role in phosphorylating proteins that are essential for the initiation and extension of cilia, including CEP164 and CEP83, thereby facilitating microtubule dynamics and cellular signaling pathways (Bernatik2020Phosphorylation; Potjewyd2022Modulation). Mutations in the TTBK2 gene are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia and cerebellar degeneration, underscoring the gene's significance in maintaining neuronal and cellular function (Houlden2007Mutations; Bowie2018Spinocerebellar).

## Structure
Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in phosphorylating tau and tubulin proteins. The primary structure of TTBK2 includes a kinase domain spanning residues 1-300, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Ahamad2021A). This kinase domain is characterized by a bilobal fold, a common feature in protein kinases, with an open and extended activation loop (Marcotte2020The). The phosphate-binding groove, formed by a cluster of arginine residues and Lys58, is conserved and involved in substrate recognition (Marcotte2020The).

TTBK2 shares structural similarities with the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family, particularly in its phosphate-priming site, which is adapted to recognize +2 phosphotyrosine residues (Bouskila2011TTBK2). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets typical of kinases, although specific details are not fully described in the context provided.

TTBK2 has several isoforms due to alternative splicing, with TTBK1 being a closely related isoform primarily found in the brain, while TTBK2 is ubiquitously distributed across various tissues (Marcotte2020The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence its activity and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context.

## Function
Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia assembly. It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher expression in the cerebellum, hippocampus, midbrain, and substantia nigra (Potjewyd2022Modulation). TTBK2 is essential for the recruitment of centriolar and distal end proteins necessary for cilia assembly, such as CEP164, CEP83, and CEP89, which are crucial for early ciliogenesis steps like ciliary vesicle docking and CP110 removal from the mother centriole (Čajánek2014Cep164; Potjewyd2022Modulation). 

TTBK2 phosphorylates several proteins involved in ciliogenesis, including CEP83, CEP89, and Rabin8, facilitating microtubule growth and axonemal extension (Bernatik2020Phosphorylation). Its kinase activity is non-redundant, meaning no other kinase can compensate for its function in ciliogenesis (Bernatik2020Phosphorylation). TTBK2's role extends beyond ciliogenesis, as it is involved in mitosis, microtubule dynamics, and neurotransmission, impacting cellular signaling and homeostasis (Potjewyd2022Modulation). Mutations in TTBK2 are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 11, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Bernatik2020Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TTBK2 gene are clinically significant as they are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11), a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder. SCA11 is characterized by progressive ataxia and cerebellar atrophy, primarily due to the degeneration of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum (Houlden2007Mutations; Bowie2018Spinocerebellar). These mutations often result in truncated TTBK2 proteins that interfere with normal protein function, particularly affecting ciliogenesis and cilium stability. This disruption leads to reduced cilia number and impaired Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of SCA11 (Bowie2018Spinocerebellar; MuñozEstrada2023TTBK2mutations).

The mutations also impact peroxisome dynamics, further affecting cellular processes such as cholesterol distribution, which is crucial for ciliary membrane composition and SHH signaling (MuñozEstrada2023TTBK2mutations). The TTBK2 mutations act as dominant negative alleles, where the truncated protein interferes with the function of the full-length protein, exacerbating the disease phenotype (Bowie2018Spinocerebellar). These findings underscore the importance of TTBK2 in maintaining neuronal function and highlight its role in the development of neurodegenerative conditions like SCA11 (Bouskila2011TTBK2).

## Interactions
TTBK2 (tau tubulin kinase 2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. TTBK2 phosphorylates multiple proteins involved in ciliogenesis, including CEP83, CEP89, Rabin8, CCDC92, and DVL3, which are implicated in cilia initiation (Bernatik2020Phosphorylation). It also interacts with CEP164, a major target of TTBK2 phosphorylation, which is essential for the transition from cilia initiation to extension (Bernatik2020Phosphorylation). The interaction between TTBK2 and CEP164 is significant in ciliopathies, with mutations in CEP164 affecting its binding with TTBK2 and subsequent cilia formation (Rosa2022Molecular).

TTBK2 also plays a role in regulating microtubule dynamics through its interaction with KIF2A. TTBK2 phosphorylates KIF2A, inhibiting its microtubule-depolymerizing activity, which is crucial for cell migration (Watanabe2015TTBK2). This interaction is dependent on end-binding proteins EB1 and EB3, which modulate TTBK2's activity by disrupting its autoinhibitory conformation, allowing it to phosphorylate KIF2A at microtubule plus ends (Watanabe2015TTBK2). These interactions highlight TTBK2's role in maintaining proper microtubule dynamics and its involvement in cellular migration processes (Watanabe2015TTBK2).
