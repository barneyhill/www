# RPRD1B

## Overview
RPRD1B, or regulation of nuclear pre-mRNA domain containing 1B, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of transcription and cell cycle progression. The protein, also known as CREPT, is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates dimerization and interaction with other proteins, such as RNA polymerase II and phosphorylated STAT3, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation (Zhai2021CREPT/RPRD1B; Ni2014RPRD1A). RPRD1B is implicated in the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, influencing transcription initiation and elongation (Ni2014RPRD1A). Additionally, it is associated with cell proliferation and has been linked to carcinogenesis, particularly in gastric cancer, where its overexpression correlates with increased tumor invasion and metastasis (Jia2022Long; Winczura2021RPRD). The protein's interactions and regulatory functions underscore its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
The RPRD1B protein, also known as CREPT, is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which plays a crucial role in its dimerization and oligomerization. This domain facilitates the formation of homo- and heterodimers with RPRD1A, enhancing its functional interactions (Ni2014RPRD1A). The coiled-coil domain of RPRD1B forms a homodimer with a head-to-tail association, where two major helices, α1 and α2, are extensively intertwined. The N-terminal regions of the α1 helices contact each other in an anti-parallel mode, packing against the central region of the α2 helices (Ni2014RPRD1A).

RPRD1B contains C-terminal domain-interacting domains (CIDs) that are involved in binding to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II. These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in transcription regulation (Ni2014RPRD1A). The protein is also known to interact with phosphorylated STAT3 through its RPR domain, which is essential for its function in enhancing STAT3-driven gene transcription (Zhai2021CREPT/RPRD1B).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are significant for RPRD1B's function. For instance, phosphorylation by Aurora B at serine 145 is critical for its role in regulating Cyclin B1 expression during the G2/M transition in gastric cancer (Ding2018CREPTRPRD1B).

## Function
The RPRD1B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) activity in human cells. RPRD1B is involved in the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII, specifically at the serine 5 position, which is a critical step in the transcription cycle. This dephosphorylation is facilitated by the recruitment of the phosphatase RPAP2, with RPRD1B acting as a scaffold to organize the CTD into a conformation suitable for dephosphorylation (Ni2014RPRD1A).

RPRD1B also interacts with other proteins, such as HDAC1, to regulate the acetylation and phosphorylation states of RNAPII, thereby influencing transcription initiation and elongation. This interaction is part of an autoregulatory mechanism that maintains the balance of phosphorylation and acetylation marks on RNAPII, which is essential for proper gene expression (Ali2018Crosstalk).

In addition to its role in transcription regulation, RPRD1B is linked to cell proliferation and has been associated with carcinogenesis. It acts as a negative regulator of transcription, particularly affecting non-coding RNA levels, and its overexpression is often observed in cancer, suggesting a role in faster cell proliferation (Winczura2021RPRD).

## Clinical Significance
RPRD1B is implicated in the progression of various cancers, particularly gastric cancer. Overexpression of RPRD1B in gastric cancer is associated with increased tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and poorer prognosis. This overexpression is linked to the activation of the c-Jun/c-Fos/SREBP1 axis, which enhances fatty acid metabolism and promotes metastatic behavior in gastric cancer cells (Jia2022Long). The stability and expression of RPRD1B are regulated by the long non-coding RNA NEAT1, which increases RPRD1B mRNA stability and reduces its degradation, further contributing to cancer progression (Jia2022Long).

In addition to gastric cancer, RPRD1B is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly the G2/M transition, by upregulating Cyclin B1 expression. This regulation is crucial for tumorigenesis, as RPRD1B overexpression promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth (Ding2018CREPTRPRD1B). Furthermore, miR-139-5p has been identified as a negative regulator of RPRD1B, inhibiting gastric cancer cell proliferation by targeting RPRD1B expression (Wenquan2020MiR1395p). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RPRD1B in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RPRD1B interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It forms complexes with RPRD1A and RPRD2, which are involved in the dephosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). This interaction is crucial for the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (Ni2011Control; Ni2014RPRD1A). RPRD1B can form homo- and heterodimers with RPRD1A through coiled-coil domains, creating a scaffold for interaction with CTD repeats (Ni2014RPRD1A).

RPRD1B also interacts with Aurora B kinase, particularly in the context of regulating Cyclin B1 expression during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in gastric cancer. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of RPRD1B at Ser145, which is essential for its function in promoting Cyclin B1 transcription (Ding2018CREPTRPRD1B).

Additionally, RPRD1B interacts with phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and p300, a histone acetyltransferase, enhancing STAT3-driven gene transcription. This interaction is crucial for promoting tumorigenesis through the recruitment of p300 to STAT3-targeted gene promoters (Zhai2021CREPT/RPRD1B). These interactions highlight RPRD1B's role in transcriptional regulation and its potential involvement in cancer progression.
