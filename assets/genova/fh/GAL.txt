# GAL

## Overview
The GAL gene is responsible for encoding a pre-prohormone that is subsequently processed into the neuropeptide galanin and the galanin message-associated peptide (GMAP). Galanin is a neuropeptide that plays a significant role in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it functions primarily by modulating neurotransmitter release and regulating hormone secretion. It is categorized as a neuropeptide due to its involvement in various physiological processes, including mood regulation, cognitive functions, feeding behavior, and pain perception. The GAL gene's expression is highly adaptable, influenced by numerous factors, which suggests complex regulatory mechanisms at both transcriptional and post-translational levels (Webling2012Galanin; Marcos2021Neuropeptidergic). The structural characteristics of galanin, such as its conserved N-terminal α-helical conformation, are crucial for its biological activity, allowing it to interact effectively with G-protein-coupled receptors (Gopalakrishnan2020An).

## Structure
The human GAL gene encodes a pre-prohormone that is processed into the neuropeptide galanin and galanin message-associated peptide (GMAP). The primary structure of galanin in humans consists of 30 amino acids, with the N-terminal fifteen residues being conserved across various mammalian species (Webling2012Galanin; Marcos2021Neuropeptidergic). The C-terminal region of galanin in humans is unique due to the presence of a nonamidated serine, distinguishing it from other mammals (Gopalakrishnan2020An).

In terms of secondary structure, galanin adopts an α-helical conformation at the N-terminus, which is crucial for its biological activity. This structure is maintained in a membrane-mimicking environment, where the peptide assumes a horseshoe-like shape (Webling2012Galanin). The tertiary structure of galanin is not detailed in the provided context, nor is there information on quaternary structure or specific domains.

Post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms are not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, the GAL gene's expression is highly plastic and influenced by various factors, suggesting potential regulatory mechanisms at the post-translational level (Webling2012Galanin).

## Function
The GAL gene encodes the galanin and GMAP prepropeptide, which is processed into the neuropeptide galanin. Galanin plays a crucial role in various physiological processes by modulating neurotransmitter release and regulating hormone secretion. It is primarily active in the central and peripheral nervous systems, where it binds to specific G-protein-coupled receptors to exert its effects. This interaction influences several biological functions, including feeding behavior and pain perception. In the central nervous system, galanin is involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission, impacting processes such as mood regulation and cognitive functions. In the peripheral nervous system, it contributes to the regulation of gastrointestinal motility and insulin release. The diverse roles of galanin highlight its importance in maintaining homeostasis and responding to physiological changes. Its ability to influence neurotransmitter systems and hormonal pathways underscores its potential impact on both neural and endocrine functions.
