# FCGR2C

## Overview
The FCGR2C gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIc (FcγRIIc), a transmembrane receptor that plays a significant role in the immune system by binding to the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. This receptor is primarily expressed on various immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and B lymphocytes, where it facilitates immune responses such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (van2012Phenotypic; Metes1998Expression). The gene's expression and function are influenced by genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs), which can affect the receptor's role in modulating immune responses and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases (Nagelkerke2019Genetic). Notably, the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) allele is necessary for the expression of a functional receptor, while a stop codon allele results in a pseudogene (Metes1998Expression; Breunis2008Copy).

## Structure
The FCGR2C gene encodes a protein that is part of the Fc gamma receptor family, which is involved in binding to the Fc region of IgG antibodies. The primary structure of the protein consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function. In terms of secondary structure, the protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation. The tertiary structure of the FCGR2C protein results in a three-dimensional shape that is crucial for its interaction with IgG antibodies. The quaternary structure involves the assembly of multiple subunits, which may be necessary for its full biological activity.

The protein encoded by FCGR2C may contain immunoglobulin-like domains, which are important for its role in immune response. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation can occur, potentially affecting the protein's stability, localization, and function. Splice variant isoforms of FCGR2C can lead to different functional forms of the protein, which may have distinct roles in immune processes. These structural features and modifications are essential for the protein's ability to mediate immune responses through its interaction with IgG antibodies.

## Function
The FCGR2C gene encodes the Fc gamma receptor IIc (FcγRIIc), which is involved in immune cell function by binding to the Fc region of immunoglobulin G (IgG). This receptor is primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and B lymphocytes, where it plays a crucial role in mediating immune responses such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (van2012Phenotypic; Metes1998Expression). 

FcγRIIc functions as an activating receptor, capable of inducing the killing of target cells when crosslinked with IgG-opsonized pathogens. This activation leads to a rise in intracellular calcium concentration, which is essential for the cytotoxic activity of NK cells (van2012Phenotypic; Nagelkerke2019Genetic). The receptor's expression and function are contingent upon the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) allele, as opposed to a stop codon allele, which results in a pseudogene (Metes1998Expression; Breunis2008Copy).

The expression of FcγRIIc is subject to genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs), which can influence receptor levels and, consequently, the balance between activating and inhibitory signals in immune cells. This balance is critical for modulating inflammation and immune responses, potentially affecting susceptibility to autoimmune diseases (van2012Phenotypic; Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
The FCGR2C gene, encoding the Fc gamma receptor IIc, is implicated in various diseases due to its genetic variability, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs). Variants in FCGR2C have been associated with autoimmune diseases such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and Kawasaki disease (KD). The classic FCGR2C-ORF variant is linked to susceptibility to ITP and KD, with a positive response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in these conditions (Nagelkerke2019Genetic).

In the context of HIV, the FCGR2C c.134-96C>T variant has been associated with a reduced risk of HIV-1 infection in the Thai RV144 vaccine trial but an increased risk of disease progression in black South Africans. This variant also correlates with increased odds of perinatal HIV-1 acquisition in South African children (Ebonwu2021An).

The FCGR2C gene is also linked to autoimmune blistering diseases like bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigus vulgaris/foliaceus (PV/PF). Variations in FCGR2C, such as the FCGR2C.ORF allele, are associated with increased risk and altered immune responses in these conditions (Recke2015Allelic).
