# EOMES

## Overview
EOMES, or eomesodermin, is a gene that encodes the T-box transcription factor eomesodermin, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune cell differentiation and function. This transcription factor is particularly significant in the development and activity of CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, where it orchestrates the expression of genes essential for cytotoxic functions and immune responses. Eomesodermin is involved in the regulation of cytokine production, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and is crucial for the cytolytic activity of these immune cells. It works in conjunction with other transcription factors, such as T-bet, to promote the differentiation of effector T cells and maintain NK cell identity. The gene's expression and function are also implicated in various clinical conditions, including autoimmune diseases and cancers, where it influences disease progression and immune system dysregulation (Wong2023TBET; Pearce2003Control; Gruarin2018Eomesodermin).

## Function
EOMES (eomesodermin) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the differentiation and function of various immune cells, particularly in T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. In CD8+ T cells, EOMES is essential for the induction of effector functions, including the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), perforin, and granzymes, which are crucial for cytolytic activity (Pearce2003Control). EOMES complements the function of T-bet, another transcription factor, in promoting the differentiation of CD8+ T cells into effector cells capable of mounting effective immune responses (Pearce2003Control).

In NK cells, EOMES is vital for maintaining their identity and function. It regulates genes involved in NK cell cytotoxicity, proliferation, and migration, ensuring their role in antitumor immunity (Wong2023TBET). EOMES also influences the expression of chemokine receptors and cytokines, contributing to the regulatory function of Tr1-like cells, a subset of regulatory T cells that co-produce IL-10 and IFN-γ (Gruarin2018Eomesodermin). Through these roles, EOMES is integral to the immune system's ability to respond to infections and maintain immune homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EOMES gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving immune system dysfunction. In multiple sclerosis (MS), EOMES-expressing CD4+ T cells are associated with chronic neuroinflammation and are implicated in the pathogenesis of secondary progressive MS (SPMS). These cells exhibit cytotoxic properties and contribute to neuronal damage, suggesting that targeting EOMES+ CD4+ T cells could offer new therapeutic strategies for SPMS (Raveney2015Eomesoderminexpressing).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), EOMES is not expressed in the leukemia cells themselves but is crucial in CD8+ T cells, where it regulates immune responses. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) affecting EOMES is associated with an increased risk of developing CLL, potentially due to impaired CD8+ T-cell-mediated immune control. EOMES expression is higher in CD8+ T cells of CLL patients, contributing to T-cell exhaustion and dysfunction, which may facilitate leukemia progression (LlaóCid2021EOMES).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Eomes+ T-bet low CD8+ T cells are functionally impaired and associated with poor clinical outcomes. These cells show reduced cytokine production and cytotoxic capacity, and their presence correlates with poor treatment response and overall survival, indicating their potential as predictive biomarkers (Jia2019Eomes+Tbetlow).

## Interactions
EOMES (eomesodermin) is a T-box transcription factor that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in immune cell differentiation and function. EOMES interacts with RUNX3 and BRG1 to promote the formation of innate memory CD8+ T cells through epigenetic reprogramming. This interaction is essential for recruiting BRG1, a chromatin remodeling factor, to RUNX3-bound enhancers, facilitating epigenetic changes necessary for memory cell traits (Istaces2019EOMES).

EOMES also forms part of chromatin-associated complexes, including components of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, which modulate chromatin accessibility and histone modifications at specific loci. These interactions are crucial for the transcriptional activity and differentiation of CD8SP thymocytes towards a memory phenotype (Istaces2019EOMES).

In mouse lymphoma BW5147 cells, EOMES enhances the binding of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) subunit RelA and nuclear factor of activated T cells c2 (NFATc2) to the Ifng promoter and conserved noncoding sequences, promoting the transcriptional regulation of the Ifng gene. This interaction is modulated by pharmacological inhibitors, highlighting EOMES's role in cytokine production (Harada2020Eomesodermin).
