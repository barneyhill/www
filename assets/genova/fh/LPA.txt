# LPA

## Overview
The LPA gene encodes apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], a glycoprotein that is a critical component of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a lipoprotein particle implicated in cardiovascular health. Apo(a) is characterized by its unique structure, which includes multiple kringle IV (KIV) repeats, a kringle V domain, and a protease-like domain. These structural features contribute to the protein's polymorphic nature and influence its function and stability (Kronenberg2016Human; Ward2019Molecular). The LPA gene exhibits significant genetic variability, particularly in the number of KIV repeats, which affects the size and plasma concentration of Lp(a) particles. Elevated levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke, making the LPA gene a significant focus of genetic and clinical research (Langsted2021Genetics; Li2021A).

## Structure
The LPA gene encodes the apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], a key component of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. The primary structure of apo(a) includes a series of kringle IV (KIV) repeats, a kringle V domain, and a protease-like domain. The KIV domain is particularly notable for its expansion into ten different types, with KIV2 existing in multiple copies ranging from 2 to over 40 repeats, contributing to the protein's polymorphic nature (Kronenberg2016Human; Ward2019Molecular). Each KIV2 repeat is approximately 5.6 kilobases in size, resulting in significant copy number variation (Kronenberg2016Human).

The secondary and tertiary structures of apo(a) are characterized by these kringle domains, which are looped structures stabilized by disulfide bonds (Jawi2020Lipoprotein(a) page 0 of 13). The quaternary structure involves the covalent linkage of apo(a) to apolipoprotein B-100 (apo-B100) of the LDL particle via a disulfide bond, forming the Lp(a) particle (Jawi2020Lipoprotein(a) page 0 of 13; Maranhão2014Lipoprotein page 0 of 5).

Apo(a) is highly glycosylated, a common post-translational modification that affects its function and stability (Jawi2020Lipoprotein(a) page 0 of 13). The variability in the number of KIV repeats leads to different isoforms of apo(a), influencing the molecular weight and plasma concentration of Lp(a) (Maranhão2014Lipoprotein; Ward2019Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and genetic variations in the LPA gene are clinically significant due to their impact on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels, which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Elevated Lp(a) levels, influenced by LPA gene variants, are linked to coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic stroke, and aortic valve stenosis (Langsted2021Genetics; Li2021A). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs10455872 and rs3798220 are associated with higher Lp(a) concentrations and increased risk of CAD and myocardial infarction (Page2020Coronary; Clarke2009Genetic). These SNPs explain a significant portion of the variation in Lp(a) levels and are considered independent risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (Clarke2009Genetic).

The LPA gene also exhibits kringle IV copy number variation (KIV CNV), which contributes to the heterogeneity in Lp(a) levels among individuals. A novel compound heterozygous deletion affecting the KIV CNV domains has been identified in a patient with ischemic stroke, expanding the spectrum of known LPA mutations (Li2021A). Additionally, certain LPA variants, such as the 4733G>A splicing variant, can reduce Lp(a) levels and are associated with a decreased risk of CAD (SchachtlRiess2021Frequent).
