# TMSB10

## Overview
Thymosin beta 10 (TMSB10) is a gene that encodes the protein thymosin beta 10, which is a member of the beta-thymosin family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as cell motility, proliferation, and differentiation. As a cytoskeleton-associated protein, thymosin beta 10 influences various signaling pathways, including those related to cancer progression and immune response modulation. Its interactions with proteins such as RHO, CDC42, and RAC1 underscore its significance in tumor metastasis and cellular dynamics (Zhang2017Thymosin). TMSB10's involvement in pathways like PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK further highlights its role in oncogenic processes and potential as a therapeutic target (Zeng2020Thymosin; Inoue2022Tmsb10).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMSB10 (thymosin beta 10) has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In glioma, particularly glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), TMSB10 is highly expressed in the mesenchymal subtype, which is associated with poor prognosis and increased macrophage infiltration. It promotes glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is linked to immune checkpoints and macrophage-related immunosuppressive molecules (Xiong2022Pancancer). In lung cancer, TMSB10 is regulated by the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway, leading to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Its high expression correlates with poor survival and higher metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (Li2020PTENAKT).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), TMSB10 is significantly upregulated and associated with poor clinical outcomes. Knockdown of TMSB10 impairs cell proliferation and invasion, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Pan2020TMSB10). Additionally, genetic variants in TMSB10 have been linked to carfilzomib-related cardiotoxicity in multiple myeloma patients, suggesting its involvement in cardiovascular adverse events (Tantawy2023WholeExome). These findings underscore TMSB10's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target across various cancers.

## Interactions
TMSB10 (thymosin beta 10) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It interacts with cytoskeleton-regulating proteins such as RHO, CDC42, and RAC1, which are involved in tumor metastasis by affecting actin dynamics and cell motility (Zhang2017Thymosin). TMSB10 also interacts with RAS proteins, inhibiting the RAS-RAF interaction and suppressing the RAS/ERK signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for processes like fetal Leydig cell differentiation and ciliogenesis (Inoue2022Tmsb10). 

In lung adenocarcinoma, TMSB10 is involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, promoting the conversion and proliferation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to the M2 phenotype. This interaction enhances tumor growth and progression (Zeng2020Thymosin). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, TMSB10 is associated with several signaling pathways, including the HIF-1, FoxO, and MAPK pathways, and is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Pan2020TMSB10). These interactions highlight TMSB10's role in modulating signaling pathways and cellular dynamics, contributing to its involvement in cancer progression and other biological processes.
