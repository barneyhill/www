# IFNGR1

## Overview
The IFNGR1 gene encodes the interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFN-γR1), a transmembrane receptor that plays a pivotal role in the immune response by mediating the effects of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a key cytokine in type-1 immunity. IFN-γR1 is a component of the heterodimeric receptor complex, which also includes interferon gamma receptor 2 (IFNGR2). This complex is essential for the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, particularly STAT1, which regulates the expression of genes involved in immune defense mechanisms (Blouin2013Interferon; van2010Functional). The receptor's function is modulated by various post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, which influence its stability and signaling capacity (Londino2017Posttranslational). Mutations in IFNGR1 can lead to immunodeficiencies, highlighting its clinical significance in susceptibility to infections such as mycobacterial diseases (Dupuis2000Human).

## Structure
The IFNGR1 protein is a critical component of the interferon gamma receptor complex, which plays a significant role in immune response signaling. The primary structure of IFNGR1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its complex folding and function. The secondary structure includes specific motifs such as a leucine-isoleucine (LI) doublet and a YVSL tyrosine-based motif, which are crucial for the internalization and endocytosis of the receptor (Blouin2013Interferon). 

The tertiary structure of IFNGR1 involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for ligand binding and interaction with other proteins. This structure is essential for the receptor's function in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, where it associates with lipid microdomains at the plasma membrane (Blouin2013Interferon). 

In terms of quaternary structure, IFNGR1 forms a heterodimeric complex with IFNGR2, which is necessary for the full activation of STAT1 phosphorylation and subsequent signal transduction (Walter2020The). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common and may influence the receptor's function and localization. The presence of splice variant isoforms can also affect the protein's activity and interaction with other cellular components (Blouin2013Interferon).

## Function
The IFNGR1 gene encodes the interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFN-γR1), a critical component of the immune response. IFN-γR1 is part of the receptor complex for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), a cytokine essential for type-1 immunity. The receptor complex consists of two ligand-binding IFN-γR1 chains and two signal-transducing IFN-γR2 chains. Upon binding with IFN-γ, the receptor undergoes oligomerization, activating Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2 through trans-phosphorylation. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of tyrosine 440 in the intracellular domain of IFN-γR1, creating a docking site for STAT1. Phosphorylated STAT1 dissociates, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus to regulate IFN-γ responsive genes, which are involved in immune responses such as antigen presentation and T cell activation (van2010Functional).

In healthy human cells, IFNGR1 is crucial for the cellular response to IFN-γ, facilitating the recruitment of IFN-γR2 to form a receptor complex. This complex is essential for the phosphorylation and activation of STAT1, which mediates immune responses by regulating the expression of genes involved in pathogen defense (Dupuis2000Human). IFN-γR1 is primarily located on the cell surface and plays a significant role in activating antigen-presenting cells, enhancing their bactericidal activity and antigen presentation (van2010Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFNGR1 gene, which encodes the interferon gamma receptor 1, are associated with a range of immunodeficiencies and increased susceptibility to infections. One significant condition linked to IFNGR1 mutations is Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD). This condition results from impaired interferon-gamma (IFN-g) signaling, which is crucial for the immune response against mycobacterial infections. Mutations can lead to complete or partial deficiencies in the IFN-g receptor, affecting the cellular response to IFN-g. Complete IFNGR1 deficiency, caused by recessive mutations, results in severe susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, such as overwhelming BCG disease and early-onset non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease, often leading to death without bone marrow transplantation (Dupuis2000Human).

Partial IFNGR1 deficiencies, which can be dominant or recessive, present milder phenotypes. Dominant partial deficiencies are associated with curable BCG infections and late-onset NTM disease, with a good prognosis when treated with IFN-g therapy. Recessive partial deficiencies are even milder, with curable BCG infections and no NTM infections, allowing patients to generally survive without prophylaxis (Dupuis2000Human).

Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in IFNGR1 have been linked to tuberculosis susceptibility. For instance, the rs2234711 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in certain populations (Wu2019Genetica; Wu2019Genetic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of IFNGR1 in immune function and disease susceptibility.

## Interactions
Interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1) is a critical component of the receptor complex for interferon gamma (IFN-γ), playing a significant role in immune response modulation. Upon binding with IFN-γ, IFNGR1 forms a complex with interferon gamma receptor 2 (IFNGR2), which is associated with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) on the cytosolic domains of IFNGR1 and IFNGR2, respectively. This interaction leads to the activation of these kinases and the recruitment of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which is phosphorylated and transported to the nucleus to initiate transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (Londino2017Posttranslational).

IFNGR1 is also subject to post-translational modifications that influence its stability and signaling. It undergoes polyubiquitination, which is modulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β), affecting its degradation and signaling capacity (Londino2017Posttranslational). The receptor interacts with the adaptor protein complex 3 subunit delta 1 (AP3D1) in the context of optineurin deficiency, which promotes its lysosomal sorting and degradation. This interaction is enhanced by the palmitoylation of IFNGR1 at Cys122, a modification crucial for its binding with AP3D1 (Du2021Loss). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms governing IFNGR1's role in immune signaling.
