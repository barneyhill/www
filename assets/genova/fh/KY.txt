# KY

## Overview
The KY gene encodes the kyphoscoliosis peptidase, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of skeletal muscle. This protein is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and is associated with the sarcomeric Z-band structure, where it forms a complex with other proteins such as filamin C (FLNC) and IGFN1. Although classified within the family of transglutaminase-like proteins, the kyphoscoliosis peptidase lacks enzymatic activity due to a disrupted catalytic triad, suggesting a structural rather than enzymatic role (Baker2010Identification; HedbergOldfors2016A). The protein is involved in mechanotransduction and the maintenance of sarcomeric stability, which is crucial for muscle fiber integrity and function (Jokl2018Transcriptional). Mutations in the KY gene have been linked to various neuromuscular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in muscle pathology (HedbergOldfors2016A; Yogev2017Progressive).

## Structure
The KY gene encodes the kyphoscoliosis peptidase, a protein primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and associated with the sarcomeric Z-band structure. The KY protein is part of a family of transglutaminase-like proteins, although it lacks enzymatic activity due to a disrupted catalytic triad (Baker2010Identification; HedbergOldfors2016A). It contains a putative transglutaminase/protease domain, suggesting a structural rather than enzymatic role within the sarcomere (Baker2010Identification).

The KY protein is involved in forming a Z-band associated protein complex with FLNC and IGFN1, which provides structural support to the sarcomere. The absence of KY disrupts this complex, leading to abnormal Z-band thickening and altered distribution of FLNC and XIN (Baker2010Identification). The protein's interaction with IGFN1 and FLNC suggests a role in maintaining sarcomeric stability (Baker2010Identification).

The KY protein's structure includes regions that interact with other sarcomeric proteins, although specific details about its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available literature. The protein's role in muscle function is further supported by its evolutionary conservation across vertebrates (Baker2010Identification).

## Function
The KY gene encodes the kyphoscoliosis peptidase, a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle integrity and function. In healthy human cells, KY is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and uterus, with lower levels in other tissues (HedbergOldfors2016A; Yogev2017Progressive). KY is involved in the regulation of sarcomere organization, particularly at the Z-disc, where it interacts with proteins such as filamin C (FLNC) and IGFN1 to form a complex that provides structural support to the sarcomere (Baker2010Identification). This interaction is essential for maintaining the normal architecture of the Z-disc and ensuring proper muscle function (Baker2010Identification).

KY also plays a role in mechanotransduction, helping muscles respond to mechanical stress by regulating protein turnover and maintaining structural stability (Jokl2018Transcriptional). The absence of KY leads to aberrant localization of FLNC and increased transcription of chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA) components, indicating its involvement in protein turnover and muscle maintenance (Jokl2018Transcriptional). These functions are critical for muscle fiber integrity and the prevention of muscle atrophy and structural damage (Jokl2018Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KY gene, which encodes the kyphoscoliosis peptidase, are associated with several neuromuscular disorders. A homozygous mutation in the KY gene has been linked to autosomal recessive progressive spastic paraplegia in a consanguineous Bedouin kindred. This condition is characterized by spasticity of the lower limbs, hyperreflexia, toe walking, and equinus deformity, with some patients also exhibiting tongue atrophy and intellectual disability (Yogev2017Progressive). Muscle biopsies from affected individuals show central nuclei and fiber size variability, and the disease is associated with a homozygous variant in KY, c.51_52ins(28); p.(V18fs56*) (Yogev2017Progressive).

Another study identified a new early-onset neuromuscular disorder linked to a homozygous one-base deletion in the KY gene, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein. This disorder is characterized by walking difficulties, generalized muscle weakness, and mild contractures, with muscle biopsies revealing variability in fiber size and internalized nuclei (HedbergOldfors2016A). The KY gene is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, and its deficiency leads to abnormal distribution of sarcomeric proteins like filamin C, contributing to muscle pathology (Beatham2004Filamin).

## Interactions
The KY gene encodes a protein that interacts with several sarcomeric cytoskeletal proteins, playing a significant role in muscle structure and function. KY is known to interact with Filamin C (FLNC), a large actin-cross-linking protein crucial for skeletal muscle function. This interaction is particularly important as FLNC is involved in various forms of Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies (LGMDs) (Beatham2004Filamin). The interaction between KY and FLNC has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and pull-down assays, with KY co-purifying with FLNC in cell studies (Beatham2004Filamin). 

KY also interacts with other sarcomeric proteins such as MYBPC1, TTN, and IGFN1, forming a Z-band associated protein complex. This complex is thought to provide structural support to the skeletal muscle sarcomere (Baker2010Identification). The interaction with IGFN1 is particularly notable, as IGFN1 can dimerize through its globular domains and is involved in forming a Z-band protein complex with KY and FLNC (Baker2010Identification). These interactions suggest that KY plays a critical role in maintaining muscle integrity and function, potentially influencing the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies (Beatham2004Filamin).
