# EME1

## Overview
The EME1 gene encodes the essential meiotic structure-specific endonuclease 1 protein, which is a critical component of the Mus81-Eme1 complex, a structure-specific endonuclease involved in DNA repair processes. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by processing complex DNA structures, particularly during DNA replication and repair. The EME1 protein is characterized by a central nuclease domain and two helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motifs, which are essential for its interaction with DNA and other proteins. It is subject to regulation through post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is crucial for its catalytic activity. The Mus81-Eme1 complex, in which EME1 functions, is integral to the resolution of DNA double-strand breaks and the prevention of replication fork collapse, thereby safeguarding genomic integrity during cell division (Chang2008Crystal; Giaccherini2022Regulation; Forment2011StructureSpecific).

## Structure
The EME1 protein is a component of the Mus81-Eme1 complex, which functions as a structure-specific endonuclease involved in DNA repair processes. EME1 contains a central nuclease domain and two repeats of the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif at its C-terminal region, along with a linker helix (Chang2008Crystal). The nuclease-like domain of EME1 is formed with a six-stranded sheet and several helices, while the C-terminal domains are composed of five helices with a pair of HhH motifs (Chang2008Crystal).

The 36-residue intradomain linker in EME1 is crucial for DNA recognition and binding, playing a significant role in substrate interaction and nuclease activity (Chang2008Crystal). This linker is flexible and interacts with the duplex portion of substrate DNA, which is necessary for efficient cleavage (Chang2008Crystal).

EME1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by Rad3 ATR and Chk1 kinases, which is essential for the catalytic stimulation of the Mus81-Eme1 complex (Giaccherini2022Regulation). The N-terminal domain of EME1 contains SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) that are important for its function and regulation (Giaccherini2022Regulation).

## Function
The EME1 gene encodes a protein that forms a complex with MUS81, functioning as a structure-specific DNA endonuclease. This complex plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by processing DNA structures that resemble replication forks. In healthy human cells, the EME1 protein, as part of the Mus81/Eme1 complex, is involved in the resolution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication and repair processes. This activity is crucial for the proper progression of the S phase of the cell cycle and for preventing replication fork collapse, which can lead to genomic instability (Forment2011StructureSpecific).

The Mus81/Eme1 complex is regulated by the Chk1-mediated DNA-damage checkpoint pathway, which prevents uncontrolled fork collapse and ensures proper S-phase progression. In the absence of Chk1 activity, the Mus81/Eme1 complex can generate DSBs at replication forks, leading to replication fork collapse and incomplete replication (Forment2011StructureSpecific). The complex is also involved in the cleavage of stalled and blocked replication forks, facilitating replication recovery and maintaining genomic integrity (Martín2011Novel). EME1 is active in the nucleus, where it participates in safeguarding the integrity of the genome during cell division.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EME1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), EME1 is part of a DNA damage repair gene signature that predicts poor clinical outcomes. It is upregulated in high-risk ccRCC groups, correlating with poorer overall survival and progression-free survival (Peng2022A). In esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), EME1 is overexpressed in tumor samples compared to normal tissues, suggesting a role in tumor biology and potential implications for chemotherapy sensitivity (Jalal2014Gastroesophageal).

EME1 is also involved in the response to DNA damage in other cancers. It is upregulated in lung squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer, with higher expression levels associated with increased survival risk in certain cancers like adrenocortical carcinoma (Agarwal2024Potential). In homologous recombination-deficient tumor cells, EME1 expression is linked to PARP inhibitor resistance, particularly in BRCA1-mutated breast cancer, where low EME1 expression correlates with a favorable prognosis (Sweatman2024SETD1Adependent).

These findings highlight EME1's potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and its involvement in DNA repair pathways, influencing treatment responses and clinical outcomes.

## Interactions
The EME1 protein is a crucial component of the Mus81-Eme1 structure-specific endonuclease complex, which plays a significant role in DNA repair processes. EME1 interacts with the MUS81 protein through three primary interfaces, involving the nuclease domain of MUS81 and the nuclease-like domain of EME1, as well as the HhH2 domains of both proteins. These interactions are primarily hydrophobic, with contributions from hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, and are essential for the dimerization and function of the complex (Chang2008Crystal).

The EME1 protein also contains a 36R intradomain linker that is critical for recognizing and binding to DNA substrates, such as splayed-arm and 3' overhang DNA. This linker stabilizes the interaction between the MUS81 complex and DNA, facilitating efficient cleavage and maintaining genomic stability (Chang2008Crystal).

In addition to its interactions with MUS81, EME1 is involved in regulatory mechanisms through its SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs), which are crucial for its function. These motifs mediate interactions with SUMO-like domains and are important for the phosphorylation of EME1 by kinases such as Rad3 ATR and Chk1, which is essential for the catalytic activity of the Mus81-Eme1 complex (Giaccherini2022Regulation).
