# CDC14A

## Overview
CDC14A is a gene that encodes the protein cell division cycle 14A, a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, centrosome duplication, and mitotic progression. The CDC14A protein is characterized by its dual-specificity phosphatase domain, which allows it to dephosphorylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, thereby modulating the activity of various substrates, including cyclin-dependent kinases and other cell cycle regulators (Gray2003The; Imtiaz2017CDC14A). This phosphatase is essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, and it plays a significant role in the DNA damage response and repair mechanisms (Mocciaro2010Vertebrate; ManzanoLópez2020The). Beyond its cellular functions, CDC14A is crucial for physiological processes such as hearing and male fertility, with mutations in the gene linked to conditions like sensorineural hearing loss and male infertility (Imtiaz2017CDC14A).

## Structure
The CDC14A protein is a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in cell cycle regulation. Its primary structure consists of 623 amino acid residues, with two annotated transcription start sites and four different 3' untranslated regions (Imtiaz2017CDC14A). The protein contains a dual-specificity phosphatase domain (DSPc/PTPc), which is crucial for its phosphatase activity (Imtiaz2017CDC14A). 

The secondary structure of CDC14A includes a DSP-like fold, similar to other dual-specificity phosphatases, with a conserved protein-tyrosine phosphatase catalytic motif (Gray2003The). The tertiary structure forms a globular shape with two structurally equivalent domains, A and B, arranged in tandem. The B-domain contains the catalytic center, while the A-domain contributes to substrate specificity (Gray2003The). 

CDC14A undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1 (Cdk1) on specific serine residues, which may modulate its interactions with other proteins (Ovejero2018Biochemical). The protein also has splice variant isoforms, which can result in different functional forms (Imtiaz2017CDC14A). The C-terminal domain contains a nuclear export sequence and is subject to phosphorylation, affecting its subcellular localization (Ovejero2018Biochemical).

## Function
The CDC14A gene encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. In human cells, CDC14A is involved in centrosome duplication and mitotic regulation, where it dephosphorylates substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), such as Cdc25A, on specific serine residues. This dephosphorylation is crucial for cell cycle transitions and checkpoint responses, impacting the stability and turnover of Cdc25A, which is essential for proper cell cycle progression (Kaiser2002Disruption; Esteban2006Human).

CDC14A is localized to the centrosomes and is implicated in regulating centrosome structure, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Misregulation of CDC14A can lead to defects in these processes, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Kaiser2002Disruption). The phosphatase is also involved in the DNA damage response, playing a crucial role in DNA repair mechanisms, which is vital for maintaining genomic integrity (Mocciaro2010Vertebrate; ManzanoLópez2020The).

In addition to its cellular roles, CDC14A is essential for hearing and male fertility in humans, with its phosphatase activity being critical for these functions. Mutations in CDC14A can lead to hearing loss and male infertility, underscoring its importance in these physiological processes (Imtiaz2017CDC14A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CDC14A gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting hearing and male fertility. Pathogenic variants of CDC14A have been linked to DFNB32-linked deafness, characterized by sensorineural hearing loss. These mutations include frameshift, stop-gain, and missense mutations, which can lead to aberrant mRNA transcripts and truncated proteins lacking essential phosphatase activity (Imtiaz2017CDC14A). Specific mutations, such as p.Q320P, are associated with severe-to-profound hearing loss and male infertility, while other truncating mutations may result in less severe hearing loss (Imtiaz2017CDC14A).

In addition to hearing loss, certain CDC14A mutations are linked to male infertility. Affected males may exhibit low sperm count, high immotility, and abnormal sperm morphology, although not all males with CDC14A mutations are infertile (Imtiaz2017CDC14A). Mouse models with Cdc14a mutations show similar phenotypes, including degeneration of hair cells and seminiferous tubules, leading to deafness and infertility (Imtiaz2017CDC14A).

The CDC14A gene is also implicated in a proposed monogenic syndrome named Hearing Impairment and Infertile Male Syndrome (HIIMS), distinct from other syndromes involving hearing loss and infertility (Imtiaz2017CDC14A).

## Interactions
The human gene CDC14A encodes a phosphatase that interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation. CDC14A forms a stable complex with the atypical mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk3, independent of its phosphatase activity. This interaction occurs via Erk3's unique C-terminal domain, and CDC14A can dephosphorylate Erk3, suggesting Erk3 as a potential substrate (Hansen2008A). CDC14A also influences the signaling pathway between Erk3 and MK5 by redistributing MK5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Hansen2008A).

CDC14A interacts with the Cdk1/cyclin B complex during interphase but dissociates during mitosis, indicating a regulatory role in cell cycle progression (Paulsen2006The). It also binds to and dephosphorylates the ser315 site of the p53 protein, modulating p53 activity (Paulsen2006The). CDC14A dephosphorylates Cdc25A, a cell cycle-regulatory protein, affecting its stability and function (Esteban2006Human). These interactions highlight CDC14A's involvement in critical cellular processes, including centrosome duplication and mitotic regulation.
