# SELENOT

## Overview
SELENOT is a gene that encodes the protein selenoprotein T, a member of the selenoprotein family characterized by the presence of the amino acid selenocysteine. Selenoprotein T functions primarily as an oxidoreductase within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a critical role in maintaining redox homeostasis and facilitating protein folding through selenosulfide/disulfide exchange reactions. This protein is integral to the regulation of calcium dynamics in the ER, influencing cellular processes such as differentiation and survival. Selenoprotein T is also involved in neuroprotection and brain development, with its deficiency linked to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, SELENOT's interactions with components of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex underscore its importance in glycoprotein quality control and cellular communication (Zhang2021Roles; Pothion2020Selenoprotein; Anouar2018Selenoprotein).

## Function
SELENOT, or selenoprotein T, is a crucial oxidoreductase involved in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. It is primarily active in the ER, where it plays a significant role in redox homeostasis by facilitating selenosulfide/disulfide reactions, which are essential for protein folding and quality control of glycoproteins (Pothion2020Selenoprotein). SELENOT interacts with the STT3A-type oligosaccharyltransferase complex, regulating N-glycan occupancy of specific substrates, including glycohormones and GPI-anchored proteins, which are vital for cell adhesion and communication (Pothion2020Selenoprotein).

SELENOT is also involved in calcium regulation within the ER, likely through interactions with the IP3 receptor or SERCA pump, which is crucial for cellular processes like differentiation and survival (Pothion2020Selenoprotein; Anouar2018Selenoprotein). Its expression is regulated by the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway and is influenced by calcium ions, linking it to metabolic activity and secretion, particularly in neuroendocrine cells (Pothion2020Selenoprotein).

SELENOT's role extends to neuroprotection, where it is involved in brain development and function. It is essential for maintaining neural health, as its deficiency leads to reduced brain volumes and increased vulnerability to neurotoxins (Zhang2021Roles; Anouar2018Selenoprotein). These functions underscore SELENOT's importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SELENOT gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In the cardiovascular system, SELENOT is crucial for protecting cardiomyocytes from oxidative damage and ER stress, which are significant factors in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury and cardiac lipotoxicity. Reduced SELENOT expression is associated with increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, contributing to conditions like congestive heart failure and coronary heart disease (Rocca2022The; Rocca2023PalmitateInduced).

In the central nervous system, SELENOT plays a protective role in neurodevelopment and neuroprotection. Its deficiency leads to reduced brain volumes and increased vulnerability to oxidative stress, which can result in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease. SELENOT deficiency in mice has been linked to decreased catecholaminergic neuron density and altered behavioral phenotypes, including hyperactivity and anxiety (Godefroy2022SELENOT; Anouar2018Selenoprotein).

SELENOT's involvement in maintaining ER homeostasis and its interaction with the oligosaccharyltransferase complex suggest its potential role in congenital disorders of glycosylation, which are associated with hormonal disturbances (Pothion2020Selenoprotein). These findings highlight SELENOT as a potential therapeutic target for diseases characterized by oxidative and ER stress.

## Interactions
SELENOT, a selenoprotein, is involved in various interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are crucial for its function. It physically interacts with the SERCA2 calcium pump, which is essential for regulating ER calcium flux and maintaining dopaminergic signaling pathways. This interaction is significant for the expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the transcription factor NURR1, both of which are important in protecting against attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in mice (Guo2023SELENOT).

SELENOT is also a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, interacting specifically with subunits such as KCP2, STT3A, and OST48, but not with STT3B. These interactions suggest SELENOT's role in the stability and function of the OST complex, which is crucial for N-glycosylation processes (Pothion2020Selenoprotein; Hamieh2017Selenoprotein).

In the context of ER stress and apoptosis regulation, SELENOT interacts with ubiquitin protein ligases GP78 and RMA1, which are involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system. These interactions highlight SELENOT's role in managing protein misfolding and maintaining ER homeostasis (Varlamova2022The).
