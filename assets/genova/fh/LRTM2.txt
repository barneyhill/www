# LRTM2

## Overview
LRTM2, or leucine-rich repeats and transmembrane domains 2, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in neuronal development and synaptic organization. The LRTM2 protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs and transmembrane domains, which are integral to its function in protein sorting and synaptic differentiation (Dolan2007The; Ichise2022LeucineRich). As a neuronal protein, LRTM2 plays a pivotal role in the localization of proteins to inhibitory axon terminals and interacts with neurexins, a family of presynaptic cell adhesion molecules, to promote excitatory synapse formation (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs; Ichise2022LeucineRich). The protein's ability to bind neurexins in a calcium-dependent manner, and its competitive interaction with neuroligins, underscores its significance in synaptic development and organization (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs).

## Structure
The LRTM2 protein is a type I transmembrane protein consisting of 370 amino acids in humans and mice. It is relatively small compared to other leucine-rich repeat (LRR) transmembrane protein families (Ichise2022LeucineRich). The protein features a signal peptide, an LRR-NT, six LRR repeats, an LRR-CT, and a transmembrane domain, followed by a short cytoplasmic tail with acidic residues (Dolan2007The). The LRR domain is located between the N-terminal signal sequence and the transmembrane domain, comprising six repeated LRR motifs and capping structures at both terminals (LRR-NT and LRR-CT) (Ichise2022LeucineRich).

LRTM2 is glycosylated, as indicated by its sensitivity to peptide N-glycosidase F treatment, but it is not a proteoglycan, showing resistance to treatments with chondroitinase ABC, heparinase I, heparinase II, and endoglycosidase H (Ichise2022LeucineRich). The protein ends in a consensus PDZ-binding domain (SSSA/SSVA), suggesting synaptic localization (Dolan2007The). The cytoplasmic domain contains candidate sequences for protein sorting, including YxxL/Yxxϕ, KKxx, and an acidic domain (AD) associated with axon targeting (Ichise2022LeucineRich). These features suggest a role in protein sorting and neuronal circuit functions (Ichise2022LeucineRich).

## Function
LRTM2, or leucine-rich repeats and transmembrane domains 2, plays a crucial role in protein sorting within neurons, particularly affecting axon and dendrite localization. It is involved in the proper distribution of proteins to inhibitory axon terminals, influencing the localization and levels of proteins such as GAD67 and GABA B R1 in the brain (Ichise2022LeucineRich). LRTM2 enhances axon localization of these proteins, and mutations in its sorting signals can impair this function, leading to altered protein distribution (Ichise2022LeucineRich).

In synapse development, LRTM2 acts as a ligand for neurexins, specifically binding to neurexin-1β variants lacking an insert at splice site 4. This binding is crucial for its presynaptic inducing activity, as it promotes synaptic differentiation more effectively than neuroligin-1 (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs). LRTM2's interaction with neurexins is calcium-dependent and competitive with neuroligin-1, highlighting its significant role in synaptic organization (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs). Through these interactions, LRTM2 contributes to the formation of the glutamatergic postsynaptic scaffold, enhancing the clustering of synaptic components (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs).

## Interactions
LRRTM2, a leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal protein, is primarily involved in synaptic development through its interactions with neurexins, a family of presynaptic cell adhesion molecules. LRRTM2 specifically binds to neurexin-1β, neurexin-2, and neurexin-3 variants that lack an insert at splice site 4 (−S4). This interaction is crucial for promoting excitatory synapse formation and is calcium-dependent (Ko2009LRRTM2; Siddiqui2010LRRTMs).

The binding of LRRTM2 to neurexins is competitive with neuroligins, another group of proteins that also bind neurexins. However, LRRTM2 and neuroligins have different splice-site dependencies, with LRRTM2 binding specifically to neurexins lacking the splice site 4 insert, while neuroligins can bind to neurexins with or without the insert (Ko2009LRRTM2; Siddiqui2010LRRTMs). This competitive binding suggests that neurexins act as master regulators of the cooperative activities of LRRTMs and neuroligins in synapse development (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs).

Mutations in LRRTM2 that disrupt its binding to neurexins abolish its ability to induce presynaptic differentiation, underscoring the importance of this interaction in synaptic development (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs).
