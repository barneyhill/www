# SNRPC

## Overview
The SNRPC gene encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide C, a crucial component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. This protein plays a vital role in the spliceosome, a cellular machinery responsible for RNA splicing, which is essential for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA and the joining of exons to form mature mRNA. The SNRPC protein is categorized as a ribonucleoprotein and is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to mRNA maturation and gene expression regulation by recognizing the 5' splice site during the splicing process. Its interactions with various proteins and nucleic acids underscore its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and gene expression. Additionally, SNRPC has been implicated in several diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2021SNRPC; Cai2021N6methyladenosine; Yamaguchi2022Splicing).

## Function
The SNRPC gene encodes a specific protein component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is essential for the formation of the spliceosome. The spliceosome is a critical cellular machinery responsible for RNA splicing, a process that removes introns from pre-mRNA and joins exons together to form mature mRNA. This process is vital for generating diverse transcriptional variants, which are crucial for normal cellular function and adaptation (Zhang2021SNRPC).

SNRPC is involved in the biogenesis, assembly, and subunit organization of the ribonucleoprotein complex, playing a significant role in RNA splicing and mRNA processing. These functions are consistent with its presumed physiological roles in healthy human cells (Zhang2021SNRPC). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to mRNA maturation and gene expression regulation by recognizing the 5' splice site during the splicing process (Zhang2021SNRPC).

While the specific function of SNRPC in healthy human cells is less detailed in some studies, its role in the spliceosome and RNA splicing underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and gene expression (Cai2021N6methyladenosine).

## Clinical Significance
The SNRPC gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SNRPC is identified as a potential oncogene, with its expression significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues. This overexpression is associated with poorer overall survival and disease-free survival in HCC patients, suggesting its role in cancer progression and metastasis (Zhang2021SNRPC). SNRPC is also linked to immune evasion in HCC, as its expression negatively correlates with the infiltration of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils (Zhang2021SNRPC).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), SNRPC is involved in the regulation of interferon signature genes, with specific genetic variants affecting the expression of different SNRPC isoforms. This regulation is more pronounced in men and is associated with the disease's pathophysiology (Yamaguchi2022Splicing).

SNRPC has also been identified as a significantly mutated gene in neuroendocrine carcinomas of the gallbladder, although its specific role in this context is less clear (Liu2021Wholeexome). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SNRPC in various diseases, particularly in cancer and autoimmune disorders.

## Interactions
SNRPC, a core component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in the U1 snRNP machinery, which overlaps extensively with the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) machinery. SNRPC co-immunoprecipitates with RNAP II, indicating a physical interaction between these machineries, although reciprocal immunoprecipitations using antibodies against U1 snRNP do not pull down RNAP II, possibly due to the epitope being buried within the RNAP II machinery (Chi2018Interactome).

SNRPC also interacts with ALS/SMA-causative proteins such as FUS, EWSR1, TAF15, and MATR3. These interactions were identified through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, showing that SNRPC and other U1 snRNP-specific proteins are enriched in the immunoprecipitates of these ALS proteins (Chi2018Interactome).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SNRPC is involved in the biogenesis, assembly, and organization of the ribonucleoprotein complex. It interacts with miRNAs like miR-206, miR-302c, and miR-200b, which negatively regulate SNRPC and are known to inhibit proliferation, invasion, and migration of HCC cells (Zhang2021SNRPC). These interactions highlight SNRPC's role in both splicing and disease-related processes.
