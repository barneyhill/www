# TXNL4B

## Overview
TXNL4B is a gene that encodes the thioredoxin-like protein 4B, which is a member of the thioredoxin protein family. This protein is characterized by its thioredoxin fold, a structural motif commonly associated with redox reactions, although TXNL4B is primarily involved in pre-mRNA splicing rather than redox activity. As a crucial component of the spliceosome, TXNL4B plays a significant role in the removal of introns from pre-messenger RNA, a process essential for the proper expression of genes and the production of mature mRNA molecules. The protein interacts specifically with Prp6, a spliceosomal protein, and is necessary for efficient pre-mRNA splicing. Beyond its role in RNA processing, TXNL4B is implicated in cell cycle progression, particularly in the transition from the S phase to the G2 phase, and is associated with cell growth and proliferation. Its expression levels have been linked to various clinical conditions, including breast cancer, where it may serve as a potential biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic targeting (Nordgard2008Genome‐wide; Jin2005Overproduction; Oei2014Reduction).

## Structure
TXNL4B is a thioredoxin-like protein that shares homology with TXNL4A, differing by a single amino acid deletion and exhibiting 38% identity in their aligned sequences (Jin2005Overproduction). The protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified for structural studies. The molecular weight of the purified TXNL4B protein was determined to be 16,883 Da, consistent with the absence of the N-terminal methionine (Jin2005Overproduction).

The crystallization of TXNL4B was achieved using the vapor-diffusion method, and the crystals were found to belong to the primitive monoclinic space group P2 (Jin2005Overproduction). This crystallographic data is crucial for understanding the structural differences between TXNL4B and its homolog TXNL4A, which may elucidate their distinct roles in pre-mRNA splicing (Jin2005Overproduction).

TXNL4B features a thioredoxin fold, a common motif in proteins involved in redox reactions. This structural motif is indicative of its potential role in cellular redox processes. The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions (Jin2005Overproduction). Additionally, TXNL4B can produce multiple splice variant isoforms, which may vary in their functional roles (Jin2005Overproduction).

## Function
TXNL4B encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) in eukaryotic cells. This process, known as pre-mRNA splicing, is essential for the proper expression of genes and the production of mature messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that can be translated into proteins (Jin2005Overproduction). TXNL4B interacts specifically with Prp6, a spliceosomal protein, and its activity is necessary for efficient pre-mRNA splicing. Inhibition of TXNL4B results in insufficient splicing, highlighting its critical role in RNA processing (Nordgard2008Genome‐wide; Jin2005Overproduction).

In addition to its role in splicing, TXNL4B is involved in cell cycle progression, particularly in the transition from the S phase to the G2 phase. This function is linked to its role in pre-mRNA splicing, which is necessary for the production of proteins required for cell cycle progression (Oei2014Reduction). TXNL4B's expression is associated with cell growth and proliferation, as evidenced by its overexpression in certain cancer cell lines, which leads to increased cell proliferation (Nordgard2008Genome‐wide).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TXNL4B gene have been associated with various clinical implications, particularly in the context of breast cancer. Overexpression of TXNL4B is linked to increased proliferation of breast cancer cells, potentially by accelerating the transition from the S phase to the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. This overexpression is associated with disease progression and poorer patient survival outcomes. Conversely, deletion of TXNL4B, often observed in patients with a 16q chromosomal deletion, may slow down cell proliferation, which could counterbalance the effects of deleting the tumor suppressor gene ADAMTS18, leading to a better prognosis (Nordgard2008Genome‐wide).

In breast cancer subtypes, TXNL4B expression levels vary significantly, with the basal-like subtype showing the highest levels and the Luminal A subtype, which is linked to a better prognosis, showing the lowest levels (Nordgard2008Genome‐wide). 

Additionally, TXNL4B is implicated in liver and kidney damage induced by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in rats, where its expression is associated with necrosis pathways (Frejo2014Liver). These findings suggest that TXNL4B's expression levels and interactions may serve as potential biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targets in various diseases.

## Interactions
TXNL4B, a thioredoxin-like protein, is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and interacts with several proteins within the spliceosome complex. It is known to associate with Prp6, a component crucial for the spliceosome's function, highlighting its role in pre-mRNA splicing (Nordgard2008Genome‐wide; Jin2005Overproduction). Despite its homology to TXNL4A, TXNL4B does not interact with proteins such as PQBP1, hnRNP F, or hnRNP H, which are known to associate with TXNL4A, indicating functional differences between these homologous proteins (Jin2005Overproduction).

TXNL4B's interaction with Prp6 is essential for cell cycle progression, particularly in the transition from the S phase to the G2 phase, which is significant in the context of cancer cell proliferation (Nordgard2008Genome‐wide). The gene's expression levels have been linked to breast cancer subtypes, with variations in expression potentially affecting tumor proliferation and prognosis (Nordgard2008Genome‐wide). While specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, TXNL4B's role in the spliceosome and cell cycle regulation underscores its importance in cellular processes.
