# KIF18B

## Overview
KIF18B is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 18B, a motor protein belonging to the kinesin-8 family. This protein plays a critical role in cellular processes by regulating microtubule dynamics, particularly during mitosis. Kinesin family member 18B is characterized by its ability to move along microtubules towards their plus ends, facilitated by its N-terminal motor domain and C-terminal microtubule-binding domain. The protein's function is essential for proper chromosome alignment and segregation, ensuring genomic stability during cell division (McHugh2018Microtubule; Tanenbaum2011A). KIF18B's interactions with other proteins, such as EB1 and MCAK, further underscore its role in modulating microtubule dynamics and mitotic spindle positioning (Stout2011Kif18B; Tanenbaum2011A). Additionally, KIF18B has been implicated in various cancers, where its dysregulation is associated with tumor progression and poor prognostic outcomes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wu2021Kinesin; Yang2020Identification).

## Structure
KIF18B is a kinesin-8 family motor protein with a complex molecular structure. It features an N-terminal motor domain responsible for its movement along microtubules, a coiled-coil segment, and a large C-terminal tail (Chen2024KIF18B:; Tanenbaum2011A). The C-terminal region includes a microtubule-binding domain, which is crucial for its localization to microtubule plus ends and is regulated by phosphorylation (McHugh2018Microtubule). This region also contains a globular domain that promotes dimerization, enhancing its affinity for microtubules and EB proteins (McHugh2018Microtubule).

KIF18B interacts with EB1 through its C-terminal tail, which contains sites resembling the SxIP consensus sequence, facilitating its localization to microtubule plus ends (Stout2011Kif18B; Tanenbaum2011A). The protein's motor domain is involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, essential for its motor activity (Tanenbaum2011A). KIF18B is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which regulate its interaction with other proteins and its function in microtubule dynamics (Stout2011Kif18B; McHugh2018Microtubule). The protein's structure allows it to function as a processive motor, moving towards microtubule plus ends and playing a role in spindle positioning during mitosis (McHugh2018Microtubule).

## Function
KIF18B is a member of the kinesin-8 family, functioning as a plus end-directed motor protein with a secondary microtubule binding site in its tail. In healthy human cells, KIF18B plays a crucial role in regulating microtubule dynamics, which are essential for several cellular processes, including chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, vesicle trafficking, and maintenance of cell polarity throughout the cell cycle (Clinical; p&gt; Zhong2019&lt). It is primarily active in the mitotic spindle apparatus, where it ensures proper chromosome congression and stability, which is vital for accurate cell division and maintaining genomic integrity (Wu2018KIF18B).

KIF18B's activity is not limited to mitosis, as it is an important modulator of microtubule dynamics throughout the cell cycle. Loss of KIF18B can lead to defects in spindle microtubule organization, increased number and density of astral microtubules, disturbed chromosome alignment, and perturbed microtubule dynamics (Clinical; p&gt; Zhong2019&lt). This protein is involved in intracellular transport and mitotic spindle dynamics, playing a significant role in chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division by regulating microtubule dynamics (Wu2018KIF18B).

## Clinical Significance
KIF18B has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), KIF18B is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognostic outcomes, including lower 5-year survival rates. Its expression correlates with tumor grade, pathological stage, and metastasis, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Yang2020Identification). In prostate cancer, KIF18B overexpression activates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and serving as a potential biomarker for disease progression (Wu2021Kinesin).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KIF18B enhances the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, contributing to tumor proliferation and metastasis (Yang2020KIF18B). Similarly, in breast cancer, KIF18B is linked to the Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin pathway, influencing cell survival and proliferation, and its knockdown increases chemosensitivity to doxorubicin (Jiang2021Silencing). In lung adenocarcinoma, KIF18B is overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes, with its dysregulation potentially driven by DNA amplification and hypomethylation (Clinical; p&gt; Zhong2019&lt).

KIF18B's role in cancer is further supported by its correlation with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint genes, indicating its potential as a target for immunotherapy (Qiu2021KIF18B).

## Interactions
KIF18B, a kinesin-8 family member, interacts with several proteins to regulate microtubule dynamics during mitosis. A key interaction is with EB1, a microtubule plus-end binding protein. KIF18B directly binds to EB1 through its C-terminal domain, which is crucial for its localization to microtubule plus ends. This interaction is essential for KIF18B's role in controlling astral microtubule length and dynamics (Stout2011Kif18B; Tanenbaum2011A).

KIF18B also interacts with MCAK, a kinesin-13 family member, forming a complex that promotes microtubule depolymerization. This interaction is mediated by a specific domain in KIF18B's unstructured tail, known as the MCAK binding domain (MCBD). The KIF18B-MCAK complex is negatively regulated by Aurora kinases, which phosphorylate MCAK, reducing its binding affinity to KIF18B (Tanenbaum2011A).

These interactions highlight KIF18B's role in modulating microtubule dynamics through its associations with EB1 and MCAK, contributing to its function in mitotic spindle positioning and stability (Tanenbaum2011A; McHugh2018Microtubule).
