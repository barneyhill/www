# C22orf42

## Overview
C22orf42 is a gene located on chromosome 22, encoding the protein known as chromosome 22 open reading frame 42. This protein is currently uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and mechanisms of action remain largely undefined. However, emerging research suggests that C22orf42 may play a role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. Alterations in the expression and methylation status of C22orf42 have been associated with prognostic outcomes in several cancers, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, as well as treatment responses in ovarian cancer (Aydin2021Overview; Ershov2023Uncharacterized). Additionally, its involvement in non-functioning pituitary neuroendocrine tumors and idiopathic nonobstructive azoospermia has been noted, although further research is needed to elucidate its precise role in these conditions (Tang2022Joint; Cheng2019Identification).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
C22orf42 has been implicated in various cancers and other conditions through alterations in its expression and methylation status. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), low expression levels of C22orf42 are associated with unfavorable disease-free survival and overall survival, indicating its prognostic significance in these cancers (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). In ovarian cancer, C22orf42 expression levels correlate with positive responses to platinum-based chemotherapy, suggesting its role in predicting treatment outcomes (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

In non-functioning pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PitNETs), increased methylation and decreased expression of C22orf42 have been observed, which may contribute to the invasive behavior of these tumors (Cheng2019Identification; Aydin2021Overview). This gene's methylation status is negatively correlated with its expression, further supporting its involvement in tumor invasiveness (Cheng2019Identification).

C22orf42 has also been identified in the context of idiopathic nonobstructive azoospermia (iNOA), although its specific role in this condition remains unclear (Tang2022Joint). These findings highlight the potential of C22orf42 as a target for therapeutic interventions and its importance in cancer prognosis and treatment.
