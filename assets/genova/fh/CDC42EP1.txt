# CDC42EP1

## Overview
CDC42EP1, also known as Borg5, is a gene that encodes the CDC42 effector protein 1, a member of the CDC42 effector protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal organization and cell migration. It functions as a scaffold protein, lacking enzymatic activity, and interacts with the Rho GTPase CDC42 through its Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain. CDC42EP1 is crucial for the formation and stabilization of septin filaments, which are essential for maintaining the organization of actin stress fibers, thereby influencing cell shape, contractility, and directed migration (Farrugia2016The; Kho2023Coordinated). The protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in cellular processes such as migration and morphogenesis by interacting with septins and actin filaments (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Structure
CDC42EP1, also known as Borg5, is a protein composed of 409 amino acids, making it the largest member of the Borg family of CDC42 effector proteins (Farrugia2016The). The protein lacks known enzymatically active domains, suggesting its function is primarily structural or scaffolding (Farrugia2016The). It contains a highly homologous N-terminal CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain, which facilitates binding to active CDC42 and TC10, but not Rac1 (Farrugia2016The; Umarao2022Cdc42/Rac). Following the CRIB domain is a unique Borg Homology (BH) 1 domain, with the central and C-terminal regions containing two additional conserved regions, BH2 and BH3 (Farrugia2016The). The BH3 domain is necessary for binding to septins and contains an alpha-helix (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). CDC42EP1 also features several heptad repeats following the BH3 domain, including a specific 'PAANPPA' repeat of unknown function (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). The central region of CDC42EP1 includes a proline-rich domain, shared with CDC42EP2 and CDC42EP5 (Farrugia2016The). The protein is predicted to be mostly disordered, with the high-resolution structure remaining unknown (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Function
CDC42EP1, also known as Borg5, is a member of the CDC42 effector protein family involved in cytoskeletal organization and cell migration. It interacts with the Rho GTPase CDC42, cycling between active and inactive states to regulate various cellular functions (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP1 plays a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of septin filaments, which are essential for maintaining the organization of actin stress fibers. This interaction is vital for processes such as cell shape regulation, contractility, and directed migration (Kho2023Coordinated).

In endothelial cells, CDC42EP1 aligns with septin filaments and actin stress fibers, contributing to cellular structure and contractility. Its depletion disrupts septin and actomyosin fiber assembly, leading to a loss of cellular contractility and affecting cell migration (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP1 is also involved in neural crest cell migration, where it cooperates with septin filaments to regulate the speed and direction of migration by stabilizing actin stress fibers (Kho2023Coordinated).

CDC42EP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular processes like migration and morphogenesis by interacting with septins and actin filaments (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Interactions
CDC42EP1, also known as Borg5, is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and cell motility. It interacts with the small GTPase CDC42 in a GTP-dependent manner through its Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif, which is essential for its localization and function in cells (Farrugia2016The; Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). CDC42EP1 also interacts with septin filaments, particularly Septin7, and is involved in their assembly and stability. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the organization of actin stress fibers, which are important for cell migration (Kho2023Coordinated).

CDC42EP1's interaction with septins is direct, and it acts as a stabilizing side binder for septin filaments. This interaction is reciprocal, as septin filaments also influence the subcellular organization of CDC42EP1 (Kho2023Coordinated). The protein is also a substrate of ERK2, suggesting its involvement in signaling pathways that regulate cell motility and shape (Farrugia2016The). Additionally, CDC42EP1 interacts with atypical PKC, which has been shown to increase cell motility in certain cell types (Farrugia2016The). These interactions highlight CDC42EP1's role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular processes.
