# AGTRAP

## Overview
The AGTRAP gene encodes the angiotensin II receptor-associated protein, a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in modulating the signaling pathways of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. AGTRAP is involved in the internalization and desensitization of AT1R, thereby regulating cardiovascular and renal functions and contributing to metabolic homeostasis. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including renal nephron tubules and adipose tissues, where it influences processes such as renal hemodynamics and metabolic regulation. AGTRAP's interactions with other proteins, such as the transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), further underscore its role in cellular processes related to iron metabolism and oxidative stress response (Abe2022Angiotensin; LopezIlasaca2003The). Alterations in AGTRAP expression have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Dumitru2024The; Maeda2013Angiotensin).

## Function
The AGTRAP gene encodes a protein that interacts with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), playing a crucial role in modulating its signaling pathways. AGTRAP promotes the internalization of AT1R, which inhibits pathological activation while preserving baseline physiological signaling. This regulation is essential for maintaining normal cardiovascular and renal functions, as well as preventing diseases such as hypertension and renal damage (Matsuda2013Upstream; Tamura2007The).

In healthy human cells, AGTRAP is abundantly expressed in renal nephron tubules and adipose tissues. In the kidney, it is involved in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system, affecting renal hemodynamics and tubular transport (Tamura2007The). In adipose tissues, AGTRAP plays a role in metabolic regulation, helping to prevent disorders associated with visceral obesity, such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia (Maeda2013Angiotensin).

At the cellular level, AGTRAP is active in the cell membrane and cytoplasm, where it influences receptor internalization and desensitization processes. This activity is crucial for modulating AT1R function and ensuring proper cellular responses to angiotensin II, thereby impacting overall cardiovascular and metabolic health (Daviet1999Cloning; Tanaka2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AGTRAP gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, AGTRAP is significantly overexpressed in several types, including glioblastoma (GBM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and others, where it is associated with poor prognosis and shorter overall survival (Dumitru2024The; Liu2021AGTRAP). In GBM, high AGTRAP levels correlate with shorter progression-free survival and are linked to tumorigenic pathways such as MAPK and AKT/mTOR, as well as immune cell infiltration that promotes tumor progression (Dumitru2024The). In HCC, AGTRAP overexpression is associated with immune infiltration and T-cell exhaustion, contributing to tumor progression (Liu2021AGTRAP).

AGTRAP also plays a role in metabolic disorders associated with visceral obesity. Decreased expression of AGTRAP in adipose tissues is linked to conditions such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia, which can lead to cardiovascular and renal diseases. AGTRAP deficiency in mice results in systemic metabolic dysfunction, characterized by increased fat accumulation and insulin resistance (Maeda2013Angiotensin).

In kidney aging, AGTRAP deficiency exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, contributing to renal fibrosis and a shortened lifespan in mice (Uneda2017Angiotensin). These findings suggest that AGTRAP is crucial in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing disease progression.

## Interactions
AGTRAP, also known as ATRAP, is known to interact with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This interaction is crucial for modulating angiotensin II signaling. AGTRAP is a transmembrane protein that affects the signaling pathways of AT1R by decreasing the generation of inositol lipids and reducing transcriptional activity and cell proliferation (LopezIlasaca2003The). The interaction between AGTRAP and AT1R involves the C-terminal domain of AGTRAP, specifically the amino acid residues 110-120, which are essential for its binding to the receptor (LopezIlasaca2003The).

AGTRAP also interacts with the transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), promoting its internalization and reducing its cell-surface expression. This interaction is linked to decreased cellular iron levels and oxidative stress signaling, suggesting a role in iron metabolism and oxidative stress response (Abe2022Angiotensin). The interaction with TfR1 is proposed to be direct, although further research is needed to confirm this (Abe2022Angiotensin).

These interactions highlight AGTRAP's role in modulating receptor function and influencing cellular processes related to cardiovascular and renal functions.
