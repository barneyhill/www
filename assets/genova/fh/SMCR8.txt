# SMCR8

## Overview
SMCR8 is a gene that encodes the SMCR8-C9orf72 complex subunit, a protein integral to cellular processes such as autophagy and lysosomal function. The SMCR8 protein is a component of the C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex, which is involved in the regulation of autophagy initiation and lysosomal homeostasis. It contains several domains, including uDenn, cDenn, and dDenn, which are structurally similar to those in the FLCN protein, and it functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases (Yang2016A; Nörpel2021Structure). SMCR8 plays a critical role in modulating signaling pathways such as AKT and MTORC1, and it is involved in the regulation of ULK1 kinase activity, which is essential for autophagy initiation (Jung2017Multiplex; Lan2019SMCR8). Mutations or dysregulation of SMCR8 are associated with various diseases, including autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Zhang2018The; Goodier2020C9orf72associated).

## Structure
The SMCR8 protein is a component of the C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex, which plays a role in autophagy and lysosomal function. The primary structure of SMCR8 includes several domains: uDenn, cDenn, and dDenn, which are similar to those found in the FLCN protein but have distinct orientations (Nörpel2021Structure). The secondary structure of SMCR8 features a coiled-coil region within its uDenn domain, which serves as a protein binding platform and influences the activity of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex (Nörpel2021Structure).

The tertiary structure of SMCR8 involves the DENN domain, which is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, such as WDR41, via its C-terminal helix (Tang2020CryoEM). The quaternary structure of the SMCR8 protein is characterized by its role in the dimerization of the C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex, where it interacts with the C-terminal tail of C9orf72 (Tang2020CryoEM). SMCR8 also contains a critical residue, Arg147, which is essential for its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity (Tang2020CryoEM). The interaction of SMCR8 with the FEM1B receptor, part of the Cullin-RING E3 ligase complex, involves the recognition of a C-degron in an SMCR8 isoform, highlighting its role in protein degradation pathways (Zhao2021Structural).

## Function
The SMCR8 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating autophagy and lysosomal homeostasis in human cells. SMCR8 is part of a complex with C9orf72 and WDR41, which is essential for the proper induction and maturation of autophagosomes, structures that sequester and degrade cellular components (Jung2017Multiplex; Yang2016A). In healthy cells, SMCR8 acts as a negative regulator of the AKT and MTORC1 signaling pathways, which are important for lysosome biogenesis and tissue homeostasis. SMCR8 deficiency leads to increased activity of these pathways, resulting in impaired nuclear localization of TFEB, a transcription factor critical for lysosomal biogenesis (Lan2019SMCR8).

SMCR8 also regulates ULK1, a key protein in autophagy initiation, by modulating its kinase activity and gene expression. It associates with chromatin at the ULK1 gene locus, influencing ULK1 mRNA levels and protein abundance (Jung2017Multiplex). SMCR8's role extends to lysosomal exocytosis, where it acts as a negative regulator, preventing excessive secretion of lysosomal proteins and maintaining immune regulation (Zhang2018The). These functions highlight SMCR8's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing pathological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SMCR8 gene are associated with several diseases, particularly autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Loss-of-function mutations in SMCR8 lead to enhanced lysosomal exocytosis and autoimmune phenotypes, similar to those observed in C9orf72 mutants. This suggests that the SMCR8-C9orf72 complex plays a role in suppressing autoimmunity, and its dysfunction may contribute to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (Zhang2018The).

In mice, SMCR8 mutations result in increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, characterized by severe symptoms such as weight loss and intestinal bleeding. This indicates that SMCR8 functions in hematopoietic cells to protect against colitis (McAlpine2018Excessive). SMCR8 deficiency also leads to excessive endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, contributing to inflammatory diseases through prolonged ligand-receptor interactions and impaired lysosomal function (McAlpine2018Excessive).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, SMCR8 is implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations in SMCR8, along with C9orf72, are linked to these conditions, with SMCR8 potentially serving as a biomarker for C9orf72 expansion-related diseases (Goodier2020C9orf72associated).

## Interactions
SMCR8 is a protein that forms a complex with C9orf72 and WDR41, playing a significant role in autophagy and lysosomal function. This complex is involved in the regulation of autophagy initiation through interactions with the ULK1 complex, which includes FIP200, ATG13, and ATG101 (Yang2016A; Sullivan2016The). SMCR8 interacts with various Rab GTPases, including RAB39B, and functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAB39B, promoting GDP release (Yang2016A). 

The SMCR8 protein also interacts with components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, including E3 ubiquitin ligases like STUB1 and HUWE1, which are involved in autophagy regulation (Goodier2020C9orf72associated). SMCR8 is associated with the ATG8 autophagy receptor network and influences the ULK1-RB1CC1-ATG13-ATG101 autophagy initiation complex (Goodier2020C9orf72associated). 

The coiled-coil region of SMCR8 serves as a protein binding platform, influencing interactions with proteins such as FIP200 and WDR41, which are involved in autophagy and lysosomal localization (Nörpel2021Structure). SMCR8's interaction with stress granules is noted, although C9orf72 does not consistently enter these granules (Goodier2020C9orf72associated).
