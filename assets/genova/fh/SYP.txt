# SYP

## Overview
The SYP gene encodes synaptophysin, a transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly found in the presynaptic vesicles of neurons. Synaptophysin plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release, functioning as an integral component of the synaptic vesicle membrane. It forms a hexameric structure that interacts with synaptobrevin (VAMP2), facilitating synaptic vesicle fusion and recycling (Adams2015Architecture; White2021Room). The protein's interactions with other synaptic proteins underscore its importance in maintaining synaptic function and plasticity. Alterations in the SYP gene have been linked to various neurological and psychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia (Liu2013Association; Gao2014Interactions).

## Structure
Synaptophysin (SYP) is a membrane glycoprotein predominantly located in presynaptic vesicles of neurons. It is composed of 313 amino acids and features four transmembrane domains, contributing to its integral membrane protein nature (White2021Room). The protein forms a hexameric structure, which resembles a channel pore, and is involved in the formation of a hexameric ring complex with synaptobrevin (VAMP2) dimers (Adams2015Architecture). This hexameric assembly is crucial for its role in synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release (Adams2015Architecture).

The quaternary structure of synaptophysin includes its interaction with VAMP2, forming a cholesterol-dependent 2:1 complex, where synaptophysin exists as a homo-hexamer and VAMP2 as a dimer (Adams2015Architecture). Synaptophysin is also known to interact with the V-ATPase complex in synaptic vesicles, although it does not significantly alter the V-ATPase conformation (Wang2024Structure).

Post-translational modifications of synaptophysin include glycosylation, which is essential for its function in synaptic vesicle trafficking (Wang2024Structure). These structural features and interactions highlight synaptophysin's role in synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release.

## Function
Synaptophysin (SYP) is a key protein involved in the trafficking and retrieval of synaptobrevin-2 (Syb2) at the presynapse, playing a crucial role in synaptic vesicle (SV) cycling. It ensures the efficient retrieval of Syb2 during SV endocytosis, which is essential for maintaining neurotransmitter release during repeated neuronal activity (Cousin2021Synaptophysin‐dependent; Kokotos2019Synaptophysin). SYP facilitates the transition of Syb2 from a trans-SNARE to a cis-SNARE complex, preventing futile complex formation and clustering for retrieval (Cousin2021Synaptophysin‐dependent). 

SYP is also involved in maintaining synaptic vesicle fusion events, particularly under conditions of sustained neuronal activity. It preserves Syb2 levels at nerve terminals, which is critical for sustaining neurotransmitter release (Kokotos2019Synaptophysin). The protein's role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis is highlighted by its ability to regulate the kinetics of this process, ensuring efficient synaptic function and neurotransmission (Kwon2011Synaptophysin). 

In addition to its role in vesicle trafficking, SYP is implicated in synapse formation, particularly in environments where neurons of different genotypes interact, suggesting a context-dependent role in synaptic plasticity (Tarsa2002Synaptophysin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SYP gene, which encodes synaptophysin, have been associated with several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Synaptophysin is crucial for synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and its dysfunction can impact neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Studies have linked SYP to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), particularly the inattentive subtype (ADHD-I), in Chinese Han subjects. Genetic variants of SYP may influence the formation of the synaptophysin/synaptobrevin complex, affecting neurotransmitter release and contributing to ADHD symptoms (Liu2013Association).

Research has also explored the interaction between SYP and the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, suggesting that these interactions may be significant in the etiology of ADHD, especially in females. This gene-gene interaction highlights the potential for SYP to contribute to gender-specific differences in ADHD prevalence and symptoms (Gao2014Interactions).

Beyond ADHD, synaptophysin has been implicated in other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, due to its role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and synaptic membrane integrity. Alterations in synaptophysin levels may affect synaptic density and are considered a proxy for synaptic alterations in these disorders (Liu2013Association; Gao2014Interactions).

## Interactions
Synaptophysin (SYP) is a key protein involved in synaptic vesicle function, interacting with various proteins to facilitate neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle trafficking. SYP forms a complex with synaptobrevin-2 (SYB2), a crucial interaction for synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. This interaction is mediated through both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, with the SYP C-terminus playing a significant role in SYB2 trafficking (Cousin2021Synaptophysin‐dependent; Harper2021Synaptophysin). The SYP/SYB2 complex is sensitive to ionic strength and cholesterol content, indicating that these factors influence the stability and formation of the complex (Edelmann1995Synaptobrevin; Mitter2002The).

SYP also interacts with other proteins such as synaptogyrin3 (SYNGR3), phospholipase D4 (PLD4), stathmin-like 3 (STMN3), Rho family GTPase 2 (RND2), and ADP-ribosylation factor interacting protein 2 (Arfaptin2). These interactions are crucial for its role as a multi-user platform in synaptic vesicle cycling (Felkl2008Interaction). The interaction with STMN3 is particularly notable due to its potential role in synaptic plasticity (Felkl2008Interaction). SYP's ability to form a hexameric complex with VAMP2 suggests a structural role in organizing synaptic vesicle components for efficient neurotransmitter release (Adams2015Architecture).
