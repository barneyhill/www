# PLOD2

## Overview
PLOD2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2, which is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of collagen by hydroxylating lysine residues, a process essential for the formation of stable collagen cross-links. These cross-links are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix, impacting tissue strength and resilience (RosellGarcía2019A; Gjaltema2016Molecular). PLOD2 is involved in various physiological processes, including bone mineralization and connective tissue maintenance, and is regulated by factors such as hypoxia and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (RosellGarcía2019A). The enzyme's activity is significant in pathological conditions, including fibrosis and cancer metastasis, where it influences cellular motility and extracellular matrix remodeling (Ueki2020PLOD2; Xu2017Hypoxia). Mutations in the PLOD2 gene are associated with disorders such as Bruck syndrome, highlighting its clinical relevance in connective tissue diseases (PuigHervás2012Mutations).

## Structure
The PLOD2 gene encodes the enzyme procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2, which plays a crucial role in collagen biosynthesis by hydroxylating lysine residues in collagen telopeptides. This post-translational modification is essential for forming stable cross-links in collagen, impacting the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix (RosellGarcía2019A). The enzyme is a member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family and contains a conserved catalytic domain necessary for its enzymatic activity (RosellGarcía2019A).

PLOD2 may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and regulation (RosellGarcía2019A). The enzyme's activity is regulated by factors such as hypoxia and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which induce its expression through specific binding sites on the PLOD2 promoter (RosellGarcía2019A). These regulatory mechanisms highlight the enzyme's role in adapting to environmental changes and its involvement in pathological conditions like fibrosis and cancer metastasis (RosellGarcía2019A).

The structural details of PLOD2, including its primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, are not explicitly detailed in the available context. However, the enzyme's function and regulation are closely linked to its structural features, which are critical for its role in collagen modification and extracellular matrix stability.

## Function
The PLOD2 gene encodes lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2), an enzyme crucial for collagen biosynthesis. LH2 is responsible for the hydroxylation of lysine residues in the telopeptide regions of collagen, a modification essential for the formation of stable collagen cross-links. These cross-links are vital for maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical properties of tissues, particularly in the extracellular matrix of bone and other connective tissues (Qi2018Roles; Gjaltema2016Molecular).

In healthy human cells, PLOD2 activity is integral to collagen maturation and stabilization, ensuring proper collagen cross-linking and deposition. This process is necessary for tissue strength and resilience, contributing to normal tissue development and maintenance (Qi2018Roles). The enzyme is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it facilitates the hydroxylation of lysyl residues, a precursor step in the formation of hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links (PuigHervás2012Mutations).

PLOD2 expression is particularly significant during the mineralization stage of osteoblastic differentiation, where it contributes to the formation of hydroxylysine-aldehyde-derived collagen cross-links, which are predominant in skeletal tissues (Uzawa1999Differential). This function underscores its role in modulating bone mineralization processes and maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLOD2 gene are associated with Bruck syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone fragility and joint contractures. Bruck syndrome is genetically heterogeneous, involving mutations in PLOD2, which encodes lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2), an enzyme crucial for collagen cross-linking. These mutations lead to insufficient hydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen, resulting in decreased bone strength and increased fracture risk (PuigHervás2012Mutations; Wang2022Genetic). 

PLOD2 mutations can cause a range of phenotypes from Bruck syndrome to autosomal-recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (AR-OI), highlighting the genetic heterogeneity and phenotype-genotype correlation in these conditions (PuigHervás2012Mutations). Specific mutations, such as c.1559dupC and a homozygous G>A transition in the donor splice site of intron 12, have been identified as pathogenic, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and affecting collagen stability (PuigHervás2012Mutations).

Alterations in PLOD2 expression are also linked to fibrotic conditions, where increased PLOD2 mRNA levels correlate with higher pyridinoline cross-links in the extracellular matrix, contributing to collagen accumulation and fibrosis (van2003Identification). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PLOD2 in connective tissue disorders and fibrotic diseases.

## Interactions
PLOD2, also known as procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2, is involved in several critical interactions that influence cancer cell behavior and collagen modification. PLOD2 interacts with integrin β1, a major integrin family molecule, stabilizing and activating it through hydroxylation. This interaction enhances cellular motility and is crucial for the invasion and metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (Ueki2020PLOD2). PLOD2's hydroxylase activity is essential for the stability and membrane localization of integrin β1, which is necessary for cancer cell motility (Ueki2020PLOD2).

In cervical cancer, PLOD2 affects cell adhesion and motility through a FAK-dependent mechanism, influencing the formation of focal adhesions and the activation of integrins via the phosphorylation of FAK (Xu2017Hypoxia). PLOD2 also plays a role in collagen cross-linking within tumors, which is crucial for tumor stiffness and metastasis. It is essential for collagen fiber formation in hypoxic regions of tumors, affecting the biophysical properties of the extracellular matrix and promoting local invasion and metastasis (Gilkes2013Procollagen). These interactions highlight PLOD2's significant role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
