# GEMIN6

## Overview
GEMIN6 is a gene that encodes the gem nuclear organelle associated protein 6, a component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex. This protein is integral to the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which are essential for the spliceosome's role in pre-mRNA splicing. As a part of the SMN complex, gem nuclear organelle associated protein 6 is involved in the cytoplasmic assembly of spliceosomal uridine-rich snRNPs (UsnRNPs), a critical process for cellular function (Cauchi2010SMN). The protein is categorized as a scaffolding intermediate, facilitating the maturation of snRNPs and playing a role in RNA transport and processing within cells (Meier2018Gemin4is). Its interactions within the SMN complex, particularly through forming a heterodimer with GEMIN7, underscore its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and function of this complex (Cauchi2010SMN).

## Function
GEMIN6 is a component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex, which plays a crucial role in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), essential for the spliceosome's function in pre-mRNA splicing. The SMN complex, including GEMIN6, is involved in the cytoplasmic assembly of spliceosomal uridine-rich snRNPs (UsnRNPs), a critical housekeeping process in all cells (Cauchi2010SMN). GEMIN6, along with other Gemin proteins, is efficiently targeted to SMN granules in neurites, indicating its involvement in intracellular transport processes, potentially related to RNA transport or processing (Todd2010SMN). 

In healthy human cells, GEMIN6 is hypothesized to act as a scaffolding intermediate during the assembly of the Sm core, which is crucial for the maturation of snRNPs (Meier2018Gemin4is). The presence of GEMIN6 in both stationary and transport granules within neurites suggests its active role in the dynamic processes of RNA transport and cellular component distribution, which are vital for maintaining neuronal function (Todd2010SMN). While specific functions of GEMIN6 in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in these fundamental processes underscores its importance in cellular and organismal biology.

## Interactions
GEMIN6 is a component of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex, which is essential for the assembly of spliceosomal uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (UsnRNPs). Within this complex, GEMIN6 forms a heterodimer with GEMIN7, which is thought to resemble Sm core protein dimers, although they lack significant sequence similarity with Sm proteins (Cauchi2010SMN). This heterodimer is involved in the arrangement of Sm hetero-oligomers, facilitating their transfer from the pICln-Sm protein complex (Cauchi2010SMN).

GEMIN6 interacts weakly with SMN, likely due to auto-activation rather than true binding, and its interactions within the SMN complex are mediated through other Gemin proteins, particularly GEMIN8 (Otter2007A). GEMIN8 acts as a bridge, linking the GEMIN6-GEMIN7-UNRIP trimer to the rest of the SMN complex. The absence of GEMIN8 results in the loss of association of GEMIN6, GEMIN7, and UNRIP with the complex, highlighting the critical role of GEMIN8 in maintaining these interactions (Otter2007A).

In Drosophila, the orthologue of GEMIN6, known as Hezron, also interacts strongly with the orthologue of GEMIN7, Sabbat, indicating a conserved interaction pattern across species (Lanfranco2017Novel).
