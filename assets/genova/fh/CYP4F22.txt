# CYP4F22

## Overview
CYP4F22 is a gene that encodes the protein cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily F member 22, which is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This protein is categorized as a type I endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein and plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of ultra-long-chain fatty acids (ULCFAs) through omega-hydroxylation, a critical step in the synthesis of acylceramide. Acylceramide is essential for the formation of the skin's permeability barrier, which is crucial for maintaining skin integrity and function (Ohno2015Essential). Mutations in the CYP4F22 gene are linked to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a group of genetic disorders characterized by impaired skin barrier function, leading to conditions such as lamellar ichthyosis and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (EsperónMoldes2020Novel; Ohno2015Essential). The protein's proper localization and function within the endoplasmic reticulum are essential for its enzymatic activity and the maintenance of healthy skin (Ohno2015Essential).

## Structure
The CYP4F22 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which is involved in the metabolism of various substrates. It is a type I endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, with its N terminus oriented towards the ER lumen and the C-terminal domain facing the cytosolic side, which is essential for its function in ω-hydroxyceramide synthesis (Ohno2015Essential). The protein is involved in the ω-hydroxylation of ultra-long-chain fatty acids, a critical step in acylceramide production, which is essential for epidermal barrier formation (Ohno2015Essential).

The CYP4F22 protein includes a highly hydrophobic region at the N terminus, necessary for its anchoring to the ER membrane, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Ohno2015Essential). The protein's structure is characterized by a conserved threonine in helix I, similar to other human CYP structures, which is important for protein delivery and catalytic function (Kumar2011Molecular). Mutations in the CYP4F22 gene can lead to alterations in the protein's 3D structure, affecting its function and leading to conditions such as autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (EsperónMoldes2020Novel).

## Function
CYP4F22 is a crucial enzyme in the cytochrome P450 family, primarily involved in the metabolism of ultra-long-chain fatty acids (ULCFAs) through omega-hydroxylation. This process is essential for the production of acylceramide, a key lipid necessary for the formation of the skin permeability barrier (Ohno2015Essential). The enzyme specifically hydroxylates ULCFAs with chain lengths of C28 and greater, but not very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) with chain lengths of C22 and C24 (Ohno2015Essential). 

CYP4F22 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where its activity is dependent on NADPH. It converts ULCFA-CoAs to ULCFAs before omega-hydroxylation, and the resulting omega-hydroxy-ULCFA is further processed by an acyl-CoA synthetase, potentially ACSVL4/FATP4, to form omega-hydroxy-ULCFA-CoA (Ohno2015Essential). This enzyme's function is critical for maintaining the epidermal barrier, and its impairment can lead to skin disorders such as ichthyosis, characterized by dry, scaly skin (Ohno2015Essential). The proper anchoring of CYP4F22 to the ER membrane is essential for its activity in producing omega-hydroxyceramide, a precursor for acylceramide (Ohno2015Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYP4F22 gene are associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a group of rare genetic disorders affecting skin keratinization. These mutations lead to conditions such as lamellar ichthyosis (LI) and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE), characterized by dry, thickened, and scaly skin due to impaired skin barrier function (EsperónMoldes2020Novel; Ohno2015Essential). The gene is crucial for the production of acylceramide, a lipid essential for skin permeability barrier formation. Mutations result in decreased ω-hydroxylase activity, leading to reduced acylceramide levels and compromised skin barrier integrity (Ohno2015Essential).

Specific mutations, such as c.1303C>T (p.His435Tyr), have been identified as founder mutations in certain populations, indicating a common ancestral origin (EsperónMoldes2020Novel). Clinical manifestations of CYP4F22 mutations include palmoplantar keratoderma, ectropion, and nail dystrophy, with some patients presenting with a collodion membrane at birth (Mohamad2021Molecular). The severity of ichthyosis varies, with some patients exhibiting mild symptoms and others experiencing more severe phenotypes (Diociaiuti2024CrossSectional). The genetic and phenotypic diversity of CYP4F22 mutations underscores the complexity of ARCI and its clinical management.
