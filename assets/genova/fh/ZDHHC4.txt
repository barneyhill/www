# ZDHHC4

## Overview
ZDHHC4 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 4, which is a member of the DHHC family of palmitoyltransferases. This protein is primarily involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through palmitoylation, a process that attaches palmitate to specific cysteine residues, thereby influencing protein localization, stability, and function. As a palmitoyltransferase, ZDHHC4 plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and membrane trafficking, by facilitating the attachment of proteins to cellular membranes. The protein is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus, where it regulates the intracellular distribution of proteins, contributing to cellular homeostasis and communication (CanteroRecasens2020Palmitoylation; Liao2024The). ZDHHC4's expression across different cell types underscores its importance in maintaining the structural integrity and functionality of proteins involved in essential cellular pathways (Wild2023CellPalmSeq:).

## Function
ZDHHC4 is a palmitoyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through palmitoylation, a process that involves the addition of palmitate, a fatty acid, to specific cysteine residues on target proteins. This modification affects protein localization, stability, and function, influencing various cellular processes such as signal transduction and membrane trafficking (Liao2024The). ZDHHC4 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the palmitoylation of proteins, thereby regulating their attachment to cellular membranes and influencing their intracellular distribution (CanteroRecasens2020Palmitoylation).

In healthy human cells, ZDHHC4 is expressed across various cell types, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular functions. The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and proper functioning of proteins involved in critical cellular pathways (Wild2023CellPalmSeq:). The palmitoylation process mediated by ZDHHC4 is vital for the recruitment and localization of proteins to specific cellular compartments, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating effective cellular communication (CanteroRecasens2020Palmitoylation).

## Clinical Significance
ZDHHC4 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In glioblastoma, ZDHHC4 mediates the palmitoylation of GSK3β, which enhances the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma stem cells and contributes to temozolomide resistance through the EZH2-STAT3 signaling axis. High expression levels of ZDHHC4 in glioblastoma are associated with higher tumor grades and poorer patient prognosis, suggesting its role as an unfavorable prognostic factor. Targeting ZDHHC4-mediated palmitoylation of GSK3β may offer new therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance and prevent tumor recurrence in glioblastoma (Zhao2022GSK3β).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ZDHHC4 is upregulated and associated with shorter overall survival. Its expression correlates with immune checkpoint-related genes and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. High ZDHHC4 expression is linked to smoking and lymph node metastasis, and alterations in its gene, such as amplification, are observed in a subset of LUAD cases. These findings suggest that ZDHHC4 may play a role in LUAD progression and could be a target for therapeutic intervention (Bian2024Identification).
