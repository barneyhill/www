# BRCC3

## Overview
BRCC3 is a gene that encodes the protein BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3, a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a pivotal role in DNA repair and immune regulation. The protein is a member of the Zn2+ dependent JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM) domain metalloprotease family, which is characterized by its ability to cleave lysine-63-linked ubiquitin chains (Meyer2019Functional). BRCC3 is integral to the BRCA1-A complex, where it collaborates with other proteins to facilitate the repair of DNA double-strand breaks, and is also a component of the BRISC complex, which is involved in immune signaling (Rabl2019Structural). The gene's mutations are linked to various clinical conditions, including syndromic moyamoya disease and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in critical cellular pathways (Meyer2019Functional; Miskinyte2011Loss).

## Structure
BRCC3, also known as BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in DNA repair and immune regulation. It is a member of the Zn2+ dependent JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM) domain metalloprotease family, which is characterized by its catalytic activity on lysine-63-linked ubiquitin chains (Meyer2019Functional). The protein contains an MPN domain, which is essential for its catalytic function (Rabl2019Structural).

BRCC3 is part of the BRCA1-A complex, where it interacts with other proteins such as ABRAXAS, BRE, MERIT40, and RAP80, forming a heteropentameric structure (Rabl2019Structural). The BRCA1-A complex has an arc-shaped quaternary structure, with BRCC3 and ABRAXAS forming the central part of the arc (Rabl2019Structural). This structural arrangement is crucial for its role in DNA repair, as it provides a scaffold for ubiquitin binding (Rabl2019Structural).

BRCC3 is also a component of the BRISC complex, where it is associated with proteins like ABRO1 and SHMT2. The BRISC complex shares a similar arc-shaped structure and is involved in immune signaling (Rabl2019Structural). The interaction with SHMT2a, which inhibits BRISC activity, highlights the regulatory mechanisms involving BRCC3 in cellular processes (Rabl2019Structural).

## Function
BRCC3, also known as BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3, is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a critical role in several cellular processes. It is a component of the BRCA-DNA repair complex and is involved in the regulation of lysine 63-linked ubiquitination (K63Ub), which is crucial for DNA repair and oligodendrocyte differentiation (Wang2019BRCA1BRCA2‐containing). In the context of DNA repair, BRCC3 functions within the BRCA1-A complex, where it facilitates the repair of double-strand breaks by deubiquitinating K63-linked ubiquitinated histones at DNA lesion sites, thereby aiding in the recruitment of DNA repair proteins (Wang2019BRCA1BRCA2‐containing).

In oligodendrocytes, BRCC3 regulates the balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination, which is essential for the trafficking and homeostasis of myelin proteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP). This regulation is vital for proper oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation (Wang2019BRCA1BRCA2‐containing). BRCC3 is also involved in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, where it deubiquitinates the NLRP3 protein, a process necessary for inflammasome activation and the subsequent inflammatory response (Py2013Deubiquitination). These functions highlight BRCC3's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its involvement in critical cellular pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BRCC3 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably syndromic moyamoya disease and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In syndromic moyamoya, BRCC3 mutations lead to progressive stenosis of cerebral arteries, resulting in ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. This condition is characterized by a range of symptoms, including short stature, facial dysmorphism, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and cardiovascular issues such as hypertension and dilated cardiomyopathy (Miskinyte2011Loss). The loss of BRCC3 function is linked to abnormal angiogenesis, as demonstrated in zebrafish models where BRCC3 knockdown resulted in defective vascular development (Miskinyte2011Loss).

In AML, particularly cases with the t(8;21)(q22;q22.1) translocation, BRCC3 mutations are recurrent and associated with a favorable prognosis. These mutations impair DNA damage repair and alter cytokine signaling, which increases sensitivity to chemotherapy, leading to improved treatment outcomes (Meyer2019Functional). The mutations are often located in the catalytically active MPN+ domain and are predicted to be deleterious (Meyer2019Functional). Despite their role in promoting cell proliferation, BRCC3 mutations in AML are considered secondary events rather than initiating mutations (Meyer2019Functional).

## Interactions
BRCC3, also known as BRCA1/BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in DNA repair and immune regulation. BRCC3 is a component of the BRCA1-A complex, where it interacts with proteins such as ABRAXAS, BRE, MERIT40, and RAP80. This complex plays a role in DNA damage response by sequestering BRCA1 away from damage sites, a process facilitated by RAP80's binding to ubiquitin-SUMO chains (Hu2011NBA1MERIT40; Rabl2019Structural).

BRCC3 also forms part of the BRISC complex, which includes ABRO1, MERIT40, and BRE. In this complex, ABRO1 acts as a scaffold, facilitating BRCC3's deubiquitinating activity, which is specific for lysine-63-linked ubiquitin chains (Cooper2009K63specific; Zhang2020ABRO1). The interaction with ABRO1 is crucial for stabilizing BRCC3 by inhibiting its degradation mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2 (Zhang2020ABRO1).

BRCC3's interaction with WWP2 leads to its ubiquitination and degradation, but this is inhibited by ABRO1, which competes for binding to BRCC3's MPN domain (Zhang2020ABRO1). These interactions highlight BRCC3's role in maintaining protein stability and regulating ubiquitination processes.
