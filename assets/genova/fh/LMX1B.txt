# LMX1B

## Overview
LMX1B is a gene that encodes the LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 beta, a critical protein involved in various developmental and physiological processes. As a transcription factor, LMX1B plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression, particularly in the differentiation and function of podocytes in the kidney, where it is essential for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier (Miner2002Transcriptional). Beyond its renal functions, LMX1B is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, limbs, and eyes, where it contributes to cell-type specification and development (Rascle2009The). The protein interacts with several other proteins and transcription factors, such as NF-κB, to modulate immune responses and other cellular processes (Rascle2009The). Mutations in the LMX1B gene are linked to hereditary conditions like Nail-Patella Syndrome and LMX1B-associated nephropathy, highlighting its clinical significance (Lei2020Myelin).

## Structure


## Function
The LMX1B gene encodes a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor that plays a critical role in the differentiation and function of podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney's glomerulus. In healthy cells, LMX1B regulates the expression of genes necessary for podocyte development, including CD2AP and NPHS2 (podocin), which are essential for the formation of foot processes and slit diaphragms, crucial components of the kidney's filtration barrier (Miner2002Transcriptional). LMX1B also influences the expression of glomerular basement membrane collagens, such as COL4A3 and COL4A4, maintaining the structural integrity of the filtration barrier (Miner2002Transcriptional).

Beyond the kidney, LMX1B is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, developing limb, and eye, where it is involved in cell-type specification during development (Rascle2009The). It regulates a subset of NF-κB target genes, such as IL-6 and IL-8, in cooperation with nuclear p50/p65 NF-κB, indicating its role in modulating immune responses (Rascle2009The). LMX1B's function varies depending on the cellular context, acting as both a transcriptional activator and repressor, influenced by the presence of specific cofactors (Rascle2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LMX1B gene are associated with several hereditary kidney diseases, most notably Nail-Patella Syndrome (NPS) and LMX1B-associated nephropathy (LAN). NPS is characterized by dysplastic nails, hypoplastic patellae, and iliac horns, with nephropathy affecting 30 to 50% of patients. LAN presents similar nephropathy but lacks extrarenal manifestations. Both conditions follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and are linked to heterozygous inactivating mutations in the LMX1B gene (Rohr2002The; Lei2020Myelin).

The pathogenic mechanism of these conditions is often haploinsufficiency, leading to reduced transcriptional and functional activity of mutant proteins. Mutations in the homeodomain of LMX1B are more frequently associated with heavier proteinuria and isolated nephropathy (LAN) (Lei2020Myelin). The LMX1B R246Q mutation, in particular, has been associated with a renal-limited disease that can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in adulthood (Konomoto2016Clinical).

Histological findings in LMX1B-associated nephropathy can include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and unique electron microscopic findings, such as irregular thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and distinctive collagen fibrils (Shimohata2021LMX1Bassociated; Lei2020Myelin).

## Interactions
LMX1B is known to participate in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. It forms a protein complex with Paraspeckle protein 1 (PSPC1) and Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein-associated Splicing Factor (PSF), creating a 230 kDa complex identified both in vitro and in vivo. This complex is thought to be part of the Nurr1 transcriptional complex, which is essential for the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (Hoekstra2013LMX1B).

LMX1B also interacts with NF-κB target genes, enhancing their expression by binding to their promoters. This interaction is facilitated through cooperation with the NF-κB transcription factor, specifically the p50/p65 subunits, although no direct physical interaction between LMX1B and NF-κB proteins has been detected. Instead, LMX1B's role appears to be at the chromatin level, where it enhances NF-κB DNA association (Rascle2009The).

Additionally, LMX1B has been shown to interact with other proteins such as Glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding factor 1 (GRLF1), Myosin 1c (MYO1C), and Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes beyond transcriptional regulation (Hoekstra2013LMX1B).
