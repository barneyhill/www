# DOK5

## Overview
DOK5 is a gene that encodes the protein docking protein 5, a member of the DOK family of intracellular adaptors involved in signal transduction. Docking protein 5 is characterized by its pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which facilitate interactions with receptor tyrosine kinases and other signaling molecules, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways (Li2010Downstream; Grimm2001Novel). Predominantly expressed in the nervous system and skeletal muscle, DOK5 is implicated in neuronal differentiation and metabolic processes, including insulin signaling and cardiomyocyte differentiation (Tabassum2010Evaluation; Li2010Downstream). The protein's involvement in the MAP kinase pathway and its role as a substrate for receptors such as c-Ret and TrkB highlight its significance in developmental and metabolic pathways (Li2010Downstream; Grimm2001Novel). Given its functions, DOK5 is of interest in the study of conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, where its dysregulation may have clinical implications (Wen2009Dok5; Cai2003Two).

## Structure
DOK5, a member of the DOK family of proteins, is characterized by its structural domains that facilitate its role in signal transduction. The protein contains an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a central phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which are crucial for its interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases and other signaling molecules (Li2010Downstream; Grimm2001Novel). These domains are typical of multiadapter proteins and are involved in membrane localization and receptor interaction (Grimm2001Novel).

The C-terminal region of DOK5 is relatively short and contains fewer tyrosine residues compared to other DOK family members, which limits its interaction with certain proteins like rasGAP and Nck (Grimm2001Novel). Despite this, DOK5 is involved in the activation of the MAP kinase pathway, indicating its role in signal transduction (Grimm2001Novel).

DOK5 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions with other proteins (Tabassum2010Evaluation). The protein is expressed predominantly in the nervous system and skeletal muscle, where it plays a role in neuronal differentiation and metabolic processes (Tabassum2010Evaluation; Li2010Downstream).

## Function
DOK5 (docking protein 5) is a member of the DOK family of intracellular adaptors involved in signal transduction, primarily functioning in the downstream signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases. In healthy human cells, DOK5 plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation by acting as a substrate for the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase. It is involved in mediating neuronal differentiation and axonal outgrowth, particularly in tissues where it is coexpressed with c-Ret, such as the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. DOK5 enhances c-Ret-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is crucial for processes like embryogenesis and the development of the enteric nervous system (Grimm2001Novel).

DOK5 is also involved in insulin signaling, where it is phosphorylated in response to insulin and IGF1, suggesting a role in metabolic homeostasis, particularly in skeletal muscle. This function makes DOK5 a candidate for involvement in conditions like type 2 diabetes and obesity, which are closely linked to insulin signaling pathways (Tabassum2010Evaluation).

In cardiomyocytes, DOK5 is involved in differentiation through the PI3K/PKB/FOXO3a signaling pathway, where it is negatively regulated by FOXO3a. This regulation is crucial for heart development and function (Wen2009Dok5).

## Clinical Significance
DOK5, also known as IRS-6, is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in insulin signaling and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Alterations in DOK5 expression have been associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, as it is involved in glucose metabolism. DOK5 is highly expressed in muscle tissue, which is crucial for glucose uptake, and its phosphorylation kinetics differ from other insulin receptor substrates, potentially impacting insulin signaling pathways (Cai2003Two).

In the context of cardiomyocyte differentiation, DOK5 is regulated by the PI3K/PKB/FOXO3a signaling pathway. Its expression is negatively regulated by the transcription factor FOXO3a, and changes in this regulation can affect heart development. Knockdown of DOK5 has been shown to attenuate cardiomyocyte differentiation, suggesting its critical role in heart tissue development (Wen2009Dok5).

While the direct link between DOK5 mutations and specific diseases is not extensively documented, its involvement in key signaling pathways suggests that dysregulation could contribute to metabolic disorders and cardiovascular conditions. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical implications of DOK5 alterations (Wen2009Dok5; Cai2003Two).

## Interactions
DOK5, a member of the docking protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in signal transduction pathways. DOK5 directly interacts with the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, a relationship that is phosphorylation-dependent, specifically requiring the phosphorylation of tyrosine 1062 on c-Ret. This interaction has been demonstrated through yeast two-hybrid screens, far Western blotting, and coimmunoprecipitation in vivo (Grimm2001Novel). DOK5 is also involved in mediating neuronal differentiation by promoting axonal outgrowth through the activation of the MAP kinase pathway, as evidenced by Erk1/2 phosphorylation. This interaction is specific to c-Ret, as DOK5 does not bind to other receptors such as Met, Kit, and TrkA (Grimm2001Novel).

In the context of insulin signaling, DOK5, also known as IRS6, is phosphorylated in response to insulin and IGF-1. However, it does not bind to SH2 domain proteins like RasGAP, Crk, Src, and Fyn, which are bound by IRS5/DOK4, indicating a distinct role in insulin signaling pathways (Cai2003Two). DOK5 is also a substrate for TrkB and TrkC receptors, contributing to neurotrophin-induced MAPK activation (Li2010Downstream).
