# ITGB2

## Overview
The ITGB2 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 2, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by forming part of the leukocyte integrins. These integrins are heterodimeric receptors composed of an alpha and a beta subunit, with ITGB2 specifically pairing with various alpha subunits to form integrins such as LFA-1, Mac-1, and CR4. These integrins are essential for leukocyte adhesion, migration, and immune response, as they mediate interactions with intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) and the extracellular matrix (Fagerholm2019Beta2Integrins; Altorki2021The). The ITGB2 protein's structure includes several domains that contribute to its function, including a transmembrane helical region and a cytoplasmic tail involved in intracellular signaling (Holmes2011Comparative). Mutations in the ITGB2 gene can lead to immunodeficiency disorders such as Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency type 1 (LAD1), underscoring its clinical significance (Teimourian2017Mutation; Nasir2024INTEGRIN).

## Structure
The ITGB2 protein, also known as integrin beta-2, has a complex molecular structure comprising several distinct domains. Its primary structure includes a signal peptide (residues 1-22), an extracellular integrin beta region (residues 32-447) with a potential cell attachment site (residues 397-399), and a region of cysteine-rich tandem repeats (residues 414-617) (Holmes2011Comparative). The secondary structure features a central hydrophobic core with coiled motifs at the ends, essential for the insertion of the N-terminal ends of beta-subunits into the cell membrane (Holmes2011Comparative). The tertiary structure includes an integrin beta tail domain (residues 622-700) and a transmembrane helical region (residues 701-723) that anchors ITGB2 to the cell membrane, with a cytoplasmic region (residues 724-768) involved in intracellular interactions (Holmes2011Comparative).

In terms of quaternary structure, integrins, including ITGB2, typically function as heterodimers, pairing with an alpha integrin subunit to form a functional receptor complex (Holmes2011Comparative). The ITGB2 protein also contains a plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain, a hybrid domain with an inserted β-I domain, four cysteine-rich epidermal growth factor (EGF) modules, and a β-tail domain (Anthis2011The). The β-I and α-I domains are similar to von Willebrand A domains, contributing to the protein's conformational flexibility, which is central to integrin function (Anthis2011The).

## Function
The ITGB2 gene encodes the integrin subunit beta 2, also known as CD18, which is a critical component of leukocyte integrins. These integrins are heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of an alpha and a beta subunit, playing a central role in cell-cell adhesion events. In healthy human cells, the beta 2 integrin (CD18) associates with one of four leukocyte integrin alpha subunits (CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, or CD11d) to form the antigens LFA-1, Mac-1, p150,95, and αDβ2, respectively (Kijas1999A). These integrins are essential for the proper functioning of the immune system, facilitating the adhesion and migration of leukocytes to sites of infection or injury (Kijas1999A).

Beta 2 integrins are involved in binding to intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), which is crucial for leukocyte adhesion and immune response. They mediate cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix and other cells, facilitating cell movement and stabilizing interactions (Altorki2021The). In particular, LFA-1 is involved in firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium and in T-cell priming, while Mac-1 functions as a major phagocytic receptor (Hogg1999A). These integrins must undergo activation to function properly, which involves conformational changes and clustering (Hogg1999A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ITGB2 gene, which encodes the integrin subunit beta 2, are primarily associated with Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency type 1 (LAD1), a rare autosomal recessive immunodeficiency disorder. LAD1 is characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, impaired wound healing, delayed umbilical cord separation, and leukocytosis due to impaired leukocyte adhesion and migration (Teimourian2017Mutation; Sun2019Report; Nasir2024INTEGRIN). The severity of LAD1 is linked to the level of CD18 expression, with less than 1% expression associated with severe forms and 3-10% with moderate forms (Teimourian2017Mutation).

Mutations in ITGB2 include nonsense, missense, splice site, and deletion mutations, often occurring in exons 5 to 9, which encode the β1 domain of ITGB2 (Zhang2019A; Nasir2024INTEGRIN). These mutations lead to reduced or absent expression of CD18, a critical component of β2 integrins, impairing leukocyte recruitment and immune response (Yaz2021Clinical; Deshpande2016Leukocyte). Novel mutations have been identified in various populations, indicating a diverse genetic basis for the disorder (Zhang2019A; Sun2019Report). Early diagnosis and treatment, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, are crucial for managing LAD1 (Yaz2021Clinical; Sun2019Report).

## Interactions
ITGB2, also known as CD18, is a critical component of beta2-integrins, which are involved in various immune functions, including leukocyte adhesion and migration. ITGB2 forms heterodimers with different alpha subunits, such as CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, and CD11d, resulting in integrins like LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), and CR4 (CD11c/CD18). These integrins interact with a range of ligands and proteins, facilitating immune cell trafficking and activation (Fagerholm2019Beta2Integrins).

LFA-1, which includes ITGB2, binds to intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) on antigen-presenting cells, forming the immunological synapse crucial for T cell activation. This interaction is stabilized by proteins such as talin and kindlin-3, which are essential for integrin activation and linking to the actin cytoskeleton (Fagerholm2019Beta2Integrins). 

ITGB2 also interacts with filamin A, which negatively regulates integrin functions, although it stabilizes platelet adhesion under shear flow (Fagerholm2019Beta2Integrins). Additionally, kindlin-3 is vital for ITGB2 activation, and mutations affecting this interaction can lead to leukocyte adhesion deficiencies (Fagerholm2019Beta2Integrins). These interactions highlight ITGB2's role in immune regulation and its potential implications in immunodeficiency diseases.
