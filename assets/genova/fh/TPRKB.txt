# TPRKB

## Overview
TPRKB is a gene that encodes the TP53RK binding protein, a crucial component of the human EKC/KEOPS complex, which is involved in tRNA modification processes. The protein plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of threonyl-carbamoyl adenosine (t6A), a modification essential for accurate protein translation. Structurally, TP53RK binding protein is characterized by a central four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices, facilitating its interaction with other proteins within the KEOPS complex, such as PRPK. This interaction is vital for the complex's function in cellular processes, including cell proliferation, DNA damage response, and protein synthesis. TPRKB is implicated in various cellular functions and has been associated with clinical conditions such as Galloway-Mowat syndrome and certain cancers, where it presents as a potential therapeutic target (Goswami2019Identification; Braun2017Mutations; Li2021Crystal).

## Structure
The TPRKB protein, also known as TP53RK-binding protein, is a component of the human EKC/KEOPS complex, which plays a crucial role in tRNA modification. Structurally, TPRKB features a central four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by two and seven α-helices on either side. This configuration allows TPRKB to interact with the N-lobe of PRPK, utilizing helices α2, α8, and α9, as well as the loop between β1-β2 (Li2021Crystal). The interaction between TPRKB and PRPK is characterized by a significant interface area of 1423 Å, involving conserved residues and various interactions such as hydrogen bonds, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions (Li2021Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, TPRKB forms a complex with PRPK, and this interaction is essential for the function of the KEOPS complex. The TPRKB protein's structure is similar to the archaeal and yeast Bud31-Cgi121 structures but possesses unique features that distinguish it from these homologs (Li2021Crystal). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function within the complex (Wan2016Proteomic). These structural insights are critical for understanding the role of TPRKB in cellular processes and its potential implications in diseases.

## Function
The TPRKB gene encodes a protein that is a component of the human EKC/KEOPS complex, which plays a crucial role in tRNA modification, specifically the threonyl-carbamoyl adenosine (t6A) modification. This modification is essential for strengthening the A-U codon-anticodon interaction on the ribosome, thereby ensuring accurate protein translation (Li2021Crystal). The KEOPS complex, including TPRKB, is involved in various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, DNA damage response, and protein synthesis. In human cells, TPRKB is part of a sub-complex with PRPK, where it enhances PRPK's autophosphorylation activity, suggesting a regulatory role in maintaining PRPK in an active conformation (Li2021Crystal).

TPRKB is also implicated in the regulation of cell growth and survival. Knockdown of TPRKB in human podocytes has been shown to impair cell proliferation, increase apoptosis, and activate DNA damage response signaling, indicating its role in maintaining normal cellular functions (Braun2017Mutations; Li2021Crystal). The protein localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, highlighting its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Braun2017Mutations). Additionally, TPRKB interacts with other proteins involved in mRNA and tRNA processing, suggesting roles in these molecular processes (Wan2016Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPRKB gene, a component of the KEOPS complex, are associated with Galloway-Mowat syndrome (GAMOS), a rare condition characterized by nephrotic syndrome, microcephaly, and brain anomalies. Specifically, TPRKB mutations are linked to GAMOS5, which presents with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and neurological symptoms such as microcephaly and pachygyria (Braun2017Mutations; Chen2023Diagnosis). These mutations lead to impaired cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and genomic instability, contributing to the disease phenotype (Braun2017Mutations).

In cancer, TPRKB has been identified as a significant vulnerability in TP53-mutant cancer cell lines. Alterations in TPRKB expression can affect cell proliferation and survival, making it a potential therapeutic target in TP53-deficient cancers (Goswami2019Identification; Wang2022Single-cell). The dependency of TPRKB in these cancers is unique among KEOPS complex members, highlighting its clinical significance (Goswami2019Identification). The PRPK-TPRKB complex structure has facilitated drug development efforts, as targeting TPRKB could offer therapeutic benefits in both GAMOS and cancer contexts (Li2021Crystal).

## Interactions
TPRKB (TP53RK binding protein) is a component of the EKC/KEOPS complex, which is involved in tRNA modification. Within this complex, TPRKB interacts with several proteins, including TP53RK, OSGEP, LAGE3, and C14ORF142. These interactions are essential for the complex's role in the biosynthesis of threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A), a conserved tRNA modification (Wan2016Proteomic).

TPRKB forms a stable interaction with TP53RK, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, but does not directly interact with OSGEP (Costessi2012The). The interaction between TPRKB and TP53RK is part of a linear configuration within the EKC complex, which includes LAGE3, OSGEP, and TP53RK (Costessi2012The).

In addition to its role in the KEOPS complex, TPRKB has been shown to interact with the TRMT6-TRMT61a complex, which is involved in tRNA modification, suggesting a potential influence on tRNA function beyond its established role (Wan2016Proteomic). TPRKB, along with PRPK, may form sub-complexes distinct from KEOPS that are involved in mRNA and tRNA-related processes (Wan2016Proteomic). These interactions highlight TPRKB's multifaceted role in cellular processes related to RNA.
