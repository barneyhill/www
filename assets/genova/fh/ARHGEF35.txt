# ARHGEF35

## Overview
ARHGEF35 is a gene that encodes the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 35, a protein involved in the regulation of Rho GTPases, which are critical for various cellular processes including cytoskeletal dynamics, cell migration, and cell cycle progression. As a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the protein facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases, thereby activating them. This activation plays a pivotal role in signal transduction pathways that control cell morphology and motility. The ARHGEF35 gene and its encoded protein are of significant interest due to their potential implications in cancer progression and metastasis, as well as other diseases involving aberrant cell movement and growth (Qiu2020aarFDC).
