# AURKAIP1

## Overview
AURKAIP1, or Aurora kinase A interacting protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cellular processes, particularly through its interaction with Aurora-A kinase. The protein encoded by AURKAIP1 is not a kinase itself but plays a critical role in modulating the stability and activity of Aurora-A kinase, which is essential for proper cell cycle progression and mitosis. AURKAIP1 facilitates the degradation of Aurora-A via a proteasome-dependent, ubiquitin-independent pathway, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability (Lim2007AuroraA). Additionally, AURKAIP1 is associated with the mitochondrial ribosome, functioning as a mitochondrial ribosomal protein (MRP) involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis (Koc2013Identification). Its role extends to cancer biology, where it influences pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin signaling, particularly in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (Tian2023AURKAIP1).

## Function
AURKAIP1 (Aurora kinase A interacting protein 1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of Aurora-A kinase, a protein involved in cell cycle progression, particularly during mitosis. AURKAIP1 promotes the degradation of Aurora-A through a proteasome-dependent but ubiquitin-independent pathway, which is distinct from the traditional ubiquitin-dependent degradation mechanism. This alternative pathway is significant because it allows for the regulation of Aurora-A levels independently of the cell cycle, ensuring proper cell cycle progression and preventing issues such as aneuploidy and transformation that can result from Aurora-A overexpression (Lim2007AuroraA).

AURKAIP1 specifically targets Aurora-A for degradation without affecting other proteins like Aurora-B, p21, and cyclin B1, highlighting its specificity in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Lim2007AuroraA). The truncated form of AURKAIP1 is more effective in destabilizing Aurora-A, suggesting that certain regions of the protein may influence its regulatory efficiency (Lim2007AuroraA). AURKAIP1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to proper cell division and genomic stability by modulating the stability and activity of Aurora-A kinase (Kiat2002AuroraA).

## Clinical Significance
AURKAIP1 has been implicated in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Studies have shown that AURKAIP1 expression is significantly higher in TNBC cells compared to normal breast cells, and its overexpression correlates with poorer overall survival and relapse-free survival in TNBC patients (Tian2023AURKAIP1). AURKAIP1 promotes TNBC progression by stabilizing the DDX5 protein, which in turn enhances the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a key driver of cancer cell proliferation and migration (Tian2023AURKAIP1). The interaction between AURKAIP1 and DDX5 is crucial, as DDX5 overexpression can reverse the inhibitory effects on proliferation and migration caused by AURKAIP1 knockdown (Tian2023AURKAIP1).

In addition to its role in cancer, AURKAIP1 is identified as a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Knockdown of AURKAIP1 leads to a significant reduction in mitochondrial protein synthesis, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function (Koc2013Identification). While the clinical significance of AURKAIP1 mutations is not directly addressed, its dysregulation in cancer and its role in mitochondrial function suggest potential implications for various diseases (Koc2013Identification).

## Interactions
AURKAIP1, also known as Aurora kinase A interacting protein 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), AURKAIP1 interacts with DEAD-box helicase 5 (DDX5), stabilizing it by preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This interaction enhances the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression. AURKAIP1's role in stabilizing DDX5 is significant, as DDX5 forms a complex with β-catenin, enhancing its transcriptional activity and promoting the transcription of downstream target genes involved in cancer (Tian2023AURKAIP1).

AURKAIP1 is also associated with the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the small subunit (28S). It is considered a mitochondrial ribosomal protein (MRP) and plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis. This association was confirmed through mass spectrometry and immunoblotting analyses, which demonstrated AURKAIP1's presence in the mitochondrial ribosome and its involvement in mitochondrial translation processes (Koc2013Identification). Despite its mitochondrial association, AURKAIP1 does not appear to directly affect the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial ribosomal proteins or mitochondrially encoded mRNAs (Koc2013Identification).
