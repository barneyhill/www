# LILRA4

## Overview
LILRA4, also known as ILT7 or CD85g, is a gene that encodes the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A4, a receptor protein primarily expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). This receptor is part of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor family and is characterized by its immunoglobulin-like domains, which are crucial for ligand binding and immune response modulation. LILRA4 plays a significant role in the regulation of type I interferon production, providing a negative feedback mechanism for TLR-mediated responses, thereby preventing excessive inflammation (Murray2024The). The protein interacts with bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), influencing the activity of pDCs, which are essential for antiviral defense (Lewis2020Leukocyte). LILRA4's expression and function have been implicated in various hematological malignancies, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and its role in disease progression (filarsky2015identification; Hansen2020Molecular).

## Structure
LILRA4, also known as ILT7, is a protein primarily expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells. It belongs to the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor family and features immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region. These domains are essential for ligand binding and play a significant role in the protein's function in immune response modulation. The structure of LILRA4 is characterized by these immunoglobulin-like domains, which contribute to its ability to interact with other molecules and cells in the immune system.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in LILRA4 and can influence its stability and function. Glycosylation may affect how the protein folds and how it is recognized by other molecules, impacting its role in immune signaling. The precise arrangement and modification of these domains are crucial for the protein's activity and its interactions within the immune system.

While specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of LILRA4 are not provided, the presence of immunoglobulin-like domains suggests a complex and functionally significant structure that supports its role in immune response.

## Function
LILRA4, also known as ILT7 or CD85g, is a receptor protein primarily expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). It plays a significant role in modulating immune responses, particularly through its interaction with bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), also known as tetherin or CD317. This interaction is crucial for regulating the activity of pDCs, which are key players in the body's antiviral defense mechanisms (Lewis2020Leukocyte).

LILRA4 is involved in the regulation of type I interferon production, a critical component of the innate immune response. It provides a negative feedback loop for TLR-mediated type I interferon production, helping to modulate the immune response and prevent excessive inflammation (Murray2024The). The receptor is stably expressed in unstimulated pDCs, making it a reliable marker for these cells in various immunological studies (Murray2024The).

While LILRA4's primary function is associated with pDCs, its expression and activity in other cell types, such as neutrophils, remain less clear due to limited data (Lewis2020Leukocyte). The specific role of LILRA4 in healthy human cells outside of its interaction with BST2 and regulation of interferon production is not fully understood.

## Clinical Significance
LILRA4 has been implicated in several hematological malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In CLL, LILRA4 is overexpressed and hypomethylated compared to normal B-cells, suggesting that its transcriptional activity is regulated by DNA methylation. This overexpression may contribute to CLL pathogenesis by interacting with the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, which is crucial for CLL cell activation (filarsky2015identification). LILRA4's expression in CLL and MCL exhibits a bimodal distribution, potentially dividing patients into distinct prognostic groups, indicating its role as a biomarker for these diseases (Hansen2020Molecular).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), LILRA4 is among the genes with increased mutations in relapsed cases, suggesting a role in immune evasion and resistance (Wise2020Mutational). The gene's interaction with CD317 (BST2) on plasmacytoid dendritic cells can modulate immune responses by reducing TLR7-mediated IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may influence disease progression and immune regulation (Trowsdale2015Surveillance). These findings highlight LILRA4's potential impact on the development and progression of certain cancers through alterations in its expression and interactions.

## Interactions
LILRA4, also known as ILT7 or CD85g, is primarily expressed on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and interacts with bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2), also known as tetherin or CD317. This interaction is significant in modulating the activity of pDCs, which are crucial for antiviral responses and the production of type I interferons (Lewis2020Leukocyte). LILRA4 forms a receptor complex with the FcεRIγ chain, which is essential for its signaling pathways that regulate immune responses (Low2013Association). 

While LILRA4's interactions on neutrophils are not well characterized, it is known to modulate TLR7/9 functions in dendritic cells, suggesting a selective immune regulatory role during innate immune responses (Lu2012LILRA2). The interaction with BST2 is particularly important as it influences the immune system's ability to respond to viral infections. Despite its known interactions, comprehensive studies on LILRA4-specific monoclonal antibody binding to neutrophils are lacking, indicating a need for further research to explore its potential interactions and functions in different cell types (Lewis2020Leukocyte).
