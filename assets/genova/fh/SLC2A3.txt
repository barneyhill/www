# SLC2A3

## Overview
The SLC2A3 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 3, commonly known as GLUT3, which is a high-affinity glucose transporter. As a member of the solute carrier family, GLUT3 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains that facilitate the transport of glucose and other substrates across cellular membranes. This protein plays a critical role in glucose uptake, particularly in neuronal tissues, where it supports essential functions such as ATP production and neurotransmitter release. The expression of SLC2A3 is tightly regulated and can be upregulated under hypoxic conditions to meet increased metabolic demands. Its involvement in various cellular processes and disease states, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, underscores its clinical significance (Gao2021A; Mimura2012Dynamic; Ziegler2020Cellular).

## Structure
The SLC2A3 gene encodes the glucose transporter protein GLUT3, which is a member of the solute carrier family 2. GLUT3 is characterized by its structure, which includes 12 transmembrane domains, a common feature of the major facilitator superfamily (Ziegler2020Cellular; Jafri2023Molecular). Both the amino and carboxy termini of GLUT3 are located intracellularly, and the protein has a glycosylation site at the first extracellular loop (Ziegler2020Cellular). The protein is composed of 496 amino acids, resulting in a molecular weight of approximately 54 kDa (Ziegler2020Cellular).

GLUT3 is known for its high affinity for D-glucose, with a Km of 1.4, and it can also transport other substrates such as galactose, mannose, and ascorbic acid in vitro (Ziegler2020Cellular). The protein's structure is crucial for its function in glucose transport, and specific motifs like the QLS motif in transmembrane segment 7 contribute to its glucose specificity (Jafri2023Molecular). The structural insights into GLUT3, including its experimentally determined high-resolution structure, are essential for understanding its substrate specificity and transport mechanisms (Colas2016SLC).

## Function
The SLC2A3 gene encodes the glucose transporter protein GLUT3, which is crucial for glucose uptake in cells, particularly in neurons. GLUT3 facilitates the diffusion of glucose across plasma membranes, a process essential for maintaining energy homeostasis in the brain, which relies heavily on glucose for ATP production. This energy is vital for processes such as axonal transport and neurotransmitter release (Ziegler2020Cellular).

GLUT3 is primarily expressed in the brain, where it is localized to axonal and dendritic processes in regions such as the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. It plays a significant role in ATP-dependent axonal transport and synaptic plasticity, contributing to excitatory neurotransmission (Ziegler2020Cellular). The transporter is also found in the mitochondrial membrane of neuronal cell lines and in platelet α-granules, indicating its involvement in various cellular processes (Ziegler2020Cellular).

Under hypoxic conditions, the expression of SLC2A3 is upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), enhancing glucose uptake to support glycolysis and energy production. This regulation is crucial for cellular adaptation to low oxygen environments (Mimura2012Dynamic).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC2A3 gene, encoding the glucose transporter GLUT3, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in glucose metabolism. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high SLC2A3 expression is associated with poor overall and disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Its expression is linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and immune response modulation, particularly through PD-L1 regulation (Kim2019Upregulation; Gao2021A). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), decreased SLC2A3 expression impairs vitamin C uptake, crucial for TET2 activity restoration, and is associated with poor survival outcomes. This suggests SLC2A3 as a predictive biomarker for vitamin C treatment efficacy in AML (Liu2020Decreased).

SLC2A3 is also involved in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Alterations in its expression or copy number variations (CNVs) have been linked to conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Alzheimer's disease. In ADHD, SLC2A3 duplication may affect cognitive functions, while in Alzheimer's, decreased GLUT3 expression is observed, impacting glucose metabolism (Ziegler2020Cellular). In testicular embryonal carcinomas, frequent copy number gains of SLC2A3 suggest its role in tumor development (Hoff2020Frequent).

## Interactions
The SLC2A3 gene, encoding the glucose transporter protein GLUT3, is involved in several interactions that influence its function and regulation. SLC2A3 interacts with the STAT3 signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells, forming a feedback loop that enhances the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional regulation of SLC2A3, as phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) binds to the promoter regions of SLC2A3, thereby influencing its expression. The use of a p-STAT3 inhibitor has been shown to reduce the proliferative ability of gastric cancer cells, highlighting the functional significance of this interaction (Yao2020SLC2A3).

Under hypoxic conditions, SLC2A3 expression is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) and the histone demethylase KDM3A. HIF1 binds to specific motifs in the SLC2A3 promoter and enhancer regions, facilitating chromatin conformational changes that enhance gene expression. This interaction is essential for the upregulation of SLC2A3, which supports increased glucose uptake necessary for glycolysis under low oxygen conditions (Mimura2012Dynamic). These interactions underscore the role of SLC2A3 in cellular adaptation to metabolic demands and its potential involvement in cancer progression.
