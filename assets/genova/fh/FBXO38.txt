# FBXO38

## Overview
FBXO38 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 38, a member of the F-box protein family characterized by the presence of an F-box motif. This motif is crucial for the formation of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, which plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a system responsible for targeted protein degradation. F-box protein 38 is categorized as an FBXL protein due to its leucine-rich repeats, which facilitate specific protein-protein interactions. The protein is involved in the regulation of centromere integrity through its interaction with zinc finger proteins ZXDA and ZXDB, mediating their ubiquitination and degradation. This function is essential for maintaining proper chromatin assembly and cell division processes. Mutations in FBXO38 have been linked to various neuromuscular disorders and other conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Dibus2022FBXO38a; Saferali2019Analysis; Dibus2022FBXO38).

## Structure
FBXO38, also known as F-box protein 38, is characterized by its F-box motif located at the N-terminus, which is essential for forming the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex. This motif is approximately 40 amino acids long and is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with SKP1, a component of the SCF complex (Jin2004Systematic; Dibus2022FBXO38). 

FBXO38 contains leucine-rich repeats (LRR) following the F-box motif, classifying it as an FBXL protein, which is a subgroup of F-box proteins that contain these repeats (Dibus2022FBXO38). The C-terminal domain of FBXO38 is significant for its interaction with ZXDA/B proteins, facilitated by a zinc finger linker motif. This motif specifically recognizes a sequence within ZXDA, encompassing amino acid residues 386-408 (Dibus2022FBXO38).

The nuclear localization sequence (NLS) is located in the C-terminal part of FBXO38, indicating its role in nuclear functions (Dibus2022FBXO38). Mutations such as C206R and R526Q in FBXO38 are linked to distal hereditary motor neuronopathy type IID, highlighting the importance of its structural integrity (Dibus2022FBXO38). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its role in ubiquitination and protein stability regulation.

## Function
FBXO38 encodes an F-box protein that functions as a substrate receptor in the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is responsible for targeted protein degradation. FBXO38 specifically interacts with zinc finger proteins ZXDA and ZXDB, mediating their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining centromere integrity, as ZXDA/B proteins stabilize the centromeric protein CENP-B, essential for proper centromeric chromatin assembly and function during cell division (Dibus2022FBXO38a).

FBXO38's role extends to regulating the stability of ZXDA/B proteins, which are involved in chromatin binding but not directly in transcriptional regulation. This regulation is vital for centromere integrity and potentially other cellular processes (Dibus2022FBXO38a). In the absence of FBXO38, there is an increase in ZXDA/B protein levels, leading to elevated levels of centromeric proteins CENP-A, -B, and -C, which can disrupt centromere integrity (Dibus2022FBXO38a). FBXO38 is also implicated in preventing cytokinesis and mitotic defects, as its deficiency is associated with increased multinucleated cells and potential links to cancer-related malformations (Dibus2022FBXO38a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FBXO38 gene have been linked to several neuromuscular disorders and other conditions. A novel homozygous missense variant in FBXO38 has been associated with distal hereditary motor neuronopathy (dHMN) type IID, characterized by anterior horn cell degeneration and progressive distal muscle weakness. This condition was identified in a young Turkish female, suggesting a loss of function mechanism and expanding the known phenotype of dHMN type IID (Akçimen2019A). 

FBXO38 mutations have also been implicated in early-onset distal muscular dystrophy, which involves increased anterior horn motor neuron loss in the spinal cord. This suggests a potential role for FBXO38 in neurodegenerative syndromes (Dibus2022FBXO38). Additionally, a C206R heterozygous missense mutation in FBXO38 has been found in families with dominant hereditary motor neuropathy (HMN), impairing KLF7 target gene activation and reducing neurite length in motor neurons (Beijer2020The).

FBXO38 has been identified as a novel gene associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) susceptibility through alternative splicing, with a cryptic exon potentially leading to a truncated protein with altered function (Saferali2019Analysis). Furthermore, changes in alternative polyadenylation of FBXO38 have been linked to cancer susceptibility, with specific variants increasing post-transcriptional activities, suggesting an oncogenic role (Guo2023Largescale).

## Interactions
FBXO38 is a component of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing) ubiquitin ligase complex, where it functions as a substrate receptor. It specifically interacts with the zinc finger proteins ZXDA and ZXDB, targeting them for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Dibus2022FBXO38a). The interaction between FBXO38 and ZXDA/B is mediated by a zinc finger linker motif in ZXDA/B, while FBXO38 contains leucine-rich repeats and an F-box motif essential for this interaction (Dibus2022FBXO38a). 

FBXO38's interaction with ZXDA/B is mutually exclusive with the centromeric protein CENP-B, suggesting that FBXO38 and CENP-B bind overlapping regions on ZXDA/B (Dibus2022FBXO38a). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of ZXDA/B stability and, consequently, centromere integrity (Dibus2022FBXO38a). 

FBXO38 also interacts with Cullin-1 as part of its role in the SCF complex, similar to other F-box proteins like Skp2 and Fbw7 (Saferali2019Analysis). Despite these interactions, FBXO38 does not directly interact with centromeric DNA, indicating its role is more regulatory in maintaining centromere integrity (Dibus2022FBXO38a).
