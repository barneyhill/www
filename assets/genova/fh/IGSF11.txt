# IGSF11

## Overview
IGSF11, or immunoglobulin superfamily member 11, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its extracellular immunoglobulin domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail, which are integral to its function as a cell adhesion molecule (Schreiber2013The; Harada2005BT‐IgSF). IGSF11 is predominantly expressed in the brain and testis, where it plays a critical role in synaptic transmission and plasticity by interacting with postsynaptic scaffolding proteins and AMPA receptors (Ghouzlani2021The; Jang2015Synaptic). Additionally, IGSF11 is involved in osteoclast differentiation, impacting bone metabolism (Kim2020IgSF11). Clinically, alterations in IGSF11 expression have been linked to various cancers, including colorectal and gastric cancers, as well as gliomas, where it may contribute to tumor progression and immune evasion (Ghouzlani2021The; Watanabe2005Identification).

## Structure
The IGSF11 protein, also known as BT-IgSF, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its structural components, including extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. Specifically, the extracellular region of IGSF11 comprises one V-type Ig domain and one C2-type Ig domain, which are typical features of proteins in this family (Schreiber2013The; Harada2005BT‐IgSF). The protein also contains a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which facilitates interactions with proteins containing PDZ domains, such as PSD-95 (Jang2015Synaptic).

IGSF11 is known to form homophilic dimers, a quaternary structure that is modeled based on the homodimeric structure of the related CAR protein (Jang2015Synaptic). This dimerization is crucial for its function as a cell adhesion molecule, mediating cell-cell adhesion in a calcium-independent manner (Harada2005BT‐IgSF). The protein is glycosylated, which is a common post-translational modification for proteins in this family, contributing to its stability and function (Harada2005BT‐IgSF). The cytoplasmic tail of IGSF11 is highly conserved, indicating its importance in cellular signaling and adhesion processes (Harada2005BT‐IgSF).

## Function
IGSF11, also known as immunoglobulin superfamily member 11, is a synaptic adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission and plasticity, particularly in the brain. It is predominantly expressed in the brain and testis, where it interacts with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 and AMPA receptors (AMPARs) to stabilize these receptors at synapses (Ghouzlani2021The; Jang2015Synaptic). This stabilization is essential for maintaining synaptic strength and plasticity, which are critical for learning and memory processes (Jang2015Synaptic).

IGSF11 mediates cell-cell adhesion through homophilic interactions, meaning it binds to itself on adjacent cells, which is important for the formation of synaptic connections (Harada2005BT‐IgSF). In the hippocampus, IGSF11 is involved in the regulation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, influencing the amplitude and frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents (Jang2015Synaptic). It also plays a role in osteoclast differentiation, a process crucial for bone metabolism, by interacting with PSD-95, which is necessary for proper osteoclast maturation (Kim2020IgSF11). These functions highlight IGSF11's role in both neural connectivity and bone metabolism.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IGSF11 gene have been implicated in various cancers. IGSF11 is upregulated in colorectal cancers, hepatocellular carcinomas, and intestinal-type gastric cancers, suggesting its role in tumor progression and as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy (Watanabe2005Identification). In gastric cancer, the IGSF11-2 isoform is specifically upregulated, indicating its involvement in cancer cell proliferation (Watanabe2005Identification). Suppression of IGSF11 using siRNA has been shown to reduce the growth of gastric cancer cells, highlighting its importance in cancer cell growth (Watanabe2005Identification).

In gliomas, particularly high-grade gliomas like glioblastoma, IGSF11 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression correlates with other immune checkpoints, contributing to an immunosuppressive microenvironment that aids tumor cells in evading immune responses (Ghouzlani2021The). High IGSF11 expression in gliomas is linked to increased infiltration of immune cells, although these cells are likely less functional due to the immunosuppressive environment (Ghouzlani2021The).

In bone metabolism, IGSF11 plays a crucial role in osteoclast differentiation. Deficiency in IGSF11 leads to impaired osteoclast differentiation and increased bone mass, suggesting its involvement in bone resorption processes (Kim2020IgSF11). Alterations in IGSF11 expression or its interaction with PSD-95 can impact bone density and osteoclast-related processes (Kim2020IgSF11).

## Interactions
IGSF11, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is known for its interactions with several proteins, primarily through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. It interacts with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95, which is crucial for its localization at excitatory synapses and plays a significant role in synaptic transmission and plasticity (Jang2015Synaptic). IGSF11 forms a complex with AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs), specifically the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits, but not with the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors (Jang2015Synaptic). This interaction is important for the synaptic stabilization of AMPARs, although IGSF11 does not affect their functional properties such as desensitization or deactivation (Jang2015Synaptic).

In osteoclast differentiation, IGSF11 interacts with PSD-95, and this interaction is necessary for proper differentiation. The intracellular region of IGSF11, particularly the 75 C-terminal amino acids, is crucial for this process (Kim2020IgSF11). IGSF11 also forms a signaling complex with PSD-95 that recruits Src family kinases, leading to the phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), which is essential for osteoclast differentiation (Kim2023IgSF11mediated).
