# OR11H6

## Overview
OR11H6 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily H member 6, which is a part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in humans. It is primarily expressed in olfactory sensory neurons and is involved in the recognition of specific odorants, including isovaleric acid and other ecologically significant compounds (Saraiva2019A; Menashe2007Genetic). The receptor is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as the kidney, suggesting potential roles beyond olfaction, although these functions remain to be fully elucidated (Kalbe2016Olfactory).

## Function
OR11H6 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odorants, contributing to the sense of smell in humans. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in olfactory signal transduction. OR11H6 is expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and is associated with the detection of specific odorants, including isovaleric acid (IVA) and other key food odorants (KFOs) that are ecologically relevant (Saraiva2019A; Menashe2007Genetic).

The receptor is highly expressed in humans and is thought to be involved in recognizing specific classes of odorants such as carboxylic acids, thiols, and vanillin-like compounds, which are important for ecological functions like food choice (Saraiva2019A). OR11H6, along with closely related receptors OR11H4 and OR11H7P, may collectively contribute to the perception of IVA, although its response is not as significant as OR11H7P (Menashe2007Genetic).

In addition to its role in the olfactory system, OR11H6 has been studied in non-olfactory tissues, such as the kidney, where it may participate in cellular signaling pathways, although its specific function in these tissues is not well-defined (Kalbe2016Olfactory).
