# SLURP2

## Overview
SLURP2 is a gene that encodes the protein secreted LY6/PLAUR domain containing 2, which is a member of the Ly-6/uPAR family of proteins. This protein is characterized by a 'three-finger' fold, a structural motif common to this family, and is involved in cholinergic signaling. SLURP2 is primarily expressed in keratinocytes within the human mucocutaneous epithelium, where it plays a crucial role in regulating cell differentiation and apoptosis. The protein interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α3 and α7 subtypes, influencing keratinocyte behavior and potentially modulating inflammatory responses and malignant cell transformation. SLURP2's expression is notably upregulated in hyperproliferative skin conditions such as psoriasis, suggesting its involvement in the pathophysiology of these diseases. Its ability to modulate nAChR activity in a concentration-dependent manner highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in skin disorders and cancer (Lyukmanova2014Human; Lyukmanova2016Secreted; Arredondo2006SLURP‐2:).

## Structure
SLURP-2 is a protein characterized by a 'three-finger' fold, a common structural motif in the Ly-6/uPAR protein family. This fold consists of a compact β-structural core with three protruding loops, stabilized by invariant disulfide bonds (Lyukmanova2016Secreted). The protein's structure includes two antiparallel β-sheets formed by five β-strands, with the first β-sheet involving residues from loop I and the second sheet consisting of three strands from loops II and III (Lyukmanova2016Secreted). SLURP-2 is stabilized by four disulfide bonds in the 'head' and one in the first loop, similar to other Ly-6/uPAR proteins and 'non-conventional' snake neurotoxins (Lyukmanova2016Secreted).

SLURP-2 is a secreted isoform of the membrane-tethered neuromodulator Lynx1, produced by alternative splicing of the lynx1 gene (Lyukmanova2016Secreted). Despite low sequence homology with Lynx1 and SLURP-1, SLURP-2 shares a structural motif with other Ly-6/uPAR proteins (Lyukmanova2016Secreted). The protein's structure is sensitive to pH changes, which can lead to partial denaturation and transition from β-structural to random coil conformation (Lyukmanova2014Human). SLURP-2's structure has been studied using NMR spectroscopy, providing detailed insights into its spatial configuration (Lyukmanova2016Secreted).

## Function
SLURP2 is a cholinergic signaling peptide involved in the regulation of keratinocyte functions in human mucocutaneous epithelium. It is secreted by epidermal and oral keratinocytes and primarily found in the suprabasal compartment of the epidermis and the lowermost epithelial layers of the gingiva (Arredondo2006SLURP‐2:). SLURP2 competes with acetylcholine for binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α3 subtype, and delays keratinocyte differentiation while preventing apoptosis (Arredondo2006SLURP‐2:). This peptide downregulates the expression of differentiation markers and pro-apoptotic genes, suggesting its role in maintaining keratinocyte proliferation and survival (Arredondo2006SLURP‐2:).

SLURP2's interaction with nAChRs influences keratinocyte behavior by modulating gene expression related to cell differentiation and apoptosis, primarily through heteropentameric nAChRs (Arredondo2006SLURP‐2:). It increases cell numbers and decreases sensitivity to apoptosis, indicating an anti-apoptotic effect (Arredondo2006SLURP‐2:). SLURP2's expression is upregulated in hyperproliferative conditions like psoriasis, indicating its involvement in keratinocyte hyperproliferation and possibly T cell differentiation/activation (Arredondo2006SLURP‐2:). The protein's role in promoting cell growth and survival suggests it plays a protective role in maintaining the integrity and function of the mucocutaneous epithelium (Arredondo2007SLURP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the SLURP2 gene are associated with several skin conditions, notably palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) and psoriasis. SLURP2 is involved in the regulation of keratinocyte functions, and its expression is upregulated in hyperproliferative skin conditions such as psoriasis. This suggests that SLURP2 plays a role in the pathophysiology of these diseases by influencing keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation (Arredondo2006SLURP‐2:). In PPK, deficiencies in SLURP2, along with SLURP1, result in similar disease phenotypes, including a thickened stratum corneum and hind-limb clasping in knockout mice models, indicating its critical role in maintaining normal skin barrier function (Allan2018Palmoplantar).

SLURP2 interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on keratinocytes, competing with acetylcholine and delaying keratinocyte differentiation while preventing apoptosis. This interaction is crucial for maintaining skin homeostasis, and disruptions can lead to skin disorders characterized by altered keratinocyte behavior (Arredondo2006SLURP‐2:). The gene's involvement in modulating inflammation and keratinocyte proliferation highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in skin diseases characterized by hyperproliferation and altered differentiation.

## Interactions
SLURP-2, a member of the Ly-6/uPAR family, interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α7 and α3β2 subtypes. These interactions are significant in regulating the growth and differentiation of keratinocytes and controlling inflammation and malignant cell transformation (Lyukmanova2014Human). SLURP-2 has been shown to have an antiproliferative effect on human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, which express only α7-nAChRs, suggesting that the α7-nAChR is the primary receptor responsible for these effects in epithelial cells (Lyukmanova2014Human).

Recombinant SLURP-2 (rSLURP-2) has been reported to inhibit α4β2, α3β2, and α7 nAChRs at micromolar concentrations, while at lower concentrations, it potentiates α7 nAChR-mediated currents. This indicates that SLURP-2 can modulate nAChR activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Durek2017Interaction). The structural analysis of SLURP-2 revealed a typical three-finger fold with a β-structural core, similar to ws-Lynx1, another member of the Ly-6/uPAR family, which suggests a shared mechanism of interaction with nAChRs (Lyukmanova2014Human). These interactions highlight the potential role of SLURP-2 in cancer treatment and its importance in modulating nAChR-mediated signaling pathways.
