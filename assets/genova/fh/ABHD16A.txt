# ABHD16A

## Overview
ABHD16A is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 16A, a phospholipase enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. This protein is characterized by an alpha/beta hydrolase domain and is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylserine (PS) to lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS), a lipid involved in signaling pathways that regulate inflammation and neural development (Nguyen2022An; Kamat2015Immunomodulatory). ABHD16A is also implicated in mitochondrial dynamics, facilitating the recruitment of fission and fusion machinery at ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function (Nguyen2022An). The gene is associated with various clinical conditions, including a novel psychomotor developmental disorder and the neurological disorder PHARC, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis and neurological health (Yahia2021Pathogenic; Singh2020Mapping).

## Structure
ABHD16A is a protein encoded by the ABHD16A gene, characterized by an alpha/beta hydrolase domain, which is a common structural motif in enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. This domain is responsible for its phospholipid hydrolase activity, specifically converting phosphatidylserine (PS) to lysophosphatidylserine (lysoPS) (Nguyen2022An; Singh2020Mapping). The protein also contains an acyltransferase motif, although its biochemical function remains uncharacterized (Nguyen2022An).

ABHD16A is a multi-pass membrane protein, predicted to be palmitoylated, although the function of this modification is unknown (Lord2013Mammalian). It is an integral membrane protein localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with a cytosolically oriented active site (Singh2020Mapping). The protein is also found on the plasma membrane in human platelets and mouse megakaryocytes (Lord2013Mammalian).

The ABHD16A gene produces two protein-coding transcripts, NM_021160 and NM_001177515, which code for isoforms of 558 and 525 amino acids, respectively. These isoforms are functionally related but differ in their tissue expression profiles (Yahia2021Pathogenic). The protein's structure includes lipase-like motifs and is highly conserved in vertebrates (Nguyen2022An).

## Function
ABHD16A is a phospholipase enzyme primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in human cells, where it plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics. It is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylserine (PS) to produce lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS), a signaling lipid that influences various cellular processes, including inflammation and neural development (Nguyen2022An; Kamat2015Immunomodulatory). 

In the context of mitochondrial dynamics, ABHD16A is essential for the recruitment of fission and fusion machinery to ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites (MCSs). This recruitment is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function, as ABHD16A facilitates the formation of ER-associated mitochondrial nodes where fission and fusion occur (Nguyen2022An). The enzyme's activity at these sites is thought to involve altering phospholipid composition, which affects membrane curvature and the localization of proteins required for mitochondrial fission and fusion (Nguyen2022An). 

ABHD16A's role in lipid signaling and mitochondrial dynamics underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function, with implications for immune regulation and neurodevelopmental processes (Kamat2015Immunomodulatory; Xu2018Sequence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ABHD16A gene are associated with a novel psychomotor developmental disorder characterized by spastic paraplegia. This condition is marked by developmental delay, intellectual impairment, spasticity, and skeletal deformities. The disorder has been identified in two Sudanese families, where homozygous null variants in ABHD16A were found, leading to a loss of function in the enzyme it encodes, which is crucial for brain phosphatidylserine metabolism (Yahia2021Pathogenic). The loss of ABHD16A function results in altered lipid metabolism, specifically affecting phosphatidylserine and lysophosphatidylserine levels, which are critical for intracellular signaling. This disruption is particularly evident in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, as observed in both knockout mice and patient fibroblasts (Yahia2021Pathogenic).

The ABHD16A gene is also implicated in the neurological disorder PHARC, which is characterized by polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract. ABHD16A is a principal lyso-PS biosynthetic enzyme in the central nervous system, and its dysfunction can lead to deregulation of lyso-PS signaling, particularly affecting the cerebellum, which is responsible for motor functions (Singh2020Mapping). The interplay between ABHD16A and ABHD12 in lyso-PS metabolism is crucial for maintaining normal neurological function, and disruptions in this pathway can contribute to the pathophysiology of PHARC (Singh2020Mapping).

## Interactions
ABHD16A, also known as Human Lymphocyte Antigen B-associated transcript 5 (BAT5), is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in lipid metabolism and cellular processes. It is part of a gene cluster within the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III, suggesting a potential role in immunity. In a high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screen, ABHD16A was found to interact with several proteins, including membrane receptors and chaperone/processing proteins, although the specific functions of these interactions remain unclear (Lord2013Mammalian).

ABHD16A is also implicated in ER-associated mitochondrial constriction, where it plays a role in the recruitment of mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery. It interacts with proteins at ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites (MCSs), such as Mfn1, and is involved in phosphatidylserine (PS) shuttling, which is crucial for the localization of Mfn1/2 to nodes, potentially affecting mitochondrial fission and fusion (Nguyen2022An).

In the context of gastric cancer, ABHD16A is regulated by miR-4646-5p, which influences the accumulation of lysophosphatidylserines (lyso-PS) and activates signaling pathways involving RhoA, contributing to cancer metastasis. This suggests indirect interactions with components of the signaling cascade, such as RhoA or GPCRs (Yang2021Mirtronic).
