# ZNF14

## Overview
ZNF14 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 14, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role as transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by their zinc finger motifs, which enable them to bind DNA and regulate gene expression. Zinc finger protein 14 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape, impacting cellular processes such as differentiation and development (RousseauMerck1993Chromosomal; Jin2004Proteomic). Although the specific functions of ZNF14 in normal physiology are not fully understood, its involvement in transcriptional regulation suggests a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli (Mandal2016Profiling). The gene has also been implicated in various diseases, including biliary atresia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and breast cancer, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Sun2022A; Miki1992Identification; Wang2022Prognostic; Gaykalova2015Outlier).

## Function
ZNF14, a zinc finger protein, is primarily involved in the regulation of gene transcription. Zinc finger proteins, including ZNF14, are characterized by their ability to bind DNA through zinc finger motifs, which allows them to function as transcription factors. These proteins play crucial roles in various cellular processes by modulating the transcription of target genes (Jin2004Proteomic). ZNF14 is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell, impacting processes such as cell differentiation and development (RousseauMerck1993Chromosomal).

The specific functions of ZNF14 in healthy human cells are not well understood, but it is known to be involved in transcriptional regulation. The protein's activity in the nucleus suggests its role in controlling the expression of genes necessary for maintaining normal cellular functions (Mandal2016Profiling). While the precise molecular pathways and target genes regulated by ZNF14 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in transcriptional processes highlights its potential importance in cellular homeostasis and response to environmental stimuli (Jin2004Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF14 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression and interactions. In biliary atresia (BA), a severe liver disease in neonates, ZNF14 is identified as a significant transcription factor associated with poor clinical outcomes. Its expression is positively correlated with advanced liver fibrosis and poor survival, suggesting its role as a master regulator influencing immune response and fibrosis in BA (Sun2022A).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ZNF14 is identified as a top candidate gene with increased DNA methylation in tumor samples compared to normal tissues. This hypermethylation is associated with decreased gene expression, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis. The study suggests that ZNF14 methylation could serve as a biomarker for HNSCC, aiding in early detection and diagnosis (Gaykalova2015Outlier).

ZNF14 is also highlighted in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as one of the key genes associated with patient prognosis. Its expression is part of a prognostic model that predicts IPF progression, underscoring its clinical significance in this lung disease (Wang2022Prognostic).

In breast cancer, ZNF14 has been identified as a target of homozygous deletions, suggesting its potential involvement in the disease's progression (Miki1992Identification).
