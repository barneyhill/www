# TUBA4B

## Overview
TUBA4B is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin alpha 4b, which is a member of the tubulin family of proteins. Tubulins are globular proteins that polymerize to form microtubules, essential components of the cytoskeleton that play a critical role in maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. The TUBA4B gene is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which is crucial for various cellular processes. Alterations in the expression of TUBA4B have been associated with several types of cancer, where it may function as a tumor suppressor by influencing cell proliferation and signaling pathways (Chen2016Low; Zhu2017Downregulation). As such, TUBA4B is being studied for its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Zhang2018Integrated).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TUBA4B gene have been implicated in various cancers. In epithelial ovarian cancer, TUBA4B is significantly downregulated, correlating with poor prognosis, including lower survival rates and advanced pathological features such as higher FIGO stage and lymph node metastases (Zhu2017Downregulation). Overexpression of TUBA4B in ovarian cancer cells has been shown to reduce cell proliferation and attenuate the activation of ERK and Akt signaling pathways, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Zhu2017Downregulation).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), low expression of TUBA4B is associated with advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis, indicating a poor prognosis. Overexpression of TUBA4B in NSCLC cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for NSCLC prognosis (Chen2016Low).

A meta-analysis has identified TUBA4B as a prognostic biomarker in various cancers, including lung, colon, breast, and ovarian cancers. The analysis found that TUBA4B expression is significantly correlated with overall survival, with lower expression linked to poorer outcomes (Zhang2018Integrated). These findings suggest that TUBA4B plays a critical role in cancer progression and could serve as a target for therapeutic interventions.
