# KIF20B

## Overview
KIF20B is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 20B, which is part of the Kinesin-6 family of motor proteins. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind ATP and microtubules, playing a crucial role in intracellular transport and cell division processes. Kinesin family member 20B is particularly involved in cytokinesis, where it facilitates the organization and separation of the mitotic spindle during the late telophase of mitosis. The protein's unique structure, including a notably long stalk and multiple coiled-coil domains, allows it to effectively bundle and slide microtubules, which is essential for its function in microtubule organization during cell division and neuron development (Janisch2018Kinesin6; McNeely2017Mutation). Additionally, KIF20B's interactions with other proteins, such as CENP-F and PRC1, underscore its importance in maintaining proper cell cycle progression and mitotic processes (Wolter2017Central; Fritzler2019A). The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in neurological development and cancer, where altered KIF20B levels are associated with disease progression and prognosis (Lin2018Pseudopod‐associated; McNeely2017Mutation).

## Structure
KIF20B is a member of the Kinesin-6 family, characterized by a conserved motor domain that binds ATP and microtubules. The protein is approximately 1000 amino acids long and features a unique structure with a two-fold longer stalk compared to other Kinesin-6 family members, consisting of four coiled-coil domains linked by three hinges, which may provide increased flexibility (Janisch2018Kinesin6; McNeely2017Mutation). This structure allows KIF20B to slide and bundle microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner, crucial for its function in microtubule organization during cell division and neuron development (McNeely2017Mutation).

The protein's motor domain is homologous to other Kinesin-6 family members, but KIF20B is structurally divergent with an extraordinarily long stalk, which evolved in the vertebrate lineage (Janisch2018Kinesin6). The microtubule-binding domain (MBD) of KIF20B, consisting of amino acid residues 1002-1059, is critical for its interaction with Shootin1, a protein involved in neuronal growth cone dynamics (Sapir2013Shootin1).

KIF20B is heavily phosphorylated during mitosis, which may regulate its activity (Sapir2013Shootin1). The protein's role in cytokinesis and neuronal polarization suggests it may have multiple functional isoforms, although specific splice variants are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
KIF20B, a member of the kinesin superfamily, is a molecular motor protein involved in intracellular transport and cell division. It plays a critical role in cytokinesis, particularly during the late telophase of mitosis, by facilitating the proper organization and separation of the mitotic spindle. KIF20B is essential for efficient cytokinetic furrowing and timely abscission, regulating late steps of maturation, including ESCRT-III recruitment and microtubule constriction site formation (Li2019Kinesin; Lin2018Pseudopod‐associated).

In healthy human cells, KIF20B is active in the cytoplasm, where it bundles microtubules and moves toward their plus-end in an ATP-dependent manner. This activity is crucial for maintaining microtubule dynamics and ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (Lin2018Pseudopod‐associated). The protein's microtubule-binding and microtubule-bundling properties, along with its microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity, underscore its role in cell cycle regulation and microtubule cytoskeleton organization (Yang2021Identification; Li2019Kinesin).

KIF20B's function in healthy cells is primarily related to its role in cell division, ensuring proper cytokinesis and maintaining chromosomal integrity during mitosis (Lin2018Pseudopod‐associated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KIF20B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of neurological development, mutations in KIF20B can lead to defects in cortical neuron polarization and morphogenesis, resulting in conditions such as microcephaly. These mutations cause mRNA splicing errors, leading to frameshifts and premature termination codons, which reduce KIF20B protein levels and affect neuron shape and growth (McNeely2017Mutation).

In cancer, KIF20B is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with cancer progression, including increased tumor invasion and metastasis. High KIF20B expression correlates with shorter overall survival in CRC patients and is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion (Lin2018Pseudopod‐associated).

Similarly, in tongue cancer, KIF20B is highly expressed and associated with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. Knockdown of KIF20B in tongue cancer cell lines reduces cell proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene in this cancer type (Li2019Kinesin).

## Interactions
KIF20B, a kinesin family member, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its role in cell division and intracellular transport. It has been shown to colocalize with CENP-F, a centromere-related protein, during cell division, although they exhibit distinct staining patterns, indicating a complex interaction during cytokinesis (Fritzler2019A). KIF20B is also implicated in cytokinetic furrowing and cell abscission, processes essential for successful cell division (Fritzler2019A).

The protein interacts with PRC1, a key player in central spindle assembly and midbody function during cytokinesis, although its expression is independent of MMB-FOXM1 regulation despite promoter binding (Wolter2017Central). KIF20B's role in cytokinesis is further supported by its involvement in the formation of microtubule constriction sites, similar to other coiled-coil-rich proteins that facilitate organelle movement (Fritzler2019A).

These interactions highlight KIF20B's essential function in maintaining proper cell cycle progression and mitotic processes, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in diseases characterized by aberrant cell division, such as cancer (Yang2021Identification).
