# KIAA1586

## Overview
KIAA1586 is a gene that encodes the protein SDE2, which is a member of the ZNF451 family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, particularly through its interactions with SUMO2/3 paralogs. SDE2 contains a ribonuclease H-like domain and a catalytic tandem-SIM domain, which is nearly identical to other ZNF451 family members, although it lacks certain regions necessary for specific substrate interactions and SUMO chain initiation (Pichler2017SUMO). In addition to its structural features, KIAA1586 plays a role in the regulation of gene expression related to Alzheimer's disease by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that interacts with specific microRNAs (miRNAs) (Zhang2019Systematic). The dysregulation of these interactions may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (Zhang2019Systematic).

## Interactions
KIAA1586, also known as SDE2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is part of the ZNF451 family, which is known for its specificity to SUMO2/3 paralogs. KIAA1586 shares a nearly identical N-terminal catalytic tandem-SIM domain with other ZNF451 family members, differing by only one amino acid substitution. However, it is otherwise unrelated to ZNF451-1 and ZNF451-2, possessing a ribonuclease H-like domain (Pichler2017SUMO). Despite its similarities, KIAA1586 lacks certain regions present in other ZNF451 family members that are crucial for specific substrate interactions and SUMO chain initiation, such as the zinc finger region necessary for SUMO chain initiation and PML sumoylation (Pichler2017SUMO).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, KIAA1586 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by interacting with miRNAs such as hsa-miR-29b, hsa-miR-101, and hsa-miR-15a. These miRNAs are involved in the regulation of genes associated with Alzheimer's disease, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta (Aβ) (Zhang2019Systematic). The dysregulation of KIAA1586 may disrupt the balance of these miRNA-related ceRNA networks, contributing to Alzheimer's disease (Zhang2019Systematic).
