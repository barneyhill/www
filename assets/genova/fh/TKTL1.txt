# TKTL1

## Overview
The TKTL1 gene encodes the transketolase-like 1 protein, which is a member of the transketolase family involved in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This pathway is essential for cellular processes such as nucleotide biosynthesis and maintaining redox balance. The TKTL1 protein, although structurally similar to the transketolase (TKT) enzyme, features a unique deletion in its N-terminal domain that affects its enzymatic activity and dimerization properties (Schneider2012A; Deshpande2019The). Functionally, TKTL1 plays a critical role in cell proliferation and survival by contributing to the production of ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH, which are vital for anabolic reactions and antioxidant defense (Zhao2009A). The protein's interactions and regulation, particularly its involvement in forming heterodimers with TKT and its regulation by the APC/C CDH1 complex, underscore its significance in cellular metabolism and its potential implications in cancer (Li2019APCCCDH1).

## Structure
The human transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) shares a high sequence identity with the transketolase (TKT) enzyme, although it features a notable deletion of 38 consecutive amino acids in its N-terminal domain. This deletion includes regions critical for cofactor binding and catalysis, which are present in TKT, suggesting potential differences in enzymatic activity (Schneider2012A). Despite this deletion, homology models indicate that TKTL1 maintains a structure similar to TKT, with a cleft that can accommodate the cofactor-substrate complex (Deshpande2019The).

The secondary structure of TKTL1 is characterized by an (α/β) fold, although the deletion results in a slightly reduced α-helical content compared to full-length TKT (Schneider2012A). The tertiary structure of TKTL1 is stabilized by alternative interactions that compensate for the absence of certain residues, allowing the protein to maintain its overall integrity (Deshpande2019The).

In terms of quaternary structure, TKTL1 forms a homodimer, similar to TKT, which is essential for its function. However, the deletion affects dimer formation, as seen in the TKTD38 model, which predominantly exists as a monomer (Schneider2012A). The structural alignment of TKTL1 with TKT shows a close match, with an RMSD of 0.4 Å, indicating minimal impact on its global structure (Deshpande2019The).

## Function
TKTL1 (transketolase-like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which is crucial for nucleotide biosynthesis and maintaining cellular redox balance. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in cell proliferation and survival by contributing to the production of ribose-5-phosphate and the generation of NADPH, both essential for anabolic reactions and antioxidant defense (Zhao2009A).

Structurally, TKTL1 shares similarities with the well-studied transketolase enzyme (TKT), which is involved in the PPP and glycolysis. Despite some differences in amino acid residues, TKTL1 is suggested to function similarly to TKT, participating in the transfer of a 2-carbon ketose in a classic ping-pong-bi-bi two-substrate reaction (Deshpande2019The). Homology modeling indicates that TKTL1 can assume a structure similar to TKT, allowing for similar substrate binding and stabilization, which supports its role as a bona fide transketolase (Deshpande2019The).

The protein's activity is particularly important in tissues requiring large amounts of NADPH for fatty acid and steroid synthesis, highlighting its role in metabolic adaptation and cellular homeostasis (Zhao2009A).

## Clinical Significance
The transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) gene is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its role in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is crucial for tumor cell metabolism. Overexpression of TKTL1 is observed in several cancers, including colorectal, breast, prostate, gastric, and melanoma, and is often associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior (da2018Transketolase; Staiger2006Expression; Jayachandran2016Transketolaselike; Földi2007Transketolase; Xu2008Transketolase‐like).

In colorectal cancer, high TKTL1 expression is linked to shorter disease-free survival, particularly in cases with synchronous liver metastases (Peltonen2020High). In breast cancer, TKTL1 overexpression correlates with Her2/neu overexpression, although it does not directly correlate with patient outcomes (Földi2007Transketolase). In prostate cancer, increased TKTL1 expression is associated with advanced disease stages and higher Gleason scores (da2018Transketolase).

In melanoma, TKTL1 overexpression is driven by promoter hypomethylation, contributing to enhanced glycolytic activity and tumor progression (Jayachandran2016Transketolaselike). In gastric cancer, TKTL1 serves as a potential marker for poorly differentiated tumors, particularly in male patients (Staiger2006Expression). These findings suggest that TKTL1 could be a valuable target for therapeutic interventions across various cancer types.

## Interactions
TKTL1 (transketolase-like 1) is known to interact with transketolase (TKT) to form a stable heterodimer. This interaction has been confirmed through methods such as co-immunoprecipitation, affinity purification, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The dissociation constant (K D) of the TKTL1-TKT complex is similar to that of TKT-TKT homodimers, indicating a strong interaction (Li2019APCCCDH1). The TKTL1-TKT heterodimer exhibits asymmetric transketolase activities, with reduced activity in reactions that remove ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and increased activity in reactions that produce R5P. This is due to the heterodimer's weaker binding to X5P and stronger binding to S7P (Li2019APCCCDH1).

TKTL1 is also regulated by the APC/C CDH1 complex, which targets it for degradation. CDH1 overexpression reduces TKTL1 levels and enhances its ubiquitination, while CDH1 knockdown increases TKTL1 stability. The presence of a D-box in TKTL1, recognized by CDH1, is crucial for this regulation. Removal of the D-box weakens the interaction with CDH1 and affects ubiquitination (Li2019APCCCDH1). These interactions are significant for understanding TKTL1's role in cell cycle progression and its potential implications in cancer metabolism and growth.
