# IZUMO1R

## Overview
The IZUMO1R gene encodes the JUNO protein, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptor located on the surface of oocytes. JUNO plays a pivotal role in the fertilization process by serving as the receptor for the sperm protein IZUMO1, facilitating the recognition and fusion of gamete membranes. This interaction is essential for successful fertilization and is conserved across various mammalian species (Jean2018JUNO; Bianchi2015Crossspecies). Structurally, JUNO is characterized by a compact, globular form with specific secondary elements stabilized by disulfide bonds, and it shares similarities with human folate receptors, although it does not bind folate (Han2016Divergent; Aydin2016Molecular). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with reproductive disorders, such as fertilization failure and polyspermy, when mutations occur (Yu2017Mutational).

## Structure
The JUNO protein, also known as IZUMO1R, is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein located on the oocyte membrane. Its molecular structure is characterized by a compact, globular form. The primary structure of JUNO includes a specific amino acid sequence that is essential for its function as a receptor for the sperm protein IZUMO1 (Jean2018JUNO). 

The secondary structure of JUNO comprises five short α-helices, three 3_10 helices, and two short two-stranded antiparallel β-sheets. These elements are stabilized by eight conserved disulfide bonds, which maintain the integrity of the core helices and flexible loops (Aydin2016Molecular). 

JUNO shares structural similarities with human folate receptors, such as FOLR-α and FOLR-β, but lacks the key residues necessary for folate binding, indicating a divergent evolution in its binding capabilities (Han2016Divergent). The protein does not exhibit a quaternary structure as it functions as a monomer. Post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, are crucial for its function, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively documented in the provided context (Jean2018JUNO).

## Function
The human gene IZUMO1R, also known as JUNO, encodes a receptor protein that plays a critical role in the fertilization process. JUNO is expressed on the plasma membrane of human oocytes and is essential for the fusion of sperm and oocyte, a crucial step in fertilization (Jean2018JUNO). The protein functions as the receptor for the sperm protein IZUMO1, facilitating the recognition and adhesion of gamete membranes, which is necessary for successful fertilization (Jean2018JUNO).

JUNO is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, previously identified as a putative folate receptor, but its primary role in fertilization is the interaction with IZUMO1 (Jean2018JUNO). This interaction is conserved across several mammalian species, including humans, and is crucial for gamete membrane fusion (Jean2018JUNO). Blocking JUNO with specific monoclonal antibodies prevents sperm from fusing with the oocyte membrane, indicating its essential role in gamete membrane adhesion and fusion (Jean2018JUNO).

After fertilization, JUNO is rapidly shed from the egg membrane and redistributed within vesicles in the perivitelline space, which may act as sperm-blocking agents to prevent polyspermy, ensuring that only one sperm fuses with the egg (Bianchi2014Izumo).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IZUMO1R gene, also known as JUNO, have been implicated in reproductive disorders, particularly in the context of fertilization failure and polyspermy during in vitro fertilization (IVF). A study by Yu et al. identified four rare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IZUMO1R gene among women experiencing fertilization failure and polyspermy, which were absent in a control group. These included a missense SNP found in two patients with fertilization failure and a nonsynonymous SNP along with two synonymous SNPs found in cases of polyspermy. These genetic variations may disrupt the interaction between the JUNO receptor and its ligand, IZUMO1, which is crucial for gamete recognition and fusion, potentially leading to fertilization issues (Yu2017Mutational).

The study suggests that these mutations in the IZUMO1R gene could contribute to the pathogenesis of fertilization failure and polyspermy, highlighting the need for further research to understand their functional impact. While the research primarily focuses on reproductive implications, it underscores the importance of IZUMO1R in successful fertilization and suggests that disruptions in its function could have significant clinical consequences (Yu2017Mutational).

## Interactions
The human gene IZUMO1R, also known as JUNO, encodes a receptor protein that plays a critical role in the fertilization process by interacting with the sperm protein IZUMO1. This interaction is essential for sperm-egg recognition and fusion. JUNO is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein located on the surface of oocytes. It specifically binds to IZUMO1, a protein on the surface of acrosome-reacted sperm, facilitating the adhesion and fusion of gamete membranes (Bianchi2015Crossspecies; Chalbi2014Binding).

The interaction between JUNO and IZUMO1 involves a stable complex formation characterized by extensive non-bonded van der Waals, hydrophobic, and aromatic interactions, as well as electrostatic interactions, including salt bridges and hydrogen bonds (Aydin2016Molecular). This binding is crucial for the close apposition of sperm and egg membranes, leading to successful fertilization (Aydin2016Molecular).

Blocking JUNO with monoclonal antibodies has been shown to prevent sperm from fusing with the oocyte membrane, underscoring its essential role in gamete membrane adhesion and fusion (Jean2018JUNO). The interaction is conserved across species, as demonstrated by the ability of hamster JUNO to bind IZUMO1 from various species, including humans (Bianchi2015Crossspecies).
