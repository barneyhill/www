# MARCHF10

## Overview
MARCHF10, or membrane associated ring-CH-type finger 10, is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for tagging proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. As a membrane-associated protein, MARCHF10 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of immune responses and lipid metabolism. Its role in lipid metabolism is particularly significant, as it has been linked to phospholipid and triglyceride concentrations in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, with implications for cardiovascular health (Sandholm2022Wholeexome). The gene's involvement in metabolic regulation and immune function underscores its importance in maintaining physiological balance and its potential impact on health and disease.

## Function
MARCHF10, or membrane associated ring-CH-type finger 10, is a gene encoding a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. MARCHF10 is active in cellular membranes, where it plays a crucial role in modulating protein levels and ensuring proper cellular function. The ubiquitination process facilitated by MARCHF10 is essential for various cellular processes, including the regulation of immune responses and lipid metabolism (Sandholm2022Wholeexome).

In the context of lipid metabolism, MARCHF10 has been associated with phospholipid and triglyceride concentrations in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. A specific variant of MARCHF10, rs199705946, has been identified in the Finnish population and is predicted to be deleterious, suggesting a potential impact on protein function and lipid traits (Sandholm2022Wholeexome). Although the exact function of MARCHF10 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in lipid metabolism and potential implications for cardiovascular health highlight its significance in maintaining physiological balance (Sandholm2022Wholeexome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MARCHF10 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. In the Finnish population, a rare variant in MARCHF10 is suggestively linked to lower phospholipid concentrations in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, which could have implications for lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health (Sandholm2022Wholeexome). This variant is predicted to be deleterious, indicating potential adverse effects on lipid profiles and associated disease risks (Sandholm2022Wholeexome).

In the context of Girolando cattle, MARCHF10 has been identified as one of the genes associated with significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence milk yield, suggesting a role in metabolic processes (da2021SingleNucleotide). Although this finding is in cattle, it highlights the gene's potential involvement in metabolic regulation, which could be extrapolated to human health.

Additionally, MARCHF10 has been implicated in the differentiation of memory cells through DNA methylation changes, although specific clinical outcomes related to this function are not detailed (Zhang2022Comparative). These findings suggest that MARCHF10 may play a role in immune function and metabolic regulation, with potential implications for diseases related to these systems.
