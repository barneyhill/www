# NCAPH2

## Overview
NCAPH2 is a gene that encodes the non-SMC condensin II complex subunit H2, a crucial component of the condensin II complex involved in chromosome organization and stability. The protein plays a significant role in the axial compaction of chromosomes, which is essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis. It is categorized as a structural protein due to its involvement in maintaining chromosomal architecture. NCAPH2 localizes to telomeric regions, where it interacts with the shelterin protein TRF1, contributing to telomere stability and preventing dysfunction. Beyond its structural role, NCAPH2 is implicated in genome organization and transcriptional regulation, particularly at transcription factor interaction sites and TAD boundaries, supporting the expression of active gene clusters (Yuen2017Condensin; Wallace2019Condensin). Mutations in NCAPH2 have been associated with various diseases, including cancer and developmental disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic integrity (Weyburne2020Cancer‐associated; Martin2016Mutations).

## Function
NCAPH2 is a subunit of the condensin II complex, which plays a critical role in chromosome organization and stability in healthy human cells. This protein is involved in the axial compaction of chromosomes, a process essential for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (Wallace2019Condensin). NCAPH2 localizes to telomeric regions, where it interacts with the shelterin protein TRF1, contributing to telomere stability and preventing telomere dysfunction (Wallace2019Condensin). The interaction with TRF1 is crucial for maintaining telomere integrity, as depletion of NCAPH2 leads to DNA damage accumulation at telomeres and a fragile telomere phenotype (Wallace2019Condensin).

In addition to its role in telomere maintenance, NCAPH2 is involved in genome organization and transcriptional regulation. It colocalizes with TFIIIC binding sites, forming condensin-transcription factor interaction sites that are associated with transcriptional activity, particularly at the promoters of housekeeping genes (Yuen2017Condensin). NCAPH2 supports the expression of active gene clusters, including histone gene clusters, by maintaining interactions at TAD boundaries, which is essential for high expression levels of these genes (Yuen2017Condensin). This highlights its role in maintaining genomic stability and supporting gene expression in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NCAPH2 gene, which encodes a subunit of the condensin II complex, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and developmental disorders. In cancer, specific mutations such as R551P, R551S, and S556F in NCAPH2 are associated with genomic instability. These mutations lead to DNA damage, anaphase defects, and chromosomal instability, contributing to cancer progression by increasing genetic diversity in tumor cells (Weyburne2020Cancer‐associated). The mutations disrupt the formation of the condensin complex, resulting in telomere dysfunction and anaphase chromosome bridges, which are linked to cancer-associated genomic instability (Weyburne2020Cancer‐associated).

In developmental disorders, mutations in NCAPH2 are linked to microcephaly. For instance, the p.Ile15Asn missense mutation in a mouse model results in impaired chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to reduced brain size and cortical surface area (Martin2016Mutations). This mutation causes chromatin bridges during neurogenesis, leading to chromosome segregation errors and reduced neuronal proliferation, ultimately contributing to microcephaly (Martin2016Mutations).

Overall, alterations in NCAPH2 expression and function can significantly impact genomic stability, leading to various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
NCAPH2, a component of the condensin II complex, is involved in several critical interactions that contribute to its role in maintaining chromosome structure and telomere stability. NCAPH2 interacts with the shelterin protein TRF1, which is crucial for telomere protection and replication. This interaction has been confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that NCAPH2 associates with TRF1 at telomeric regions (Wallace2019Condensin). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments have shown that NCAPH2 binds to telomeric TTAGGG repeat sequences, suggesting a direct role in telomere maintenance (Wallace2019Condensin).

The interaction between NCAPH2 and TRF1 is significant for preventing telomeric DNA damage and maintaining telomere stability. Depletion of NCAPH2 leads to increased DNA damage markers at telomeres, highlighting its protective role (Wallace2019Condensin). NCAPH2 also appears to suppress ATR-mediated DNA damage signaling at telomeres, further supporting its involvement in telomere stability (Wallace2019Condensin). These interactions underscore the importance of NCAPH2 in chromosomal and telomeric integrity, particularly through its association with TRF1 and its role in the condensin II complex.
