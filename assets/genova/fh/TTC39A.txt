# TTC39A

## Overview
TTC39A is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39A, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein belongs to a family characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for the assembly of multiprotein complexes and the regulation of diverse biological functions. Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39A has been implicated in lipid metabolism and may play a role in the regulation of cholesterol levels, as well as in the modulation of inflammatory responses (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the function and interactions of TTC39A is important for elucidating its potential impact on human health and disease.
