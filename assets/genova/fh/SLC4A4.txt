# SLC4A4

## Overview
The SLC4A4 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 4 member 4, commonly referred to as NBCe1, which is a transmembrane sodium bicarbonate cotransporter. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining acid-base homeostasis by facilitating the transport of bicarbonate ions across cell membranes, thereby regulating intracellular and extracellular pH levels. NBCe1 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidneys, pancreas, eyes, and brain, where it contributes to essential physiological processes such as bicarbonate reabsorption, neuronal excitability modulation, and corneal transparency maintenance (Liu2015Structure; Igarashi1999Mutations). The gene's mutations are linked to clinical conditions like proximal renal tubular acidosis and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Inatomi2004Mutational; GilPerotín2021Epilepsy).

## Structure
The SLC4A4 gene encodes the NBCe1 protein, a member of the solute carrier family 4, which functions as a sodium bicarbonate cotransporter. NBCe1 has several splice variant isoforms, including NBCe1-A through -E, which result from the use of alternative promoters and cassette exons. These variants exhibit structural differences, particularly in the N-terminal (Nt) and C-terminal (Ct) regions. The initial 41 amino acids of the Nt region in NBCe1-A/D differ from the initial 85 amino acids in NBCe1-B/C/E due to alternative transcription. A 9 amino acid optional cassette in the Nt region results from alternative splicing (Liu2015Structure).

The Ct domain of NBCe1-C is unique, with the last 61 amino acids differing from other variants due to alternative splicing of exon 24, which contains a stop codon. This affects the length of the Ct domain, and the long Ct of NBCe1-C contains a PDZ-binding motif (Liu2015Structure). The Nt region is crucial for functional modulation, with NBCe1-A being stimulatory and NBCe1-B/C being inhibitory. The Nt region of NBCe1-B/C also contains structural determinants for binding IRBIT, which can stimulate transport activity (Liu2015Structure).

## Function
The SLC4A4 gene encodes the electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBCe1, which is crucial for maintaining acid-base homeostasis in the body. This transporter facilitates the movement of bicarbonate ions across cell membranes, playing a vital role in regulating intracellular and extracellular pH levels (Liu2015Structure). In the kidneys, NBCe1 is primarily active in the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in the proximal renal tubules, where it is responsible for reabsorbing more than 85% of the filtered bicarbonate load, a process essential for maintaining systemic acid-base balance (Schmitt1999Immunolocalization; Igarashi1999Mutations).

NBCe1 is also expressed in other tissues, including the pancreas, eyes, and brain, where it contributes to various physiological processes such as neuronal excitability modulation, corneal transparency maintenance, and digestion-related functions (Liu2015Structure). In the brain, NBCe1 variants are expressed by astrocytes and are involved in modulating neuronal excitability by acting as acid extruders to regulate local pH (GilPerotín2021Epilepsy). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining pH equilibrium, which is significant for cellular homeostasis and various biological processes (Liu2022SLC4A4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC4A4 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting the kidneys and eyes. The gene encodes the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBCe1, which is crucial for bicarbonate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules. Mutations in SLC4A4 can lead to permanent isolated proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA), characterized by impaired bicarbonate reabsorption, resulting in metabolic acidosis and low plasma bicarbonate levels. This condition is often accompanied by ocular abnormalities such as glaucoma, cataracts, and band keratopathy (Inatomi2004Mutational; Igarashi1999Mutations).

In addition to renal and ocular symptoms, SLC4A4 mutations can cause neurological complications, including epilepsy, status epilepticus, and hemiplegic migraine. These neurological issues are thought to arise from the role of NBCe1 in modulating neuronal excitability by regulating local pH in the brain (GilPerotín2021Epilepsy).

Altered expression of SLC4A4 has also been implicated in colorectal cancer. Reduced expression of the gene is associated with poor prognosis and increased cancer cell proliferation and migration, particularly in the context of microsatellite instability (Rui2023Prognostic).

## Interactions
SLC4A4, also known as NBCe1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in ion transport and cellular processes. In prostate cancer cells, SLC4A4 interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (RB), and this interaction is diminished upon SLC4A4 knockdown, leading to hypophosphorylation of RB and cell cycle arrest (Rashid2022Dissecting). This suggests a role for SLC4A4 in cell cycle regulation through the SLC4A4/RB axis.

SLC4A4 is also implicated in the regulation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. Knockdown of SLC4A4 results in decreased β-catenin protein levels and increased phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/37, potentially through the activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β). This interaction is part of the SLC4A4/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling axis, which affects cell invasion and migration in prostate cancer (Rashid2022Dissecting).

In breast cancer cells, SLC4A4 may interact with carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) to maintain an alkaline intracellular pH, which is crucial for tumor cell survival. The relationship between SLC4A4 and CA IX is highlighted by the observation that CA IX silencing increases SLC4A4 mRNA under hypoxic conditions (Parks2015The).
