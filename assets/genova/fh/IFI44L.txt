# IFI44L

## Overview
IFI44L is a gene that encodes the protein interferon-induced protein 44-like, which is part of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) family. This protein plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in antiviral defense mechanisms. It is primarily involved in inhibiting viral replication and modulating immune responses through the interferon signaling pathway. The protein is active in the cytoplasm and exhibits antiproliferative activity, which is linked to the activation of specific signaling pathways such as Met/Src (Busse2020InterferonInduced; Lempainen2020Associations). IFI44L has been associated with variations in immune responses to viral infections and vaccinations, and its expression levels have clinical significance in diseases such as cancer and autoimmune disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (Haralambieva2017Genomewide; Lempainen2020Associations).

## Function
The IFI44L gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in the immune response, particularly in antiviral defense mechanisms. It is part of the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and is transcriptionally induced by type I interferon signaling, which is crucial in the innate immune response (Lempainen2020Associations). IFI44L is involved in inhibiting viral replication, as demonstrated by its ability to restrict the replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) when overexpressed, while knockout of the gene increases infection levels (Busse2020InterferonInduced). 

The protein encoded by IFI44L is active in the cytoplasm and is associated with antiproliferative activity, which is linked to increased activation of Met/Src signaling pathways (Busse2020InterferonInduced). This antiproliferative effect is not due to increased cytotoxicity but rather a reduction in cellular proliferation, which is a common feature of the interferon response (Busse2020InterferonInduced). 

IFI44L also plays a role in modulating immune responses, particularly through the interferon signaling pathway, and has been linked to variations in immune response to viral infections and vaccinations (Haralambieva2017Genomewide; Lempainen2020Associations).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IFI44L gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and autoimmune disorders. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), higher expression levels of IFI44L are associated with better prognosis and increased tumor immune infiltration. IFI44L acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) cells. It is involved in various cancer-related pathways, such as the JAK/STAT and NF-kB signaling pathways, and its expression is correlated with the presence of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, which are linked to favorable survival outcomes (Zeng2022Comprehensive).

In autoimmune diseases, IFI44L is notably involved in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The gene is hypomethylated in SLE patients, particularly during disease flare-ups, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease activity. This hypomethylation is observed across various cell types, including CD4+ T-cells and monocytes, and is associated with the interferon signature characteristic of SLE. IFI44L's methylation status changes during remission, indicating its role in monitoring disease activity (Ulff‐Møller2018Twin).
