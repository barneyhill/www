# FUOM

## Overview
The FUOM gene is responsible for encoding the enzyme fucose mutarotase, which is a key player in carbohydrate metabolism. Fucose mutarotase is an isomerase enzyme that facilitates the interconversion between the α-L-fucose and β-L-fucose isomers, a process vital for the synthesis and modification of glycans. These glycans are integral to numerous cellular functions, including cell-cell communication, immune responses, and protein stability. The enzyme operates predominantly in the cytoplasm, ensuring the availability of GDP-fucose, which is essential for the fucosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This post-translational modification is critical for the stability and function of these molecules, impacting various physiological processes. Disruptions in the activity of fucose mutarotase can lead to significant developmental and physiological abnormalities, highlighting its importance in human health (Park2010Malelike).

## Function
The FUOM gene encodes the enzyme fucose mutarotase, which plays a critical role in the metabolism of fucose, a hexose deoxy sugar. This enzyme is involved in the interconversion of fucose isomers, specifically facilitating the conversion between α-L-fucose and β-L-fucose. This conversion is essential for the synthesis and modification of glycans, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell-cell communication, immune response, and protein stability (Park2010Malelike).

In healthy human cells, fucose mutarotase is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the proper functioning of glycoproteins and glycolipids. These molecules are vital for maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating interactions between cells and their environment. The enzyme's activity ensures the availability of GDP-fucose, a donor substrate for fucosylation, which is a post-translational modification process that attaches fucose to proteins and lipids. This modification is important for the stability and secretion of various glycoproteins, influencing their biological activity and function (Park2010Malelike).

The proper functioning of fucose mutarotase is crucial for normal development and physiological processes, as evidenced by the impact of impaired fucosylation in congenital disorders of glycosylation, which can lead to developmental alterations in the brain, liver, and immune system (Park2010Malelike).
