# TRIP4

## Overview
The TRIP4 gene encodes the protein thyroid hormone receptor interactor 4, also known as Activating Signal Cointegrator-1 (ASC-1), which functions as a transcriptional coactivator. This protein is a crucial component of the ASC-1 complex, a tetrameric structure involved in transcriptional coactivation and RNA processing. ASC-1 plays a significant role in the transactivation of nuclear receptors and interacts with various transcription factors, influencing pathways such as NF-kappa-B and others related to cellular metabolism and growth (Jung2002Novel; Dembour2022ASC1). The TRIP4 gene is essential for normal cellular processes, including transcription, splicing, and cell cycle regulation, and is implicated in myogenesis and cancer progression (Chi2018The; Meunier2021Inherited). Mutations in TRIP4 are associated with congenital myopathies and peripheral neuropathies, highlighting its clinical significance (Frongia2024‘A; Villar‐Quiles2019ASC‐1).

## Function
The TRIP4 gene encodes the Activating Signal Cointegrator-1 (ASC-1) protein, which functions as a transcriptional coactivator in human cells. ASC-1 is a component of the ASC-1 complex, a tetrameric structure that includes ASCC-1, ASCC-2, and ASCC-3, and is involved in transcriptional coactivation and RNA processing events (Dembour2022ASC1). TRIP4 plays a crucial role in the transactivation of nuclear receptors, including the NF-kappa-B pathway, and is involved in transcriptional regulation by interacting with transcription factors such as serum response factor (SRF), activating protein 1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor B (NF-B) (Jung2002Novel).

In healthy cells, TRIP4 is part of the RNAP II/U1 snRNP machinery, which is essential for transcription, splicing, and other RNA processing activities (Chi2018The). The ASC-1 complex, including TRIP4, acts as a transcriptional signal cointegrator, modulating gene expression in a tissue-specific manner and adapting cellular metabolism to environmental changes (Dembour2022ASC1). TRIP4 is also involved in cell cycle regulation, influencing cell proliferation and muscle cell growth, which are key processes in myogenesis (Meunier2021Inherited). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other transcription factors to modulate cellular processes like metabolism, growth, and development (Meunier2021Inherited).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRIP4 gene, which encodes the transcriptional coactivator ASC-1, are associated with a range of congenital myopathies. These myopathies can vary in severity from lethal neonatal conditions to milder adult forms. Clinical manifestations include early-onset axial and proximal muscle weakness, scoliosis, rigid spine, dysmorphic facies, respiratory failure, and in some cases, dilated cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies from affected individuals often reveal abnormalities such as multiminicores, nemaline rods, and cytoplasmic bodies (Villar‐Quiles2019ASC‐1).

A loss-of-function mutation in TRIP4 can lead to a novel form of congenital muscle disease characterized by neonatal-onset muscle weakness, respiratory failure, skin abnormalities, and joint hyperlaxity. This mutation results in a significant reduction in TRIP4 mRNA levels and absence of detectable protein in patient cells (Davignon2016Lossoffunction).

TRIP4 mutations have also been linked to peripheral neuropathy, expanding the clinical spectrum of ASC-1 related myopathy. Patients with these mutations may present with mixed sensory-motor polyneuropathy, severe hypotonia, and respiratory distress (Frongia2024‘A).

In cancer, TRIP4 is implicated in cervical cancer, where its overexpression is associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and poor prognosis. TRIP4 influences cancer progression through the activation of MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and hTERT signaling pathways (Che2019TRIP4).

## Interactions
TRIP4, also known as thyroid hormone receptor interactor 4, is a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is a subunit of the nuclear activating signal co-integrator 1 (ASC-1) complex and interacts with the ASCC3 helicase region. This interaction is mediated through TRIP4's zinc finger (ZnF) domain, which binds to the RecA1 domain of ASCC3, forming a stable complex essential for transcription regulation and ribosome quality control (Jia2022Extended). TRIP4 also enhances the helicase activity of ASCC3, influencing DNA and RNA unwinding processes (Jia2022Extended).

TRIP4 is involved in the regulation of signaling pathways such as MAPK and PI3K/AKT, which are crucial for cervical cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. It interacts with proteins like hTERT, p-AKT, and p-ERK, promoting tumor growth and affecting radiosensitivity (Che2019TRIP4). In colorectal cancer, TRIP4 is a direct target of miR-518-3p, which regulates its expression and influences metastasis-related genes such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Yang2020MicroRNA5183p). These interactions highlight TRIP4's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
