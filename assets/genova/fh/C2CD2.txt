# C2CD2

## Overview
C2CD2 is a gene that encodes the protein C2 calcium-dependent domain containing 2, which plays a significant role in cellular processes by forming endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions at cell-cell contact sites. This protein is categorized as a membrane-associated protein involved in lipid transport and cellular signaling. C2CD2 interacts with band 4.1 family proteins, which are part of the plasma membrane-associated cytoskeleton, facilitating its localization at cell-cell interfaces. Unlike its paralog TMEM24, C2CD2 remains associated with the plasma membrane even in elevated calcium conditions, indicating a unique regulatory mechanism. The protein is broadly expressed across various tissues, with notable enrichment in the liver, suggesting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and intercellular communication (Johnson2023A; Sun2019Lipid).

## Function
C2CD2 is a protein involved in the formation of endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions at cell-cell contact sites. These junctions are crucial for lipid transport and cellular signaling. C2CD2, along with its paralog TMEM24, interacts with band 4.1 family proteins, which are components of the plasma membrane-associated cytoskeleton. This interaction is mediated by a β-sheet motif in C2CD2, which helps localize it at cell-cell contacts, potentially involving other cell adhesion proteins like CD44 and β-integrins (Johnson2023A).

C2CD2 functions as an ER-PM tether, maintaining these contact sites, but unlike TMEM24, it does not dissociate from the plasma membrane in response to elevated calcium levels due to the absence of specific phosphorylation sites. This suggests a distinct regulatory mechanism and function in different tissues, as C2CD2 is broadly expressed across various tissues, including the liver, where it is enriched (Sun2019Lipid).

The presence of C2CD2 at ER-PM junctions suggests a role in coordinating extracellular interactions and lipid transport, which is important for intercellular signaling and homeostatic responses to lipid perturbations (Johnson2023A).

## Interactions
C2CD2 is involved in forming endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER/PM) junctions at cell-cell contact sites, where it interacts with band 4.1 proteins. This interaction is facilitated by a β-sheet motif, which is crucial for the accumulation of C2CD2 at cell-cell interfaces. The C-terminal polybasic motif of C2CD2 binds to the acidic cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane, aiding in its localization (Johnson2023A). Band 4.1 proteins, which can bind various plasma membrane proteins through their FERM domain, act as bridges between the ER and the PM, suggesting that C2CD2 may participate in lipid transport at these junctions (Johnson2023A).

C2CD2 is also suggested to interact with cell adhesion molecules such as SynCAM 1, CD44, CADM4, and β-integrins, which contribute to its localization at cell-cell contacts (Johnson2023A). Although specific physical interactions of C2CD2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its association with TMEM24 and band 4.1 proteins at ER/PM contacts indicates a role in supporting signaling reactions at these sites (Johnson2023A). The potential for heterodimerization between TMEM24 and C2CD2 through their SMP domains has been suggested, indicating that they can form heterodimers in cells where both proteins are expressed (Sun2019Lipid).
