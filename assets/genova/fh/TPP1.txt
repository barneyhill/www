# TPP1

## Overview
The TPP1 gene encodes the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1, which is a serine protease involved in the degradation of proteins within lysosomes. This enzyme plays a critical role in cellular protein turnover by sequentially removing tripeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides, thus contributing to cellular homeostasis and metabolism (Santos2020Tripeptidyl; Collier2019Protein). TPP1 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme and undergoes proteolytic processing to become active in the acidic environment of the lysosome (Santos2020Tripeptidyl). The enzyme's activity is essential for preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins, which is vital for normal cellular function and organismal health (Cruz2019Lysosomal). Mutations in the TPP1 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, including Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2 disease) and autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCAR7), highlighting its clinical significance (Sun2013Autosomal; Ma2021Generation).

## Structure
Tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) is a lysosomal serine protease encoded by the TPP1 gene. The primary structure of TPP1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a 544-amino acid proenzyme, which is processed into a mature enzyme of 368 amino acids (Walus2010Functional). The secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function.

The tertiary structure of TPP1 forms a compact, globular shape, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure is stabilized by calcium ions, which are crucial for the autocatalytic cleavage of the proenzyme to its mature form (Kuizon2010A). The quaternary structure involves dimerization, which may play a role in its function and stability.

TPP1 contains a peptidase S53 domain, characteristic of the sedolisin family, and exhibits a subtilisin-like fold with a unique catalytic triad composed of Ser-475, Glu-272, and Asp-360 (Wujek2004NGlycosylation; Kuizon2010A). Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, are critical for its folding, stability, and lysosomal targeting, with five potential N-glycosylation sites identified (Wujek2004NGlycosylation). Splice variant isoforms may exist, potentially affecting the enzyme's function and localization.

## Function
Tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) is a lysosomal enzyme encoded by the TPP1 gene, playing a crucial role in protein degradation within lysosomes. It primarily functions as a tripeptidyl exopeptidase, sequentially removing tripeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides, which is essential for cellular protein turnover and homeostasis (Santos2020Tripeptidyl; Collier2019Protein). TPP1 is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme and becomes active after proteolytic processing in the acidic environment of the lysosome (Santos2020Tripeptidyl; Collier2019Protein).

The enzyme is involved in the degradation of various proteins, contributing to the recycling of amino acids and peptides for cellular metabolism (Santos2020Tripeptidyl). TPP1's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins, which is vital for normal cellular function and organismal health (Cruz2019Lysosomal). The enzyme is trafficked to the lysosome via mannose-6-phosphate receptors, which recognize its glycosylation sites, ensuring its proper localization and function within the cell (Collier2019Protein).

In addition to its role in protein degradation, TPP1 is implicated in various physiological processes, including bone degradation and tumor invasion, and is associated with endometrial receptivity, highlighting its diverse functions in human biology (Santos2020Tripeptidyl).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TPP1 gene are primarily associated with Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2 disease), a severe neurodegenerative disorder. CLN2 disease is characterized by seizures, vision loss, progressive motor and mental decline, and premature death, typically manifesting between the ages of 2 to 4 years (Sun2013Autosomal; Ma2021Generation). The condition results from loss-of-function mutations in the TPP1 gene, leading to deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP1) (Gardner2019Mutation). Two prevalent pathogenic variants, c.509-1 G>C and c.622 C>T (p.(Arg208*)), are found in approximately 60% of affected individuals (Gardner2019Mutation; Ma2021Generation).

In addition to CLN2 disease, TPP1 mutations are linked to autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCAR7), where variants reduce but do not abolish TPP1 activity (Sun2013Autosomal). TPP1 is also involved in telomere maintenance as part of the shelterin complex. Mutations such as K170Δ in the TEL patch of TPP1 impair telomerase recruitment and are associated with Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, a severe variant of dyskeratosis congenita (Kocak2014HoyeraalHreidarsson). These mutations can lead to telomere dysfunction, contributing to clinical manifestations like bone marrow failure (Guo2014Inherited).

## Interactions
TPP1 (tripeptidyl peptidase 1) is known to interact with various proteins, although the specific interactions and roles outside the lysosome are not fully characterized. TPP1 has been reported to interact with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) proteins, suggesting a role in the pathology of late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) (Getty2010Interactions). The protein is involved in lysosomal processes and has been shown to have activity on substrates such as angiotensin-I and -II, cholecystokinin, neuromedin B, Bid during apoptosis, and the mitochondrial ATP-synthase subunit C (Getty2010Interactions).

In the context of axonal mitochondrial transport, TPP1 acts as a negative regulator. Inhibition or knockdown of TPP1 enhances mitochondrial motility, indicating its role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics in neurons (Shlevkov2019A). The exact mechanism by which TPP1 influences mitochondrial transport remains unclear, but it is suggested that TPP1's regulatory role could be linked to its interactions with other proteins involved in mitochondrial trafficking (Shlevkov2019A).

TPP1's interactions are also implicated in endometrial receptivity, where its expression affects epithelial cell adhesion, potentially through interactions with proteins like SIRT1 (Santos2020Tripeptidyl). These interactions highlight TPP1's diverse roles in cellular processes beyond its enzymatic activity.
