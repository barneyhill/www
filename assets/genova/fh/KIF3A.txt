# KIF3A

## Overview
KIF3A is a gene that encodes the kinesin family member 3A protein, a crucial component of the kinesin-II motor protein complex. This protein is categorized as a motor protein and plays a significant role in intracellular transport along microtubules. Kinesin family member 3A is essential for the formation and function of cilia, both motile and nonmotile, and is involved in various cellular processes, including protein trafficking, cell proliferation, and cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein's function extends to influencing key signaling pathways such as Shh, Wnt, and Pdgf, which are vital for morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis. KIF3A's interactions with other proteins, such as KIF3B and KAP3, form a heterotrimeric complex that facilitates anterograde transport of organelles, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular function and structure (Boehlke2013Kif3a; Giridhar2016Airway).

## Structure
KIF3A is a motor protein that is part of the kinesin superfamily, primarily involved in intracellular transport along microtubules. The primary structure of KIF3A consists of 701 amino acids, featuring a motor-like domain at the NH2 terminus, an alpha-helical domain in the middle, and a proline-rich globular domain at the COOH terminus (Kondo1994KIF3A). The secondary structure includes an alpha-helix-rich rod domain, which contributes to its overall rod-like shape (Kondo1994KIF3A).

The tertiary structure of KIF3A involves a coiled-coil region that facilitates dimerization, particularly in the neck regions, which are crucial for its function as a motor protein (chana2005stability). The quaternary structure of KIF3A is characterized by its assembly into a heterotrimeric complex with KIF3B and KAP3, forming a functional unit that is essential for its role in vesicle transport (Yamazaki1996Cloning; Seog2004Molecular).

KIF3A does not exhibit a fan-like tail structure, unlike conventional kinesin, possibly due to the absence of light chains, as it consists only of heavy chains (Kondo1994KIF3A). The protein is sensitive to AMP-PNP, which affects its motility, and it promotes the translocation of microtubules toward the minus end (Kondo1994KIF3A).

## Function
The KIF3A gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the kinesin-II motor protein complex, which is essential for microtubular function and transport in healthy human cells. This protein plays a significant role in the formation and function of both motile and nonmotile cilia. In the lungs, motile cilia are responsible for mucociliary clearance, a process crucial for maintaining respiratory health by removing mucus and trapped particles from the airways (Giridhar2016Airway). KIF3A is also involved in the regulation of intracellular protein trafficking and ciliary transport, influencing pathways such as Shh, Wnt, and Pdgf, which are important for morphogenesis, homeostasis, and repair of various organs (Giridhar2016Airway).

In addition to its role in cilia, KIF3A is implicated in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, intracellular transport, cytoskeletal dynamics, and planar polarity. It is crucial for the migration and movement of bronchial epithelial cells, as its inhibition leads to impaired cell movement and migration, affecting airway epithelial repair (Giridhar2016Airway). KIF3A's function extends beyond ciliary roles, as it is involved in microtubule dynamics and morphogenesis, influencing cell migration and the formation of multicellular structures (Boehlke2013Kif3a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KIF3A gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving allergic and respiratory conditions. In atopic dermatitis (AD), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in KIF3A, such as rs11740584 and rs2299007, create new CpG sites that become highly methylated, leading to decreased KIF3A expression. This reduction in expression is associated with increased transepidermal water loss and skin barrier dysfunction, contributing to AD susceptibility (Stevens2020Diseaseassociated). KIF3A is also linked to the atopic march, which includes the progression to other allergic conditions like asthma and allergic rhinitis (Stevens2020Diseaseassociated).

In asthma, KIF3A polymorphisms are associated with aspirin hypersensitivity, affecting the decline of FEV1 upon aspirin provocation. This suggests a role for KIF3A in the development of aspirin hypersensitivity in asthmatics (Kim2010KIF3A). Altered KIF3A expression in bronchial epithelial cells is linked to increased apoptosis and inflammation, contributing to asthma pathogenesis (Geng2018KIF3A).

KIF3A is also involved in bone formation, where its deletion in osteoblasts leads to osteopenia, characterized by reduced bone mineral density and impaired osteoblast function (Qiu2012Disruption). In medulloblastoma, KIF3A is necessary for tumor initiation and maintenance, highlighting its role in certain cancers (Barakat2013Kif3a).

## Interactions
KIF3A is a motor protein that forms part of the kinesin-2 complex, interacting with KIF3B and KAP3 to facilitate intracellular transport. KIF3A and KIF3B form a heterodimer that associates with KAP3, creating a heterotrimeric complex. This complex is involved in the anterograde transport of membranous organelles along microtubules. KAP3 binds to the tail domain of the KIF3A/3B heterodimer, but does not affect its motor activity, suggesting a role in regulating membrane binding (Yamazaki1996Cloning).

KIF3A also interacts with RNF33, a testis-specific protein, through its carboxyl non-motor portion. This interaction is independent of KAP3, indicating that RNF33 does not associate with the KIF3A/KIF3B/KAP3 complex. The interaction between KIF3A and RNF33 involves the rod domain of KIF3A, with the tail domain playing a modulatory role (Huang2011Association).

In addition, KIF3A forms a complex with KIF3C, another kinesin motor protein, in neuronal cells. KIF3A and KIF3C interact specifically, forming a complex distinct from the KIF3A/KIF3B complex, as KIF3B does not coimmunoprecipitate with KIF3C (Muresan1998KIF3C).

KIF3A also interacts with the dynactin subunit p150 Glued, which is crucial for organizing centriole subdistal appendages. This interaction is mediated by the carboxy-terminal domain of KIF3A and is essential for microtubule anchoring and centriole cohesion (Kodani2013Kif3a).
