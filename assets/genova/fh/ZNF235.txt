# ZNF235

## Overview
ZNF235 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 235, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of multiple zinc finger domains. These domains are critical for the protein's role as a transcription factor, enabling it to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate gene expression. The protein also contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, specifically the KRAB-A domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression. Notably, the human ZNF235 includes the KRAB-B domain, which is absent in its mouse ortholog, Zfp235, highlighting species-specific differences in its regulatory functions (Shannon2003Differential). The high degree of conservation in the zinc finger domains across species underscores the evolutionary importance of ZNF235 in maintaining precise DNA interactions (Shannon2003Differential).

## Structure
ZNF235 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of multiple zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding function. The protein contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, specifically the KRAB-A domain, which is involved in transcriptional repression. The KRAB-B domain is absent in the mouse ortholog, Zfp235, but is present in the human ZNF235 (Shannon2003Differential). The zinc finger domains of ZNF235 are highly conserved, with a 94% identity over 418 amino acids, indicating a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain these structures for DNA interaction (Shannon2003Differential). 

The primary structure of ZNF235 includes a series of zinc finger motifs arranged in tandem, which are essential for its function as a transcription factor. These motifs are stabilized by zinc ions, allowing the protein to bind to specific DNA sequences. The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the available context, but the conservation of the zinc finger domains suggests a stable and specific folding pattern necessary for its function. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which can influence its activity and stability, although specific modifications for ZNF235 are not detailed in the context. Splice variant isoforms may exist, contributing to functional diversity (Shannon2003Differential; Schmidt2004Adaptive).
