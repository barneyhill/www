# KCTD11

## Overview
KCTD11, also known as the potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 11, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression and regulation of signaling pathways. The protein encoded by KCTD11 is characterized by a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and is crucial for its function as an adaptor molecule in the Cullin3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein plays a significant role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway by mediating the ubiquitination and degradation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), thereby influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Skoblov2013Protein; Liu2013The). KCTD11 is expressed in two splice variant isoforms, sKCTD11 and lKCTD11, which may have distinct roles in cellular signaling (Liu2013The). The gene is located on chromosome 17p13.2 and is often downregulated in various cancers, highlighting its importance as a tumor suppressor (Di2004REN; Argenti2005Hedgehog).

## Structure
KCTD11 is characterized by the presence of a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain, which is a versatile protein-protein interaction motif. This domain is crucial for the protein's ability to mediate interactions with other proteins, including its potential role in binding to cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (Teng2019KCTD:; Liu2013The). The BTB domain in KCTD11 facilitates the formation of pentameric homo-oligomers, which are important for its function in cellular processes (Teng2019KCTD:).

KCTD11 is expressed in two splice variant isoforms, sKCTD11 and lKCTD11, both of which contain the BTB domain (Liu2013The). These isoforms may have distinct roles in cellular signaling pathways, such as the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, where KCTD11 is known to mediate histone deacetylase (HDAC1) ubiquitination and degradation, thereby affecting Hh/Gli signaling (Liu2013The).

The protein is also involved in tumor suppression, promoting growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis, and is often downregulated in various cancers (Angrisani2021The). Despite its significant roles, specific details about the tertiary structure of KCTD11 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
KCTD11, also known as REN, is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in healthy human cells. It is characterized by a conserved N-terminal BTB domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and functions as an adaptor molecule for the Cullin3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of substrate proteins, including histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), which leads to reduced Hedgehog (Hh)/Gli signaling (Skoblov2013Protein; Liu2013The).

KCTD11 acts as a suppressor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In healthy cells, KCTD11 inhibits cell proliferation and promotes differentiation by antagonizing the Gli-mediated transactivation of Hedgehog target genes. This function is vital for maintaining normal cell growth and preventing tumorigenesis, particularly in neural progenitor cells and the cerebellum (Di2004REN).

KCTD11 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates cellular functions by interacting with other proteins. Its expression is regulated by the transcription factor Sp1 and DNA methylation, indicating its active role in normal cellular processes (Mancarelli2010The).

## Clinical Significance
The KCTD11 gene, also known as REN, is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17p13.2 and is implicated in various cancers, particularly medulloblastoma, a common childhood brain malignancy. In medulloblastoma, KCTD11 is frequently deleted or downregulated, with allelic deletion occurring in 39% of sporadic cases. This downregulation leads to the deregulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, contributing to tumorigenesis by allowing uncontrolled proliferation of cerebellar granule progenitors (Di2004REN; Argenti2005Hedgehog).

KCTD11 is also downregulated in several other cancers, including those of the larynx, esophagus, stomach, colon-rectum, urinary bladder, lung, breast, gallbladder, and endometrium, often due to loss of heterozygosity and epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation (Mancarelli2010The). In prostate adenocarcinoma, KCTD11 expression is reduced, with loss of heterozygosity observed in 45% of analyzed tissues. This reduction is associated with the overexpression of proteins involved in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, indicating its role as an inhibitor of this pathway (Zazzeroni2014KCTD11Tumor).

The gene's promoter region contains several Sp1 binding sites, and the transcription factor Sp1, along with DNA methylation, plays a role in regulating KCTD11 expression. Alterations in Sp1 binding or promoter methylation could impact KCTD11 expression in tumors (Mancarelli2010The).

## Interactions
KCTD11, also known as REN, is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular processes. It interacts with Cullin3 (Cul3) to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins such as histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) (Correale2011Molecular; Liu2013The). This interaction is mediated by the BTB domain of KCTD11, which forms a tetrameric structure that binds Cul3 in a 4:4 stoichiometry (Correale2011Molecular).

KCTD11 also interacts with the transcription factor Gli1, influencing the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is implicated in various cancers (Correale2011Molecular). In the context of medulloblastoma, KCTD11 acts as a substrate receptor for the CRL3REN complex, targeting SALL4 for degradation. This interaction is significant in regulating the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, as SALL4 enhances the transcriptional activity of Gli1 (Lospinoso2023SALL4).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, KCTD11 is involved in inhibiting cell adhesion, migration, and invasion by repressing proteins such as CTGF and CLDN1, and by modulating the Hippo signaling pathway (Tong2017KCTD11). These interactions highlight KCTD11's role as a tumor suppressor and its potential as a therapeutic target.
