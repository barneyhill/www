# CAPRIN2

## Overview
CAPRIN2 is a gene that encodes the protein caprin family member 2, which is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a C-terminal C1q-related domain and a dimerization domain, which facilitate its role in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and RNA regulation (Miao2014Structural; Wu2019Crystal). Caprin-2 is implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation, particularly in the context of the central osmotic defense response and neuronal development (Wu2015Bacterial; Konopacka2015RNA). Clinically, CAPRIN2 is associated with various cancers, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma and colorectal cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and prognosis (Qiu2022CAPRIN2; He2021The). The protein's ability to form homodimers and interact with other molecular partners underscores its significance in cellular signaling and disease mechanisms (Zhu2020Crystal).

## Structure
The CAPRIN2 protein is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. It contains a C-terminal C1q-related domain (CRD), which is crucial for its role in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. This domain forms a homotrimeric assembly with a 10-stranded jelly roll folding topology, similar to Collagen VIII NC1, although it lacks a collagen-like region, which may contribute to its intrinsic instability (Miao2014Structural). The trimerization of the CRD is mediated by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, and while calcium ions are present, they are not essential for trimer formation but help stabilize the structure by balancing electrostatic charges (Miao2014Structural).

CAPRIN2 also features a dimerization domain within the HR1 region, which forms a head-to-head dimer with an all α-helical fold consisting of five α-helices. This domain is structurally similar to that of Caprin-1, but with different molecular surface properties that may influence protein interactions (Wu2019Crystal). The dimerization interface involves intermolecular hydrophobic contacts, electrostatic interactions, and hydrogen bonds (Wu2019Crystal).

The protein has multiple isoforms, with the longest human isoform containing 1127 amino acids (Miao2014Structural). The presence of a C-terminal RGG motif suggests a role in RNA binding, and the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could affect its function (Konopacka2015RNA).

## Function
CAPRIN2 is a gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CAPRIN2 plays a significant role in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, where it acts as a scaffold protein within LRP5/6 signalosomes. It facilitates the phosphorylation of LRP5/6, a crucial step in Wnt signaling, by forming a homotrimer mediated by calcium ions. This trimeric assembly is essential for its function, although calcium binding itself is not necessary for maintaining the trimeric form (Miao2014Structural).

CAPRIN2 is also involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation. It interacts with the mRNA of arginine vasopressin (AVP), increasing its abundance and poly(A) tail length, which is crucial for the central osmotic defense response. This regulation is specific to AVP mRNA and is important for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis during osmotic stress (Konopacka2015RNA).

In the brain, CAPRIN2 is highly expressed and localized to neuronal RNA granules, where it influences neuronal development and function. It is involved in the developmental transition from rapid proliferation to terminal differentiation, particularly in neurons (Wu2015Bacterial; Wu2019Crystal).

## Clinical Significance
CAPRIN2 is implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or interactions. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), CAPRIN2 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its upregulation, driven by LINC00941, promotes resistance to ferroptosis and enhances metastatic colonization through the HMGCR pathway. This makes CAPRIN2 an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in NPC patients, correlating with advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages and metastasis (Qiu2022CAPRIN2).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), CAPRIN2 is part of a five-gene RNA binding protein signature that helps stratify patients into risk groups. It is significantly upregulated in CRC cells, suggesting a role in cancer progression. CAPRIN2's involvement in CRC is linked to its ability to inhibit cell growth and enhance WNT signaling, contributing to its classification as an oncoprotein in other cancers like hepatoblastoma and oral squamous cell carcinoma (He2021The).

CAPRIN2 also plays a role in the central osmotic defense response by regulating arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNA stability under osmotic stress. Alterations in CAPRIN2 expression affect fluid homeostasis, as observed in studies involving osmotic stress in rats (Konopacka2015RNA).

## Interactions
Caprin-2, encoded by the CAPRIN2 gene, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It is known to bind directly to arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNA, enhancing its abundance and poly(A) tail length, which is crucial for the physiological response to osmotic stress (Konopacka2015RNA). This interaction is particularly evident in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, where Caprin-2 modulates AVP mRNA levels and stability (Konopacka2015RNA).

Caprin-2 also participates in the Wnt signaling pathway by interacting with low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6), which are coreceptors for Frizzled (Wu2019Crystal). Structurally, Caprin-2 forms homodimers through a conserved dimerization domain, which is a feature shared with other members of the Caprin protein family. This domain facilitates the formation of macromolecular assemblies such as neuronal RNA granules and stress granules (Zhu2020Crystal).

The protein's dimerization domain, characterized by a V-shaped concave surface, may serve as a binding groove for other proteins, contributing to its functional specificity and interaction with various molecular partners (Zhu2020Crystal).
