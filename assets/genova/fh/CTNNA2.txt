# CTNNA2

## Overview
CTNNA2, or catenin alpha 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the catenin family, which plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion and signaling. The protein, catenin alpha 2, is a key component of the cadherin-catenin complex, essential for maintaining cell-cell adhesion and tissue integrity. It is particularly significant in neural development, where it influences neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity. Catenin alpha 2 functions as a tumor suppressor by modulating signaling pathways such as NF-kB, and its expression is often altered in various cancers, including neuroblastoma and laryngeal carcinoma. Additionally, mutations in CTNNA2 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in brain development and function (Wen2021Catenin; Clark2021Reactivation; FanjulFernández2013Cell–cell).

## Structure
CTNNA2 (catenin alpha 2) encodes a protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling, playing a crucial role in the cadherin adhesion complex. The primary structure of CTNNA2 consists of amino acid sequences forming the polypeptide chain. The protein includes specific domains such as the armadillo repeat domain, which is essential for protein-protein interactions, particularly in binding to cadherins and actin filaments (FanjulFernández2013Cell–cell). 

The secondary structure of CTNNA2 is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is critical for its interaction with other cellular components. CTNNA2's quaternary structure includes its interaction with other proteins, such as beta-catenin, which is part of the Wnt signaling pathway (FanjulFernández2013Cell–cell).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect CTNNA2's function and interactions, influencing processes like cell motility and invasion (Song2019NovelmiR4885). Splice variants of CTNNA2 may lead to different isoforms, each with distinct functions, potentially impacting its role in various cellular processes and disease states (Wen2021Catenin).

## Function
CTNNA2, also known as catenin alpha 2, encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the cadherin-catenin complex, which is essential for maintaining cell-cell adhesion and tissue integrity. This protein plays a significant role in neural development and synaptic plasticity, influencing processes such as neuronal migration and connectivity. In healthy human cells, CTNNA2 is primarily active at cell junctions, where it contributes to the regulation of signaling pathways and cellular differentiation (Clark2021Reactivation).

CTNNA2 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the NF-kB signaling pathway, which is involved in cell survival and proliferation. Its expression is often silenced in certain cancers, such as neuroblastoma, due to epigenetic modifications. Reactivation of CTNNA2 can enhance sensitivity to retinoic acid, a compound used in cancer differentiation therapy, by downregulating cell survival pathways (Clark2021Reactivation).

In the context of the nervous system, CTNNA2 is involved in cell adhesion and the regulation of signaling pathways, contributing to normal cellular differentiation and proliferation. It interacts with other proteins, such as PCDH19, in the developing brain, which may have implications for understanding its role in brain development and function (de2024Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTNNA2 gene, which encodes catenin alpha-2, have been implicated in various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders. In laryngeal carcinomas, CTNNA2 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its mutations are associated with increased cancer cell invasion and migration, contributing to poor prognosis. These mutations are found in approximately 15% of laryngeal cancer cases and are linked to deregulation of b-catenin signaling pathways, promoting tumor progression (FanjulFernández2013Cell–cell). 

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CTNNA2 mutations are associated with changes in the immune microenvironment, which can affect patient prognosis. These mutations correlate with increased tumor mutation burden and neoantigen load, enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and leading to longer overall survival in patients receiving such treatments (Wen2021Catenin). 

CTNNA2 mutations are also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, due to their role in cell adhesion pathways. In the central nervous system, CTNNA2 is crucial for normal brain development, and mutations can lead to conditions like cerebellar ataxia and abnormal synaptic activity (Vite2015New).

## Interactions
CTNNA2, also known as catenin alpha 2, is a protein that plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling. It interacts with other proteins such as beta-catenin and cadherins, forming complexes essential for maintaining cell-cell adhesion and tissue integrity. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of signaling pathways that influence cell behavior (Song2019NovelmiR4885).

In the context of esophageal cancer, CTNNA2 is targeted by novel-miR-4885, a microRNA that binds to the 3' untranslated region of CTNNA2 mRNA, leading to its downregulation. This interaction results in decreased levels of alpha N-catenin, which affects the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by altering the expression of EMT-related proteins such as E-cadherin, ZO-1, N-cadherin, and beta-catenin. The loss of alpha-catenin can promote tumor cell movement and growth by affecting the cadherin-catenin complex and the Wnt signaling pathway (Song2019NovelmiR4885).

In laryngeal carcinomas, mutations in CTNNA2 are associated with increased phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser552, leading to its translocation to the nucleus and activation of TCF/LEF-1 transcription factors. This activation is linked to increased cellular motility and invasion, contributing to tumor progression (FanjulFernández2013Cell–cell).
