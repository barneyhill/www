# PYY

## Overview
The PYY gene encodes the peptide YY (PYY), a 36-amino acid neuropeptide that plays a crucial role in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis. As a member of the neuropeptide Y family, PYY is primarily produced by L-cells in the distal small intestine and colon, and is released postprandially. The peptide exists in two main forms: PYY1-36 and the more active PYY3-36, which acts as a specific agonist for the Y2 receptor, influencing feeding behavior by reducing appetite (Karra2009The; Shih2009Peptide). PYY's structure is characterized by a PP-fold, essential for its interaction with neuropeptide Y receptors, including NPY1R, NPY2R, and NPY4R, which mediate its physiological effects (Keire2000Solution; Nygaard2006The). Genetic variations in the PYY gene have been associated with metabolic conditions such as obesity and metabolic syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Shih2009Peptide).

## Structure
Peptide YY (PYY) is a 36-amino acid peptide that belongs to the neuropeptide Y family. Its primary structure is characterized by a linear chain of amino acids, with a C-terminal amidation that enhances its stability and biological activity (Hegefeld2011Structural; Nygaard2006The). The secondary structure of PYY predominantly features an alpha-helix, with studies indicating that approximately 48% to 54% of the peptide adopts this conformation (Hegefeld2011Structural). The peptide also contains a polyproline-like helix at the N-terminal end and a hydrophobic core, which are crucial for its structural integrity (Hegefeld2011Structural; Nygaard2006The).

The tertiary structure of PYY is defined by the PP-fold, a characteristic feature of the neuropeptide Y family, which includes a polyproline-like N-terminal segment folded back on a long amphipathic alpha-helix (Keire2000Solution; Nygaard2006The). This fold is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and a dipole moment created by acidic and basic residues at the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively (Nygaard2006The). The PP-fold is essential for receptor binding, particularly for the Y1 receptor, as it facilitates the interaction of the N- and C-terminal ends (Nygaard2006The). PYY is primarily monomeric in solution, which is significant for its function and receptor interaction (Keire2000Solution).

## Function
Peptide YY (PYY) is a hormone involved in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis. It is primarily produced by L-cells in the distal small intestine and colon, and is released in response to food intake (Steinert2017Ghrelin). PYY exists in two main forms: PYY1-36 and PYY3-36, with PYY3-36 being the active form that acts as a specific agonist for the Y2 receptor (Shih2009Peptide). This receptor is expressed in various regions of the central nervous system, including the hypothalamus, where PYY3-36 influences feeding behavior by reducing appetite (Karra2009The).

PYY3-36 plays a crucial role in appetite suppression and energy regulation by modulating homeostatic and hedonic brain circuits. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and has been shown to reduce feeding when administered directly into the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Karra2009The). In addition to its effects on appetite, PYY3-36 may also influence energy expenditure and fat oxidation, suggesting a dual role in body weight regulation (Karra2009The).

The secretion of PYY is also linked to metabolic processes, as it is involved in the regulation of gastric emptying and meal-related glycemia (Steinert2017Ghrelin). Genetic variations in the PYY gene can affect its expression and secretion, influencing susceptibility to obesity and metabolic syndrome traits (Shih2009Peptide).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the Peptide YY (PYY) gene have been linked to several metabolic and gastrointestinal conditions. Variants in the PYY gene, such as the Q62P mutation, have been associated with obesity. This variant shows familial segregation with body mass and affects receptor-binding selectivity, leading to reduced efficacy in appetite suppression (Ahituv2005A). Other polymorphisms in the PYY gene, particularly in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) and proximal promoter regions, have been linked to metabolic syndrome traits, including increased body mass index (BMI), cholesterol levels, and altered PYY secretion (Shih2009Peptide).

Alterations in PYY expression levels are also implicated in gastrointestinal disorders. Abnormal PYY levels have been observed in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic idiopathic slow transit constipation, where they may either contribute to the disease or represent an adaptive response (ELSALHY2012The). These findings suggest that PYY plays a significant role in both metabolic and gastrointestinal health, and its genetic variations can influence susceptibility to related disorders. Understanding these associations may lead to novel therapeutic interventions targeting PYY pathways.

## Interactions
Peptide YY (PYY) interacts with several neuropeptide Y receptors, including NPY1R, NPY2R, and NPY4R, playing a significant role in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis. PYY has a higher affinity for the NPY4R receptor compared to NPY1R, as indicated by computational studies that calculated binding energies, suggesting its potential as an antidiabetic drug candidate (Choong2021Theoretical). PYY1-36, the full-length form of PYY, binds effectively to Y1 receptors, while its truncated form, PYY3-36, selectively interacts with Y2 receptors. This interaction is crucial for its role as a satiety signal, as PYY3-36 is a preferential agonist at Y2 receptors, inhibiting food intake (Grandt1992Novel; Holzer2012Neuropeptide).

PYY is also involved in the gut-brain axis, influencing gastrointestinal motility and secretion through its interactions with Y receptors. These interactions inhibit gastric acid secretion, gastric emptying, and intestinal transit, facilitating nutrient absorption (Holzer2012Neuropeptide). The processing of PYY1-36 to PYY3-36 by a specific dipeptidyl exopeptidase alters its receptor specificity, converting it from a non-selective Y agonist to a Y2-specific agonist, which modulates its physiological effects (Grandt1992Novel).
