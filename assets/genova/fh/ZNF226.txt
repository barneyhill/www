# ZNF226

## Overview
ZNF226 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 226, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their involvement in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. These proteins typically function as transcription factors, modulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. Zinc finger protein 226 is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, primarily through its activity in the nucleus where it influences the transcriptional landscape (He2019DNA). While the precise biological roles of ZNF226 in healthy human cells are not fully understood, it is associated with DNA methylation processes and cellular response mechanisms (He2019DNA; Gong2014Gene). The gene is also linked to several diseases, including colorectal cancer and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its potential significance in pathological conditions (Sun2023Systematic; Khullar2021Predicting).

## Function
ZNF226, a zinc finger protein, is part of a family of proteins known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. These proteins typically function as transcription factors, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. ZNF226 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional landscape of the cell (He2019DNA).

The specific function of ZNF226 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, but it is known to be involved in DNA methylation processes. The study by He et al. identified that nutritional deprivation can lead to differential methylation of the ZNF226 gene, suggesting its potential role in response to environmental factors (He2019DNA). Additionally, ZNF226 has been noted to be downregulated in response to paracrine effects of uterine natural killer cells on human endometrial epithelial cells, indicating its involvement in cellular response mechanisms (Gong2014Gene). Despite these findings, the precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes of ZNF226's functions in healthy cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF226 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ZNF226 is identified as a prognostic factor, with its alternative splicing events being significantly correlated with patient survival. The study suggests that pathways such as apoptosis, cell cycle, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR are involved in CRC tumorigenesis and proliferation, indicating ZNF226's potential role in these processes (Sun2023Systematic).

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), ZNF226 functions as a hub gene within the gene regulatory network in the hippocampus, regulating modules associated with AD phenotypes. This suggests that ZNF226's regulatory functions may be relevant in understanding AD progression (Khullar2021Predicting).

ZNF226 is also associated with DNA methylation changes due to nutritional deprivation. Hypomethylation of ZNF226 was observed in response to famine exposure, potentially affecting pathways involved in neuronal development and function. This indicates a possible connection to neurological conditions, although specific diseases are not detailed (He2019DNA).

In ovarian carcinomas, ZNF226 is part of a zinc finger gene cluster on chromosome 19, where DNA gains are associated with increased expression, suggesting a role in ovarian carcinogenesis (Smebye2014Chromosome).
