# ZNF697

## Overview
ZNF697 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 697, an RNA-binding protein primarily involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle inflammation and regeneration. Unlike typical zinc finger proteins that function as DNA-binding transcription factors, zinc finger protein 697 predominantly interacts with RNA, including long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs, to modulate various biological processes (Correia2023Zfp697). This protein plays a crucial role in muscle biology by influencing chemokine secretion, immune cell recruitment, and extracellular matrix remodeling, which are essential for muscle repair and regeneration (Correia2023Zfp697). Additionally, zinc finger protein 697 is expressed in diverse cell types, such as fibroadipogenic precursors and endothelial cells, particularly in regenerating muscle tissue, underscoring its significance in maintaining muscle health (Correia2023Zfp697). Beyond muscle tissue, ZNF697 has been implicated in various diseases, including multiple sclerosis and certain cancers, highlighting its potential clinical relevance (Chen2023NOTCH; Dendrou2016Neuroinflammation).

## Function
ZNF697, also known as Zfp697 in mice, is an RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in regulating skeletal muscle inflammation and regeneration. It is primarily composed of zinc finger domains, which are typically associated with DNA-binding transcription factors. However, ZNF697 primarily interacts with RNA, particularly long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), rather than functioning as a traditional transcription factor (Correia2023Zfp697).

In the context of muscle biology, ZNF697 is involved in the regulation of chemokine secretion, immune cell recruitment, and extracellular matrix remodeling, which are crucial processes for muscle regeneration. Its expression is transiently elevated in response to muscle injury and other stimuli, facilitating the activation of a regenerative transcriptional program in myofibers (Correia2023Zfp697). ZNF697 is also necessary for the basal expression of several chemokines and interferon gamma (IFNγ) target genes, indicating its role in the IFNγ signal transduction pathway (Correia2023Zfp697).

ZNF697's activity is not limited to muscle tissue; it is expressed in various cell types, including fibroadipogenic precursors and endothelial cells, particularly in regenerating muscle tissue (Correia2023Zfp697). Its role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining muscle health and function.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF697 has been implicated in various diseases through its altered expression and potential genetic variants. In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), genetic variants in the ZNF697 gene region have been investigated for their influence on the response to interferon β (IFN-β) treatment. Approximately 30-50% of MS patients do not respond to IFN-β, and ZNF697 is among the genes that may affect this treatment response (Dendrou2016Neuroinflammation; Cacabelos2020Pharmacogenomics). 

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ZNF697 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene, particularly in the context of HPV-positive cases. This suggests a potential role for ZNF697 in the prognosis of HNSCC, although its clinical and functional implications require further research (MéndezMatías2021Prevalence).

ZNF697 has also been mentioned in studies related to ovarian cancer, where it is associated with the NOTCH signaling pathway. This association indicates a possible role in tumorigenesis and immune cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment (Chen2023NOTCH). Despite these associations, the specific clinical significance of ZNF697 mutations remains to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
ZNF697, also known as Zfp697 in mice, is primarily recognized as an RNA-binding protein involved in skeletal muscle inflammation and regeneration. Although initially thought to function as a DNA-binding transcription factor due to its zinc finger domains, studies have shown that ZNF697 interacts directly with RNA. Enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing identified 170 Zfp697-associated eCLIP peaks, corresponding to 98 unique genes. Many of these peaks mapped to RNAs from distal intronic regions, suggesting potential interactions with unannotated miRNAs. Notably, there is a significant enrichment of miRNA peaks, particularly miR-206-3p, which is known to promote skeletal muscle regeneration. Overexpression of Zfp697 in myotubes reduced the abundance of the miR-206-5p passenger strand, indicating that Zfp697 may promote the usage of miR-206-3p as the mature strand (Correia2023Zfp697).

In addition to its RNA interactions, ZNF697 has been associated with TRIM28, a protein involved in gene expression regulation. ZNF697 is listed among the zinc finger proteins that interact with wild-type TRIM28, although specific details about this interaction are not extensively discussed (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
