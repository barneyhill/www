# PDHA1

## Overview
The PDHA1 gene encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit alpha 1, a critical component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which is essential for cellular energy metabolism. This gene is located on the X chromosome and plays a pivotal role in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (Lissens2000Mutations; Horga2019Differential). The protein encoded by PDHA1 is a part of the E1 enzyme, a heterotetramer composed of two alpha and two beta subunits, and is crucial for the enzymatic activity of the PDC (Pinheiro2012Pyruvate). The activity of this enzyme is tightly regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its function in response to cellular energy demands (Horga2019Differential). Mutations in the PDHA1 gene can lead to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including lactic acidosis and neurological impairments (Fujii1996Pyruvate; Matthews1993Neurodevelopmental).

## Structure
The PDHA1 gene encodes the E1 alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which is essential for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. The E1 component is a symmetric dimer of heterodimers, consisting of two alpha and two beta subunits, forming a heterotetrameric structure (PavluPereira2021Structural). The active sites of the enzyme are located at the interfaces between the alpha and beta subunits, which are crucial for the incorporation of the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) cofactor and enzymatic activity (PavluPereira2021Structural).

The secondary structure of the E1 alpha subunit includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall 3D conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements to form the active sites and binding pockets necessary for its function. The quaternary structure is characterized by the assembly of the alpha and beta subunits into the functional heterotetramer (PavluPereira2021Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating the activity of the E1 component. Phosphorylation loops A and B are particularly important for the regulation of E1 activity, affecting the binding of cofactors and substrates (Whitley2018Pyruvate).

## Function
The PDHA1 gene encodes the E1α subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), a critical enzyme system in cellular energy metabolism. This complex is located in the mitochondrial matrix and plays a pivotal role in converting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA through oxidative decarboxylation, a process that links glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and oxidative phosphorylation (Lissens2000Mutations; Horga2019Differential). The E1 component of the PDC is a heterotetramer composed of two α and two β subunits, with the E1α subunit being essential for the complex's enzymatic activity (Matthews1994Pyruvate; Pinheiro2012Pyruvate).

The activity of the PDC is regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the E1α subunit, mediated by specific kinases and phosphatases, which control the activation and inactivation of the complex (Horga2019Differential). This regulation is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis, particularly in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain (Lissens2000Mutations). Mutations in the PDHA1 gene can lead to PDC deficiency, resulting in impaired energy metabolism and associated clinical symptoms, including lactic acidosis and neurological impairments (Fujii1996Pyruvate; Matthews1993Neurodevelopmental).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PDHA1 gene, which encodes the E1α subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, are associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD). This condition can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including lactic acidosis, neurological dysfunction, and developmental delays (Patel2012The; Cameron2004Deficiency). PDCD is often linked to congenital lactic acidosis and is characterized by impaired mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, resulting in reduced acetyl-CoA production and decreased energy generation (Patel2012The).

The clinical presentation of PDCD is highly variable, ranging from severe neonatal lactic acidosis to milder forms with intermittent ataxia or chronic neurological dysfunction (Cameron2004Deficiency). Mutations in PDHA1 can include missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations, with missense mutations being more prevalent in males and frameshift mutations more common in females (Lissens2000Mutations; Patel2012The). The X-linked nature of the PDHA1 gene results in different expression patterns in males and females, influenced by X chromosome inactivation (Matthews1994Pyruvate).

PDHA1 mutations are also implicated in Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by bilateral symmetrical lesions in the brain stem and basal ganglia, often associated with elevated lactic acid levels (Gong2021Clinical). The genetic variability and complexity of PDHA1 mutations contribute to the wide range of clinical outcomes observed in affected individuals (Horga2019Differential).

## Interactions
PDHA1, the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit alpha 1, is a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. PDHA1 interacts with the E1 beta subunit to form the E1 enzyme, a key component of the PDC. This interaction is essential for the enzymatic activity of the complex (Zhao2016Pyruvate).

PDHA1 is also involved in regulatory interactions with pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) and phosphatases (PDPs), which modulate its phosphorylation state and, consequently, its activity. Phosphorylation of PDHA1 by PDKs inhibits its activity, while dephosphorylation by PDPs activates it, thus regulating the flow of pyruvate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Zhao2016Pyruvate).

In the context of cancer, PDHA1 has been shown to interact with SHP2, a tyrosine phosphatase, in adipocytes. This interaction is crucial for maintaining PDHA1 protein levels and is implicated in the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven adipogenesis. The SHP2-PDHA1 interaction is significant in the crosstalk between adipocytes and pancreatic cancer cells, influencing cancer cell migration and invasion (Olou2022SHP2).

PDHA1 is also associated with various tumor functional statuses, such as DNA repair and angiogenesis, as revealed by single-cell sequencing studies (Deng2022Comprehensive).
