# CCDC60

## Overview
The CCDC60 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 60 protein, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC60 may play a role in various cellular processes through such interactions. Although the precise biological functions of the CCDC60 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in cellular pathways is indicated by its expression patterns and associations with certain diseases. The gene has been studied in the context of cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its potential significance in these areas (Lee2012Genome; Liu2023Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC60 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or genetic mutations. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), CCDC60 expression is significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including advanced cancer stage, lymph node metastasis, and lower overall survival rates. The gene's expression is also linked to immune infiltration, influencing tumor immunity and potentially serving as a target for immunotherapy in HNSC (Liu2023Comprehensive).

CCDC60 has also been associated with schizophrenia. Genome-wide association studies have identified a significant association between CCDC60 and schizophrenia at the locus 12q24.23, suggesting a potential genetic susceptibility to this condition (Lee2012Genome). Additionally, the gene is located in a genomic region linked to intellectual disability and other neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating its possible involvement in cognitive and psychiatric conditions (Bulayeva2015Genomic).

While CCDC60 was identified as a variant in a study on Parkinson's disease, its specific role in this condition remains unclear, as the variant was not found in a larger cohort (Schulte2013Rare).
