# SLC10A3

## Overview
SLC10A3 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 10 member 3, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes. Although the specific function of the SLC10A3 protein is not fully elucidated, it is categorized as a transmembrane protein, suggesting a role in cellular transport processes. The gene has garnered attention due to its significant upregulation in colorectal adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with poor patient prognosis and alterations in the tumor immune microenvironment (Wang2024The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC10A3 gene has been implicated in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC), where its expression levels are significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High expression of SLC10A3 is associated with poor prognosis, including lower overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in CRC patients. This suggests that SLC10A3 may serve as a prognostic marker in CRC, potentially influencing the immune microenvironment by affecting immune cell infiltration and chemokine networks (Wang2024The).

Alterations in SLC10A3 expression are linked to various immune cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment, including correlations with natural killer (NK) cells, eosinophils, and regulatory T cells (TReg), while showing negative correlations with central memory T cells (Tcm), T helper 2 (Th2) cells, and T helper cells. These interactions may contribute to the tumor's immune evasion strategies (Wang2024The).

The gene's expression is also associated with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and DNA mismatch repair molecules, indicating a potential role in tumor progression and genomic instability. Methylation levels of specific CpG islands in SLC10A3 are linked to prognosis in colon adenocarcinoma, further highlighting its clinical significance in cancer (Wang2024The).
