# NTRK3

## Overview
The NTRK3 gene encodes the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (TrkC), a member of the tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) family, which is integral to neurotrophin signaling pathways. TrkC is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that primarily binds to neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), facilitating critical processes such as neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity through the activation of downstream signaling cascades like the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT and MAPK pathways (Werner2014Mutations). The protein's structure includes multiple extracellular ligand-binding domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain, which undergoes autophosphorylation upon ligand binding, triggering various intracellular signaling events (Hondermarck2015The). TrkC is also involved in cardiac development and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and congenital heart diseases, due to mutations and gene rearrangements (Werner2014Mutations; Chu2020Clinicopathologic).

## Structure
The NTRK3 gene encodes the TrkC protein, a member of the tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) family, which plays a crucial role in neurotrophin signaling. TrkC is a transmembrane protein with a primary structure that includes a signal peptide, multiple extracellular ligand-binding domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain (Hondermarck2015The). The extracellular region contains cystine-rich regions, a leucine-rich domain, and immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig-C1 and Ig-C2), which are important for ligand binding and receptor dimerization (Hondermarck2015The).

The secondary structure of TrkC features β-strands in the N-terminal lobe and α-helices in the C-terminal lobe, typical of protein kinases (Bertrand2017Crystal). The kinase domain includes a DFG motif and an α-C helix, which are involved in the regulation of kinase activity (Bertrand2017Crystal).

TrkC exists in several isoforms due to alternative splicing, including TrkC-A, TrkC-D, and a non-catalytic form, TrkC-B. These isoforms differ in their kinase domains, affecting protein interactions and signaling pathways (Hondermarck2015The). TrkC-B, for instance, lacks the tyrosine kinase domain and has an alternative intracellular domain, impacting its function in neuroblastoma cells (Hondermarck2015The).

Post-translational modifications of TrkC include phosphorylation of conserved tyrosines in the intracellular domain, which is crucial for downstream signaling (Hondermarck2015The).

## Function
The NTRK3 gene encodes the TrkC protein, a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in neurotrophin signaling by primarily binding to neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). This interaction leads to autophosphorylation of TrkC, activating various signaling pathways, including the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT and MAPK pathways, which are essential for neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity (Werner2014Mutations). TrkC is active in the cell membrane, where it initiates signaling cascades that influence cell growth and development, particularly in the nervous system (Werner2014Mutations).

In healthy human cells, TrkC's activation by NT-3 is crucial for the development and maintenance of the nervous system, promoting neuronal survival and cell differentiation (Werner2014Mutations). The receptor is also involved in the regulation of neuronal pathways and plays a role in the integrity of white matter in the brain, which is vital for proper brain function and connectivity (Braskie2013Relation). Additionally, NTRK3 is implicated in cardiac morphogenesis, with its expression in cardiac neural crest cells and myocardial cells contributing to the development of the heart's outflow tract and ventricular trabeculation (Werner2014Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NTRK3 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In bladder cancer, NTRK3 expression is associated with tumor mutation burden and immune infiltration, suggesting its role as a prognostic biomarker. High NTRK3 expression correlates with increased immune and stromal scores, indicating its involvement in tumor progression and prognosis (Zhang2021Identification). In lung adenocarcinoma, NTRK3 mutations are linked to enhanced antitumor immunity and better overall survival in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, highlighting its potential as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy (Niu2020Prognosis).

NTRK3 mutations are also associated with congenital heart diseases, particularly ventricular septal defects. These mutations can impair TrkC receptor autophosphorylation, affecting downstream signaling pathways crucial for heart development (Werner2014Mutations). In thyroid cancer, NTRK3 rearrangements, such as ETV6-NTRK3, act as oncogenic drivers, promoting cellular proliferation and transformation. These fusions are significant in papillary thyroid cancer, especially in radiation-exposed cases, and are considered potential diagnostic markers (Chu2020Clinicopathologic; Bastos2018ETV6NTRK3).

## Interactions
NTRK3, also known as TrkC, is a receptor tyrosine kinase that engages in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its signaling functions. It primarily interacts with proteins containing SH2 and PTB domains, such as SHC1, GRB2, and PI3K, which are involved in the activation of the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways (Jin2020Roles). These interactions are essential for cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation.

The ETV6-NTRK3 fusion protein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation, retains the ability to bind PLCg but lacks the interaction sites for SHC, GRB2, and PI3K due to the fusion point's position (Wai2000The). Despite this, the fusion protein can still activate the Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, likely through alternative interactions, such as with IRS adaptors (Kinnunen2023The).

ETV6-NTRK3 also interacts with the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII), inhibiting TGF-β signaling by preventing Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation (Jin2005The). This interaction is specific to the intracellular domain of TβRII and is critical for the fusion protein's ability to suppress TGF-β signaling (Jin2005The). These interactions highlight the complex network of signaling pathways influenced by NTRK3 and its fusion variants.
