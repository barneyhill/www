# MSANTD2

## Overview
MSANTD2 is a gene that encodes the protein Myb/SANT DNA binding domain containing 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Myb/SANT domain, which is known for its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. This domain is typically associated with chromatin remodeling and gene expression modulation, suggesting that MSANTD2 may play a critical role in these biological processes. The precise functions and mechanisms of action of the MSANTD2 protein are still under investigation, but its involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway indicates a potential role in cell cycle regulation and development (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the biological significance and potential clinical implications of MSANTD2.
