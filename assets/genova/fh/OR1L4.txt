# OR1L4

## Overview
The OR1L4 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily L member 4, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium (Pranckėnienė2023Microevolutionary). As a transmembrane receptor, OR1L4 is involved in the initial steps of olfactory perception by binding specific odor molecules and activating intracellular signaling pathways (Saeed2023Smell). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR1L4 and other olfactory receptors are expressed in various tissues, suggesting additional roles in cellular processes such as communication, proliferation, and apoptosis (Saeed2023Smell). The gene's evolutionary significance is underscored by its involvement in local adaptation and potential contributions to physiological processes beyond smell (Pranckėnienė2023Microevolutionary).

## Function
The OR1L4 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they are involved in olfactory signal recognition and transmission. Upon binding to specific odorant molecules, OR1L4 initiates a signal transduction pathway that ultimately results in the perception of smell (Pranckėnienė2023Microevolutionary).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR1L4, like other olfactory receptors, may have broader biological functions. Olfactory receptors are implicated in various cellular processes, including cellular communication, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (Saeed2023Smell). These receptors are not only expressed in olfactory sensory neurons but also in other tissues, suggesting potential roles beyond smell sensation, such as involvement in brain development, memory, emotion, and neuroplasticity (Saeed2023Smell).

The evolutionary significance of OR1L4 and related olfactory receptor genes is highlighted by their selection pressures across generations, indicating their importance in local adaptation and possibly in other physiological processes (Pranckėnienė2023Microevolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
The OR1L4 gene has been implicated in several medical conditions through its mutations and altered expression levels. In schizophrenia, a study on Sudanese families identified significant enrichment of OR1L4 gene variants, with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered likely pathogenic. These variants were shared across multiple families, suggesting a potential link between OR1L4 and schizophrenia, particularly in relation to olfactory function impairment (Saeed2023Smell).

In the context of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), mutations in the OR1L4 gene were found exclusively in mixed germ cell tumors, with a mutation frequency of around 2% (Yao2023Comprehensive). This indicates a possible role of OR1L4 mutations in the pathogenesis of this specific tumor subtype.

The OR1L4 gene is also upregulated in severe preeclampsia, although the specific mechanisms or roles of this upregulation remain unclear. The study suggests that olfactory receptors, including OR1L4, may be involved in the condition, potentially contributing to the phenomenon of 'olfactory hypersensitivity' observed in pregnancy and preeclampsia (Vidal2022GProtein).

Additionally, OR1L4 is upregulated in cases of normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (NK-AML) with low platelet counts, indicating its involvement in cell signaling pathways related to this condition (Park2022Investigation).
