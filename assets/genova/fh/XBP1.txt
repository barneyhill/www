# XBP1

## Overview
XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). The XBP1 gene produces two main isoforms: XBP1u (unspliced) and XBP1s (spliced), each playing distinct roles in cellular processes. XBP1s, characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, is a potent transcription factor that regulates genes essential for protein folding, secretion, and degradation, thereby maintaining ER homeostasis (Yoshida2001XBP1; Xu2020X‐box). XBP1 is expressed in various tissues and is crucial for several developmental processes, including cardiac myogenesis and plasma cell differentiation (AcostaAlvear2007XBP1). Additionally, XBP1 is implicated in numerous diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Dunys2014The; Xu2020X‐box).

## Structure
The human XBP1 gene encodes two main isoforms: XBP1u (unspliced) and XBP1s (spliced). XBP1u plays a critical role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) by inducing translational pausing. This is achieved through a translational arrest peptide (AP) that forms a unique turn in the ribosomal exit tunnel, subtly distorting the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and inhibiting translation (Shanmuganathan2019Structural). The XBP1u AP is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) but does not efficiently gate the Sec61 translocon, allowing for co-translational localization of its mRNA on the ER membrane (Shanmuganathan2019Structural).

The XBP1u nascent chain adopts an extended conformation in the ribosomal tunnel, with a prominent turn formed by residues W249 to W256, which is critical for its pausing activity (Shanmuganathan2019Structural). This turn interacts with the tunnel wall and is framed by tryptophan residues, causing displacement of a ribosomal base (Shanmuganathan2019Structural). The spliced isoform, XBP1s, contains a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, essential for DNA binding and dimerization, and undergoes post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, influencing its activity and stability.

## Function
XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular mechanism activated in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In healthy human cells, XBP1 is involved in maintaining ER homeostasis by regulating genes that enhance protein folding, secretion, and degradation processes. Upon ER stress, XBP1 mRNA undergoes unconventional splicing mediated by the IRE1 enzyme, resulting in the production of a highly active transcription factor, XBP1s, which efficiently activates UPR target genes (Yoshida2001XBP1; Xu2020X‐box).

XBP1 regulates a subset of ER-resident chaperone genes, such as BiP, CHOP, ERdj4, and p58 IPK, which are crucial for protein folding and degradation (Lee2003XBP-1). It also influences processes associated with ER function, organelle expansion, and energy expenditure, linking it to broader metabolic processes (AcostaAlvear2007XBP1). XBP1 is expressed in most adult tissues and is essential for various developmental processes, including cardiac myogenesis, hepatogenesis, and plasma cell differentiation (AcostaAlvear2007XBP1). It also plays a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by regulating genes involved in redox homeostasis and oxidative stress responses (Liu2009Preventing).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the XBP1 gene are implicated in various diseases. In vitiligo, a depigmentary disorder, a polymorphism in the promoter region of XBP1, specifically rs2269577, is associated with increased risk. This polymorphism leads to elevated XBP1 expression in lesional skin, suggesting its role in the disease's pathogenesis (Ren2009Genetic). In bipolar disorder, a polymorphism (-116C→G) in the XBP1 promoter is linked to increased genetic risk, affecting the gene's transcription activity and response to ER stress (Kakiuchi2003Impaired).

XBP1 is also involved in cancer, where its expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer and pulmonary adenocarcinoma, while in colorectal cancer, it reduces cell proliferation (Xu2020X‐box). In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, XBP1 is part of the unfolded protein response, with its spliced form offering protective effects against neuronal damage (Dunys2014The). In metabolic disorders, XBP1 influences insulin signaling and lipid metabolism, with its dysregulation contributing to conditions like type 2 diabetes and obesity (Wu2015Involvement). These findings highlight the clinical significance of XBP1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
XBP1 (X-box binding protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular stress responses. Unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) interacts with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to protect endothelial cells from oxidative stress. This interaction is essential for the up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, mediated through the Akt1/Nrf2 pathway. XBP1u and HDAC3 co-expression synergistically enhances Akt1 phosphorylation and HO-1 levels, with the binding domain of HDAC3 for XBP1u identified within the amino acid region 201-323 (Martin2014Unspliced).

XBP1 also interacts with FoxO1, a transcription factor involved in autophagy. In auditory cells under ER stress, XBP1 regulates FoxO1 expression, and their interaction is crucial for ER stress-induced autophagy. XBP1 can suppress autophagy by degrading FoxO1 through the proteasome (Kishino2017XBP1FoxO1).

Additionally, XBP1s, the spliced form of XBP1, interacts with Pin1, a phosphorylation-specific peptidyl-prolyl isomerase. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and involves the Ser 288-Pro motif, which is crucial for binding. The interaction with Pin1 is important for the stability of XBP1s in cancer signaling (Chae2016Critical).
