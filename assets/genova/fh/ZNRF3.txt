# ZNRF3

## Overview
ZNRF3 is a gene that encodes the zinc and ring finger 3 protein, a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including an extracellular protease-associated (PA) domain, a transmembrane helix, and an intracellular RING domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity (Peng2013Structures). ZNRF3 functions primarily by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Frizzled receptors, thereby inhibiting Wnt signaling and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ci2018SCFβTRCP). This regulatory mechanism is essential for various biological processes, such as tissue development, stem cell maintenance, and sex determination (Harris2018ZNRF3). Alterations in the ZNRF3 gene have been linked to several diseases, including cancers and disorders of sex development, highlighting its clinical significance (Fraser2021Somatic; Harris2018ZNRF3).

## Structure
The ZNRF3 protein is a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling. It features a distinct molecular structure comprising an extracellular N-terminal protease-associated (PA) domain, a single-pass transmembrane helix, and an intracellular C-terminal RING domain responsible for its E3 ligase activity (Peng2013Structures). The ectodomain of ZNRF3 adopts a typical PA fold, characterized by a parallel β-sheet core surrounded by α-helices and 3_10-helices, with a disulfide bond connecting loop regions containing the 3_10-helices (Peng2013Structures). 

The tertiary structure of ZNRF3 reveals a dimeric arrangement in the crystal, involving hydrophobic, aromatic, charged, and hydrogen-bonded interactions, although the physiological relevance of this dimerization is not fully understood (Peng2013Structures). The ectodomain also forms a large pocket opposite to its C-terminus, which is involved in binding interactions with R-spondin 1 (RSPO1) (Peng2013Structures). 

ZNRF3 shares structural similarities with its homolog RNF43, with a sequence identity of 37% and a root-mean-square deviation of 0.75 Å, although notable differences exist, such as an extended β-hairpin 'flap' in ZNRF3 (Peng2013Structures). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like ubiquitination, which is typical for proteins with RING domains.

## Function
The ZNRF3 gene encodes a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a critical role in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, ZNRF3 functions by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of Frizzled receptors, which are key components of the Wnt signaling pathway. This activity serves to inhibit Wnt signaling, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and controlling cell proliferation (Ci2018SCFβTRCP; Zebisch2013Structural).

ZNRF3 is active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with its substrates to modulate Wnt signaling. This regulation is crucial for various biological processes, including tissue development, stem cell maintenance, and sex determination. In the context of sex determination, ZNRF3 inhibits canonical Wnt signaling, which is essential for the proper expression of Sox9, a critical factor in testis determination (Harris2018ZNRF3).

In the adrenal cortex, ZNRF3 helps establish a Wnt/β-catenin signaling gradient necessary for maintaining adrenal homeostasis and proper zonal differentiation (Basham2019A). In the liver, ZNRF3, along with its homolog RNF43, restricts Wnt/β-catenin signaling to control hepatocyte proliferation and maintain metabolic zonation (Sun2021ZNRF3). These functions highlight the gene's role in regulating critical signaling pathways to ensure normal tissue development and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ZNRF3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In prostate cancer, the loss of ZNRF3 is associated with metastatic relapse and is considered a predictor of aggressive cancer behavior. This loss is linked to decreased mRNA abundance, increased WNT pathway activity, and genomic instability, which are prognostic of metastasis and overall survival (Fraser2021Somatic).

In liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, mutations in ZNRF3, along with its homolog RNF43, predispose individuals to cancer by impairing liver regeneration and altering lipid metabolism. These mutations lead to increased sensitivity to WNT activation, contributing to cancer progression (Belenguer2022RNF43ZNRF3).

ZNRF3 also plays a role in sex development disorders. Mutations in this gene can lead to 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD), including complete gonadal dysgenesis, due to disrupted WNT signaling and altered Sox9 expression (Rjiba2023Additional; Harris2018ZNRF3).

In gastric adenocarcinoma, ZNRF3 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the WNT signaling pathway. Its expression is inversely correlated with cell proliferation markers, suggesting its potential role in suppressing tumor growth (Zhou2013ZNRF3).

## Interactions
ZNRF3 is a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in the regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with the SCFβ-TRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which targets ZNRF3 for ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is dependent on casein kinase I (CKI) phosphorylation and degron motifs, highlighting the role of β-TRCP in modulating ZNRF3 stability (Ci2018SCFβTRCP).

ZNRF3 also interacts with R-spondin (Rspo) proteins, which are secreted agonists of Wnt signaling. The binding of Rspo to ZNRF3 inhibits its ligase activity, thereby preventing the degradation of Wnt receptors and enhancing Wnt signaling. This interaction involves the Furin domains of Rspo, with the Fu1 domain being critical for binding to ZNRF3 (Zebisch2013Structural).

Additionally, ZNRF3 forms a complex with LGR4/5/6 receptors and Rspo proteins, which is essential for the signaling potency of the Wnt pathway. This complex formation is crucial for modulating Wnt receptor turnover and maintaining the balance of Wnt signaling (Zebisch2013Structural).
