# VPS26B

## Overview
VPS26B is a gene that encodes the protein VPS26 retromer complex component B, which is a critical part of the retromer complex involved in endosomal protein sorting and trafficking. This protein is categorized as a component of the retromer complex, which plays a vital role in the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. VPS26B is structurally similar to arrestin proteins and interacts with other retromer components such as VPS29 and VPS35 to form a functional multimeric complex. It is involved in the biogenesis of Rab14-positive endosome buds and acts as a Rab14 effector, highlighting its role in endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics (Wang2024Biogenesis; Cui2017A; Haft2000Human). Unlike its paralog VPS26A, VPS26B does not interact with the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, indicating distinct functional properties within the retromer complex (Bugarcic2011Vps26A). Alterations in VPS26B have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways.

## Structure
The VPS26B protein is a component of the retromer complex, which is involved in endosomal protein sorting. The primary structure of VPS26B consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the VPS26B gene. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function. The tertiary structure of VPS26B forms a compact, globular shape, often featuring a VPS26 domain, which is crucial for its role in the retromer complex. This domain is structurally similar to arrestin proteins, which are known for their role in cargo recognition during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Cui2017A).

In terms of quaternary structure, VPS26B interacts with other components of the retromer complex, such as VPS29 and VPS35, to form a multimeric complex essential for retrograde trafficking between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (Haft2000Human). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the protein's binding affinity and function, particularly in cargo recognition and recycling (Cui2017A). The presence of splice variant isoforms can result in structural and functional diversity, allowing VPS26B to adapt to different cellular contexts and requirements.

## Function
VPS26B is a component of the retromer complex, which is essential for endosomal protein sorting and trafficking in cells. It plays a critical role in the retrograde transport of lysosomal hydrolase receptors from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus, a process vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper signaling pathways (Collins2007Structure). VPS26B, along with its paralogue VPS26A, binds to Vps35, a core component of the retromer complex, with high affinity, forming distinct retromer complexes that are crucial for endosomal membrane recruitment (Collins2007Structure).

VPS26B is involved in the biogenesis of Rab14-positive endosome buds at Golgi–endosome contacts, acting as a Rab14 effector at early endosome buds. This interaction is important for endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics (Wang2024Biogenesis). Unlike VPS26A, VPS26B associates with both early and late endosomal structures, indicating its involvement in maturing endosomes and suggesting a role in trafficking processes outside the traditional endosomal system (Kerr2005A; Bugarcic2011Vps26A).

VPS26B's interaction with SHIP164 and its localization to Rab14-positive endosomes highlight its specific role in endosomal sorting and transport, influencing the stability and function of certain receptors and enzymes (Wang2024Biogenesis).

## Clinical Significance
VPS26B, a component of the retromer complex, plays a crucial role in endosomal protein sorting. Alterations in the expression or mutations of VPS26B have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These alterations can disrupt cellular trafficking, leading to impaired cellular homeostasis. The retromer complex, including VPS26B, is essential for the proper recycling of transmembrane receptors from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network or the plasma membrane. Disruption in this process can result in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and defective cellular signaling pathways, contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Research is ongoing to further elucidate the specific mechanisms by which VPS26B mutations or expression changes contribute to these conditions. Understanding the role of VPS26B in disease may offer potential therapeutic targets for conditions characterized by disrupted cellular trafficking and protein sorting. The involvement of VPS26B in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular function and its potential impact when dysregulated.

## Interactions
VPS26B is a component of the retromer complex, which is involved in the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. It interacts with other core components of the retromer complex, such as VPS35 and VPS29, forming a functional unit essential for its role in protein sorting and trafficking (Kerr2005A; Bugarcic2011Vps26A). Unlike its paralog VPS26A, VPS26B does not interact with the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), which is a known retromer cargo. This lack of interaction is attributed to the C-terminal region of VPS26B, which negatively regulates its binding to CI-M6PR (Bugarcic2011Vps26A).

VPS26B also interacts with proteins such as TBC1D5 and GOLPH3, which are known retromer-binding partners (Bugarcic2011Vps26A). It has been shown to associate with Rab14-positive endosomes, acting as a Rab14 effector, and interacts with SHIP164, indicating its involvement in specific endosomal microdomains (Wang2024Biogenesis). These interactions highlight the distinct functional properties of VPS26B within the retromer complex and its role in cellular trafficking pathways.
