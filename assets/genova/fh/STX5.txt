# STX5

## Overview
The STX5 gene encodes the protein syntaxin 5, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) family, which is integral to vesicular transport processes within eukaryotic cells. Syntaxin 5 is primarily involved in the trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, playing a pivotal role in both anterograde and retrograde transport. This protein is essential for the fusion of transport vesicles with target membranes, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and Golgi integrity (Linders2019Stx5Mediated; Dascher1994Syntaxin). Syntaxin 5 exists in two isoforms, Stx5 Long and Stx5 Short, which differ in their subcellular localization and function due to alternative translation initiation (Linders2020Congenital). The protein's interactions with other SNARE proteins and tethering complexes facilitate its role in intracellular trafficking and membrane fusion, underscoring its importance in cellular processes and its implication in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and congenital glycosylation disorders (Amessou2007Syntaxin; Linders2020Congenital).

## Structure
Syntaxin 5 (STX5) is a SNARE protein involved in vesicular transport, particularly in the ER-Golgi network. The primary structure of STX5 includes a SNARE motif, which is crucial for its role in membrane fusion and vesicle trafficking (Hom2023RNA). The SNARE domain, spanning approximately 63 amino acids, is essential for its function in vesicle-associated membrane trafficking (Hom2023RNA). 

STX5 exists in two isoforms, Stx5 Long (Stx5L) and Stx5 Short (Stx5S), resulting from alternative translation initiation. Stx5L contains an additional 54 N-terminal residues with an ER retrieval motif, which localizes it more to the ER, while Stx5S is more Golgi-localized (Linders2020Congenital). The presence of an RKR motif in Stx5L facilitates its retrieval from the Golgi to the ER (Linders2020Congenital).

The tertiary structure of STX5 involves the folding of its SNARE motif and other domains, allowing it to interact with other SNARE proteins to form complexes necessary for vesicle docking and fusion (Tai2004Participation). These interactions are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking and maintaining Golgi architecture (Kat2021Syntaxin).

## Function
Syntaxin 5 (STX5) is a SNARE protein that plays a critical role in vesicular transport within cells, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. It is involved in both anterograde and retrograde transport processes, facilitating the movement of proteins and lipids essential for cellular homeostasis. STX5 is part of the SNARE complex that mediates the fusion of transport vesicles with target membranes, ensuring efficient ER to Golgi transport and maintaining Golgi integrity (Linders2019Stx5Mediated; Dascher1994Syntaxin).

STX5 is also involved in retrograde transport, moving proteins and lipids from the endocytic pathway back to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and ER. This function is crucial for the recycling of cellular components and the response to exogenous toxins (Amessou2007Syntaxin; Tai2004Participation). The protein interacts with various tethering complexes and other SNARE proteins, such as GS28, Ykt6, and GS15, to facilitate these transport processes (Tai2004Participation).

In addition to its role in vesicular transport, STX5 is involved in the assembly of SNARE complexes, which are essential for membrane fusion events. It interacts with proteins like Scfd1, which regulates SNARE complex assembly and activity, further highlighting its importance in maintaining proper cellular function (Linders2019Stx5Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the STX5 gene are linked to several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and congenital glycosylation disorders. In neurodegenerative diseases, STX5 is implicated in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In Alzheimer's, STX5 mediates ER-Golgi transport of presenilin 1 and 2, components of the γ-secretase complex involved in β-amyloid peptide production. Mutations in presenilin 1 reduce interactions with STX5, affecting amyloid processing (Linders2019Stx5Mediated; Climer2015Defects). In Parkinson's disease, mutant α-synuclein binds to STX5, impairing ER-Golgi transport and potentially exacerbating disease progression (Linders2019Stx5Mediated).

A congenital disorder of glycosylation is caused by a specific variant in STX5, which affects the production of the short isoform, Stx5S. This mutation leads to severe clinical phenotypes, including infantile mortality, skeletal abnormalities, and glycosylation defects due to impaired intra-Golgi trafficking (Linders2020Congenital). The loss of Stx5S results in mislocalization of glycosyltransferases and altered ER and Golgi morphology, significantly impacting glycosylation processes (Linders2020Congenital). These findings underscore the critical role of STX5 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
Syntaxin 5 (STX5) is a SNARE protein that participates in various interactions crucial for vesicular transport and membrane fusion processes. STX5 forms SNARE complexes with proteins such as Bet1, GOSR1, Ykt6, and Sec22B, which are essential for ER to Golgi and intra-Golgi trafficking (Linders2019Stx5Mediated; Hom2023RNA). It interacts with the RNA-binding protein HuR to facilitate miRNA export, particularly in macrophages, where it plays a role in inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance (Hom2023RNA).

STX5 is also involved in Golgi membrane dynamics, interacting with proteins like p47 and p97. These interactions are part of the NSF- and p97-mediated pathways for Golgi reassembly, where p47 mediates the binding of p97 to STX5, similar to the role of α-SNAP in the NSF pathway (Rabouille1998Syntaxin). Monoubiquitination of STX5 by the ubiquitin ligase HACE1 regulates its interaction with Bet1 and p47, influencing Golgi membrane dynamics during the cell cycle (Huang2016Monoubiquitination).

STX5 also interacts with the COG complex, particularly with Cog4, which is crucial for SNARE complex assembly, and with Golgins such as p115 and GM130, which regulate its availability for SNARE complex formation (Linders2019Stx5Mediated).
