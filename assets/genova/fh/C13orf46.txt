# C13orf46

## Overview
C13orf46 is a gene located on chromosome 13 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 13 open reading frame 46. This protein is currently not categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological function remains to be fully elucidated. However, emerging research suggests that it may be involved in various cellular processes and disease mechanisms. Alterations in the expression of C13orf46 have been associated with several conditions, including osteosarcoma, keratoconus, and hidradenitis suppurativa, indicating its potential role in disease pathophysiology (Wang2022The; Witte2023Blood; Akoto2023Unravelling). Further studies are required to clarify the functional roles of both the gene and its encoded protein in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
C13orf46 has been implicated in several diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In osteosarcoma (OS), a type of bone cancer, C13orf46 is recurrently affected by germline transposable element (TE) insertions in 13 out of 39 patients studied. Although its specific cancer-associated functions have not been reported, these insertions suggest a potential role in OS development (Wang2022The).

In keratoconus, a degenerative eye disorder, C13orf46, also known as LINC00565, is significantly downregulated in response to cyclic mechanical stretch and TGFβ1 treatment. This downregulation may contribute to the pathophysiology of keratoconus (Akoto2023Unravelling).

In hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a chronic skin condition, C13orf46 is upregulated in blood T helper memory cells of patients compared to healthy individuals. This upregulation indicates a potential involvement in the inflammatory processes associated with HS, although its exact role remains to be fully elucidated (Witte2023Blood).

These findings suggest that C13orf46 may play a role in various diseases through its altered expression, although further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.
