# SH3TC2

## Overview
The SH3TC2 gene encodes the SH3 domain and tetratricopeptide repeats 2 protein, which is integral to the function of Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. This protein is characterized by the presence of Src homology 3 (SH3) domains and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate its role in protein complex formation and cellular interactions (Stendel2010SH3TC2). SH3TC2 is primarily involved in endosomal recycling and myelination processes, interacting with key molecules such as Rab11 and the ErbB2 receptor to regulate intracellular trafficking and signaling pathways essential for nerve function (Gouttenoire2013Sh3tc2; Stendel2010SH3TC2). Mutations in SH3TC2 are linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C, highlighting its clinical significance in neuropathic conditions (Piscosquito2016Screening).

## Function
The SH3TC2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the peripheral nervous system, particularly in Schwann cells, which are responsible for the myelination of peripheral nerves. SH3TC2 is involved in endosomal recycling, a process essential for the proper sorting and transport of proteins within cells. This function is mediated through its interaction with Rab11, a small GTPase that regulates recycling pathways from endosomes to the plasma membrane (Stendel2010SH3TC2). The protein contains Src homology 3 (SH3) domains and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein complex formation and interactions (Stendel2010SH3TC2).

In Schwann cells, SH3TC2 is crucial for myelination, influencing the organization of the node of Ranvier and axon-glia interactions. It is expressed at the plasma membrane and within the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment, suggesting its involvement in cellular architecture and polarization (Lupski2010WholeGenome). SH3TC2 also interacts with the ErbB2 receptor, affecting its internalization and intracellular trafficking, which is vital for the signaling pathways that regulate myelination (Gouttenoire2013Sh3tc2). These molecular activities underscore SH3TC2's importance in maintaining nerve function and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SH3TC2 gene are primarily associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4C (CMT4C), an autosomal recessive demyelinating neuropathy. CMT4C is characterized by early-onset distal muscle weakness, sensory deficits, scoliosis, and cranial nerve involvement, including potential hearing loss (Piscosquito2016Screening; Gouttenoire2013Sh3tc2; Shchagina2024Genetic). The disease is linked to various mutations in SH3TC2, including nonsense, splice-site, frameshift, and missense mutations, which can lead to premature termination of protein synthesis or nonfunctional proteins (Duan2021Characteristics).

The SH3TC2 protein is crucial for proper myelination of peripheral axons, and its deficiency affects the neuregulin-1/ErbB signaling pathway, which is essential for myelination (Gouttenoire2013Sh3tc2). Mutations in SH3TC2 can disrupt its interaction with Rab11, affecting endosome recycling and myelination regulation by Schwann cells (Shchagina2024Genetic). The R954* mutation is notably prevalent in certain populations, such as those in central Europe and the Mediterranean basin, and is associated with early-onset mild-to-moderate neuropathy (Duan2021Characteristics; Kontogeorgiou2019Mutational). The clinical presentation of CMT4C can vary, with some patients experiencing severe symptoms, while others maintain mobility into adulthood (Duan2021Characteristics).

## Interactions
The SH3TC2 protein is involved in several key interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts specifically with the ERBB2 receptor, but not with ERBB3, indicating a selective binding that is important for the internalization and intracellular trafficking of ERBB2. This interaction is enhanced by certain truncated forms of SH3TC2, suggesting that the NH2-terminus of SH3TC2 is critical for optimal binding with ERBB2 (Gouttenoire2013Sh3tc2).

SH3TC2 also interacts with Rab11, a small GTPase involved in endosomal recycling. This interaction is significant for Schwann cell function and myelination, as SH3TC2 acts as an effector of Rab11. The interaction is specific to the active GTP-bound form of Rab11, and mutations in SH3TC2 that cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 4C (CMT4C) disrupt this interaction, leading to impaired myelination (Stendel2010SH3TC2).

In the context of colorectal cancer, SH3TC2 is associated with the MAPK signaling pathway. It is positively correlated with several MAP kinases, and its downregulation inhibits the expression of MAPK8, 9, 13, and 14, suggesting a role in promoting tumorigenesis through this pathway (Huang2022PanCancer).
