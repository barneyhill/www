# OR2F1

## Overview
The OR2F1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily F member 1, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a pivotal role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it is involved in the initial steps of odor perception by binding specific odor molecules and triggering neuronal responses. Beyond its primary role in olfaction, OR2F1 is also expressed in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, suggesting a potential role in detecting volatile chemicals in the respiratory system (Kuo2022Neuroendocrinology). Additionally, the expression of OR2F1 can be influenced by dietary factors, indicating its involvement in broader biological processes related to environmental stress and defense mechanisms (Bøhn2010Blood).

## Function
The OR2F1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily involved in signal transduction processes that lead to the perception of smell. OR2F1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, initiating neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Bøhn2010Blood; Jimenez2021The).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR2F1 has been identified in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) in the lung, suggesting a potential function in sensing volatile chemicals in the airway environment (Kuo2022Neuroendocrinology). This indicates that OR2F1 may have a broader sensory role beyond the olfactory system, potentially acting as a volatile chemical sensor in primates.

The gene's expression and function are also influenced by dietary factors, as studies have shown that antioxidant-rich diets can modulate the expression of OR2F1, highlighting its involvement in biological processes related to stress and defense mechanisms (Bøhn2010Blood). This modulation suggests that OR2F1 may play a role in cellular responses to environmental changes.
