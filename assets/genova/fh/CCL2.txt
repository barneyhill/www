# CCL2

## Overview
CCL2, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, is a gene that encodes a protein known as Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), which is a member of the CC chemokine family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by directing the migration of monocytes, memory T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells to sites of inflammation, thereby facilitating immune responses. CCL2 is expressed by a variety of cell types, including endothelial and epithelial cells, and functions primarily through its interaction with the C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), a G-protein coupled receptor (Deshmane2009Monocyte). The protein's structure includes a canonical chemokine fold, and it can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the monomeric form being more effective in receptor binding (Tan2012Design; Joshi2020Dissecting). CCL2 is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune surveillance, inflammation, and the pathogenesis of diseases such as atherosclerosis, HIV, and Alzheimer's disease (Deshmane2009Monocyte; Selenica2013Diverse).

## Structure
The CCL2 protein, also known as Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), is a member of the CC chemokine family. Its primary structure consists of 76 amino acids, with a signal sequence at residues 1-23 and a pyrrolidone carboxylic acid at residue 24 (Zhu2021The). The secondary structure includes an N-terminal loop, four β-sheets, and a C-terminal helix (Joshi2020Dissecting). The tertiary structure forms a canonical chemokine fold, characterized by a long N-terminal loop, four β-strands, and a C-terminal helix (Joshi2020Dissecting). 

In terms of quaternary structure, CCL2 can exist in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, forming dimers at concentrations above 100 μM (Joshi2020Dissecting). The dimeric form is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, with a symmetric dimer topology confirmed by NMR spectroscopy (Joshi2020Dissecting). 

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which affects the protein's biological activity. O-glycosylation contributes to molecular mass heterogeneity and reduces chemotactic activity (Joshi2020Dissecting). The protein also contains two disulfide bonds at positions 34 ↔ 59 and 35 ↔ 75, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity (Zhu2021The).

## Function
CCL2, also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), is a chemokine that plays a significant role in the immune system by regulating the migration and infiltration of monocytes, memory T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells to sites of inflammation. It is produced by various cell types, including endothelial, fibroblasts, epithelial, smooth muscle, mesangial, astrocytic, monocytic, and microglial cells (Deshmane2009Monocyte). CCL2 functions by binding to the CCR2 receptor, which is crucial for monocyte recruitment and subsequent immune responses (Deshmane2009Monocyte).

In healthy human cells, CCL2 is involved in immune surveillance and modulation, facilitating the clearance of acute viral infections and the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages to specific organs in response to inflammation. This recruitment is essential for eliminating invading pathogens through phagocytosis (Deshmane2009Monocyte). CCL2 also influences macrophage polarization, promoting an anti-inflammatory phenotype by enhancing IL-10 production and modulating cytokine profiles (SierraFilardi2014CCL2). Additionally, CCL2 is implicated in the recruitment of microglia and monocytes to clear β-amyloid deposits in the brain, which is relevant to neurodegenerative conditions (Deshmane2009Monocyte).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCL2 gene are linked to a variety of diseases and conditions due to its role in immune cell recruitment and inflammation. Genetic variations such as SNPs G-927C and A-2578G in CCL2 are associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness, a marker of atherosclerosis, and a higher risk of myocardial infarction (Deshmane2009Monocyte). In the context of HIV-1, the CCL2 -2578G allele is linked to a reduced risk of acquiring the virus but also to faster disease progression and a higher risk of HIV-associated dementia once infection is established (Deshmane2009Monocyte). 

The rs1024611 polymorphism in the CCL2 gene affects expression levels and is associated with increased susceptibility to chronic inflammatory conditions and cancer risk, particularly in Caucasian individuals. In primary myelofibrosis, this polymorphism correlates with adverse clinical features and reduced survival (Masselli2021Impact). 

CCL2 is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, where it mediates macrophage recruitment and migration during inflammation in the central nervous system (Selenica2013Diverse). In cardiovascular disease, increased plasma levels of CCL2 are associated with early restenosis after coronary angioplasty (Deshmane2009Monocyte).

## Interactions
CCL2, also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interacts primarily with the C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), a G-protein coupled receptor. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to sites of inflammation. CCL2 exists in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with the monomeric form being more effective in binding and activating CCR2 (Aguas2022Rational; Tan2012Design). 

The binding of CCL2 to CCR2 involves specific residues, including Y13, R24, K35, K38, and K49, which are critical for receptor interaction (Tomczak2011Identification). CCL2 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on endothelial cell surfaces, which is important for chemokine oligomerization and leukocyte migration. This interaction is mediated by electrostatic forces, with variations in surface charge densities affecting GAG binding affinities (Joshi2020Dissecting).

CCL2 can also bind to other molecules, such as the flavonoid baicalin, which interacts with the N-terminal, β1, and β3-sheets of CCL2. This binding can inhibit CCL2's interaction with its receptor and GAGs, potentially reducing chemokine-regulated leukocyte trafficking (Joshi2020Elucidating).
