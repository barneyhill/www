# ORM1

## Overview
ORM1, ororosomucoid 1, is a gene that encodes a highly glycosylated plasma protein known as orosomucoid 1. This protein is categorized as an acute-phase glycoprotein and is primarily synthesized in the liver. It plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and maintaining physiological homeostasis. Orosomucoid 1 is involved in various biological processes, including the regulation of capillary permeability, modulation of inflammatory responses, and participation in sphingolipid metabolism. The protein's structure, characterized by a single polypeptide chain and multiple carbohydrate chains, allows it to interact with various receptors and signaling pathways, influencing processes such as energy balance, angiogenesis, and cancer progression. Alterations in the ORM1 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, including thrombosis, cancer, and metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Fournier2000Alpha1acid; Yu2023ORM1; Yuasa1997Human; Luo2015Orosomucoid).

## Structure
The ORM1 gene encodes the orosomucoid 1 protein, a highly glycosylated plasma protein with a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 daltons. It consists of a single polypeptide chain of 183 amino acids and five carbohydrate chains, contributing to its high carbohydrate content of about 45% (Fournier2000Alpha1acid; Yuasa1997Human). The primary structure of ORM1 includes specific amino acid sequences that result in different alleles, such as ORM1*F1, ORM1*F2, and ORM1*S, which are characterized by variations at specific codons (Yuasa1997Human).

The secondary structure of ORM1 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common in glycoproteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds and glycosylation, a common post-translational modification that influences the protein's function and stability (Fournier2000Alpha1acid). Glycosylation patterns vary due to different glycoforms, which are influenced by pathophysiological conditions and regulatory mediators (Fournier2000Alpha1acid).

ORM1 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its structural diversity and functional versatility in modulating immune responses (Yuasa2006The). The protein's structure and glycosylation are crucial for its biological functions, including drug and hormone binding (Fournier2000Alpha1acid).

## Function
ORM1, or orosomucoid 1, is a plasma protein primarily involved in modulating immune responses and maintaining physiological functions in healthy human cells. It acts as an acute-phase protein, synthesized mainly in the liver, and is involved in various molecular processes. ORM1 plays a crucial role in maintaining capillary permeability by interacting with endothelial cells, reducing plasma water filtration, and enhancing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins (Luo2015Orosomucoid).

In the immune system, ORM1 exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting histamine through cAMP and antagonizing capillary leakage caused by inflammatory mediators like histamine and bradykinin (Luo2015Orosomucoid). It also modulates cytokine production, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and promoting the expression of deactivating markers in macrophages, contributing to tissue homeostasis and remodeling (Gemelli2013The; Luo2015Orosomucoid).

ORM1 is involved in sphingolipid metabolism, forming complexes with serine palmitoyltransferase to regulate sphingolipid synthesis and protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (Luo2015Orosomucoid). It also enhances glucose uptake in adipocytes, alleviating insulin resistance, and may serve as a biomarker for metabolic syndrome and endothelial dysfunction in diabetes (Luo2015Orosomucoid).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ORM1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of thrombosis, ORM1 is associated with plasma levels of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which is linked to thrombosis risk. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near ORM1, rs1687391, influences cfDNA levels, suggesting ORM1 as a candidate gene in cfDNA regulation and a potential susceptibility locus for thrombosis (Lopez2022Integrated). Additionally, multiallelic copy number variation (mCNV) in ORM1 is associated with increased cfDNA levels, which are considered an intermediate phenotype for venous thromboembolism (VTE). This mCNV is linked to decreased ORM1 expression and increased VTE risk (MartinFernandez2023Multiallelic).

In cancer, ORM1 expression is significantly higher in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) tissues compared to normal tissues. High ORM1 expression correlates with worse survival outcomes in KIRC patients. ORM1 knockdown in KIRC cell lines reduces cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its role in tumor progression and metastasis (Yu2023ORM1).

ORM1 also plays a role in lipid metabolism. In yeast, ORM1 and its homologs regulate sphingolipid synthesis, and their deletion leads to dysregulation of serine palmitoyltransferase activity, affecting lipid homeostasis (Han2010Orm1).

## Interactions
Orosomucoid 1 (ORM1) is involved in various interactions with proteins and signaling pathways. It acts as an agonist for the leptin receptor (LepR), directly binding to it and activating the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway in the hypothalamus. This interaction is crucial for regulating energy balance and food intake (Sun2016The). ORM1 also interacts with other receptors, such as CCR5, which may contribute to its effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake (Sun2016The).

In the context of angiogenesis, ORM1 modulates the activity of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa) by inhibiting its signaling pathways in macrophages and endothelial cells. It specifically inhibits TNFa-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK, while not affecting VEGF-induced signaling (Ligresti2012The). ORM1 also interacts with receptors like Siglec-5 in neutrophils, influencing inflammatory and angiogenic processes (Ligresti2012The).

In colorectal cancer, ORM1 affects the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhancing cancer cell activities. It also induces macrophage M2 polarization, contributing to a pro-tumor immune microenvironment (Yue2023Orosomucoid).
