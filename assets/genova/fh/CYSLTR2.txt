# CYSLTR2

## Overview
The CYSLTR2 gene encodes the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLT2R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in mediating inflammatory responses. This receptor is part of the larger family of cysteinyl leukotriene receptors, which are activated by cysteinyl leukotrienes, lipid mediators involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including inflammation and immune responses (Capra2006Cysteinyl‐leukotrienes; Rovati2007CysteinylLeukotriene). CysLT2R is characterized by its seven-transmembrane helical structure, typical of GPCRs, and is expressed in diverse tissues such as the heart, brain, and immune cells, indicating its involvement in multiple biological functions (Gusach2019Structural; Rovati2007CysteinylLeukotriene). The receptor's interactions and signaling pathways are implicated in various clinical conditions, including uveal melanoma, where specific mutations in CYSLTR2 contribute to oncogenic processes (Moore2016Recurrent; Slater2018Evaluation).

## Structure
The CYSLTR2 gene encodes the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in inflammatory responses. The protein consists of 346 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 58 kDa (Capra2006Cysteinyl‐leukotrienes; Rovati2007CysteinylLeukotriene). It features the canonical seven-transmembrane helical bundle architecture typical of GPCRs (Gusach2019Structural). 

The receptor includes four potential N-glycosylation sites, three of which are located in the extracellular N-tail, and one in the second extracellular loop (Capra2006Cysteinyl‐leukotrienes). It also contains several potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A and C, primarily located in the third intracellular loop and carboxyl terminal (Rovati2007CysteinylLeukotriene). 

The CysLT2R structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, notably between C111 and C187, and C31 and C279, which help maintain the receptor's conformation (Gusach2019Structural). The intracellular amphipathic helix 8 (H8) is well-resolved in CysLT2R, unlike in CysLT1R, due to differences in the junction between TM7 and H8 (Gusach2019Structural). These structural features are crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation.

## Function
The CYSLTR2 gene encodes the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLT2R), a G-protein coupled receptor involved in mediating inflammatory responses through the binding of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) such as LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. This receptor is expressed in various human tissues, including the heart, brain, adrenals, and immune cells, indicating its involvement in multiple physiological processes (Rovati2007CysteinylLeukotriene).

In endothelial cells, CysLT2R activation by LTD4 leads to the upregulation of proinflammatory and prothrombotic genes, contributing to a proinflammatory phenotype. This receptor is involved in the regulation of genes associated with vascular inflammation and endothelial cell function, suggesting a role in vascular biology and inflammation (Uzonyi2006Cysteinyl).

In human mast cells, CysLT2R is implicated in the secretion of IL-8, a chemokine involved in neutrophilic infiltration during inflammatory responses. This receptor operates through Gi/Go proteins for calcium-independent signaling, highlighting its distinct functional roles compared to the type 1 receptor (CysLT1R) (Mellor2003Expression).

CysLT2R also interacts with CysLT1R, potentially forming receptor complexes that modulate leukotriene signaling pathways, influencing cell proliferation and immune responses (Jiang2007CysLT2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYSLTR2 gene, particularly the Leu129Gln (L129Q) mutation, have been implicated in the development of uveal melanoma, a type of cancer originating from melanocytes in the eye. This mutation leads to constitutive activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor, contributing to tumorigenesis by promoting cell growth and survival through the Gαq signaling pathway (Moore2016Recurrent). The L129Q mutation is a recurrent hotspot mutation in uveal melanoma and is considered a driver oncogene, similar to mutations in GNAQ and GNA11, which are also involved in this cancer type (Moore2016Recurrent; Slater2018Evaluation).

In addition to uveal melanoma, CYSLTR2 mutations have been identified in blue nevi and blue nevus-like melanomas, where they mimic pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (Goto2019CYSLTR2mutant). These mutations are rare in other cancer types but have been observed in some cases of colorectal cancer, although they are not as prevalent (Slater2018Evaluation).

Alterations in CYSLTR2 expression levels have also been noted in certain acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, where the gene is overexpressed (Slater2018Evaluation). The role of CYSLTR2 in cancer is complex, as it can have both oncogenic and protective effects depending on the cancer type (Slater2018Evaluation).

## Interactions
The CYSLTR2 protein, also known as cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2, is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins. Notably, CYSLTR2 can form heterodimers with the CysLT1 receptor in mast cells. This interaction has been demonstrated using techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and coimmunoprecipitation, indicating that these receptors are in close proximity and interact directly (Jiang2007CysLT2). The heterodimerization of CysLT1 and CysLT2 receptors affects their signaling properties and surface expression, with CysLT2 modulating the expression and function of CysLT1 (Jiang2007CysLT2).

In addition to its interactions with CysLT1, the CysLTR2-L129Q mutant, associated with uveal melanoma, shows a strong bias towards Gq/11 signaling pathways and fails to significantly recruit β-arrestins. This is due to a lack of a strong phosphorylation code in its cytoplasmic tail, which affects its interaction with β-arrestins (Ceraudo2021Direct). The mutant's biased signaling pattern allows it to persistently activate Gq proteins while avoiding β-arrestin-dependent downregulation mechanisms (Ceraudo2021Direct).
