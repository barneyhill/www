# ZMYND11

## Overview
ZMYND11 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger MYND-type containing 11 protein, also known as BS69, which is a transcriptional regulator involved in chromatin dynamics and gene expression. The protein is characterized by several domains, including a plant homeodomain (PHD), a bromodomain, and a PWWP domain, which facilitate its role in recognizing and binding specific chromosomal marks, such as the trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3.3 (H3.3K36me3) (Wu2022Zinc; Wen2014ZMYND11). ZMYND11 plays a critical role in regulating RNA polymerase II elongation and RNA splicing, impacting processes such as neural development and tumor suppression (Guo2014BS69ZMYND11; Chang2024ZMYND11). Clinically, mutations in ZMYND11 are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its significance in human health (Yates2020ZMYND11; Moskowitz2016A).

## Structure
The ZMYND11 protein, also known as BS69, is characterized by several domains that contribute to its role in chromatin binding and transcription regulation. It contains a plant homeodomain (PHD), a bromodomain, and a PWWP domain, which are involved in recognizing and binding chromosomal marks (Wu2022Zinc; Wen2014ZMYND11). The PWWP domain, in particular, plays a crucial role in recognizing the trimethylation on histone variant H3.3 at lysine 36 (H3.3K36me3) and has a five-bladed β-barrel fold with an aromatic cage that binds H3K36me3 (Guo2014BS69ZMYND11; Wen2014ZMYND11). The tandem bromo-PWWP domains form a V-shaped structure with a zinc finger motif (Wen2014ZMYND11).

The MYND domain of ZMYND11, located at residues 563-598, is involved in interactions with various chromatin-related factors and transcription factors, indicating its role in gene expression regulation (Wu2022Zinc). This domain exhibits a ββα fold with two zinc finger clusters, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Harter2016BS69ZMYND11). ZMYND11 also contains a coiled-coil domain that self-associates, bringing two MYND domains in close proximity, which enhances its interaction capabilities (Harter2016BS69ZMYND11).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may affect the function of ZMYND11, and splice variants can result in different isoforms with distinct functional properties (Lian2023Epigenetic).

## Function
ZMYND11 is a protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator in healthy human cells. It specifically recognizes the trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3.3 (H3.3K36me3) through its PHD, BROMO, and PWWP domains, which are involved in chromatin recognition (Guo2014BS69ZMYND11; Wen2014ZMYND11). This interaction allows ZMYND11 to modulate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation, thereby repressing gene expression by preventing the transition of paused Pol II to elongation (Wen2014ZMYND11). 

ZMYND11 plays a critical role in RNA splicing regulation, particularly in intron retention (IR) and exon skipping (ES) events. It antagonizes EFTUD2 in IR regulation, dependent on its physical interaction with EFTUD2 and its binding to H3K36me3-decorated chromatin (Guo2014BS69ZMYND11). 

In the context of neural development, ZMYND11 is essential for the differentiation of radial glial neural stem cells into intermediate progenitor cells, a process crucial for corticogenesis. It regulates brain-specific splicing and controls a brain-specific isoform switch involving the splicing regulator RBFOX2, which is vital for proper cortical development (Chang2024ZMYND11). 

ZMYND11's function as a tumor suppressor is also significant, as its expression levels correlate with cancer progression, and its overexpression can suppress tumor growth (Wen2014ZMYND11).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZMYND11 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including syndromic intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy. Patients with pathogenic variants in ZMYND11 often exhibit developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and behavioral issues such as attention deficit, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (Yates2020ZMYND11). Neurological abnormalities, including hypotonia and seizures, are also common (Moskowitz2016A). Dysmorphic facial features, such as thick eyebrows and a distinct nasal structure, are frequently observed (Yates2020ZMYND11).

ZMYND11 is implicated in 10p15.3 microdeletion syndrome, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and craniofacial dysmorphism. Haploinsufficiency of ZMYND11 is believed to account for many of these features (Tumiene2017Phenotype). The gene's role in chromatin regulation and transcriptional repression suggests that its mutations can disrupt normal gene expression, contributing to the observed phenotypes (Bodetko2024Further).

In some cases, ZMYND11 mutations are de novo, while others are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, including instances of parental mosaicism (Oates2021ZMYND11). The variability in phenotypic expression among individuals with ZMYND11 mutations suggests a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations (Yates2020ZMYND11).

## Interactions
ZMYND11, also known as BS69, is a protein that engages in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics. It interacts with the protein HNRNPA1 through its MYND domain, which is crucial for stress granule formation and cancer cell behavior. This interaction is significant in prostate cancer, where ZMYND11 sequesters HNRNPA1 in the nucleus, inhibiting its oncogenic activity (Lian2023Epigenetic).

ZMYND11 also interacts with the transcription factors ETS1 and ETS2. It specifically binds to ETS2, leading to reduced transcriptional activation, which is important for the regulation of cell migration gene expression programs (Plotnik2017Interaction). In the context of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, ZMYND11 interacts with the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), inhibiting its function and affecting the proliferation of lymphoblastoid cell lines (Harter2016BS69ZMYND11).

In leukemogenesis, the ZMYND11-MBTD1 fusion protein recruits the NuA4/Tip60 acetyltransferase complex to target loci, activating proto-oncogenes essential for leukemic transformation. This interaction is mediated through the PWWP domain of ZMYND11, which binds to H3.3K36me3, and is crucial for chromatin association and oncogenic activity (Li2021ZMYND11MBTD1).
