# ZSCAN20

## Overview
ZSCAN20 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 20, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a SCAN domain. The zinc finger motifs are typically associated with DNA or RNA binding capabilities, suggesting a potential role in gene regulation. The SCAN domain is a conserved protein-protein interaction motif that facilitates selective dimerization and interaction with other SCAN domain-containing proteins. This categorizes ZSCAN20 as a member of the zinc finger protein family, which is known for its involvement in transcriptional regulation and cellular signaling pathways. The protein's ability to form multiprotein complexes through its SCAN domain indicates its participation in a complex network of protein interactions, potentially influencing various cellular processes (delahaye2018characterisation).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZSCAN20, a protein containing zinc finger and SCAN domains, is involved in a network of protein-protein interactions. The SCAN domain, a conserved motif found in certain zinc finger proteins, facilitates selective dimerization and interaction with other proteins containing similar domains. Large-scale protein-protein interaction studies have demonstrated that SCAN-containing proteins, including ZSCAN20, often self-associate and interact with other SCAN domain proteins. This suggests that ZSCAN20 plays a role in a complex network of protein interactions, potentially forming multiprotein complexes (delahaye2018characterisation).

The BIOPLEX network study supports these findings, indicating that ZSCAN20 has numerous interactions with both SCAN domain proteins and non-SCAN proteins. This highlights the protein's involvement in diverse interaction networks, which may influence various cellular processes (delahaye2018characterisation). The SCAN domain's ability to mediate these interactions underscores its importance in the functional role of ZSCAN20 within the cell. While specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context, the presence of zinc finger domains typically suggests potential DNA or RNA binding capabilities, which could further expand the interaction profile of ZSCAN20.
