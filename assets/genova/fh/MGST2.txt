# MGST2

## Overview
Microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 (MGST2) is a gene that encodes an integral membrane protein belonging to the MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism) family. The MGST2 protein is primarily involved in cellular detoxification processes, where it facilitates the conjugation of glutathione to various substrates, thereby neutralizing reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics. This protein is characterized by its trimeric structure, with each monomer contributing to the formation of potential active sites, although only one is catalytically active at a time. MGST2 plays a crucial role in the synthesis of leukotriene C4, a process significant for the biosynthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which impact microcirculation and coronary vessels. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including strabismus and cancer, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Thulasingam2021Crystal; Chaomulige2024Morphometric; Ahmad2013Catalytic).

## Structure
The human microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 (MGST2) is a trimeric integral membrane protein with a molecular mass of approximately 17 kDa per monomer (Ahmad2013Catalytic). MGST2 is part of the MAPEG family, which is characterized by its involvement in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism. The protein structure is primarily composed of transmembrane alpha helices, which facilitate its integration into the membrane (Ahmad2013Catalytic).

MGST2 forms homotrimers, contributing to its quaternary structure, which is essential for its enzymatic function (Ahmad2013Catalytic). The enzyme is known to stabilize a GS-thiolate, indicating a stoichiometry of one glutathione molecule per MGST2 subunit in the trimer (Ahmad2013Catalytic). This stabilization is crucial for its catalytic activity, particularly in the detoxification processes where it catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione to electrophilic compounds.

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and stability. However, specific details on the phosphorylation sites or other modifications are not provided in the available context. The structural configuration of MGST2, including its transmembrane helices and trimeric assembly, plays a significant role in its function within the cellular environment.

## Function
Microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 (MGST2) is an integral membrane protein that plays a significant role in cellular detoxification processes. It is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to various substrates, aiding in the neutralization of reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics (Ahmad2013Catalytic). MGST2 is a member of the MAPEG family and is involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids and glutathione (Thulasingam2021Crystal).

MGST2 is crucial for the synthesis of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in non-hematopoietic cells, a process that involves the conjugation of GSH with leukotriene A4 (LTA4) (Thulasingam2021Crystal; Ahmad2013Catalytic). This enzyme exhibits GSH-dependent lipid peroxidase activity and is capable of producing cysteinyl immunoresolvents, which are specialized proresolving mediators (Thulasingam2021Crystal). The enzyme's catalytic mechanism is unique, as it restricts catalysis to one of its three active sites at a time, a behavior observed in other MAPEG family members (Thulasingam2021Crystal).

MGST2 undergoes significant conformational changes upon GSH binding, which are essential for its catalytic activity. These changes regulate solvent accessibility and facilitate the entry and processing of hydrophilic substrates like GSH (Thulasingam2021Crystal). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and defense mechanisms against oxidative stress (Ahmad2013Catalytic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MGST2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of strabismus, a condition characterized by misalignment of the eyes, MGST2 has been identified as a potential candidate gene for susceptibility. Studies using MGST2 knockout mice have shown that the absence of this gene can lead to increased eye volume, which may contribute to the development of strabismus (Chaomulige2024Morphometric).

In cancer research, MGST2 expression is significantly up-regulated in cells transfected with a mutant form of the hepatitis B virus. This up-regulation is associated with cancer hallmarks such as tumor-promoting inflammation and genome instability, suggesting a role in carcinogenesis, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (Lai2020Hepatitis). The gene's involvement in the synthesis of leukotriene C4, which is linked to oxidative stress and DNA damage, further supports its role in cancer development (Thulasingam2021Crystal).

MGST2's role in oxidative stress regulation is also noted in other contexts, such as its potential involvement in enhancing resistance to lipid peroxides and clearing reactive oxygen species, which are crucial for cellular defense mechanisms (Zhao2021Identification).

## Interactions
MGST2, a member of the MAPEG family, is involved in the synthesis of leukotriene C4 and participates in various interactions that regulate its function. The enzyme forms a homo-trimer, with each monomer contributing to the formation of potential active sites, although only one is catalytically active at a time. This structural arrangement is crucial for its function and is a characteristic shared with other MAPEG family members (Thulasingam2021Crystal).

MGST2 interacts with glutathione (GSH), which is essential for its catalytic activity. The binding of GSH induces synchronized conformational changes in MGST2, affecting both local and global structures. These changes involve intra- and inter-monomeric interactions, such as those between Asn55 and Arg90, which shift upon GSH binding. The interaction of Glu58 with different partners depending on GSH occupancy further highlights the dynamic nature of these interactions (Thulasingam2021Crystal).

MGST2 also plays a role in the conversion of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) into leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, where it is the primary enzyme responsible for this conversion. This process is crucial for the biosynthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which have significant effects on microcirculation and coronary vessels (Sjöström2001Human).
