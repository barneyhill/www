# OR13C2

## Overview
OR13C2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily C member 2, which is part of the extensive G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odorants, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways upon binding specific molecules (Ieki2022Functional). While primarily associated with olfactory functions, OR13C2 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues such as the skin, where it may contribute to processes like epidermal proliferation and regeneration (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The gene has been implicated in various physiological and pathological contexts, including potential roles in cancer progression and neurodegenerative diseases, although its precise clinical significance remains to be fully understood (melocchi2017novel; Dehghani2021A).

## Function
OR13C2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily known for their role in detecting odorants in the nasal epithelium, where they bind specific molecules and initiate a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR13C2, like other olfactory receptors, is involved in the molecular processes of odor detection and signal transduction, contributing to the sense of smell by triggering neuronal responses upon binding to odorants (Ieki2022Functional).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR13C2 is expressed in the skin and other tissues, where it may have functions beyond odor detection. The study by Uehara et al. suggests that OR13C2, along with other olfactory receptor genes, is involved in epidermal and keratinocyte proliferation, migration, regeneration, and cytokine production. The downregulation of OR13C2 in individuals with sensitive skin may be associated with disturbances in epidermal homeostasis, potentially contributing to skin sensitivity (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). However, it remains unclear whether this downregulation is a cause or consequence of sensitive skin conditions.

## Clinical Significance
The OR13C2 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been studied in the context of various diseases, although its direct involvement in specific conditions remains unclear. In breast cancer research, mutations in OR13C2 were identified in primary tumors, mammospheres, and patient-derived xenografts, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression and cancer stem cell activity. These mutations were enriched in specific sub-clones of cells with cancer stem cell activity, indicating a possible involvement in cancer evolution (melocchi2017novel). Despite these findings, no direct reports of OR13C2's involvement in cancer have been documented in the literature (melocchi2017novel).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, a heterozygous deletion overlapping OR13C2 was detected in a patient with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This deletion was also reported in Alzheimer's disease cases, although it is not considered common in the general population. The potential for copy number discordance in CNVs overlapping OR13C2 suggests that differences in cohort sizes and populations should be considered when interpreting these results (Dehghani2021A). Despite these associations, the direct clinical significance of OR13C2 mutations or alterations in expression remains to be fully elucidated.
