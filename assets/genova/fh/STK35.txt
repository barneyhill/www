# STK35

## Overview
STK35 is a gene that encodes the protein serine/threonine kinase 35, which is a member of the kinase family of proteins. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and nucleolus of cells, where it plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, cell cycle regulation, and cell migration. The protein's kinase activity is essential for its function in these processes, particularly in endothelial cells, where it influences vascular healing and angiogenesis. STK35 is involved in the regulation of the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle, acting as a negative regulator by modulating genes such as CDKN2A. Additionally, STK35 interacts with nuclear actin and other proteins, impacting cellular functions and potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis, including cancer (Sharma2021STK35L1; Wu2018SerineThreonine; Goyal2011STK35L1).

## Function
STK35, also known as serine/threonine kinase 35, is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in endothelial cells. It is primarily localized in the nucleus and nucleolus, where it associates with nuclear actin, suggesting a role in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription (Sharma2021STK35L1; Goyal2011STK35L1). The protein contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal and a nucleolar localization signal, which are crucial for its nuclear and nucleolar localization (Goyal2011STK35L1).

STK35 is involved in regulating the cell cycle, particularly by acting as a negative regulator of the G1 to S phase transition. This regulation is achieved through the modulation of genes such as CDKN2A, which encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 INK4a, thereby maintaining cells in the G1 phase and inhibiting proliferation (Sharma2021STK35L1; Goyal2011STK35L1). The protein also influences cell migration and angiogenesis, essential for vascular healing and endothelial cell function (Goyal2011STK35L1).

STK35's interaction with nuclear actin and its role in cell cycle regulation and migration highlight its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential involvement in various diseases (Sharma2021STK35L1; Goyal2011STK35L1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the STK35 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In osteosarcoma, STK35 is significantly overexpressed compared to normal bone tissues. This overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, suggesting an oncogenic role for STK35 in this type of bone cancer. The gene is regulated by the STAT3 transcription factor, and its expression is positively correlated with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is known to influence cancer cell survival and proliferation (Wu2018SerineThreonine).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), STK35 is also overexpressed, with higher levels of protein expression correlating with poorer survival outcomes. This overexpression promotes glycolysis and inhibits apoptosis through the AKT signaling pathway, contributing to chemoresistance against drugs like fluorouracil (5-FU). STK35's interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, which regulates its ubiquitination, further influences CRC progression by modulating apoptosis and glycolysis (Yang2020STK35).

These findings suggest that STK35 could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in both osteosarcoma and colorectal cancer, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
STK35 is known to interact with various proteins, influencing key cellular processes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), STK35 is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, which affects its stability and function. This interaction is crucial for regulating glycolysis and apoptosis through the AKT signaling pathway, contributing to chemoresistance in CRC (Yang2020STK35). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the interaction between STK35 and NEDD4L, highlighting a proteasome-dependent regulation mechanism (Yang2020STK35).

In osteosarcoma cells, STK35 is regulated by the transcription factor STAT3, which binds directly to the STK35 promoter, enhancing its transcription. This interaction suggests that STK35 acts as a downstream effector of STAT3, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wu2018SerineThreonine).

STK35 also interacts with nuclear actin, as demonstrated in endothelial cells. This interaction is mediated by a class III PDZ domain binding motif (PDZ-BM) within STK35, which localizes with actin stress fibers and membrane ruffles in migrating cells. This association is significant for regulating the cell cycle and migration, potentially affecting gene transcription related to these processes (Goyal2011STK35L1).
