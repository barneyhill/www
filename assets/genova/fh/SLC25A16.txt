# SLC25A16

## Overview
SLC25A16 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 16, which is part of the mitochondrial carrier family. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is involved in the transport of molecules across the mitochondrial membrane. It is hypothesized to play a critical role in the import of coenzyme A (CoA) or its precursors into mitochondria, a function supported by studies in yeast models (Palmieri2004The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The SLC25A16 protein is characterized by a structure comprising six transmembrane alpha-helices, forming a homodimer that facilitates its transport function (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational; Palmieri2004The). Although initially associated with Graves' disease, SLC25A16 is expressed in various tissues, suggesting a broader physiological role (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). Mutations in this gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as isolated fingernail dysplasia and potentially to autoimmune and psychiatric disorders (Palmieri2020Diseases; Babenko2018Altered).

## Structure
SLC25A16 is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family, characterized by a tripartite structure with three homologous domains, each approximately 100 amino acids long. These domains contain two hydrophobic stretches that span the mitochondrial membrane as alpha-helices, separated by hydrophilic regions (Palmieri2013The; Palmieri2004The). The protein forms a funnel-shaped structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices, arranged in a counter-clockwise order, creating a central cavity that is open towards the cytosol (Palmieri2013The).

The SLC25A16 protein is thought to function as a homodimer, with each monomer contributing to the six transmembrane helices, connected by hydrophilic loops, and both the N- and C-termini located on the cytosolic side (Palmieri2004The). The protein's structure is stabilized by a network of salt bridges formed by conserved motifs, which are crucial for its transport mechanism (Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational).

While the exact function of SLC25A16 remains unclear, it is suggested to be involved in the transport of coenzyme A (CoA) into mitochondria, as indicated by studies in yeast (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The protein's role in mitochondrial CoA transport is supported by its similarity to other known CoA transporters (Curcio2020Drosophila).

## Function
SLC25A16, also known as the Graves' disease carrier (GDC), is a member of the solute carrier family 25, which is involved in transporting molecules across the mitochondrial membrane. This protein is believed to play a role in the import of coenzyme A (CoA) or its precursors into mitochondria, a hypothesis supported by studies in yeast where the deletion of the yeast homolog Leu5p results in reduced mitochondrial CoA levels. The human SLC25A16 can complement this deficiency in yeast, suggesting a similar function in humans (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Palmieri2004The).

Despite its initial identification in the context of Graves' disease, SLC25A16 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, lung, kidney, and striated muscle, indicating a broader physiological role beyond the thyroid (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The exact function of SLC25A16 in healthy human cells remains unclear, but it is highly expressed in the same tissues as SLC25A42, another carrier involved in CoA transport, suggesting a possible redundant or complementary role in CoA metabolism (Cunningham202020). The protein's activity in the mitochondria is crucial for maintaining cellular metabolism and energy production, although direct transport assays are needed to confirm its specific substrates and functions (Palmieri2004The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC25A16 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions. A notable mutation, p.Arg31Leu, has been linked to autosomal recessive isolated fingernail dysplasia in a Pakistani family. This condition is characterized by severe onychodystrophy, hyperkeratotic nail beds, thickened and dystrophic nail plates, and mild erythema and swelling near the proximal nail folds, while the toenails remain unaffected (Palmieri2020Diseases; Saneto2020Mitochondrial).

The SLC25A16 gene has also been implicated in autoimmune diseases, such as Graves' disease, which affects the thyroid and can lead to hypothyroidism. This association was initially identified due to the presence of antibodies against mitochondrial antigens in patients with Graves' disease (Babenko2018Altered; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). However, the direct link between SLC25A16 and Graves' disease remains unclear (Palmieri2020Diseases).

Alterations in the expression of SLC25A16 have been observed in the context of psychiatric disorders. In experimental models of anxiety and depression, changes in the expression of SLC25A16 and other Slc25 family genes have been noted, suggesting a potential role in mitochondrial dysfunction associated with these conditions (Babenko2018Altered).
