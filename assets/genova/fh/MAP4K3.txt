# MAP4K3

## Overview
MAP4K3, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the mammalian Ste20-like kinase family. The protein product of MAP4K3, often referred to as GLK, plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and metabolism (Branch2023MAP4K3). Structurally, the protein features a conserved amino-terminal kinase domain, essential for its enzymatic activity, and is involved in protein-protein interactions through its proline-rich motifs and citron-homology domain (Chuang2019MAP4K3GLK). MAP4K3 is implicated in nutrient sensing and metabolic regulation, influencing processes such as autophagy and protein synthesis (Hsu2018MAP4K3). Clinically, alterations in MAP4K3 expression are associated with autoimmune diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Chuang2019MAP4K3GLK; Chuang2021Genomic).

## Structure
MAP4K3, also known as GLK, is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the mammalian Ste20-like kinase family. The protein structure of MAP4K3 includes a conserved amino-terminal kinase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Chuang2019MAP4K3GLK). This domain is followed by three proline-rich motifs and a conserved carboxy-terminal citron-homology (CNH) domain, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions (Chuang2019MAP4K3GLK; Seo2020MAP4K). 

MAP4K3 undergoes post-translational modifications, including autophosphorylation at the Ser-170 residue, which is identified as the trans-autophosphorylation site (Chuang2019MAP4K3GLK). Tyrosine phosphorylation is also induced by EGF stimulation at specific residues, including Tyr-366, Tyr-379, Tyr-574, and Tyr-735 (Chuang2019MAP4K3GLK). 

The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its structure and role in signaling pathways (ResnikDocampo2011MAP4K3). MAP4K3 interacts with various adaptor proteins, such as HIP-55 and SLP-76, suggesting a role in T-cell receptor signaling (Chuang2019MAP4K3GLK). These structural features and interactions highlight MAP4K3's involvement in diverse cellular processes.

## Function
MAP4K3, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 3, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the mTORC1 complex, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism. In healthy human cells, MAP4K3 is involved in amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 by inhibiting the LKB1-AMPK pathway, which is a known repressor of mTORC1. This inhibition is achieved through the phosphorylation of Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), preventing the activation of LKB1 and thus promoting mTORC1 activation (Branch2023MAP4K3).

MAP4K3 also interacts with the TSC1/2-Rheb pathway, partially inhibiting the TSC1/2 complex to facilitate mTORC1 activation. This function is essential for cell growth and metabolism, as MAP4K3 promotes anabolic processes like protein synthesis while repressing catabolic processes such as autophagy (Branch2023MAP4K3).

In the context of autophagy, MAP4K3 regulates the localization and activity of TFEB, a transcription factor involved in autophagy. Under amino acid-rich conditions, MAP4K3 phosphorylates TFEB, sequestering it in the cytosol and inhibiting autophagy (Hsu2018MAP4K3). This regulation underscores MAP4K3's role as a central node in nutrient sensing and metabolic regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAP4K3 gene, also known as GLK, are linked to several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and adult-onset Still's disease. Overexpression of MAP4K3 in T cells is associated with increased disease severity in these conditions and serves as a biomarker for autoimmune diseases. In particular, GLK overexpression leads to the activation of the AhR-RORγt complex, promoting the transcription of interleukin 17A (IL-17A), a cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE (Chuang2019MAP4K3GLK; Chuang2019MAP4K).

Genetic variants of MAP4K3, such as somatic and germline mutations, contribute to its overexpression and are associated with severe SLE symptoms. Specific variants, including T635C, A410T, and K650R, have been identified, with some preventing ubiquitination and stabilizing the GLK protein, leading to increased IL-17A production and autoimmune responses (Chuang2021Genomic).

In cancer, MAP4K3 overexpression is linked to recurrence and metastasis, particularly in non-small cell lung carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. It enhances cell migration and invasion, potentially through interactions with proteins like IQGAP1 (Chuang2019MAP4K3GLK).

## Interactions
MAP4K3, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 3, participates in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with components of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, including Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), where it phosphorylates SIRT1 at threonine 344. This phosphorylation inhibits SIRT1's enzymatic activity, affecting its interaction with LKB1 and preventing LKB1 from activating AMPK, thereby promoting mTORC1 activation (Branch2023MAP4K3). MAP4K3 also interacts with the TSC1/2-Rheb pathway, where it partially inhibits the TSC complex to derepress Rheb, facilitating mTORC1 activation (Branch2023MAP4K3).

In the context of autophagy, MAP4K3 interacts with transcription factor EB (TFEB), phosphorylating it at serine 3. This phosphorylation is necessary for TFEB's interaction with the mTORC1-Rag GTPase complex, influencing TFEB's subcellular localization and activity (Hsu2018MAP4K3). MAP4K3 also forms interactions with ribosomal proteins MRPL11 and RPL36, and nuclear proteins LIN28B and SNRPB2, suggesting roles in ribosome biogenesis and signal transduction (Seo2020MAP4K). These interactions highlight MAP4K3's role as a central node in nutrient sensing and cellular growth regulation.
