# CCDC68

## Overview
CCDC68, or coiled-coil domain containing 68, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the assembly and function of subdistal appendages (SDAs) at the centrosomes in human cells. The CCDC68 protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, such as CEP170, to mediate microtubule anchoring and organization. This protein plays a crucial role in the hierarchical assembly of SDAs, essential for cellular processes like vesicular trafficking, cell migration, and division (Huang2017Hierarchical). Beyond its structural role, CCDC68 is also implicated in cancer biology, acting as a tumor suppressor in certain contexts, such as colorectal cancer, by influencing cell cycle regulation through interactions with proteins like ITCH and CDK4 (Wang2021CoiledCoil). However, its expression and function can vary across different cancer types, highlighting its complex role in tumorigenesis (Hua2020Coiled‑coil; Radulovich2014Coiledcoil).

## Function
CCDC68 is a protein involved in the assembly of subdistal appendages (SDAs) at the centrosomes in human cells, playing a crucial role in microtubule anchoring and organization. It interacts with CEP170, a known SDA protein, and is essential for recruiting CEP170 to SDAs, which is vital for the hierarchical assembly of these structures (Huang2017Hierarchical). CCDC68 forms a ring-like structure at the distal part of the mother centriole, similar to other SDA proteins, and its localization changes from asymmetric in the G1 phase to symmetric in the G2 phase (Huang2017Hierarchical).

The protein functions independently of CCDC120, another SDA component, although both are involved in microtubule anchoring at the centrosome. This anchoring is crucial for various cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, cell migration, and division (Huang2017Hierarchical). CCDC68's role in microtubule anchoring is primarily mediated through its association with CEP170, and its depletion results in impaired microtubule organization, as evidenced by fewer and weaker microtubule asters in regrowth assays (Huang2017Hierarchical). Despite its significant role in SDA assembly, CCDC68 does not affect cilia formation, indicating its specific function in centrosome-related processes (Huang2017Hierarchical).

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC68 gene has been implicated in several cancers, with its expression levels and mutations playing a significant role in disease progression. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), CCDC68 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Loss of function through copy number loss or expression of an unstable protein isoform enhances tumor formation. A novel splice variant lacking tumor-suppressive function, resulting from SNP rs1344011, has been identified in PDAC, suggesting that alterations in CCDC68 expression and splicing are associated with the disease (Radulovich2014Coiledcoil).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), reduced expression of CCDC68 is linked to advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis. It is associated with mutations in TP53 and KRAS genes, and its low expression correlates with poorer survival outcomes. CCDC68's role in CRC involves several signaling pathways, including the Wnt signaling pathway, which is enriched in low CCDC68 expression phenotypes (Zhang2022CCDC68).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CCDC68 is highly expressed and promotes cell proliferation, contrasting its tumor-suppressive role in other cancers. Knockdown of CCDC68 in NSCLC cell lines reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (Hua2020Coiled‑coil).

## Interactions
CCDC68 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in the regulation of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation. One of the key interactions is with the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH, which mediates the degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). CCDC68 overexpression in CRC cells leads to increased ITCH expression, which in turn promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of CDK4, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and inhibition of CRC cell proliferation (Wang2021CoiledCoil). This interaction suggests that CCDC68 acts as a tumor suppressor by facilitating ITCH-mediated CDK4 degradation (Wang2021CoiledCoil).

CCDC68 also influences the transcriptional regulation of ITCH by upregulating the transcription factor RXRa, which enhances ITCH gene transcription and increases ITCH mRNA and protein levels (Wang2021CoiledCoil). This regulatory axis involving CCDC68, ITCH, and CDK4 highlights the protein's role in modulating cell cycle progression and tumor growth in CRC (Wang2021CoiledCoil). While the study does not provide specific details on direct physical interactions with nucleic acids, it emphasizes CCDC68's functional interactions in CRC pathogenesis.
