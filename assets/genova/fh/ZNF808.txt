# ZNF808

## Overview
ZNF808 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 808, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) family, which is primarily involved in transcriptional repression. This protein plays a significant role in human pancreatic development by acting as an epigenetic silencer of transposable elements, particularly the MER11 family, which is enriched in transcription factor binding sites crucial for early embryonic development. The gene is primate-specific, highlighting its unique evolutionary role in human biology. ZNF808's function is critical for maintaining proper gene expression programs during pancreatic differentiation, and its dysfunction is linked to congenital conditions such as neonatal diabetes and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (De2021Primatespecific).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF808 is a primate-specific gene that plays a crucial role in human pancreatic development. It is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) family, which functions as epigenetic silencers targeting transposable elements. ZNF808 is involved in silencing MER11 transposable elements, which are enriched in transcription factor binding sites important for early embryonic development. This silencing is essential for maintaining proper gene expression programs during pancreatic differentiation (De2021Primatespecific).

In healthy human cells, ZNF808 represses transposable elements during early pancreas development, ensuring the correct specification of cell fate. The loss of ZNF808 function leads to aberrant activation of these elements, resulting in inappropriate cell fate specification, induction of liver endoderm genes, and loss of pancreatic identity. This dysregulation is associated with neonatal diabetes and exocrine insufficiency in patients with biallelic loss of function mutations in ZNF808 (De2021Primatespecific).

ZNF808 is expressed in the embryonic pancreas and is involved in the regulation of chromatin accessibility, which is crucial for the specification of cell fate during development. The gene and its targets, such as MER11 elements, are primate-specific, highlighting its unique role in human development (De2021Primatespecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZNF808 gene are associated with pancreatic agenesis, a congenital condition characterized by neonatal diabetes and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. This condition arises due to the homozygous loss of function variants in ZNF808, which disrupts its role as an epigenetic silencer of transposable elements. The loss of ZNF808 leads to the aberrant activation of these elements, resulting in improper cell fate specification during early pancreatic development (De2021Primatespecific). 

Inactivation of ZNF808 causes dysregulation of genes that define pancreatic and liver identity, leading to a diversion of cell fate from pancreatic to liver lineages. This mechanism is proposed to cause neonatal diabetes and exocrine insufficiency in patients with biallelic loss of function mutations in ZNF808 (De2021Primatespecific). 

A study in a consanguineous population in Kurdistan, Iraq, identified a bi-allelic variant in ZNF808 in a participant with neonatal diabetes, who also experienced prolonged jaundice, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and failure to thrive (Amaratunga2023Paediatric). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZNF808 mutations in congenital pancreatic diseases and their potential impact on neonatal health.

## Interactions
ZNF808 is a zinc finger protein that is part of the KRAB-ZFP family, which is known for its role in transcriptional repression through interactions with transposable elements (TEs). ZNF808 has been identified as one of the KRAB-ZFPs that target the MER11 family of TEs. This interaction is part of an evolutionary arms race, where the MER11 family has evolved mechanisms to evade suppression by ZNF808 and other KRAB-ZFPs. The binding of ZNF808 to its target sites on MER11 has diminished over time due to mutations or insertions and deletions at these binding sites, illustrating a co-evolutionary relationship between ZNF808 and the MER11 subfamilies (Hamada2024Landscape).

In addition to its interactions with TEs, ZNF808 is associated with TRIM28, a key epigenetic modifier. TRIM28 interacts with various KRAB-ZNFs, including ZNF808, in its wild-type form. However, specific interactions between ZNF808 and other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available studies (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). The interaction with TRIM28 suggests a role for ZNF808 in the regulation of gene expression, potentially through the formation of multiprotein complexes that influence transcriptional activity.
