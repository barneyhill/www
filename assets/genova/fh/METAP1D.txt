# METAP1D

## Overview
The METAP1D gene encodes the mitochondrial methionyl aminopeptidase type 1D, a metal-activated protease that plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of proteins by cleaving the N-terminal methionine from nascent polypeptides. This enzymatic activity is crucial for protein maturation, stability, and function, particularly within the mitochondria, where it influences cellular metabolism and energy production (Hu2007Kinetic; Leszczyniecka2006MAP1D). The METAP1D protein is characterized by a distinct pita-bread fold and a binuclear Co2+ center at its active site, which is essential for its catalytic function (Lee2023Structural). Alterations in METAP1D expression and mutations have been linked to various clinical conditions, including colon cancer and hereditary optic neuropathies, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states (Leszczyniecka2006MAP1D; Cheng2022Candidate).

## Structure
The human mitochondrial methionine aminopeptidase, METAP1D, exhibits a distinct molecular structure characterized by several key features. The primary structure of METAP1D includes a mitochondrial targeting signal at its N-terminal domain, which is crucial for its localization within the mitochondria (Lee2023Structural). The protein adopts a characteristic pita-bread fold, a common feature among methionine aminopeptidases, with long α-helices surrounding the exterior and aligned β-sheets forming the inner pocket structure (Lee2023Structural).

The tertiary structure of METAP1D is defined by a well-organized metal-binding active site, featuring a binuclear Co2+ center. This site involves metal-bridging water molecules and metal-binding ligand residues, including Asp178, Asp189, His252, Glu284, and Glu315 (Lee2023Structural). The protein's electrostatic surface is predominantly negatively charged, attributed to abundant acidic residues, which likely facilitates the attraction of positively charged N-terminal signaling sequences of mitochondrial substrate proteins (Lee2023Structural).

Distinctive structural features include the α1-α2 and β6-β7 loops, which form the entrance path to the active site and contribute to substrate specificity (Lee2023Structural). These structural insights highlight METAP1D's unique functional properties and its potential role in substrate selectivity and inhibitor design (Lee2023Structural).

## Function
METAP1D encodes a mitochondrial methionine aminopeptidase that plays a crucial role in the removal of the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins, a process essential for proper protein maturation and function (Hu2007Kinetic). This enzymatic activity is important for subsequent post-translational modifications, protein stability, and degradation, impacting cellular metabolism and energy production within the mitochondria (Leszczyniecka2006MAP1D).

The METAP1D protein is a metal-activated protease, with Co2+ ions being the most effective activators of its enzymatic activity. At least two Co2+ ions are required for maximal activation, indicating a specific metal ion requirement for its function (Hu2007Kinetic). The enzyme's activity is optimal at a pH range of 7.5 to 8.0, and it is less efficient compared to other methionine aminopeptidases, which may be due to missing residues important for catalysis (Hu2007Kinetic).

In healthy human cells, METAP1D's function in the mitochondria is likely to be involved in minimizing inappropriate hydrolytic events, ensuring that proteins are correctly processed for their roles in cellular processes (Hu2007Kinetic). This function is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient energy production.

## Clinical Significance
The METAP1D gene, encoding methionyl aminopeptidase type 1D, is implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression and mutations. Overexpression of METAP1D is notably associated with colon cancer, where it contributes to tumorigenesis by enhancing the tumorigenic potential of colorectal cancer cells. Suppression of METAP1D expression has been shown to reduce the growth ability of these cancer cells, suggesting its role as a potential target for chemotherapy in colon carcinoma (Leszczyniecka2006MAP1D; Quirós2015New; Chang2023Impact).

In addition to its role in cancer, METAP1D has been linked to Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), a major hereditary optic neuropathy. A mutation in the METAP1D gene has been identified as a candidate involved in the penetrance of LHON, indicating its potential role in this condition (Cheng2022Candidate). Furthermore, METAP1D mutations have been associated with spinocerebellar ataxia, highlighting its involvement in neurological disorders (Cheng2022Candidate). These findings underscore the clinical significance of METAP1D in both cancer and hereditary diseases, warranting further research into its molecular mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target.
