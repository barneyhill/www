# EMP1

## Overview
Epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, particularly within epithelial cells. The EMP1 protein is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role in cell-to-cell interactions and maintaining epithelial cell integrity (Zhang2022Unraveling; Ahmat2019The). It is expressed in the development of the central and peripheral nervous systems, indicating its involvement in neurogenesis and the regulation of the cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Zhang2022Unraveling; Ahmat2019The). EMP1 also plays a significant role in the blood-brain barrier as a tight junction protein, contributing to its selective permeability (Ahmat2019The). The protein is implicated in various signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and its expression is inversely regulated by PMP22, highlighting its importance in cellular growth dynamics (Miao2019Epithelial; Ahmat2019The). EMP1's involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target underscore its clinical significance (Singh2021Prognostic; Ahmat2019The).

## Structure
The epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is a hydrophobic glycoprotein characterized by four transmembrane domains, which contribute to its secondary structure (Zhang2022Unraveling; Ahmat2019The). The protein consists of approximately 160 amino acid residues and includes two extracellular domains and small intracellular regions (Ahmat2019The). EMP1 shares a 40% sequence homology with PMP22, another member of the same protein family, indicating a conserved structure among these proteins (Zhang2022Unraveling).

EMP1 undergoes several post-translational modifications, which are crucial for its function. It contains two N-glycosylation sites at positions N43 and N46, and several phosphorylation sites, including T33, S52, Y55, S57, T126, S131, and S133 (Zhang2022Unraveling). These modifications can influence the protein's spatial conformation and activity, impacting cellular processes such as signal transduction and cancer pathways (Zhang2022Unraveling).

The protein lacks protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, which are present in other family members like EMP2 and EMP3, but it does contain casein kinase-2 phosphorylation sites (Ahmat2019The). EMP1 is also involved in interactions with other proteins, such as copine-III, which is essential for its role in promoting cell migration and metastasis (Ahmat2018Epithelial).

## Function
Epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in various cellular processes, primarily in epithelial cells. It is characterized by four transmembrane domains, two extracellular domains, and small intracellular regions, which facilitate its role in cell-to-cell interactions and maintaining epithelial cell integrity (Zhang2022Unraveling; Ahmat2019The). EMP1 is expressed during the development of the central and peripheral nervous systems, indicating its involvement in neurogenesis (Ahmat2019The). It plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle, cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death, particularly in epithelial cells (Zhang2022Unraveling).

EMP1 is also a component of the blood-brain barrier, acting as a novel tight junction protein, which suggests its importance in maintaining the selective permeability of this barrier (Ahmat2019The). The protein is involved in signal transduction pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which influences cellular responses and tissue homeostasis (Miao2019Epithelial). EMP1's expression is inversely regulated by PMP22 in fibroblasts and Schwann cells, highlighting its role in cellular growth dynamics (Ahmat2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EMP1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and treatment resistance. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), EMP1 mRNA levels are upregulated, contributing to metastasis and poor clinical outcomes. Silencing EMP1 in GBM cells inhibits proliferation and invasiveness (Ahmat2019The). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EMP1 overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation and tumor progression, as well as resistance to the drug gefitinib (Ahmat2019The; Lai2012EMP1). 

In pediatric B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), high EMP1 expression is associated with poor event-free survival and resistance to prednisolone, a glucocorticoid used in treatment (Singh2021Prognostic). EMP1 is also implicated in ovarian cancer, where its overexpression promotes proliferation and invasion through the MAPK pathway (Liu2020&lt; p&gt; EMP1). 

Conversely, in some cancers like nasopharyngeal and esophageal cancers, EMP1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with higher expression linked to better survival rates and reduced cancer cell proliferation (Ahmat2019The). These findings suggest that EMP1's role in cancer is complex and context-dependent, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
EMP1 (epithelial membrane protein 1) is involved in various interactions with other proteins that influence cancer progression and cellular processes. In prostate cancer, EMP1 enhances cancer cell migration and invasion through the activation of the small GTPase Rac1, which is part of a signaling cascade involving tyrosine kinase Src, Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2, and Rac1 itself (Ahmat2019The). This interaction is facilitated by the direct binding of copine-III to the intracellular region of EMP1, which is crucial for cancer invasion (Ahmat2019The).

In gastric cancer, EMP1 overexpression leads to increased apoptosis and decreased cell migration and invasion, potentially through interactions with caspase-9 and VEGFC, which are involved in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and tumor angiogenesis, respectively (SUN2014Association). EMP1 also interacts with integrins, such as integrin beta 7 (ITGB7) and integrin beta 8 (ITGB8), which are involved in cell adhesion and communication, suggesting a role in regulating these processes (Wang2003Analysis). These interactions highlight EMP1's involvement in cell signaling, adhesion, and communication, contributing to its role in cancer progression.
