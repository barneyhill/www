# STRN

## Overview
The STRN gene encodes the protein striatin, which is a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes. Striatin is a key component of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, which plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, including the PI3K/AKT and Hippo pathways, influencing cell growth, homeostasis, and inflammatory responses (Li2023Cellular; Nader2019The). The protein is characterized by several domains, such as a coiled-coil domain, a caveolin-binding domain, a calmodulin-binding domain, and a WD-repeat domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins like protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and calmodulin (Gordon2011Protein; Hwang2014STRIPAK). Striatin's activity is regulated by calcium-dependent signals, underscoring its involvement in calcium signaling pathways and its critical role in maintaining cellular integrity and function, particularly in cardiac tissues (Nader2019The).

## Structure
The STRN (striatin) protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function and interactions. It contains a coiled-coil domain, a caveolin-binding domain, a calmodulin-binding domain, and a WD-repeat domain. The coiled-coil domain, predicted to extend from residues 61-121, is crucial for oligomerization and binding with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Gordon2011Protein; Hwang2014STRIPAK). This domain also partially contributes to Mob3 binding (Gordon2011Protein). The caveolin-binding domain, located at residues 53-63, is essential for oligomerization and PP2A binding (Gordon2011Protein). The calmodulin-binding domain, spanning residues 148-166, plays a minor role in PP2A binding and does not significantly affect Mob3 binding or oligomerization (Moreno2000WD40; Gordon2011Protein).

The WD-repeat domain is important for protein interactions, including binding with Mob3 and other proteins like the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein (Hwang2014STRIPAK). Striatin forms complexes with other proteins, indicating a quaternary structure, and is involved in various cellular signaling pathways (Hwang2014STRIPAK). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate its activity (Hwang2014STRIPAK).

## Function
The STRN gene encodes striatin, a core component of the STRIPAK complex, which is involved in various cellular processes. Striatin functions as a scaffolding protein, facilitating interactions within the STRIPAK complex, which includes components like protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and germinal center kinases (GCKs) (Kück2019STRIPAK; Nader2019The). This complex plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT and Hippo pathways, impacting cell growth, homeostasis, and inflammatory responses (Li2023Cellular).

Striatin is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle progression, and vesicular trafficking (Kück2019STRIPAK; Hwang2014STRIPAK). It interacts with proteins like Caveolin-1, Calmodulin, and PP2A, which are regulators of β-adrenergic receptors and calcium channels, essential for cardiomyocyte contraction and excitation-contraction coupling in the heart (Nader2019The). Striatin's role in these processes is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and function, contributing to organismal outcomes such as cardiac function and blood pressure regulation (Kück2019STRIPAK; Nader2019The). The protein's activity is regulated by calcium-dependent signals, highlighting its involvement in calcium signaling pathways (Nader2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STRN gene, particularly an eight base pair deletion in the 3' untranslated region (UTR), have been associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) in Boxer dogs. This deletion is linked to more severe disease manifestations in dogs homozygous for the mutation, as it affects the mRNA's secondary structure, potentially leading to reduced expression of striatin. Striatin is a scaffolding protein that localizes to the cardiac intercalated disc, where it interacts with desmosomal proteins implicated in ARVC (Meurs2010Genomewide). 

While the STRN mutation was initially thought to be a marker for ARVC, further studies indicated that it is not the direct cause of the disease. The mutation is present in both affected and unaffected dogs, suggesting that it may be linked to another gene responsible for ARVC located nearby on the same chromosome. This implies that the STRN mutation might interact with other genetic factors to influence the development and severity of ARVC (Cattanach2015A). The mutation's presence in unaffected dogs and absence in some affected dogs suggests genetic heterogeneity or phenocopies (Cattanach2015A).

## Interactions
Striatin (STRN) is a scaffolding protein that participates in various protein interactions, forming complexes that are crucial for cellular signaling and function. It interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner, which is essential for its role in cardiomyocyte contraction regulation (Nader2017Cardiac). STRN is also part of the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex, which includes protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), MOB3, and CCM3. The coiled-coil domain of STRN is critical for binding with PP2A, and specific residues within this domain are essential for the interaction (Gordon2011Protein).

STRN interacts with caveolin-3 (Cav-3) and modulates the stability of the Cav-3/CaM complex, affecting cardiomyocyte contraction rates (Nader2017Cardiac). It also forms a complex with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein and tight junction proteins, such as occludin, through its WD-repeat domain (Lahav‐Ariel2018Striatin; Hwang2014STRIPAK). The interaction with APC is mediated through the armadillo repeat domain of APC, and mutations in this region can disrupt the interaction (Lahav‐Ariel2018Striatin).

STRN's interactions are crucial for its role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and the regulation of kinase activity (Gordon2011Protein).
