# ACBD3

## Overview
The ACBD3 gene encodes the acyl-CoA binding domain containing 3 protein, a multifunctional protein primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus. This protein is characterized by its acyl-CoA binding domain, which is involved in lipid metabolism, and a GOLD domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions and Golgi localization (Fan2010Acylcoenzyme; Islinger2020The). ACBD3 functions as a scaffolding protein, playing a critical role in maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating membrane trafficking. It is involved in various cellular processes, including steroidogenesis and cholesterol metabolism, and interacts with several proteins, such as PI4KB, to regulate these functions (Yue2019AcylCoABinding). Additionally, ACBD3 is implicated in viral replication, cancer progression, and metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathology (Huang2018Overexpressed; Yue2019AcylCoABinding).

## Structure
ACBD3 is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function and localization. It contains an acyl-CoA binding domain (ACBD) at the N-terminal end, which is involved in lipid metabolism, although its exact function remains elusive (Fan2010Acylcoenzyme; Islinger2020The). The protein also features a GOLD domain at the C-terminus, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions and Golgi localization (Fan2010Acylcoenzyme; Islinger2020The). This domain is involved in forming protein scaffolds at the Golgi and can self-interact to form high molecular weight oligomers (Islinger2020The).

ACBD3 includes a glutamine-rich coiled coil region (Q-domain) that facilitates interactions with proteins like PI4KB, enhancing its catalytic activity (Klima2016Structural; Islinger2020The). The Q domain forms a two-helix hairpin structure, which interacts with the kinase helix of PI4KB through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Klima2016Structural). ACBD3 also contains nuclear localization signals (NLS) and predicted DNA binding sites, although nuclear localization has not been observed (Fan2010Acylcoenzyme).

The protein is expressed in various tissues and may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could regulate its activity (Fan2010Acylcoenzyme). Multiple splice variants of ACBD3 exist, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions.

## Function
The ACBD3 gene encodes a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. ACBD3 is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it acts as a scaffolding protein, maintaining Golgi structure and facilitating membrane trafficking. It interacts with proteins such as PI4KB, Golgin45, and PKA, forming complexes that are crucial for the organization of membrane micro-domains and transport carrier formation at the Golgi (Yue2019AcylCoABinding). ACBD3 is also involved in the trafficking and retention of the KDEL receptor (KDELR) at the Golgi, regulating its interaction with protein kinase A (PKA) to maintain Golgi localization (Yue2021ACBD3).

In addition to its role in the Golgi, ACBD3 is implicated in steroidogenesis by facilitating cholesterol transport into mitochondria, which is essential for steroid biosynthesis (Yue2019AcylCoABinding). It also negatively regulates de novo cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting SREBP1, a key factor in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis (Yue2019AcylCoABinding). ACBD3's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic functions.

## Clinical Significance
The ACBD3 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes and interactions. In cancer, ACBD3 is overexpressed in several types, including breast cancer, where it promotes self-renewal and tumorigenesis through the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, correlating with poor prognosis (Huang2018Overexpressed). It is also upregulated in multiple other cancers, such as stomach adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, and is associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, sarcoma, and glioma (Ma2023Identification). ACBD3 mutations, particularly missense mutations, are common in tumor cells and are linked to cancer progression (Ma2023Identification).

In viral infections, ACBD3 interacts with nonstructural proteins of viruses like Aichi virus and picornaviruses, affecting their replication in host cells (Yue2019AcylCoABinding). It also plays a role in bacterial replication, particularly with Salmonella typhimurium (Yue2019AcylCoABinding).

In metabolic diseases, ACBD3 is involved in insulin signaling, potentially influencing insulin resistance and diabetes (Yue2019AcylCoABinding). In neurodegenerative diseases, it is linked to Huntington's disease through interactions with mutant huntingtin protein, contributing to cytotoxicity (Yue2019AcylCoABinding). ACBD3's role in regulating Numb signaling during asymmetric cell division is crucial for stem cell differentiation and may contribute to tumorigenesis (Yue2019AcylCoABinding).

## Interactions
ACBD3 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in viral replication and cellular processes. It binds to phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KB), a crucial interaction for the recruitment of PI4KB to viral RNA replication sites. This interaction is essential for the replication of several viruses, including Aichi virus (AiV) and enteroviruses, and is mediated through the central region of ACBD3 (Xiao2017Enterovirus; Sasaki2011ACBD3mediated; Lyoo2019ACBD3).

ACBD3 also interacts with viral proteins such as the 3A protein from picornaviruses, including enteroviruses and kobuviruses. This interaction occurs through the C-terminal Golgi dynamics (GOLD) domain of ACBD3 and is crucial for the recruitment of PI4KB to replication organelles (Greninger2013ACBD3; Lyoo2019ACBD3).

In addition to viral interactions, ACBD3 binds to TBC1D22A/B, a Rab GTPase-activating protein, through a mutually exclusive interaction with PI4KB. This suggests a regulatory mechanism for PI4KB recruitment (Greninger2013ACBD3). ACBD3 also interacts with the protein phosphatase PPM1L, recruiting it to the Golgi apparatus, which affects the subcellular distribution of both proteins (Shinoda2012Acyl‐CoA).
