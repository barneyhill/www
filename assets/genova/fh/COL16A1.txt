# COL16A1

## Overview
The COL16A1 gene encodes the collagen type XVI alpha 1 chain, a member of the fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT) family. This gene is responsible for producing a protein that plays a significant role in the structural integrity and stability of the extracellular matrix. Collagen type XVI is characterized by its unique structure, which includes both collagenous and non-collagenous domains, contributing to its high thermal stability and interaction capabilities. It is predominantly expressed in connective tissues, such as skin, where it is involved in maintaining the dermal-epidermal junction and potentially participating in immunological processes. The protein interacts with various extracellular matrix components, including fibrillin and fibronectin, and co-localizes with integrins, suggesting a role in cell adhesion and tissue morphogenesis. Alterations in COL16A1 expression and mutations have been linked to several pathological conditions, including aortic dissection, colon cancer, and gastric cancer, as well as age-related changes in tissue structure (Li2016Variants; Onursal2021Collagen; Grässel2012COL16A1).

## Structure
The COL16A1 gene encodes collagen type XVI, a homotrimeric molecule with each α1 chain weighing approximately 210 kDa. The protein consists of 10 collagenous domains (COL1-COL10) and 11 non-collagenous domains (NC1-NC11), with the NC11 domain featuring a 200-residue proline-arginine-rich protein (PARP) motif (Grässel2012COL16A1). The recombinant version of collagen type XVI is 1597 amino acids long, while the authentic version includes 1604 amino acids with a 21 amino acid signal peptide (Grässel2012COL16A1).

Collagen type XVI is part of the FACIT family, characterized by interrupted triple helices and non-collagenous regions. It exhibits high thermal stability due to 32 cysteine residues forming disulfide bonds, primarily in the non-collagenous domains (Grässel2012COL16A1). The molecule includes two potential N-glycosylation sites in the NC11 region, which are glycosylated, and a third site in the NC1 domain, though no glycosaminoglycan chain attachment has been observed there (Grässel2012COL16A1).

The protein's structure includes conserved features shared with other FACIT collagens, such as two highly conserved cysteine residues at the NC1 junctions and G-X-Y triplet imperfections within the COL2 domain (Grässel2012COL16A1). These structural elements contribute to its role in tissue morphogenesis and extracellular matrix stability (Grässel2012COL16A1).

## Function
COL16A1 encodes the collagen type XVI alpha 1 chain, a member of the FACIT family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. In healthy human cells, type XVI collagen is expressed in various connective tissues, including the skin, where it is found in the papillary dermis and localizes to the dermal-epidermal junction. It is produced by fibroblasts and keratinocytes, contributing to the structural integrity of the dermal-epidermal junction and potentially playing a role in dermal immunological processes (Theocharidis2017Minor).

Type XVI collagen forms homotrimeric triple helices and is considered a minor collagen component with a versatile role in different tissue-specific collagen suprastructures. It is likely present in both the basement membrane and the interstitial matrix, as suggested by its expression in fibroblast subtypes and a broad range of epithelial cells (Onursal2021Collagen). In the context of aging, COL16A1 expression increases with age in human skin, and its role in the aging process has been linked to cell growth arrest in dermal fibroblasts (Onursal2021Collagen). However, the specific molecular function of COL16A1 in healthy human cells remains underexplored, necessitating further studies to elucidate its role (Onursal2021Collagen).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the COL16A1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of aortic dissection (AD), the COL16A1 gene has been identified with novel frameshift and splice-site variants, suggesting its potential role in increasing the risk of AD. These mutations were found to be absent in control subjects, indicating a possible pathogenic link (Li2016Variants).

In colon cancer, significant differences in the mutation frequency of COL16A1 have been observed between adult and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients. These mutations are primarily nonsynonymous missense, stop-gain, or frameshift mutations, which are considered damaging and may contribute to the pathogenesis of colon cancer (Tricoli2017A).

In gastric cancer, COL16A1 mutations are associated with distinct tumor environments and overall survival outcomes. The presence of these mutations, particularly truncation mutations, has been linked to longer overall survival, suggesting a complex role in tumor progression and patient prognosis (Brodsky2022Somatic).

Additionally, COL16A1 expression is upregulated in the context of lung aging, where it may contribute to tumorigenesis and tumor invasion, highlighting its potential role in age-related diseases and cancer (Onursal2021Collagen).

## Interactions
Collagen type XVI, encoded by the COL16A1 gene, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in the extracellular matrix. It interacts with fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, with the N-terminal half of these proteins binding to collagen type XVI at low salt concentrations, while the C-terminal half shows lower interaction affinity (Grässel2012COL16A1). Fibronectin also binds strongly to collagen type XVI at physiological salt concentrations, indicating a high affinity interaction (Grässel2012COL16A1).

Collagen type XVI is known to co-localize with integrins, specifically α2 integrin at the dermal-epidermal junction and α1 integrin around fat cells in subdermal layers. This co-localization suggests a role in integrin recruitment and cell adhesion, as cells with integrins α1β1 and α2β1 can attach and spread on recombinant collagen type XVI (Grässel2012COL16A1). The interaction with α1β1 integrin is particularly notable, as it occurs via the A-domain of the α-subunits of the integrins, with a tryptic fragment of collagen type XVI being recognized by α1β1 integrin (Grässel2012COL16A1). These interactions highlight the importance of collagen type XVI in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of the extracellular matrix.
