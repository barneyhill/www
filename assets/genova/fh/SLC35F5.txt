# SLC35F5

## Overview
SLC35F5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member F5, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family. This family is known for its role in transporting a variety of molecules across cellular membranes. The SLC35F5 protein is implicated in the transport of specific substrates, although its precise physiological substrates and functions remain to be fully elucidated. Notably, SLC35F5 has been identified as interacting with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), specifically binding to the stem-loop 1 (SL1) RNA structure, which is crucial for the virus's life cycle (Fan2014A). The expression of SLC35F5 has been observed in various tissues, indicating a potentially broad functional role (Joseph2015Expression; Patel2013Identification). Further research is needed to fully understand the biological and clinical significance of SLC35F5 and its encoded protein.

## Interactions
SLC35F5 has been identified as a protein that interacts with the stem-loop 1 (SL1) RNA structure of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). This interaction is significant as SL1 is crucial in the early stages of HCV infection. The study that identified this interaction used human proteome microarrays and found that SLC35F5 is transactivated by the HCV NS5A protein, suggesting a role in the viral life cycle (Fan2014A).

While specific details on the interactions of SLC35F5 with other proteins or nucleic acids are limited, it is part of the solute carrier family, which typically involves proteins that transport molecules across cellular membranes. These proteins often participate in multiprotein complexes and can interact with other proteins to facilitate transport or regulatory functions. However, the context does not provide further specific interactions involving SLC35F5 beyond its association with HCV components (Fan2014A). 

In other studies, SLC35F5 has been noted for its expression patterns in various tissues, but these do not elaborate on direct physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids (Joseph2015Expression; Patel2013Identification).
