# SPECC1

## Overview
The SPECC1 gene encodes the protein known as sperm antigen with calponin homology and coiled-coil domains 1, which is integral to cellular structural organization and stability. This protein is primarily involved in the stabilization of microtubules, spindle shaping, and actin reorganization during cell movement, playing a critical role in cell adhesion and migration (Liu2024SPECC1). Predominantly expressed in the testis and cancer cells, SPECC1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with microtubules and other cytoskeletal components, contributing to intracellular transport and cellular integrity (Liu2024SPECC1). The protein's involvement in pathways such as integrin, PI3K-Akt, and Wnt underscores its significance in cellular and immune functions (Liu2024SPECC1). Mutations in the SPECC1 gene are associated with various developmental disorders, particularly affecting craniofacial structures, highlighting its clinical importance (Bhoj2019Phenotypic).

## Structure


## Function
The SPECC1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in cellular structural organization and stability. It is primarily involved in stabilizing microtubules, shaping the spindle, and reorganizing actin during cell movement, which are essential processes for cell adhesion and migration (Liu2024SPECC1). SPECC1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with microtubules and other cytoskeletal components, contributing to intracellular transport and maintaining cellular integrity (Liu2024SPECC1).

The protein is expressed predominantly in the testis and cancer cells, with its highest RNA expression observed in the testis and brain (Liu2024SPECC1). Immunofluorescence analysis shows SPECC1's co-localization with microtubules in the cytoplasm and its presence in the nucleus, indicating its involvement in cytoskeletal organization (Liu2024SPECC1). SPECC1 also influences integrin, PI3K-Akt, and Wnt pathways, highlighting its significance in cellular and immune functions (Liu2024SPECC1).

The protein's subcellular distribution includes the nucleoplasm, vesicles, nucleoli, and cytosol, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes (Liu2024SPECC1). These functions underscore SPECC1's potential role in cancer progression and its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SPECC1L gene are associated with a range of developmental disorders, particularly affecting craniofacial structures. Pathogenic variants of SPECC1L have been linked to conditions such as Teebi hypertelorism syndrome, Opitz GBBB syndrome, and other developmental anomalies. These conditions often present with dysmorphic facial features, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and other developmental issues (Bhoj2019Phenotypic). Heterozygous loss of function of SPECC1L can cause Tessier IV oblique facial cleft, while missense variants are associated with syndromes like Opitz GBBB and Teebi hypertelorism (Bhoj2019Phenotypic).

SPECC1L mutations are also implicated in orofacial clefts, including both syndromic and non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P). These mutations often cluster in the second coiled-coil and calponin homology domains, affecting the gene's ability to associate with microtubules, which is crucial for normal craniofacial development (Hall2020SPECC1L). In mouse models, SPECC1L mutations result in defects such as delayed palate elevation and transient oral epithelial adhesions, highlighting its role in palate development (Hall2020SPECC1L). SPECC1L deficiency in primary mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells leads to defects in cell movement and palatal development, which can be partially rescued by activating the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway (Goering2021SPECC1Ldeficient).
