# ANPEP

## Overview
The ANPEP gene encodes the alanyl aminopeptidase, membrane (also known as CD13), a type II transmembrane protein that functions as a zinc-dependent metalloprotease. This protein is involved in the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, specifically removing amino acids from the amino termini of proteins and peptides, and plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including nutrient absorption, immune response, and cellular proliferation. ANPEP is expressed in multiple tissues such as the kidney, small intestine, placenta, and liver, and is implicated in several biological processes, including angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion. Additionally, ANPEP serves as a receptor for certain viruses and is involved in glutathione metabolism, contributing to cellular defense against oxidative stress. Its clinical significance is underscored by its association with diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and various cancers, where alterations in its expression or function can impact disease progression and patient prognosis (Liu2020ACO2; Shui2019Aminopeptidase; Korvyakova2024The).

## Structure
The ANPEP gene encodes the hAPN protein, also known as CD13 or membrane alanyl aminopeptidase, which is a Zn-dependent metalloprotease with a molecular weight of 150 kDa and consists of 967 amino acids (Kim2020SARSCoV2). It is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a short cytoplasmic domain at the N-terminal region and a long extracellular region at the C-terminal domain (CTD) (Kim2020SARSCoV2). The CTD contains a pentapeptide sequence specific for Zinc-MMPs, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Kim2020SARSCoV2). 

ANPEP is part of the M1 aminopeptidase family, which shares conserved protein motifs, including the HEXXHX18E motif for zinc binding and a G/AMEN motif for substrate binding (Maynard2014Evolutionary). The protein's structure is stabilized by interactions such as disulfide bonds, and it may form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure. Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, which affects its stability and function. ANPEP's role in various cellular processes is linked to its structural features, which facilitate its function as a receptor for several viruses and its involvement in peptide digestion and immune functions (Korvyakova2024The).

## Function
Aminopeptidase N (ANPEP), also known as alanyl aminopeptidase or CD13, is a membrane-bound zinc-dependent peptidase involved in the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, specifically removing amino acids from the amino termini of proteins and peptides. It is part of the M1 family of the MA clan of peptidases and is expressed in various human tissues, including the kidney, small intestine, placenta, and liver (Shui2019Aminopeptidase; Korvyakova2024The). ANPEP plays a crucial role in the final digestion of peptides generated by gastric and pancreatic proteases, contributing to nutrient absorption (Korvyakova2024The).

In addition to its digestive functions, ANPEP is involved in multiple biological processes such as angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion, immune responses, and the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis (Shui2019Aminopeptidase; Korvyakova2024The). It also plays a role in glutathione metabolism by hydrolyzing dipeptides like cysteinyl-glycine, which are essential for the biosynthesis of glutathione, a critical antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative damage (Korvyakova2024The). ANPEP's enzymatic activity is vital for maintaining redox homeostasis and supporting cellular defense against oxidative stress (Korvyakova2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ANPEP gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), ANPEP has been identified as a susceptibility gene. Polymorphisms in ANPEP, such as rs11073891 and rs4932143, are associated with increased risk of T2D and are linked to various biochemical parameters, including fasting blood glucose and cholesterol levels. These polymorphisms may disrupt glutathione metabolism and redox homeostasis, contributing to oxidative stress and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in T2D patients (Korvyakova2024The).

ANPEP is also involved in cancer progression. In gallbladder squamous cell/adenosquamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas, low levels of ANPEP are correlated with larger tumors, higher tumor-node-metastasis staging, and decreased overall survival. This suggests that ANPEP expression levels could serve as a prognostic biomarker in these cancers (Liu2020ACO2).

In the context of viral infections, ANPEP has been studied for its potential role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although recent research did not find a direct role for ANPEP in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, its expression is genetically regulated in lung tissue, which may influence individual susceptibility to viral infections (Cotroneo2021Lung).

## Interactions
ANPEP, also known as alanyl aminopeptidase, membrane, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are significant for its functional roles in cellular processes. In the context of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ANPEP interacts with proteins such as FN1, CALR, PDGFRB, CD68, CD63, NRP1, SDC1, and SERPINA1, which are implicated in the progression of GBM (Chen2022Comprehensive). These interactions suggest a role for ANPEP in cellular immunity and tumor progression.

In cattle, ANPEP is associated with a network of protein-protein interactions involving ten proteins, including GCLM, GGT6, LAP3, FOLH1, SFN, and GGT7. These interactions are crucial for understanding the functional role of ANPEP in bovine physiology and health (Patel2024Indepth).

ANPEP is also noted for its upregulation in Myc-induced prostate cancer cells, where it is associated with proteins involved in cancer growth and metastasis, such as fibronectin-1 (FN1) and other markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Kirkemo2022Cellsurface). These interactions highlight ANPEP's involvement in cancer-related pathways and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
