# OR8H2

## Overview
The OR8H2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily H member 2, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction. OR8H2 is specifically involved in the detection of the odorant 1-octen-3-ol, a compound associated with fungal contamination, highlighting its potential application in biosensor technologies (Ahn2015Screening). The protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a critical role in the olfactory system by converting chemical signals into neuronal responses that are perceived as smell (Ahn2015Screening). While the gene's clinical significance is not fully understood, it has been implicated in cancer studies, suggesting a potential role in the epigenetic landscape of certain cancers (Goldmann2021DNA). Further research is needed to elucidate the full range of functions and clinical implications of OR8H2.

## Structure
The OR8H2 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs, where the primary structure consists of amino acid sequences that form alpha-helices in the secondary structure. These helices fold into a functional receptor in the tertiary structure, allowing the receptor to interact with specific odorants like 1-octen-3-ol (Ahn2015Screening). 

While specific details on the molecular structure of OR8H2, such as its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, are not provided in the available context, it is known that GPCRs, including olfactory receptors, often undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation. These modifications are crucial for the proper functioning and stability of the receptor (cvicek2015structure). 

The OR8H2 receptor's ability to specifically interact with 1-octen-3-ol highlights its potential application in detecting fungal contamination in grain, as this compound is a marker for such contamination (Ahn2015Screening). However, detailed structural information specific to OR8H2 remains limited in the current literature.

## Function
OR8H2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are integral to the human olfactory system, where they play a crucial role in detecting odorant molecules. OR8H2 is specifically involved in the recognition and binding of the odorant 1-octen-3-ol, a compound associated with fungal contamination (Ahn2015Screening). Upon binding to 1-octen-3-ol, OR8H2 initiates a signal transduction pathway that involves the activation of G-proteins and subsequent ion channel activity, leading to an influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) into the olfactory neurons. This influx results in changes in electrical conductance, which are interpreted by the brain as specific smells (Ahn2015Screening).

The receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it is localized on the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons. This localization is essential for its function in detecting airborne odorants and converting these chemical signals into neuronal responses that contribute to the perception of smell (Ahn2015Screening). The specificity of OR8H2 for 1-octen-3-ol highlights its potential utility in biosensor applications for detecting fungal contamination in various environments (Ahn2015Screening).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR8H2 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, is not well-documented in terms of specific diseases or conditions resulting from its mutations or expression alterations. However, some studies have explored its potential role in cancer. In lung cancer, OR8H2 is one of the olfactory receptor genes found to be hypomethylated, suggesting a possible involvement in cancer-related processes, although its specific impact remains unclear (Goldmann2021DNA). The study by Goldmann et al. highlights the potential of DNA methylation profiling in improving lung cancer diagnostics, indicating that OR8H2 might play a role in the epigenetic landscape of lung cancer (Goldmann2021DNA).

In breast cancer, OR8H2 was identified among olfactory receptor genes upregulated in miR-18b-deficient cells, suggesting an indirect regulatory mechanism possibly involving transcription factors like PDX1. However, the clinical significance of these alterations in breast cancer is not directly addressed, and further research is needed to understand their implications (FONSECASANCHÉZ2013microRNA18b). Overall, while OR8H2 is implicated in cancer studies, its precise clinical significance and the consequences of its mutations or expression changes require further investigation.

## Interactions
OR8H2, a human olfactory receptor, is involved in detecting specific odorant molecules through interactions with other proteins. It is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which typically interacts with G proteins to transduce signals. In the context of detecting fungal contamination in grain, OR8H2 specifically interacts with the odorant 1-octen-3-ol. This interaction triggers a signal transduction pathway involving G-protein and ion channels, leading to an influx of Ca2+ ions. This process was observed in a study where OR8H2 was expressed in HEK-293 cells and integrated into nanovesicles, which were then used in a biosensor system (Ahn2015Screening).

The interaction of OR8H2 with 1-octen-3-ol was confirmed through a CRE reporter gene assay, which demonstrated that OR8H2-expressing cells generated the most intensive fluorescence among a library of 100 different human ORs, indicating a specific interaction with this compound (Ahn2015Screening). The presence of OR8H2 in nanovesicles and its functionality in mediating cellular signals upon exposure to 1-octen-3-ol further supports its role in specific protein interactions related to odor detection (Ahn2015Screening).
