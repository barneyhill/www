# KATNBL1

## Overview
KATNBL1 is a gene that encodes the protein katanin regulatory subunit B1 like 1, which is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. This protein is a component of a microtubule-severing enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in modulating microtubule mass, stability, and elongation, particularly in ciliated cells. KATNBL1 interacts with the KIAA0556 protein, and this interaction is essential for its localization and function within the ciliary axoneme and at the ciliary base. The protein's expression is predominantly observed in ciliated cells, underscoring its significance in cilium-associated processes (Sanders2015KIAA0556).

## Function


## Interactions
KATNBL1 is known to interact with the KIAA0556 protein, forming part of a microtubule-severing enzyme complex that regulates microtubule mass, stability, elongation, and ciliary functions. This interaction was identified using a tandem affinity purification strategy followed by mass spectrometry, which revealed that KATNBL1, along with other katanin subunits, associates with KIAA0556 (Sanders2015KIAA0556). The interaction between KATNBL1 and the C-terminal half of KIAA0556 was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screening, indicating a direct biochemical association (Sanders2015KIAA0556).

KATNBL1 is localized at the ciliary base and along the ciliary axoneme, similar to KIAA0556. When KIAA0556 is ectopically targeted to the plasma membrane, KATNBL1 also localizes there, suggesting a strong interaction between these proteins (Sanders2015KIAA0556). KATNBL1 is expressed almost exclusively in ciliated cells, indicating its role in cilium-associated functions (Sanders2015KIAA0556). The interaction with KIAA0556 may influence microtubule binding or severing activities, potentially blocking katanin's access to microtubule binding sites (Sanders2015KIAA0556). There is no evidence of KATNBL1 interacting with nucleic acids in the provided context.
