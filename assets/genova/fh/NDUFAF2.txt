# NDUFAF2

## Overview
NDUFAF2 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex assembly factor 2, which is crucial for the assembly and function of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein acts as a chaperone, facilitating the proper folding and assembly of complex I subunits, thereby ensuring efficient electron transfer and ATP production (Schlehe2013The; Hoefs2009Baculovirus). NDUFAF2 is primarily active in the mitochondrial matrix and plays a significant role in cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. Deficiencies or mutations in NDUFAF2 can lead to complex I deficiency and are associated with various clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and ciliopathies such as Leigh syndrome and Joubert syndrome (Lo2024Primary; Abu2024Lack; Herzer2010Leigh). The protein's expression is also influenced by pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a role in cellular stress responses (Schlehe2013The).

## Function
NDUFAF2 is a mitochondrial assembly factor essential for the proper formation and function of complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) in the electron transport chain. This protein is involved in the late stages of complex I assembly, where it forms part of a subcomplex associated with several complex I subunits (Hoefs2009Baculovirus). NDUFAF2 acts as a chaperone, facilitating the proper folding of proteins within complex I, which is crucial for the enzyme's function (Schlehe2013The). Although NDUFAF2 is not required for the complete structural assembly of complex I, it plays a significant role in regulating its activity and ensuring efficient electron transfer and ATP production (Schlehe2013The).

NDUFAF2 is active in the mitochondrial matrix, where it impacts cellular energy metabolism and overall organismal energy homeostasis. Its deficiency can lead to complex I deficiency, resulting in various clinical manifestations, including neurodegenerative diseases (Abu2024Lack). The protein's expression is also regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating a potential role in responding to cellular stress (Schlehe2013The). Overall, NDUFAF2 is critical for maintaining normal mitochondrial function and energy production in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFAF2 gene are associated with several severe clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in mitochondrial complex I assembly. One of the most significant conditions linked to NDUFAF2 mutations is Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, brainstem damage, and early lethality. Patients with NDUFAF2 mutations often present with symptoms such as growth retardation, developmental delay, optic atrophy, and respiratory failure. Neuroimaging typically reveals lesions in the brainstem and other regions, consistent with Leigh syndrome (Abu2024Lack; Herzer2010Leigh).

NDUFAF2 mutations can also lead to complex I deficiency, a common mitochondrial defect affecting high energy-dependent organs like the brain and muscles. This deficiency results in a unique neuropathological pattern, including necrosis and capillary proliferation in the brainstem (Herzer2010Leigh).

Alterations in NDUFAF2 expression can impact primary cilia formation, contributing to ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome. This condition is characterized by ciliary defects and mitochondrial dysfunction, with symptoms including retinal degeneration and optic nerve atrophy. Studies have shown that NDUFAF2 interacts with the centriole protein ARMC9, and its deficiency can lead to impaired cilia formation and mitochondrial activity (Lo2024Primary).

## Interactions
NDUFAF2 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the assembly of complex I of the electron transport chain. It interacts with several proteins involved in this process. NDUFAF2 is associated with a subassembly intermediate of 830 kDa, which includes other assembly factors such as NDUFAF1, Ecsit, NDUFAF3, and NDUFAF4. This intermediate is crucial for the assembly of complex I, and NDUFAF2's role is specific to the assembly process, as it dissociates once the mature enzyme is formed (Diaz2011Mitochondrial; Mckenzie2010Assembly).

NDUFAF2 also interacts with the centriole protein ARMC9, which is important for primary cilia formation. This interaction is crucial for processes such as membrane vesicle docking, CP110 removal, and transition zone stabilization during ciliogenesis. The interaction between NDUFAF2 and ARMC9 may involve NDUFAF2 being located on the mitochondrial outer membrane or released into the cytosol to interact with ARMC9 (Lo2024Primary). The interaction is significant in the context of ciliopathies, as mutations affecting these proteins can lead to disorders such as Joubert syndrome (Lo2024Primary).
