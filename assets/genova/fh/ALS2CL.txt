# ALS2CL

## Overview
The ALS2CL gene encodes the ALS2 C-terminal like protein, which is involved in the regulation of endosomal dynamics within human cells. This protein is characterized by its structural similarity to the carboxy-terminal half of the ALS2 protein, sharing significant homology in terms of sequence and function. ALS2CL is categorized as a modulator of endosomal trafficking, primarily through its interaction with Rab5, a small GTPase. Despite its weak Rab5 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, ALS2CL exhibits strong binding to Rab5, influencing endosomal morphology and dynamics. The protein forms a dimeric structure and can interact with ALS2 to create large heteromeric complexes, which play a role in modulating ALS2-mediated endosome dynamics. The gene's potential involvement in neurological disorders, such as those associated with ALS2, has been explored, although direct links to specific diseases remain to be fully elucidated (SuzukiUtsunomiya2007ALS2CL; Hadano2004ALS2CL).

## Structure
The ALS2CL protein is encoded by the ALS2CL gene, which spans approximately 24.5 kb on human chromosome 3p21.31 and comprises 26 major exons (Hadano2004ALS2CL). The major transcript encodes a 108-kDa protein consisting of 953 amino acids (Hadano2004ALS2CL). ALS2CL includes several domains and motifs such as PH, MORN, and VPS9, which are crucial for its function (Hadano2004ALS2CL). The protein is highly homologous to the carboxy-terminal half of ALS2, sharing 33% identity and 51% similarity with the C-terminal region of human ALS2 (Hadano2004ALS2CL).

ALS2CL forms a dimeric structure in its native state, as indicated by gel filtration analysis, where it was eluted with an apparent peak molecular mass of 220 kDa, suggesting a dimeric form since no monomeric form was detected (SuzukiUtsunomiya2007ALS2CL). The interaction between ALS2CL and ALS2 results in a large heteromeric complex with a molecular mass of up to 1000 kDa (SuzukiUtsunomiya2007ALS2CL). ALS2CL exhibits strong Rab5-binding properties but has relatively weak Rab5GEF activity (SuzukiUtsunomiya2007ALS2CL; Hadano2004ALS2CL). The physiological significance of the extensive alternative splicing of ALS2CL, which results in at least 17 minor variants, remains unknown (Hadano2004ALS2CL).

## Function
The ALS2CL gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in modulating endosome dynamics in human cells. ALS2CL is highly homologous to the carboxy-terminal half of the ALS2 protein and is involved in Rab5-mediated endosomal trafficking. It exhibits strong Rab5-binding properties but has relatively weak Rab5 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity. This interaction with Rab5 influences endosomal morphology, leading to unique tubulation and elongation of endosome compartments when co-expressed with Rab5A in HeLa cells (Hadano2004ALS2CL).

ALS2CL also interacts with ALS2, forming hetero-oligomeric complexes that modulate ALS2-mediated endosome dynamics. This interaction affects the subcellular localization of ALS2, facilitating its membrane distribution and altering endosomal dynamics. In particular, ALS2CL suppresses endosome enlargement induced by a constitutively active form of ALS2, resulting in a perinuclear tubulo-membranous phenotype (SuzukiUtsunomiya2007ALS2CL).

ALS2CL is active in the cytoplasm, where it partially overlaps with early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) immunopositive vesicles, although the degree of overlap is lower compared to ALS2. This suggests that ALS2CL plays a distinct yet overlapping role with ALS2 in regulating endosomal trafficking and membrane dynamics (Hadano2004ALS2CL).

## Clinical Significance
The ALS2CL gene has been investigated for its potential role in various neurological disorders, although specific diseases directly linked to its mutations are not well-documented. Research has suggested that ALS2CL may modulate endosome dynamics through its interaction with Rab5, which could be relevant to neurological disorders similar to those associated with the ALS2 gene, such as juvenile recessive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS2), juvenile-onset primary lateral sclerosis (PLSJ), and infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic paralysis (IAHSP) (Hadano2004ALS2CL). 

In the context of schizophrenia, a study identified a nonsense mutation (E65X) in the ALS2CL gene in one patient, with a minor allele frequency of 4/475 in schizophrenia patients and 1/189 in controls. However, this variant was also found in public databases, suggesting it might not be strongly associated with schizophrenia (Jouan2013Investigation). Other rare ALS2CL variants were identified, but prediction software did not suggest they were deleterious, indicating that de novo mutations in ALS2CL are rare in schizophrenia, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of the disease (Jouan2013Investigation). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of ALS2CL mutations remains unclear, and further research is needed to elucidate their potential impact on neurological function.

## Interactions
ALS2CL interacts with ALS2 and Rab5, playing a role in modulating endosome dynamics. ALS2CL self-associates and interacts with ALS2 through specific regions, forming a large heteromeric complex. This interaction involves the central region (329-651aa) of ALS2CL and the C-terminal VPS9-containing region (1351-1657aa) of ALS2, confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (SuzukiUtsunomiya2007ALS2CL). ALS2CL forms a dimeric structure and can form a large complex with ALS2, specifically with the ALS2 fragment spanning the MORN/VPS9 region (1012-1651aa) (SuzukiUtsunomiya2007ALS2CL).

ALS2CL also interacts with Rab5, a small GTPase involved in endosome dynamics. Despite its low Rab5-GEF activity, ALS2CL binds strongly to Rab5A, interacting non-selectively with different nucleotide states of Rab5A (Hadano2004ALS2CL). In HeLa cells, ALS2CL co-localizes with Rab5A on vesicular compartments, leading to morphological changes in endosomal compartments, such as tubulation and elongation (Hadano2004ALS2CL). These interactions suggest that ALS2CL acts as a functional modulator in Rab5-mediated enzymatic reactions, influencing vesicle/membrane trafficking (Hadano2004ALS2CL).
