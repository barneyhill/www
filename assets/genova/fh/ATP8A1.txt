# ATP8A1

## Overview
ATP8A1 is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 8A1 protein, a member of the P4-ATPase family, which functions as a transmembrane flippase. This protein is integral to the maintenance of phospholipid asymmetry in cellular membranes by translocating specific phospholipids, such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, from the outer to the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer. The ATP8A1 protein's activity is ATP-dependent and involves a complex with CDC50a, which is essential for its proper function and stability (Hiraizumi2019CryoEM; Soupene2008ATP8A1). The gene's expression and the protein's function are critical in various physiological processes, including neurotransmission and red blood cell maintenance, and have been implicated in several disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and hemoglobinopathies (Kerr2016Aberrant; Soupene2008ATP8A1).

## Structure
The ATP8A1 protein is a member of the P4-ATPase family, functioning as a flippase involved in phospholipid translocation across membranes. Its structure includes a typical P-type ATPase fold with three large cytoplasmic domains: the actuator (A), nucleotide-binding (N), and phosphorylation (P) domains, along with ten transmembrane helices (M1-10) (Hiraizumi2019CryoEM). The protein forms a complex with CDC50a, which is essential for its proper expression and folding. This complex involves extensive interactions through both extracellular and intracellular regions, with CDC50a's ectodomain covering most of ATP8A1's extracellular loops (Hiraizumi2019CryoEM).

The ATP8A1 protein's transmembrane helices, particularly TM1-TM10, are crucial for its function in phospholipid transport, with specific residues forming a cavity for the phospholipid head group (Zhang2023Exploring). The protein's activity is regulated by phosphorylation, with the phosphorylation site involving interactions with the DKTG motif and a Mg2+ ion (Hiraizumi2019CryoEM). The C-terminal auto-regulatory domain, visible in the BeF3--stabilized E2P state, includes a GYAFS motif and a short helical domain, interacting with the N-domain to stabilize ATP8A1 in the E2P conformation and modulate ATPase activity (Hiraizumi2019CryoEM).

## Function
The ATP8A1 gene encodes a P-type ATPase that functions as an aminophospholipid translocase, commonly known as a flippase. This protein is crucial for maintaining the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), across the plasma membrane. In healthy human cells, ATP8A1 actively translocates PS from the outer to the inner leaflet of the membrane, a process essential for cell membrane integrity and function (levano2012atp8a1; Soupene2008ATP8A1).

ATP8A1's activity is ATP-dependent and involves the phosphorylation of a specific aspartic acid residue, which is critical for its function as a flippase (levano2012atp8a1). The protein is active in various cell types, including red blood cells and neuronal cells, where it plays a role in neurotransmission processes (levano2012atp8a1; Soupene2008ATP8A1). In red blood cells, ATP8A1 helps prevent the externalization of PS, which could otherwise signal for phagocytosis and removal by macrophages (Soupene2008ATP8A1).

In neuronal cells, ATP8A1 is involved in maintaining synaptic structure and function, with its deficiency linked to delayed hippocampus-dependent learning and altered synaptic activity (levano2012atp8a1; Kerr2016Aberrant). The protein's role in maintaining lipid asymmetry is also crucial for various cellular processes, including vesicle formation and cell signaling (Zhang2023Exploring).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ATP8A1 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Elevated levels of ATP8A1 in the hippocampus and temporal cortex have been observed in post-mortem analyses of individuals with autism, suggesting a potential role in the disorder's pathogenesis (Kerr2016Aberrant). In mouse models, overexpression of ATP8A1 leads to autistic-like behaviors, such as reduced social interaction and altered synaptic connectivity, indicating that ATP8A1 may contribute to the behavioral anomalies associated with ASD (Kerr2016Aberrant).

The ATP8A1 gene is also implicated in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in cell membranes, and its dysfunction can lead to exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. This exposure is associated with various red blood cell disorders, including hemoglobinopathies like sickle cell disease and thalassemia, where it contributes to imbalanced hemostasis and vascular dysfunction (Soupene2008ATP8A1). Additionally, ATP8A1 is cleaved by calpain during platelet apoptosis, a process that may be relevant in conditions involving oxidative stress and membrane asymmetry disruption (Jing2019Calpain). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in both neurological and hematological conditions.

## Interactions
ATP8A1 interacts with the CDC50 protein, forming a complex essential for its function as a phospholipid flippase. The ATP8A1-CDC50 complex is crucial for maintaining lipid asymmetry in eukaryotic cells by translocating lipids across the plasma membrane. This interaction is necessary for the proper folding and activation of ATP8A1, facilitating its role in phospholipid transport (Zhang2023Exploring).

The ATP8A1 protein is also a substrate for calpain, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease. During platelet apoptosis, calpain cleaves ATP8A1 in a calcium-dependent manner, a process that is inhibited by calpain inhibitors. This cleavage occurs independently of caspase activity, indicating a direct interaction between calpain and ATP8A1 (Jing2019Calpain).

While the interactions of ATP8A1 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its interaction with CDC50 is well-documented as critical for its phospholipid transport function. The modulation of ATP8A1 activity by calcium ions and its sensitivity to specific inhibitors also suggest regulatory interactions that influence its enzymatic activity (Chalat2017Cterminus; Soupene2008ATP8A1).
