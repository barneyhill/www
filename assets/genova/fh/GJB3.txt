# GJB3

## Overview
The GJB3 gene encodes the gap junction protein beta 3, also known as Connexin 31 (Cx31), which is a transmembrane protein integral to the formation of gap junction channels. These channels facilitate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, thereby playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue function (Gao2022A; Easton2018A). Cx31 is predominantly expressed in the epidermis and cochlea, where it contributes to skin differentiation and auditory processes, respectively (Gao2022A). Structurally, Cx31 consists of four transmembrane domains and assembles into hexameric connexons, which dock with connexons from neighboring cells to form functional gap junctions (Oh2013Evaluation; Li2014Mechanism). Mutations in GJB3 have been linked to disorders such as erythrokeratodermia variabilis and non-syndromic hearing loss, underscoring its clinical significance (Liu2008Digenic; Richard2000The).

## Structure
The GJB3 gene encodes the Connexin31 (Cx31) protein, which is a component of gap junction channels. The primary structure of Cx31 consists of 270 amino acids with a molecular weight of 31 kDa (Li2014Mechanism). The protein features four transmembrane domains: TM1 (amino acids 21-40), TM2 (amino acids 76-98), TM3 (amino acids 127-149), and TM4 (amino acids 188-210), separated by a cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 99-126) and two extracellular loops, E1 (amino acids 41-75) and E2 (amino acids 150-187) (Li2014Mechanism). The amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1-20) and the carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 211-270) are cytoplasmic (Li2014Mechanism).

The quaternary structure involves the assembly of six connexin subunits into a hexameric hemichannel, which can dock with another hemichannel to form a complete gap junction channel (Oh2013Evaluation). This structural arrangement allows for intercellular communication by facilitating the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells (Li2014Mechanism). The transmembrane and extracellular loop domains are conserved within the connexin family, while variations occur in the cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl-terminal domain, contributing to functional diversity (Oh2013Evaluation). Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the function and regulation of Cx31, although specific modifications for Cx31 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The GJB3 gene encodes the protein Connexin 31 (Cx31), which is a crucial component of gap junctions. These gap junctions are intercellular channels that facilitate the direct exchange of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, playing a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and communication (Gao2022A; Easton2018A). In healthy human cells, Cx31 is highly expressed in the epidermis and cochlea, indicating its significant role in skin and auditory functions (Gao2022A).

In the skin, Cx31 contributes to the differentiation of keratinocytes, which are essential for maintaining the skin's structure and function (Gao2022A). In the cochlea, Cx31 is involved in maintaining the electrochemical environment necessary for normal auditory function by facilitating the recycling of potassium ions, which is crucial for hearing (Oh2013Evaluation; Li2014Mechanism). The protein is composed of four transmembrane domains and forms hexameric structures called connexons, which dock with connexons from adjacent cells to form functional gap junction channels (Easton2018A). These channels are essential for rapid intercellular communication and maintaining epidermal integrity (Easton2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GJB3 gene, which encodes connexin 31, are associated with several human disorders, primarily affecting the skin and auditory systems. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV) is a skin disorder linked to mutations in GJB3, such as R42P and F137L, which disrupt the normal function of connexons, leading to skin abnormalities characterized by transient erythema and hyperkeratosis (Richard2000The). These mutations result in un/misfolded proteins that induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and an unfolded protein response, contributing to the pathogenesis of EKV (Tang2015Pathogenic).

GJB3 mutations are also implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss. Mutations like N166S and A194T can interact with mutations in the GJB2 gene, leading to hearing impairment in digenic heterozygotes (Liu2008Digenic). However, some variants, such as c.538C>T, have been found to have a low incidence and do not significantly contribute to hearing loss in certain populations (Huang2017The). These findings highlight the genetic heterogeneity and complex interactions involved in GJB3-related disorders.

## Interactions
The GJB3 gene encodes the protein Connexin 31, which is involved in forming gap junctions that facilitate intercellular communication. Connexin 31 interacts with other connexins, such as Connexin 43 (Cx43), to form heteromeric connexons. However, certain mutations in GJB3, like the Cx31G45E mutation, can disrupt these interactions. This mutation leads to the entrapment of Cx43 within the cell, preventing it from reaching the plasma membrane and resulting in necrotic cell death (Easton2018A).

GJB3 also interacts with cytoskeletal components, specifically F-actin and α-tubulin. These interactions are crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity and proper cell function. GJB3 binds to polymerized actin, influencing actin dynamics and invadopodia formation, which are essential for cell motility and invasion (Liu2024Impairment). The protein also colocalizes with α-tubulin at centrosomes during metaphase, affecting microtubule dynamics and spindle orientation during mitosis (Liu2024Impairment). Impairment of these interactions due to GJB3 deficiency can lead to altered microtubule and actin dynamics, resulting in genomic instability and increased cancer cell invasion (Liu2024Impairment).
