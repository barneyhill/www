# KRTAP4-4

## Overview
KRTAP4-4 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 4-4, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, which is integral to the structural integrity of human hair. This protein is categorized as an ultrahigh sulfur protein due to its significant cysteine content, which facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds. These bonds are crucial for the protein's interaction with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical properties of hair, such as strength and elasticity (Rogers2006Human; Cruz2017Peptide—protein). The KRTAP4-4 protein is characterized by a sequence rich in cysteine and serine, with a distinctive pattern of monocysteine- and dicysteine-containing pentameric repeats that are essential for its function in hair fiber formation (Rogers2006Human). The gene's expression in the hair cortex and its role in forming a cross-linked network with keratin filaments underscore its importance in maintaining hair structure (Rogers2006Human; Kariya2005Size).

## Structure
The KRTAP4-4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, known for its high sulfur content, particularly cysteine, which constitutes 33.6-36.7 mol% of the protein's amino acid composition (Rogers2006Human). This high cysteine content facilitates the formation of disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's structural stability and its interaction with keratin intermediate filaments in hair (Cruz2017Peptide—protein).

The primary structure of KRTAP4-4 is characterized by a sequence rich in cysteine and serine, with additional amino acids such as proline, arginine, threonine, glutamine, and valine (Rogers2006Human). The protein features a rigid repeat structure composed of monocysteine- and dicysteine-containing pentameric repeats, which dominate the midsection of the protein. These repeats typically begin with cysteine in positions 1 and/or 2, with proline often in position 4, and serine and threonine frequently in positions 4 and 5 (Rogers2006Human).

The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for the protein's function in forming a cross-linked network with keratin filaments (Cruz2017Peptide—protein). The quaternary structure involves interactions with keratin filaments, contributing to the mechanical properties of hair fibers (Cruz2017Peptide—protein).

## Function
KRTAP4-4, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, plays a significant role in the structure and function of human hair. This gene is part of the ultrahigh sulfur KAP4 family, which is characterized by a high cysteine content. The presence of cysteine is crucial as it forms disulfide bonds, contributing to the rigidity and strength of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human; Kariya2005Size). KRTAP4-4 is expressed in the hair cortex, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments (KIF), forming a cross-linked network that enhances the mechanical properties of hair, such as strength and elasticity (Rogers2006Human; Kariya2005Size).

The protein structure of KRTAP4-4 includes monocysteine- and dicysteine-containing pentameric repeats, which are essential for its function in hair fiber formation. These repeat structures begin with cysteine, followed by proline, serine, and threonine, which are thought to influence the physical properties of hair (Rogers2006Human). The gene's polymorphic variants suggest a genetic diversity that may affect its function, although the specific organismal outcomes of these variations are not fully understood (Rogers2005Human).
