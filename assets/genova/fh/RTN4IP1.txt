# RTN4IP1

## Overview
RTN4IP1 is a gene that encodes the protein reticulon 4 interacting protein 1, which is a mitochondrial matrix protein with NAD(P)H oxidoreductase activity. This protein plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ), a key component in the electron transport chain, by facilitating the O-methylation of intermediates necessary for CoQ production. It is involved in the final stages of mitochondrial complex I assembly, particularly affecting the ND5 module attachment and N-module stability, which are essential for efficient cellular respiration. RTN4IP1 interacts with several mitochondrial proteins, including COQ3, COQ5, and complex I assembly factors, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function (Park2023Mitochondrial; Oláhová2024RTN4IP1). Mutations in the RTN4IP1 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, such as early-onset recessive optic neuropathy and mitochondrial encephalopathies, highlighting its significance in human health (Aldosary2022A; Oláhová2024RTN4IP1).

## Function
RTN4IP1, also known as optic atrophy-10 (OPA10), is a mitochondrial matrix protein with NAD(P)H oxidoreductase activity, playing a crucial role in coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis. It supports the O-methyltransferase activity of COQ3, facilitating the conversion of demethylated CoQ2 to CoQ2 by generating a reduced hydroquinone intermediate necessary for the O-methylation reaction (Park2023Mitochondrial). RTN4IP1 is involved in transferring electrons from NAD(P)H to quinone molecules, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function (Park2023Mitochondrial).

In healthy human cells, RTN4IP1 is essential for the final stages of mitochondrial complex I (CI) assembly, particularly affecting the ND5 module attachment and N-module stability. Its absence leads to a decrease in the abundance of CI subunits, impairing cellular respiration (Oláhová2024RTN4IP1). RTN4IP1 also interacts with COQ9, supporting CoQ biosynthesis by regulating the O-methyltransferase activity of COQ3, ensuring adequate levels of both oxidized and reduced CoQ10, which are crucial for efficient electron transport and energy production in mitochondria (Oláhová2024RTN4IP1). The protein's role in CoQ biosynthesis and its antioxidant properties are vital for maintaining mitochondrial health and function (Park2021In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RTN4IP1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting the eyes and nervous system. These mutations can lead to early-onset recessive optic neuropathy, known as Optic Atrophy-10 (OPA10), characterized by symptoms such as reduced visual acuity, photophobia, nystagmus, and optic disc pallor (Aldosary2022A; Zou2019Whole). Beyond ocular manifestations, RTN4IP1 mutations are linked to neurological disorders, including mitochondrial encephalopathies, seizures, ataxia, and intellectual disabilities (Aldosary2022A).

The gene encodes a mitochondrial ubiquinol oxidoreductase, and its dysfunction is associated with deficiencies in mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and IV, contributing to conditions like Leigh syndrome and other mitochondrial diseases (Oláhová2024RTN4IP1; Okamoto2017Siblings). Studies have identified specific pathogenic variants, such as a novel homozygous variant in Saudi families, which is believed to have a founder effect and is linked to severe neurological features resembling mitochondrial encephalopathy (Aldosary2022A).

Alterations in RTN4IP1 expression or interactions can disrupt mitochondrial complex I assembly and coenzyme Q biosynthesis, leading to impaired mitochondrial function and contributing to the pathology of these diseases (Oláhová2024RTN4IP1).

## Interactions
RTN4IP1, also known as reticulon 4 interacting protein 1, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for mitochondrial function. It interacts with COQ3 and COQ5, enzymes involved in coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis, suggesting a role in facilitating the O-methylation of intermediates in CoQ production (Park2023Mitochondrial). RTN4IP1 is also part of a broader interactome that includes 438 proteins, with 32 consistently labeled, indicating its extensive involvement in mitochondrial processes (Park2023Mitochondrial).

RTN4IP1 interacts with mitochondrial complex I assembly factors such as NDUFAF3, NDUFAF4, TIMMDC1, and FOXRED1, playing a role in the final stages of complex I assembly, particularly affecting the ND5 module attachment and N-module stability (Oláhová2024RTN4IP1). It also interacts with UQCRC1 and UQCRC2, subunits of mitochondrial complex III, which is crucial for its role in CoQ biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation (Aldosary2022A).

These interactions highlight RTN4IP1's multifaceted role in mitochondrial function, particularly in CoQ biosynthesis and the assembly of respiratory chain complexes, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function.
