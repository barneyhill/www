# MXRA7

## Overview
MXRA7, or matrix remodeling associated 7, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular signaling pathways. The MXRA7 protein is categorized as a matrix-associated protein and plays a significant role in various physiological processes, including wound healing, liver injury response, and bone formation. It interacts with vimentin, an intermediate filament protein, to coordinate fibroblast functions, particularly during cutaneous wound healing. This interaction influences several signaling pathways, such as JNK, P38, and STAT3/STAT5, which are crucial for cellular responses to injury and stress (Shen2023Matrix). Alterations in MXRA7 expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including liver injury, psoriasis, and bone density disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining tissue homeostasis and integrity (Ning2018Altered; Lin2018Matrix; Zhou2019Matrix).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
MXRA7 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of liver injury, MXRA7 overexpression has been shown to exacerbate carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury (ALI) in mice, while its deficiency provides protection. This is achieved by reducing apoptosis and inflammation, as well as decreasing the infiltration of immune cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines (Lin2018Matrix).

In psoriasis, MXRA7 expression is significantly decreased in psoriatic tissues. Its deficiency in a mouse model leads to more severe psoriasis-like symptoms, suggesting a protective role against the disease. The altered expression of MXRA7 affects keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, which are key factors in psoriasis pathogenesis (Ning2018Altered).

MXRA7 also plays a role in bone formation. Deficiency in MXRA7 impairs the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts, leading to reduced bone mass and shorter femurs in mice. This suggests that MXRA7 is crucial for maintaining the balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis, and its deficiency could contribute to conditions like osteopenia (Zhou2019Matrix).

In wound healing, MXRA7 deficiency results in impaired fibroblast function and slower wound closure, indicating its importance in tissue regeneration (Shen2023Matrix).

## Interactions
MXRA7 (matrix remodeling associated 7) is known to interact with vimentin, a type of intermediate filament protein, in fibroblasts. This interaction is crucial for coordinating fibroblast functions during cutaneous wound healing. The MXRA7 protein forms a complex with vimentin, as demonstrated through immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining techniques. This interaction influences several signaling pathways, including JNK, P38, and STAT3/STAT5, which are important for wound healing processes. In MXRA7-deficient fibroblasts, these pathways are impaired, but the addition of recombinant MXRA7 proteins can restore their activation. However, the ERK1/2 pathway does not appear to be affected by MXRA7-vimentin interactions (Shen2023Matrix).

The interaction between MXRA7 and vimentin also affects fibroblast proliferation. The presence of MXRA7 is necessary for this process, as blocking vimentin with antibodies inhibits the proliferation effect of recombinant MXRA7 (Shen2023Matrix). These findings suggest that MXRA7 plays a significant role in the regulation of fibroblast activity and wound healing through its interaction with vimentin, highlighting its importance in extracellular matrix remodeling and cellular signaling pathways (Shen2023Matrix).
