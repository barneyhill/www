# ALG1L2

## Overview
ALG1L2 is a gene that encodes the protein ALG1 chitobiosyldiphosphodolichol beta-mannosyltransferase like 2, which is involved in the glycosylation process. This protein is categorized as a glycosyltransferase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the transfer of sugar moieties to specific substrates, playing a crucial role in the synthesis of glycoproteins. Glycosyltransferases like ALG1L2 are essential for proper cellular function and communication, as they contribute to the structural diversity and functionality of glycoproteins. The precise biological pathways and interactions involving ALG1L2 remain an active area of research, with implications for understanding various cellular processes and potential links to disease states.
