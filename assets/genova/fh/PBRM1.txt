# PBRM1

## Overview
PBRM1, or polybromo 1, is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of the PBAF (Polybromo-associated BAF) chromatin remodeling complex, which is part of the SWI/SNF family. The protein, also known as BAF180, is characterized by its complex structure, including six tandem bromodomains, two bromo-adjacent homology domains, and a high mobility group box, which facilitate its role in chromatin interaction and gene regulation (Liao2019High; Hopson2024Heterologous). PBRM1 plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability, regulating gene expression, and participating in DNA repair processes. It acts as a tumor suppressor, with mutations in the gene frequently observed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and other cancers, where they contribute to tumor progression and impact therapeutic responses (Aurilio2020Renal; CarrilAjuria2019Prognostic). The protein's ability to interact with chromatin and microtubules underscores its multifunctional role in cellular processes, linking chromatin remodeling with cytoskeletal dynamics (Karki2021A).

## Structure
The PBRM1 protein, also known as BAF180, is a component of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex and is characterized by its complex molecular structure. It consists of nine domains: six tandem bromodomains (BDs), two bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domains, and one high mobility group (HMG) box (Hopson2024Heterologous). The bromodomains are specialized structures that recognize acetylated lysine residues on histones, playing a crucial role in chromatin interaction and gene regulation (Liao2019High). These domains are highly conserved, each forming a hydrophobic pocket to bind acetyl-lysines on histone tails (Porter2017Individual).

The BAH domains are involved in the ubiquitination of PCNA during post-replication repair, while the HMG box is implicated in DNA binding, potentially promoting non-homologous end-joining (Hopson2024Heterologous). The protein's structure facilitates its role in genomic stability, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation (Hopson2024Heterologous).

Mutations in the bromodomains, particularly BD2 and BD4, are common in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and can disrupt the protein's ability to bind chromatin, affecting its tumor suppressor function (Slaughter2018PBRM1). The presence of multiple BDs suggests that PBRM1 acts as the nucleosome recognition subunit of the PBAF complex (Slaughter2018PBRM1).

## Function
The PBRM1 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex, which is part of the SWI/SNF family. In healthy human cells, PBRM1 plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability and regulating gene expression. It functions as a methyl reader for the α-TubK40me3 mark on microtubules, a modification made by the SETD2 enzyme. This recognition is essential for the recruitment of PBAF components to microtubules, particularly during mitosis, to ensure proper chromosome segregation and genomic stability (Karki2021A).

PBRM1 is also involved in chromatin remodeling, where it influences gene transcription, particularly under stress conditions. It regulates stress response genes in epithelial cells and is involved in DNA damage repair (Porter2019PBRM1). The protein contains six tandem bromodomains, which are involved in recognizing acetylated histone tails, mediating interactions with nucleosomes, and influencing chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activation (Slaughter2018PBRM1).

PBRM1's role extends beyond chromatin remodeling, integrating chromatin and cytoskeletal activities through its acetyl-binding BD and methyl-binding BAH domains. This coordinated activity highlights how defects in chromatin remodelers like PBRM1 can contribute to diseases through both epigenetic and cytoskeletal dysfunction (Karki2021A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PBRM1 gene are frequently observed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where they occur in approximately 40-49% of cases, making it the second most commonly mutated gene in this cancer type after VHL (Aurilio2020Renal; CarrilAjuria2019Prognostic). These mutations are predominantly truncating and lead to loss of function, contributing to increased cell proliferation and migration, and are associated with advanced tumor stages and poor differentiation (Pawłowski2012Loss; CarrilAjuria2019Prognostic). PBRM1 mutations are often clonal and define specific evolutionary trajectories in tumors, impacting prognosis and therapeutic response (CarrilAjuria2019Prognostic).

In ccRCC, PBRM1 mutations are linked to genomic instability and alterations in the tumor microenvironment, affecting the efficacy of immunotherapies such as anti-PD-1 therapy (Aili2021Mutational; Miao2018Genomic). These mutations are associated with changes in DNA methylation and miRNA expression, leading to deregulation of gene expression pathways (Wang2016An). PBRM1 mutations have also been observed in other cancers, including breast, pancreatic, and uterine cancers, although they are most prevalent in ccRCC (CarrilAjuria2019Prognostic).

In gastric adenocarcinomas, PBRM1 abnormalities, including gene deletion and methylation, are present in about 10% of cases and are associated with favorable prognostic factors, such as high tumor immune activity (Zhou2022Clinicopathological).

## Interactions
PBRM1 (polybromo 1) is a subunit of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex, which is part of the SWI/SNF family. It interacts with chromatin through its bromodomains (BDs), which recognize acetylated lysines on histones, facilitating chromatin association and gene regulation. PBRM1 contains six tandem BDs, with BD2 and BD4 being particularly crucial for mediating interactions with chromatin. These domains preferentially bind to nucleosomes marked by H3K14ac, H3K4me3, and H4K16ac, and their interactions are essential for PBRM1's role in regulating cell proliferation and tumor suppression (Slaughter2018PBRM1; Porter2017Individual).

PBRM1 also exhibits nucleic acid binding capabilities. BD3, BD4, and BD5 selectively bind to double-stranded DNA, while BD2 shows a higher affinity for double-stranded RNA. This suggests a multifunctional role for these BDs in nucleic acid interactions, potentially bridging non-coding RNAs to nucleosomes (De2024Characterization).

During mitosis, PBRM1 interacts with microtubules, binding to α-tubulin and colocalizing with the SETD2 methyl mark on spindle microtubules. This interaction is crucial for its localization to spindle poles, which is significantly reduced in SETD2-null cells (Karki2021A).
