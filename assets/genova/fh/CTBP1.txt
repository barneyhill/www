# CTBP1

## Overview
CTBP1 (C-terminal binding protein 1) is a gene that encodes a transcriptional corepressor protein involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation, chromatin modification, and cell cycle control. The CTBP1 protein is characterized by its ability to form dimers and tetramers, which are stabilized by NAD(H) binding, and it contains domains essential for interacting with chromatin-modifying enzymes and transcription factors (Madison2013Nicotinamide; Kuppuswamy2008Role). As a corepressor, CTBP1 plays a significant role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by repressing genes such as E-cadherin, which is crucial for development and cancer progression (Chinnadurai2009The). Additionally, CTBP1 is implicated in maintaining genomic stability during mitosis and is associated with various clinical conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Bergman2009CtBPs; Zhang2024A).

## Structure
CTBP1 (C-terminal binding protein 1) is a transcriptional co-repressor with a complex molecular structure. It contains several key domains, including a NAD(H)-binding domain and a PXDLS motif-binding domain, which are crucial for its function in transcriptional repression and interaction with chromatin-modifying enzymes (Kuppuswamy2008Role; Beck2019A). The protein also features a hydrophobic cleft and a surface groove, which facilitate interactions with proteins containing E1A PLDLS and RRT motifs, respectively (Kuppuswamy2008Role).

CTBP1 can form dimers and tetramers, with tetramerization occurring through a "dimer of dimers" mechanism. This process is NAD(H)-dependent, highlighting the importance of the NAD(H)-binding domain in stabilizing these quaternary structures (Madison2013Nicotinamide; Bellesis2018Assembly). The C-terminal domain of CTBP1 is intrinsically unstructured, contributing to its flexibility and ability to interact with various molecular partners (Nardini2006The).

Post-translational modifications of CTBP1 include phosphorylation and SUMOylation, which influence its stability and localization. Phosphorylation at Ser422 targets CTBP1 for degradation, while SUMOylation at Lys428 promotes nuclear localization (Nardini2006The). CTBP1 also has several splice variant isoforms, which contribute to its functional diversity.

## Function
CTBP1 (C-terminal binding protein 1) functions as a transcriptional corepressor in healthy human cells, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression. In the nucleus, CTBP1 acts as a scaffold to recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as histone deacetylases and methyltransferases, to DNA-binding transcription factors. This activity is essential for the repression of epithelium-specific genes by transcription factors like SLUG and ZEB/δEF1 (Bergman2009CtBPs). CTBP1 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by repressing adhesion molecules like E-cadherin, which is significant for development and tissue remodeling (Chinnadurai2009The).

CTBP1 also plays a role in maintaining mitotic fidelity, which is crucial for cell survival. It influences the activity of chromosome passenger proteins, such as aurora B kinase, which are critical for proper chromosome alignment and segregation during mitosis. Depletion of CTBP1 leads to mitotic defects, including lagging chromosomes and failed cytokinesis, resulting in binucleate cells (Bergman2009CtBPs). CTBP1's interaction with transcriptional regulators like δEF1 further underscores its role in modulating gene expression and maintaining genomic stability (Furusawa1999Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTBP1 gene are associated with a rare autosomal dominant disorder known as Hypotonia, Ataxia, Developmental Delay, and Tooth Enamel Defect Syndrome (HADDTS). This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, motor disturbances, and dental abnormalities, among other symptoms (AcostaBaena2022CTBP1; Zhang2024A). A specific mutation, p.R342W, has been identified in multiple patients and is linked to neurodevelopmental disabilities, including intellectual disability, ataxia, and hypotonia (Vijayalingam2020Human; Beck2019A). This mutation affects the cofactor recruitment domain of CTBP1, leading to altered transcriptional activities and downregulation of neurodevelopmental gene networks (Vijayalingam2020Human).

CTBP1 mutations can also lead to cerebellar volume reduction and increased susceptibility to neuronal viral pathogens (Vijayalingam2020Human). In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, CTBP1 is implicated in cancer progression. It interacts with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and forms complexes with transcription factors to suppress E-cadherin expression, contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumorigenesis (Chen2021The). CTBP1's role in inflammatory diseases includes upregulating proinflammatory cytokine genes, highlighting its dual function as a corepressor and coactivator depending on its binding partners (Chen2021The).

## Interactions
CTBP1 (C-terminal binding protein 1) is a transcriptional corepressor that interacts with a variety of proteins to mediate transcriptional repression. It is known to interact with DNA-binding transcription factors such as ZEB1, ZEB2, and RREB-1, as well as with enzymatic cofactors like histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2), histone methyltransferases (G9a and GLP), and lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) (Kuppuswamy2008Role). CTBP1 interacts with these proteins through specific motifs, including the PLDLS-binding cleft and the RRT-binding groove, which are crucial for its function in recruiting core and auxiliary components of the corepressor complex (Kuppuswamy2008Role).

CTBP1 also interacts with the CoREST complex and the SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9, which remain associated with CTBP1 even when the PLDLS cleft is occupied by other proteins like E1A (Kuppuswamy2008Role). The interaction with Ubc9 suggests a role for CTBP1 in the sumoylation of cofactors, influencing cofactor association dynamics (Kuppuswamy2008Role). Additionally, CTBP1 interacts with vertebrate polycomb proteins such as HPC2 and XPc through a conserved 6-amino-acid motif, contributing to gene repression (Sewalt1999C-Terminal). These interactions highlight CTBP1's role in modulating chromatin structure and transcriptional activity.
