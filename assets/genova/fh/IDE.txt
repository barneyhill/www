# IDE

## Overview
The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) gene encodes a zinc metalloprotease known as the insulin-degrading enzyme, which is involved in the catabolism of insulin and other small peptides. IDE is characterized by its unique structural features, including a clamshell-like tertiary structure and a zinc-binding motif, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Im2007Structure; Tundo2023The). The enzyme plays a pivotal role in maintaining insulin homeostasis and is implicated in the degradation of amyloid-beta peptides, linking it to Alzheimer's disease pathology (Tundo2017Multiple; Duckworth1998Insulin). IDE's activity is modulated by various factors, including divalent cations and allosteric inhibitors, which influence its function in cellular processes (GonzálezCasimiro2021Modulation; Duckworth1998Insulin). The gene's polymorphisms have been associated with diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Carrasquillo2010Concordant; Pivovarova2016Insulindegrading).

## Structure
The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease with a molecular weight of approximately 110 kDa, composed of a single polypeptide chain (Tundo2023The). Its primary structure includes a unique inversion of the active site motif 'HxxEH' compared to the classical 'HExxH' sequence found in other metalloenzymes (Tundo2023The). The secondary structure of IDE consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a clamshell-like tertiary structure with two major domains: the N-terminal (IDE-N) and C-terminal (IDE-C) domains (Im2007Structure; Tundo2023The). These domains are connected by a 28-residue hinge loop, allowing the enzyme to adopt open and closed conformations (Tundo2023The).

IDE functions as a homodimer in solution, with dimers being the predominant and more active form (Zhang2018Ensemble; Tundo2023The). The enzyme's catalytic activity is located in the IDE-N domain, which contains a zinc-binding motif involving His108, His112, and Glu189, crucial for activating a catalytic water molecule (Tundo2023The). IDE's structure also includes a catalytic chamber formed by the N- and C-terminal domains, which explains its preference for degrading peptides less than 80 amino acids long (Zhang2018Ensemble). Common post-translational modifications of IDE include phosphorylation and ubiquitination.

## Function
The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease that plays a critical role in the degradation of insulin and other peptides, such as glucagon, IGF-II, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and transforming growth factor-α (TGFα) (Duckworth1998Insulin). IDE is primarily located in the cytosol but is also found in endosomes, peroxisomes, and the extracellular space (GonzálezCasimiro2021Modulation). Its activity is essential for regulating insulin levels within cells, as it cleaves insulin at specific sites, beginning with the B chain in endosomes (Duckworth1998Insulin).

IDE's function extends beyond insulin degradation. It is involved in the breakdown of amyloid-beta peptides, which is significant in preventing amyloid plaque formation associated with Alzheimer's disease (Tundo2017Multiple). The enzyme's substrate specificity is determined by the three-dimensional structure of the substrate, with a β-pleat necessary for binding (Duckworth1998Insulin). IDE also interacts with the ubiquitin-proteasome system, potentially influencing cell growth and proliferation (Tundo2017Multiple).

IDE's activity is modulated by various factors, including divalent cations like Zn++, Mn++, Co++, and Ca++, and is inhibited by sulfhydryl-active agents (Duckworth1998Insulin). It is developmentally regulated and expressed in all cells, including non-insulin-sensitive ones, indicating its broad role in cellular processes (Duckworth1998Insulin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In Alzheimer's disease, IDE is crucial for degrading amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, which accumulate in the brains of AD patients. Decreased IDE activity or expression is observed in AD, leading to increased Aβ levels and contributing to disease pathology (Kurochkin2018InsulinDegrading; Pivovarova2016Insulindegrading). Genetic polymorphisms in the IDE gene have been associated with an increased risk of late-onset AD, with certain variants linked to altered IDE expression and Aβ levels (Carrasquillo2010Concordant; Zuo2009Promoter).

In type 2 diabetes, IDE is involved in insulin degradation. Polymorphisms within the IDE locus are associated with impaired insulin metabolism, leading to conditions such as hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance, which are characteristic of T2DM (Pivovarova2016Insulindegrading). The enzyme's inhibition can exacerbate insulin resistance, a key feature of T2DM, and potentially increase the risk of cancerogenesis (Pivovarova2016Insulindegrading). The interplay between IDE, insulin, and Aβ suggests a pathophysiological link between T2DM and AD, with IDE's role in both diseases highlighting its clinical significance (CorralizaGomez2023Insulindegrading).

## Interactions
The insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) interacts with a variety of proteins, influencing numerous biological processes. IDE is known to degrade insulin and amyloid-beta (Aβ), playing a role in proteostasis and preventing the formation of toxic amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer's disease (Zhang2018Ensemble). It also interacts with insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), and amylin, with its substrate specificity influenced by the charge distribution and structural features of these peptides (Guo2010Molecular).

IDE forms complexes with proteins such as the retinoblastoma (RB) protein and the tumor suppressor PTEN, suggesting a role in cell cycle regulation and oncogenesis (GonzálezCasimiro2021Modulation). It also interacts with androgen and glucocorticoid receptors, enhancing their DNA binding capabilities (GonzálezCasimiro2021Modulation). IDE's interaction with the viral protein glycoprotein E from varicella zoster virus suggests a role in viral pathogenesis (GonzálezCasimiro2021Modulation).

IDE's activity is modulated by various factors, including ATP and nucleoside polyphosphates, which can allosterically inhibit its function (GonzálezCasimiro2021Modulation). These interactions highlight IDE's diverse roles in proteolysis and its potential impact on diseases like diabetes and Alzheimer's.
