# ADH1C

## Overview
The ADH1C gene encodes the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 1C (class I), gamma polypeptide, which is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family of enzymes. This enzyme is a zinc metalloenzyme that plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of ethanol by catalyzing its conversion to acetaldehyde, a critical step in alcohol metabolism (Edenberg2010Alcohol). The ADH1C enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver but is also found in other tissues such as the intestine, pharynx, and stomach (Edenberg2010Alcohol). It exhibits broad substrate specificity, allowing it to metabolize various alcohols and aldehydes, and is involved in detoxification processes within human cells (Edenberg2010Alcohol). Genetic polymorphisms in the ADH1C gene can influence the enzyme's kinetic properties, affecting individual susceptibility to alcoholism and alcohol-related diseases (Edenberg2010Alcohol). Additionally, the enzyme is involved in steroid metabolism, further highlighting its functional diversity (Edenberg2010Alcohol).

## Structure
The ADH1C gene encodes a subunit of the human class I alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in ethanol metabolism. The protein structure of ADH1C includes several key features that contribute to its function. The primary structure of ADH1C consists of a polypeptide chain with specific amino acid sequences that are highly conserved among class I alcohol dehydrogenases. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets, which form the backbone of the protein's three-dimensional conformation.

The tertiary structure of ADH1C involves the folding of the polypeptide chain into a specific three-dimensional shape, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure includes a substrate-binding pocket with a unique topology that influences substrate specificity and binding affinity (Niederhut2001Three‐dimensional). The quaternary structure of ADH1C typically involves the formation of dimers, which are necessary for its catalytic function (Niederhut2001Three‐dimensional).

ADH1C contains specific domains, such as the coenzyme-binding domain, which is crucial for its interaction with NAD(H) (Niederhut2001Three‐dimensional). The protein also features a catalytic zinc ion coordinated by specific residues, which is vital for its enzymatic activity (Niederhut2001Three‐dimensional). The ADH1C isoenzyme is unique among human isoenzymes for its activity toward steroid substrates, highlighting its functional diversity (Niederhut2001Three‐dimensional).

## Function
The ADH1C gene encodes a class I alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of ethanol by catalyzing its oxidation to acetaldehyde, a key step in alcohol metabolism (Edenberg2010Alcohol; Chen2002A). This enzyme is primarily active in the liver but is also expressed in other tissues such as the intestine, pharynx, and stomach (Edenberg2010Alcohol). The ADH1C enzyme is a zinc metalloenzyme, with zinc facilitating the hydride ion transfer necessary for its catalytic activity (Niederhut2001Three‐dimensional).

ADH1C exhibits broad substrate specificity, allowing it to metabolize various alcohols and aldehydes, and it is involved in the detoxification processes in human cells (Edenberg2010Alcohol). The enzyme's activity is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which can affect its kinetic properties and, consequently, the risk of alcoholism and alcohol-related diseases (Edenberg2010Alcohol). ADH1C also plays a role in steroid metabolism, as it can oxidize 3-hydroxy-5-steroids, including derivatives like androstan and estradiol (Edenberg2010Alcohol). The enzyme's expression is regulated by various cis-acting elements and transcription factors, contributing to its tissue-specific expression pattern (Edenberg2010Alcohol; Chen2002A).

## Clinical Significance
The ADH1C gene is clinically significant due to its role in alcohol metabolism and its association with various cancers. Polymorphisms in ADH1C, such as the ADH1C*1 and ADH1C*2 alleles, influence the risk of developing alcohol-related cancers, particularly in the upper aerodigestive tract. The ADH1C*1 allele, which encodes an enzyme with a high capacity to generate acetaldehyde, is associated with an increased risk of esophageal, hepatocellular, and head and neck cancers among heavy drinkers (Homann2005Alcohol). The ADH1C*2/*2 genotype is linked to a higher risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma, independent of alcohol consumption, due to its slower alcohol metabolism, which may enhance the carcinogenic effects of alcohol (Brocic2011Genetic).

The ADH1C gene's polymorphisms also interact with environmental factors such as alcohol and tobacco use, modifying the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (Peters2005The). Ethnic differences in allele prevalence further influence these risks, with variations in findings across different populations (Hashibe2006Evidence). These genetic variations highlight the complex interplay between ADH1C polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility.
