# TMEM14C

## Overview
TMEM14C is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 14C, a crucial component of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transport protein and is primarily involved in the biosynthesis of heme, a vital process for hemoglobin production in erythroid cells. TMEM14C facilitates the transport of protoporphyrinogen IX into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is converted into heme. The gene's expression is notably enriched in erythropoietic tissues and is regulated during erythroid differentiation. Deficiencies in TMEM14C can lead to significant hematological issues, such as anemia, due to impaired heme synthesis. While the protein is suggested to interact with other mitochondrial components involved in heme metabolism, its specific interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Yien2014TMEM14C).

## Structure
TMEM14C is a transmembrane protein localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, characterized by a tightly packed three-helical bundle with interhelical distances of less than 8 Å (Klammt2012Facile). It is part of the TMEM14 protein family, which includes other members like TMEM14A and TMEM14B, and is predicted to have four transmembrane helices, although only three span the entire membrane (Attwood2016Topology). This structural feature is typical of transmembrane transport proteins, supporting its proposed role as a protoporphyrinogen IX importer in heme biosynthesis (Yien2014TMEM14C).

The protein's structure is crucial for its function in transporting heme synthesis intermediates within the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Yien2014TMEM14C). TMEM14C's expression is enriched in erythropoietic tissues, particularly during erythroid differentiation, and is regulated by the transcription factor GATA-1 (Yien2014TMEM14C). The absence of TMEM14C leads to defects in heme synthesis, highlighting its essential role in erythroid mitochondrial heme metabolism (Yien2014TMEM14C). The protein's structural integrity is maintained during experimental manipulations, as evidenced by minimal changes in NMR spectra upon mutation (Klammt2012Facile).

## Function
TMEM14C is a transmembrane protein localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it plays a crucial role in erythroid mitochondrial heme metabolism. It is specifically involved in the transport of protoporphyrinogen IX (PPgenIX) into the mitochondrial matrix, a critical step in the biosynthesis of heme, which is essential for hemoglobin production in erythroid cells (Kafina2017Intracellular; Yien2014TMEM14C). TMEM14C facilitates the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), which is then converted to heme by the enzyme ferrochelatase (Yien2014TMEM14C).

The expression of TMEM14C is enriched in mammalian erythropoietic tissues, such as the fetal liver, yolk sac, bone marrow, and spleen, and is upregulated during terminal erythroid differentiation (Yien2014TMEM14C). Its function is critical for the terminal steps of heme synthesis, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of heme intermediates, resulting in defective erythroid maturation and anemia (Yien2014TMEM14C). TMEM14C is not involved in regulating mitochondrial iron import or mitochondrial biogenesis, as mitochondrial iron levels and function remain normal in its absence (Yien2014TMEM14C).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TMEM14C gene have been implicated in several hematological conditions. TMEM14C is crucial for erythroid mitochondrial heme metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to significant defects in erythroid differentiation, resulting in anemia and developmental arrest in erythroid cells (Yien2014TMEM14C). In Tmem14c-deficient mice, there is a marked decrease in terminally differentiating erythroid cells, leading to anemia and embryonic mortality (Yien2014TMEM14C). 

In humans, although no direct link between TMEM14C mutations and specific hematologic diseases has been established, its deficiency is associated with anemia and mild porphyric phenotypes, suggesting it could act as a genetic modifier affecting the severity of anemia and porphyria (Yien2014TMEM14C). The gene's role in heme synthesis implies that its dysfunction could contribute to conditions characterized by impaired heme synthesis, such as porphyria (Yien2014TMEM14C).

In the context of myelodysplastic syndromes, specifically refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), alternative splicing of TMEM14C has been observed, which affects hemoglobin synthesis and may contribute to the ineffective erythropoiesis seen in this condition (Conte2015Aberrant). These findings suggest that TMEM14C expression alterations are associated with RARS and may play a role in the disease phenotype (Conte2015Aberrant).

## Interactions
TMEM14C is involved in mitochondrial heme metabolism and is suggested to function as a protoporphyrinogen IX (PPgenIX) transporter within the mitochondria. It is proposed to be part of a mitochondrial protein complex that includes other components involved in heme synthesis and transport, such as FECH, PPOX, and ABCB10, although specific interactions with these proteins are not detailed (Medlock2015Identification; Swenson2020From). TMEM14C is localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane and is essential for the terminal steps of heme synthesis, particularly in erythroid cells (Yien2014TMEM14C).

The protein's role as a transporter is supported by its structure, which is typical of transmembrane transport proteins, and its expression is enriched in hematopoietic tissues, particularly during erythroid differentiation (Yien2014TMEM14C). TMEM14C's involvement in heme synthesis is crucial for erythropoiesis, as its deficiency leads to porphyrin accumulation and anemia (Yien2014TMEM14C). While TMEM14C is suggested to interact with other mitochondrial proteins, specific protein interactions remain unclear, and its role may be more related to its function as a transporter within the heme biosynthesis pathway (Yien2014TMEM14C).
