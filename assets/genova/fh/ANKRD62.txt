# ANKRD62

## Overview
ANKRD62 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 62 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ankyrin repeat domain 62 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction capabilities (Mosquera2020Novel). While the specific biological functions of the ANKRD62 gene and its encoded protein are not fully understood, emerging research indicates its involvement in critical pathways related to cancer and immune system regulation. The protein's potential role in disease mechanisms, particularly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, highlights its significance in the genetic landscape of these conditions (Vallois2016Activating). Further studies are required to delineate the precise functions and interactions of the ankyrin repeat domain 62 protein, as well as its broader implications in human health and disease (Lee2024Genetic).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ANKRD62 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and immune-related conditions. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the ANKRD62 gene has been identified as having recurrently mutated regions, specifically located at chr18:12086057-12086469, with a significant q-value, suggesting its potential role in the disease's progression (Mosquera2020Novel). 

In angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), a study found similar profiles of alterations in ANKRD62 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) before and after chemotherapy in a patient with a refractory condition, indicating its involvement in the genetic landscape of this lymphoma (Vallois2016Activating). 

Additionally, a genetic study on myocardial infarction (MI) in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the ANKRD62 gene, although the study did not provide specific information on the gene's role in MI or other conditions (Lee2024Genetic). These findings suggest that ANKRD62 may play a role in various pathological processes, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance.
