# CORO2A

## Overview
CORO2A is a gene that encodes the protein coronin 2A, a member of the coronin family, which is primarily involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as a Type II coronin, characterized by a conserved WD40-repeat domain that forms a β-propeller structure, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Chan2011Unraveling). Coronin 2A plays a significant role in cellular processes such as cell migration, transcriptional regulation, and inflammatory response modulation. It is a component of the Nuclear Co-repressor (NCoR) complex and is involved in the de-repression of Toll-like receptor-responsive genes, particularly in macrophages (Huang2011Coronin). The protein's interactions with actin and other proteins, such as SUMOylated liver X receptors and Slingshot-1L, underscore its importance in actin dynamics and transcriptional regulation (Marshall2009Coronin). Alterations in CORO2A expression or function have been linked to various diseases, including inflammatory disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Lim2016Ubiquitin).

## Structure
CORO2A, also known as coronin 2A, is a protein that belongs to the coronin family, which is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization. The protein is composed of 525 amino acids and is highly expressed in the brain, with lower expression levels in the epidermis, colon, prostate, testis, and lung (Xavier2024Evolutionary). CORO2A is classified as a Type II coronin, which typically features a conserved WD40-repeat domain forming a β-propeller structure. This structural motif is crucial for protein-protein interactions and is a common feature among coronins (Chan2011Unraveling).

CORO2A is involved in the regulation of focal adhesion turnover during cell migration and is a component of the Nuclear Co-repressor (NCoR) complex, playing a role in the Toll-like receptor inflammation response pathway (Chan2011Unraveling). The protein contains a SUMO 2/3 interacting motif (SIM) at its C-terminal end, which interacts with SUMOylated Liver X Receptors, regulating NCoR clearance from gene promoters (Chan2011Unraveling). However, specific details about the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of CORO2A, as well as information on specific domains, prominent folds, or post-translational modifications, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Coronin 2A (CORO2A) is a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and division. In healthy human cells, CORO2A functions as a component of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) complex, playing a critical role in the de-repression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-responsive genes. This process involves the removal of NCoR complexes from gene promoters, facilitated by CORO2A through its interaction with nuclear actin (Huang2011Coronin). CORO2A acts as an NCoR exchange factor necessary for the de-repression of inflammatory response genes in macrophages, serving as a docking site for SUMOylated liver X receptors (LXRs) and aiding in the release of these genes from actin networks involved in repression functions (Huang2011Coronin).

CORO2A is primarily localized in the nucleus of macrophages and co-localizes with NCoR-rich regions, indicating its involvement in transcriptional regulation. It interacts with actin to facilitate the clearance of NCoR from the promoters of specific genes, such as Nos2 and Il1b, upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is crucial for gene activation (Huang2011Coronin). These functions highlight CORO2A's significant role in modulating the inflammatory response and influencing gene expression in healthy cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CORO2A gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those involving inflammatory responses and cancer. CORO2A plays a critical role in the regulation of inflammatory response genes in macrophages by mediating the actin-dependent de-repression of these genes. Mutations affecting the actin-binding domain of CORO2A can impair this process, leading to reduced activation of inflammatory genes such as Nos2 and Il1b, which may impact conditions where inflammation is a key factor (Huang2011Coronin).

In cancer, CORO2A is involved in the transcriptional repression of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) through its interaction with ubiquitin specific protease 19 (USP19). USP19 stabilizes CORO2A by reducing its ubiquitination, thereby preventing its degradation. This interaction influences RAR-mediated transcriptional processes, which are significant in adipogenesis and potentially in cancer progression (Lim2016Ubiquitin).

Additionally, CORO2A is associated with the regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) target genes, and its interaction with liver X receptors (LXRs) is crucial for modulating inflammatory responses. Disruption of the CORO2A-LXR interaction by proinflammatory signals can affect the transcriptional response, suggesting a role in pathological inflammation (Huang2011Coronin).

## Interactions
CORO2A (coronin 2A) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It is a component of the NCoR complex and interacts with oligomeric nuclear actin, facilitating the removal of NCoR from target gene promoters, which is crucial for the de-repression of inflammatory response genes (Huang2011Coronin). CORO2A also interacts with SUMOylated liver X receptors (LXRs), specifically LXRβ, which can block NCoR turnover by binding to a conserved SUMO2/3 interaction motif in CORO2A. This interaction is disrupted by inflammatory signals that induce phosphorylation of LXR, leading to its deSUMOylation and release from CORO2A (Huang2011Coronin).

CORO2A is known to interact with Slingshot-1L, a cofilin-activating phosphatase, at focal adhesions. This interaction is crucial for cofilin activity, affecting cell motility and focal-adhesion disassembly (Marshall2009Coronin). Additionally, CORO2A is a novel binding partner for USP19, a ubiquitin-specific protease. USP19 stabilizes CORO2A by reducing its ubiquitination, thereby preventing its proteasomal degradation. This interaction is significant in the transcriptional repression of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) target genes (Lim2016Ubiquitin). These interactions highlight CORO2A's role in actin dynamics and transcriptional regulation.
