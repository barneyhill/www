# SULF2

## Overview
SULF2 is a gene that encodes the protein sulfatase 2, an extracellular endosulfatase involved in the modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). This protein plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular signaling pathways by removing 6-O-sulfate groups from heparan sulfate chains, thereby modulating the interactions between HSPGs and various protein ligands, such as Wnts, FGFs, and GDNF (LemjabbarAlaoui2009Sulf2; Rosen2010Sulf2:). Sulfatase 2 is categorized as an extracellular enzyme and is known for its involvement in processes like tissue repair, development, and angiogenesis (Rosen2010Sulf2:). The gene's expression and the activity of its encoded protein have been linked to tumor progression and metastasis in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Lai2008Sulfatase; Yang2021Expression).

## Structure
The SULF2 protein is a large vertebrate protein composed of approximately 870 amino acids. It features a specific domain organization that includes a signal sequence, two sulfatase-related domains, and a basic hydrophilic domain (HD) (Rosen2010Sulf2:). The sulfatase-related domains contain nine evolutionarily conserved regions, with seven active residues forming the catalytic center. The 118 amino acid domain is homologous to the C-terminal region of lysosomal glucosamine-6-sulfatase, which is involved in degrading heparan sulfate chains (Rosen2010Sulf2:).

SULF2 is synthesized as a pre-proprotein and is cleaved into 75 kDa and 50 kDa fragments linked by disulfide bonds. These fragments are secreted and retained on the cell surface, with the HD domains responsible for cell surface binding (Rosen2010Sulf2:). The protein is enriched in lipid raft subdomains, which are important for signal transduction (Rosen2010Sulf2:).

Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, are evident in SULF2, as indicated by the presence of a 132 kDa species reduced to approximately 100 kDa after N-glycanase treatment (MorimotoTomita2002Cloning). The protein also contains several furin cleavage sites, suggesting potential multimerization and processing mechanisms (MorimotoTomita2002Cloning).

## Function
SULF2 encodes an extracellular endosulfatase that plays a crucial role in the post-synthetic modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) by removing 6-O-sulfation from intact heparan sulfate chains. This desulfation process modulates the binding and signaling of various protein ligands, including Wnts, FGFs, and GDNF, which are critical for cellular signaling pathways (LemjabbarAlaoui2009Sulf2). In healthy human cells, SULF2 is important for the spatiotemporal control of HSPG functions, which are involved in development and normal physiological processes (LemjabbarAlaoui2009Sulf2).

SULF2 is active in the extracellular matrix, where it influences cell signaling by modulating the interactions between protein ligands and HSPGs. This activity allows SULF2 to fine-tune signaling pathways, such as Wnt signaling, by altering the availability of ligands to their receptors (Rosen2010Sulf2:). Although SULF2 is not essential for normal development, it plays a role in refining signaling events, which can impact processes like tissue repair and development (Rosen2010Sulf2:). The enzyme's activity is also linked to angiogenesis, as it can mobilize angiogenic factors like VEGF by releasing HSPG-sequestered ligands (Rosen2010Sulf2:).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SULF2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, where it often exhibits protumorigenic properties. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SULF2 is frequently upregulated, promoting cell proliferation and migration. High SULF2 expression correlates with worse prognosis and increased tumor recurrence post-surgery, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lai2008Sulfatase). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SULF2 enhances Wnt signaling, contributing to tumorigenesis. Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, particularly in squamous cell carcinoma (LemjabbarAlaoui2009Sulf2). 

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), SULF2 is overexpressed in tumor tissues, with high levels linked to poor survival outcomes. This overexpression is more pronounced in tumors associated with tobacco and alcohol use compared to HPV-positive tumors (Yang2021Expression). SULF2 is also implicated in bladder cancer, where its high expression is associated with poorer disease-free and overall survival (Zhang2022Sulfatase). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SULF2 in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SULF2 interacts with various proteins and participates in multiple signaling pathways, influencing tumor progression and metastasis. It forms a ternary complex with WNT3A and glypican 3 (GPC3), enhancing the release of WNT proteins and promoting their interaction with Frizzled receptors, which activates the WNT signaling pathway (Han20246Oendosulfatases). SULF2 also upregulates GPC3, which is crucial for fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, enhancing FGF2 binding and receptor phosphorylation, thereby promoting cell proliferation and survival in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Lai2008Sulfatase).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), SULF2 modulates receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, particularly affecting PDGFRα, IGF1Rβ, and EPHA2, which are important for tumor growth and maintenance (Phillips2012Heparan). SULF2's role in modulating interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) allows it to influence the availability and activity of growth factors and cytokines, such as VEGF, FGF-1, and SDF-1, by altering their binding to heparin (Uchimura2006HSulf2).

SULF2 also affects the TGF-β/SMAD pathway, contributing to tumor cell invasiveness in cancers like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and lung cancer (Han20246Oendosulfatases). These interactions highlight SULF2's significant role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting cancer progression.
