# IMPDH1

## Overview
IMPDH1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1, a critical enzyme in the purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidoreductase and is responsible for the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), a key step in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides. IMPDH1 is expressed in various tissues, with significant importance in the retina, where it supports the high nucleotide demand of photoreceptor cells. The enzyme functions as a homotetramer and can form higher-order structures such as octamers and filaments, which are essential for its regulatory roles. Mutations in the IMPDH1 gene are linked to retinal degenerative diseases, including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and Leber congenital amaurosis, highlighting its critical role in maintaining retinal health (Aherne2004On; Kennan2002Identification; Burrell2021IMPDH1).

## Structure
IMPDH1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in purine nucleotide biosynthesis. The primary structure of IMPDH1 consists of 514 amino acids, with specific retinal splice variants, such as IMPDH1(546) and IMPDH1(595), having additional C-terminal and N-terminal extensions (McGrew2011Towards; Burrell2021IMPDH1). The secondary structure includes a catalytic alpha/beta barrel core and a regulatory cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain, which contains two CBS repeats (McGrew2011Towards).

The tertiary structure of IMPDH1 involves the catalytic domain and the CBS domain, which is located opposite the active site. This domain is not essential for enzymatic activity but may regulate intracellular adenine nucleotide levels (McGrew2011Towards). The quaternary structure of IMPDH1 is a homotetramer, which can further assemble into octamers and filaments in response to metabolic demands (Burrell2021IMPDH1).

IMPDH1 forms polymorphic filaments with different assembly interfaces in active and inhibited states, influenced by ATP and GTP binding. These filaments are crucial for its allosteric regulation and activity (Burrell2021IMPDH1). The retinal-specific variants of IMPDH1 exhibit structural modifications that reduce sensitivity to GTP inhibition, stabilizing the active filament form (Burrell2021IMPDH1).

## Function
The IMPDH1 gene encodes the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase type 1, which plays a critical role in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) to xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), a rate-limiting step in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, with the concomitant reduction of NAD to NADH (Aherne2004On; Kennan2002Identification). Guanine nucleotides are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and intracellular signaling pathways (Kennan2002Identification).

IMPDH1 functions as a homotetramer and is widely expressed in various tissues, including the retina, where it is particularly important in photoreceptor cells. These cells have a high demand for guanine nucleotides due to their role in visual transduction processes (Aherne2004On). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of nucleotide pools in cells, which is vital for normal cellular function and proliferation (Gu2003Targeted).

In addition to its enzymatic role, IMPDH1 is known to bind single-stranded nucleic acids, suggesting a potential regulatory role in nucleic acid metabolism, although the exact function of this activity remains unclear (Hedstrom2008IMP). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the synthesis of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP), essential for various cellular functions (Aherne2004On).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IMPDH1 gene are associated with several retinal degenerative diseases, most notably autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). These conditions are characterized by progressive vision loss due to the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the retina. In adRP, mutations such as Arg224Pro, Asp226Asn, and Val268Ile have been identified, which do not affect the enzyme's catalytic activity but alter its nucleic acid binding properties, potentially leading to photoreceptor apoptosis (Mortimer2005Autosomal; Bjeloš2023Novel; Kennan2002Identification). The Arg231Pro mutation is associated with a severe form of adRP, highlighting the gene's role in the disease's pathogenesis (Grover2004A).

IMPDH1 mutations are located around the CBS domain of the protein, which may disrupt interactions with photoreceptor-specific proteins, contributing to retinal degeneration (Hedstrom2008IMP; Kennan2002Identification). Despite the gene's ubiquitous expression, the retina is the primary tissue affected by these mutations, suggesting a unique requirement for IMPDH1 in photoreceptor cells (Bennett2020Disease). The mutations are thought to cause retinal degeneration through protein misfolding and aggregation rather than a loss of enzymatic activity (Aherne2004On).

## Interactions
IMPDH1 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. The protein forms polymorphic filaments, which are crucial for its regulatory functions. These filaments are composed of stacked octamers, with specific interactions between monomers, such as the interaction between Tyr12 and Arg356, which is essential for filament assembly (Burrell2021IMPDH1). The assembly of these filaments is influenced by ATP and GTP binding, which affect the conformation and activity of IMPDH1. ATP binding promotes the formation of extended octamers, while GTP binding results in compressed octamers (Burrell2021IMPDH1).

In the retina, IMPDH1 filaments co-localize with other enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis and with the regulatory protein Ankyrin Repeat Domain 9 (ANKRD9), suggesting potential interactions that could stabilize different filament states (Burrell2021IMPDH1). The retinal variants of IMPDH1 are less sensitive to GTP inhibition, which is crucial for maintaining the high guanine nucleotide demand in photoreceptors (Burrell2021IMPDH1). These interactions and filament assemblies are vital for the enzyme's regulatory functions and its role in retinal metabolism.
