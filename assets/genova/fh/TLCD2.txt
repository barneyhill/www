# TLCD2

## Overview
TLCD2 (TLC domain containing 2) is a gene that encodes the protein TLC domain containing 2, which is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and membrane fluidity in mammalian cells. The protein is categorized as a membrane-associated protein, playing a critical role in modulating the composition of phospholipids, particularly those containing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). This regulation is essential for maintaining the fluidity and functionality of cellular membranes, especially under conditions of high saturated fatty acid presence (Ruiz2018Membrane). TLCD2 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, liver, and muscle, and is localized to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial function and lipid remodeling (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). The gene's involvement in lipid homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and immune responses underscore its biological and clinical significance (Petkevicius2022TLCD1).

## Function
TLCD2 (TLC domain containing 2) is involved in regulating membrane composition and fluidity in mammalian cells. It plays a crucial role in limiting the formation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA)-containing phospholipids, which are essential for maintaining membrane fluidity, especially in the presence of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (Ruiz2018Membrane). TLCD2 is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, muscle, liver, small intestine, and fat, and is localized to the plasma membrane, indicating its specific role in the lipid composition of this cellular structure (Ruiz2018Membrane).

In human cells, TLCD2 does not affect the uptake of exogenous saturated fatty acids but may limit the production or promote the turnover of LCPUFA-containing phospholipids. Knockdown studies in human HEK293 cells have shown that TLCD2 knockdown leads to increased levels of certain LCPUFAs in phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs), suggesting its role in maintaining membrane fluidity by regulating the balance of fatty acids in membrane phospholipids (Ruiz2018Membrane). TLCD2's function is distinct from other related proteins, focusing on the regulation of membrane fluidity through LCPUFA content (Ruiz2018Membrane).

## Clinical Significance
TLCD2 has been implicated in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a liver disease characterized by fat accumulation and inflammation. Alterations in TLCD2 expression have been associated with changes in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) composition, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). Studies using TLCD1/2 double knockout (DKO) mice have shown that the absence of these genes can lead to reduced liver weight, lower hepatic lipid content, and decreased inflammation and fibrosis, suggesting a protective effect against NASH (Petkevicius2022TLCD1).

In addition to its role in liver disease, TLCD2 expression has been linked to eosinophil levels during allergic inflammation in murine models, indicating a potential role in immune responses (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). The gene's involvement in lipid metabolism and its interactions with mitochondria-associated membranes suggest that TLCD2 may influence various physiological and pathological states, including metabolic disorders (Petkevicius2022TLCD1).

Overall, TLCD2's role in regulating lipid composition and its potential impact on liver diseases and immune responses highlight its clinical significance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in related conditions.

## Interactions
TLCD2 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. In HepG2 cells, TLCD2 interacts with components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function. These interactions suggest a role for TLCD2 in mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism, particularly at mitochondria-associated membranes (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). TLCD2 also interacts with proteins involved in phospholipid synthesis and lipid remodeling, such as PHB and PHB2, which form a mitochondrial lipid remodeling complex (Petkevicius2022TLCD1).

The protein is suggested to act downstream of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) uptake and upstream of lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPLAT) enzymes, indicating a role in intracellular lipid trafficking (Petkevicius2022TLCD1). TLCD2 is not an intra-mitochondrial protein but interacts with mitochondria, suggesting a potential role in interorganelle lipid transport (Petkevicius2022TLCD1).

In addition, TLCD2 is involved in limiting the generation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA)-containing phospholipids, which are potent membrane fluidizers. This regulation is crucial for maintaining membrane homeostasis (Ruiz2018Membrane). These interactions and functions highlight TLCD2's significant role in lipid metabolism and membrane fluidity regulation.
