# BIVM

## Overview
The BIVM gene encodes the basic, immunoglobulin-like variable motif containing protein, which is characterized by its highly charged nature and presence of immunoglobulin-like motifs. Despite these motifs, the protein does not belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily due to structural differences. The BIVM protein is predicted to be 503 amino acids in length with an isoelectric point of 9.1, suggesting potential interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids. It is widely expressed across various tissues, indicating its role as a housekeeping gene essential for fundamental cellular functions. The protein localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, implicating it in transcriptional regulation and other cellular processes. While the specific molecular functions of BIVM remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in cellular communication and structural organization is suggested by its biochemical properties (Yoder2002BIVM).

## Structure
The BIVM gene encodes a protein that is predicted to be 503 amino acids in length with an isoelectric point (pI) of 9.1, indicating it may interact with other proteins or nucleic acids (Yoder2002BIVM). The protein is characterized by short peptide motifs typical of an immunoglobulin (Ig) variable (V) region, such as motifs W 41 FRQ and YFC 104, which correspond to structural cores within framework regions 2 and 3 of Ig V regions (Yoder2002BIVM). Despite these motifs, BIVM does not have the appropriate spacing or relationships associated with the Ig superfamily (Yoder2002BIVM).

The carboxy-terminal region of BIVM is highly conserved across species, suggesting a significant structural and functional role, although specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided (Yoder2002BIVM). The protein is highly charged and may associate with other cellular proteins or bind DNA/RNA (Yoder2002BIVM). The presence of a CpG island at the 5' end and its wide tissue distribution suggest it may function as a housekeeping gene (Yoder2002BIVM). There is no mention of specific domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms in the available context.

## Function
The BIVM gene encodes a protein that is involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning as a housekeeping gene due to its ubiquitous expression across different tissues. The BIVM protein is highly charged and localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting it may associate with other proteins or bind DNA/RNA, potentially influencing transcriptional regulation or other cellular processes (Yoder2002BIVM). The presence of a CpG island at the 5' end of the gene supports its role as a housekeeping gene, essential for basic cellular functions (Yoder2002BIVM).

The BIVM protein contains an immunoglobulin-like motif, which implies a potential role in immune-related functions, although it does not fit into the immunoglobulin superfamily due to structural differences (Yoder2002BIVM; Ferraren2005Linkage). Its predicted high isoelectric point (pI) of 9.1 suggests that BIVM may bind other proteins and/or nucleic acids, which could be crucial for its function in cellular communication and structural organization (Yoder2002BIVM). Despite these insights, the specific molecular functions of BIVM in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The BIVM gene has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations and alterations in its expression. In the context of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm newborns, the BIVM rs3825519 mutation has been identified as a significant genetic factor. This mutation was found in 44.1% of BPD patients compared to 12.5% of non-BPD infants, suggesting a potential role in the disease's pathogenesis. The mutation is associated with prolonged assisted ventilation in BPD patients, indicating it may contribute to the severity of the condition. Additionally, decreased expression of the BIVM gene in the cord blood of BPD patients has been observed, which may be linked to the rs3825519 mutation, potentially affecting the pathogenesis of BPD (Luo2023Identification).

In the context of bipolar disorder, the BIVM gene has been studied for its potential association with the condition. Although some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the BIVM region were identified, the clinical significance of these mutations or expression alterations in bipolar disorder remains unclear. The study did not find strong evidence of association between BIVM SNPs and bipolar disorder in the populations examined (Ferraren2005Linkage).
