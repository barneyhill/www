# HMGB4

## Overview
HMGB4 is a gene that encodes the high mobility group box 4 protein, a member of the high mobility group (HMG) protein family known for its role in DNA binding and chromatin remodeling. The HMGB4 protein is characterized by its two tandem HMG domains, which facilitate its interaction with DNA, particularly non-linear structures such as those modified by the anticancer drug cisplatin (Park2012Binding). Unlike other HMGB proteins, HMGB4 lacks a C-terminal acidic tail, which influences its DNA-binding properties and enhances its affinity for platinated DNA (Park2012Binding). Predominantly expressed in the testes, HMGB4 is implicated in processes such as spermatogenesis and transcriptional repression, particularly by inhibiting the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, thereby affecting the sensitivity of testicular germ cell tumors to cisplatin (Awuah2017Repair). The protein's interactions with histones and histone deacetylases further suggest its involvement in chromatin structure modulation and gene expression regulation (Rouhiainen2016HMGB4).

## Structure
HMGB4 is a member of the high mobility group (HMG) protein family, characterized by its DNA-binding capabilities. The protein structure includes two tandem HMG domains, known as HMGB4a and HMGB4b, each with a molecular weight of approximately 10 kDa (Park2012Binding). Unlike other HMGB proteins, HMGB4 lacks the C-terminal acidic tail, which influences its DNA-binding affinity (Park2012Binding). This absence results in a binding affinity to platinated DNA that is more similar to the HMGB1 didomain AB than to the full-length HMGB1 (Park2012Binding).

The primary structure of HMGB4 includes conserved amino acid residues shared with HMGB1, particularly in domain A, which is the main DNA-binding domain. Notably, the intercalating residue Phe37 is crucial for binding to platinated DNA and is conserved in HMGB4 (Park2012Binding). The protein's DNA-binding capacity is redox-independent due to the replacement of cysteine at position 22 with phenylalanine or tyrosine, preventing the formation of an intradomain disulfide bond (Park2012Binding).

HMGB4 is expressed preferentially in the testis and is involved in inhibiting the repair of cisplatin-modified DNA, which may contribute to the hypersensitivity of testicular germ cell tumors to cisplatin (Park2012Binding).

## Function
HMGB4 is a member of the high mobility group box (HMGB) family of proteins, which are involved in DNA binding and chromatin remodeling. In healthy human cells, HMGB4 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences DNA-related processes such as transcription and repair. Unlike other HMGB proteins, HMGB4 lacks the C-terminal acidic tail, which affects its DNA-binding properties, resulting in a binding affinity for platinated DNA that is more similar to the HMGB1 didomain AB than to the full-length HMGB1 (Park2012Binding).

HMGB4 has a preference for binding to non-linear DNA structures, such as those modified by cisplatin, a platinum-based anticancer drug. This binding is redox-independent due to the absence of an intradomain disulfide bond, which distinguishes it from other HMGB proteins (Park2012Binding). The protein's DNA-binding capacity is significantly influenced by the intercalating residue Phe37, which plays a critical role in stabilizing the interaction with platinated DNA (Park2012Binding).

HMGB4 is expressed preferentially in the testes, where it is proposed to facilitate spermatogenesis (Park2012Binding). It acts as a transcriptional repressor and is involved in blocking the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing DNA damage (Awuah2017Repair).

## Clinical Significance
The HMGB4 gene has been implicated in the sensitivity of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) to cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug. Alterations in HMGB4 expression or mutations can significantly impact the effectiveness of cisplatin treatment. In TGCTs, HMGB4 is known to block the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing cisplatin-induced DNA damage. This blockage results in increased sensitivity to cisplatin, as the drug-induced DNA lesions are not efficiently repaired (Awuah2017Repair). Conversely, the absence or reduction of HMGB4 expression leads to increased resistance to cisplatin, suggesting that mutations or modifications in HMGB4 could confer drug resistance (Awuah2017Repair).

The study also highlights that HMGB4 may act as a transcriptional repressor of NER-associated proteins, such as XPF-ERCC1 and XPG, which are up-regulated in cells lacking HMGB4. This suggests that HMGB4's role in DNA repair processes is crucial for maintaining cisplatin sensitivity (Awuah2017Repair). These findings underscore the potential clinical relevance of HMGB4 in determining cisplatin sensitivity and its implications for cancer treatment, particularly in TGCTs (Awuah2017Repair).

## Interactions
HMGB4 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It binds to core histones and histone deacetylases (HDACs), influencing post-translational modifications of histones. This interaction is associated with increased HDAC activity and changes in histone acetylation and methylation patterns, suggesting a role in chromatin structure modulation (Rouhiainen2016HMGB4).

HMGB4 also exhibits a strong binding affinity to cisplatin-modified DNA, particularly to 1,2-intrastrand cross-linked adducts, which significantly inhibits the repair of cisplatin-induced DNA damage. This interaction is facilitated by the absence of a C-terminal acidic tail, which enhances its binding affinity compared to HMGB1. The residue Phe37 is crucial for stabilizing the binding complex with platinated DNA, highlighting HMGB4's role in DNA repair inhibition (Park2012Binding).

In neuronal cells, HMGB4 affects the expression of genes involved in neural differentiation, potentially through its interactions with histones and HDACs. It modulates the expression of over 800 genes, including those related to cell adhesion and neuronal differentiation markers, indicating its involvement in transcription regulation and neural development (Rouhiainen2016HMGB4).
