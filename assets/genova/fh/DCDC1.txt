# DCDC1

## Overview
DCDC1 is a gene that encodes the protein doublecortin domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of a doublecortin (DC) domain. This domain is evolutionarily conserved and plays a crucial role in microtubule binding, although DCDC1 contains only a single DC repeat, suggesting limited microtubule polymerization capability (Zeng2003Identification). The DCDC1 protein is a hydrophilic, intracellular protein, lacking both a signal peptide and transmembrane domain, indicating its cytoplasmic localization (Zeng2003Identification). Functionally, DCDC1 is involved in dynein-dependent transport of RAB8A-positive vesicles, which is essential for intracellular transport and microtubule dynamics, particularly in neuronal cells where it influences neurogenesis and neuronal migration (Badosa2023Proteomic). Alterations in the DCDC1 gene have been linked to various medical conditions, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and chromosomal rearrangements associated with ocular and neurodevelopmental disorders (Du2017Comprehensive; Wawrocka2018The).

## Structure
The DCDC1 gene encodes a protein with a doublecortin (DC) domain, which is evolutionarily conserved and important for microtubule binding. The DCDC1 protein is a putative 354-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 39.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9.40 (Zeng2003Identification). The DC domain in DCDC1 contains only one repeat, which suggests it may have microtubule binding activity but lacks the ability to mediate microtubule polymerization (Zeng2003Identification). The absence of a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain indicates that DCDC1 is a hydrophilic, intracellular protein (Zeng2003Identification).

The DCDC1 protein is part of the DCX gene family, which is characterized by its ability to bind to tubulin and stabilize microtubules, crucial for neuronal migration (Dijkmans2010The). However, specific details about the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of DCDC1 are not provided in the available literature. The protein's primary structure is defined by its amino acid sequence, but further structural details remain unspecified (Zeng2003Identification; Reiner2006The). There is no mention of post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for DCDC1 in the provided context.

## Function
The DCDC1 gene encodes a protein that contains a doublecortin (DC) domain, which is crucial for microtubule binding. This domain is evolutionarily conserved and typically involved in microtubule dynamics, although DCDC1 contains only one DC repeat, suggesting it may bind microtubules but lacks the ability to mediate their polymerization, which usually requires two tandem repeats (Zeng2003Identification). The DCDC1 protein is likely a hydrophilic, intracellular protein, as it lacks a signal peptide and transmembrane domain, indicating its activity within the cytoplasm (Zeng2003Identification).

In cellular processes, DCDC1 plays a significant role in mediating dynein-dependent transport of RAB8A-positive vesicles, which is essential for intracellular transport and microtubule dynamics (Badosa2023Proteomic). This function is particularly relevant in neuronal cells, where DCDC1 is involved in neurogenesis and neuronal migration, impacting brain development and function. The protein's activity in the cytoplasm underscores its importance in maintaining cellular structure and facilitating intracellular transport, which are critical for proper cell division and function (Badosa2023Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DCDC1 gene have been implicated in various medical conditions. In the context of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), DCDC1 has been identified as a novel significantly mutated gene. Studies have reported frequent nonsilent mutations and deletions in DCDC1, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of ESCC by affecting microtubule polymerization (Du2017Comprehensive). These genetic alterations in DCDC1 are associated with the development of ESCC, highlighting its potential role in cancer biology (Talukdar2018Molecular).

In addition to its role in cancer, DCDC1 is involved in chromosomal rearrangements associated with ocular conditions. Deletions encompassing DCDC1 and other genes in the 11p13 region have been linked to aniridia, a condition characterized by the absence of the iris, and other ocular malformations (Wawrocka2018The; BlancoKelly2017Improving). These deletions may also predispose individuals to neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting a broader impact of DCDC1 alterations on human health (Wawrocka2018The).

While DCDC1 has been mentioned in the context of COVID-19 severity, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with its mutations or alterations remain under investigation (Kamenarova2024Rare).
