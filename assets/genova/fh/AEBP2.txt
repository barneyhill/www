# AEBP2

## Overview
AEBP2 (Adipocyte Enhancer-Binding Protein 2) is a gene that encodes the AE binding protein 2, a zinc finger protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. This protein is a critical component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a significant role in transcriptional repression through histone modification, specifically the methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/me3) (Sun2017Structural; Kasinath2018Structures). AEBP2 is characterized by its Gli-type zinc finger motifs and an RRK-rich motif, which facilitate its interaction with other PRC2 components, such as RBBP4 and SUZ12, thereby stabilizing the complex and enhancing its enzymatic activity (Sun2017Structural; Kim2009AEBP2). The gene is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with distinct roles in adult and embryonic tissues (Kim2009AEBP2). AEBP2's function is crucial for the regulation of genes involved in neural crest cell development, and its disruption can lead to developmental defects and diseases such as Hirschsprung's disease and Waardenburg syndrome (Kim2024Functional; Kim2011Aebp2). Additionally, alterations in AEBP2 have been implicated in oncological contexts, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Bhattacharyya2023Polycomb).

## Structure
The AEBP2 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several conserved domains. It contains three Gli-type zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for its DNA-binding activity and interaction with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) (Kim2009AEBP2). These zinc fingers are part of the C-terminal region and are highly conserved across vertebrates (Kim2009AEBP2). The protein also features an RRK-rich motif, which interacts with RBBP4, a core component of PRC2 (Sun2017Structural).

AEBP2 is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with two major forms: a 52 kDa isoform prevalent in adult tissues and a 31 kDa isoform found primarily in embryos (Kim2009AEBP2). The larger isoform includes acidic and neutral domains, while the smaller isoform lacks these domains (Kim2009AEBP2).

The zinc finger domains of AEBP2 form typical Cys2His2 structures, with ZF1 and ZF3 having a β-sheet followed by an α-helix, while ZF2 includes a protruding loop (Sun2017Structural). These structural features suggest a role in stabilizing the PRC2 complex and enhancing its enzymatic activity (Sun2017Structural).

## Function
AEBP2 (AE binding protein 2) is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation in human cells. It is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which is involved in transcriptional repression through the methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/me3), a marker of gene silencing (Sun2017Structural; Kasinath2018Structures). AEBP2 interacts with other PRC2 components, such as RBBP4 and SUZ12, stabilizing the complex and enhancing its histone methyltransferase activity (Sun2017Structural; Kasinath2018Structures).

AEBP2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA motifs, often co-localizing with PRC2 target sites, suggesting its role as a targeting protein for PRC2 to specific genomic loci (Kim2024Functional; Kim2011Aebp2). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of genes involved in neural crest cell development, as AEBP2 is predominantly expressed in these cells during development (Kim2024Functional; Kim2011Aebp2). Disruption of AEBP2 function can lead to developmental defects, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper gene expression patterns during embryogenesis (Kim2024Functional; Kim2011Aebp2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the AEBP2 gene have been implicated in several human diseases, particularly those involving neural crest cell (NCC) development. AEBP2 is associated with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) and Waardenburg syndrome (WS), as heterozygous mutants in mice display phenotypes similar to these conditions. These phenotypes include enlarged colon and hypopigmentation, linked to the absence of neural crest-derived ganglia and melanocytes (Kim2024Functional). The gene's role in regulating NCC migration through PRC2-mediated epigenetic mechanisms suggests that AEBP2 could be a potential disease locus for HSCR and WS, with its effects possibly influenced by environmental factors and nutritional status (Kim2024Functional).

In addition to developmental disorders, alterations in AEBP2 have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mutations and deletions in genes coding for PRC2 factors, including AEBP2, have been increasingly identified in AML, with similar mutational patterns observed in both pediatric and adult cases, as well as in T-ALL and MPAL (Bhattacharyya2023Polycomb). These findings highlight the clinical significance of AEBP2 in both developmental and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
AEBP2 (AE binding protein 2) is a zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). AEBP2 interacts with several components of the PRC2 complex, including RBBP4 and SUZ12, which helps stabilize the core complex and enhance its histone methyltransferase activity (Sun2017Structural). AEBP2 contains tandem C2H2 zinc fingers that interact with the ubiquitin moiety in H2AK119ub1 and the histone H2A-H2B surface on nucleosomes, facilitating the recruitment and activation of PRC2 (Kasinath2021JARID2).

AEBP2 also interacts with RBBP4 through its RRK-rich motif, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 7.6 μmol/L, and its ZF1-3 domain, with a Kd of 10.1 μmol/L (Sun2017Structural). These interactions are crucial for the recognition of ubiquitinated nucleosomes and the regulation of PRC2 activity. The KRRKLKNKRRR motif of AEBP2 contacts nucleosomal DNA, further supporting its role in DNA interaction and PRC2 recruitment (Kasinath2021JARID2). These interactions highlight AEBP2's role in modulating PRC2 activity and its involvement in chromatin remodeling.
