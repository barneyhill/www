# FAT3

## Overview
FAT3 is a gene that encodes the FAT atypical cadherin 3 protein, a member of the cadherin superfamily known for its role in cell adhesion and signaling. The FAT3 protein is a large, single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by an extensive extracellular region with 34 cadherin repeats, a Laminin G domain, and EGF-like motifs, which facilitate calcium binding and cell adhesion. The cytoplasmic tail of FAT3 contains conserved motifs that suggest a role in intracellular signaling. This protein is highly expressed in the nervous system, where it influences neuronal morphology and development, and is also involved in skeletal morphogenesis. FAT3 interacts with various proteins, including the kinesin motor protein Kif5B and actin regulators from the Ena/VASP family, which are crucial for its role in neural development and cytoskeletal dynamics. Mutations and altered expression of FAT3 have been implicated in conditions such as adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Okajima2020Atypical; Katoh2006Comparative; Nada2022Identification; Cheng2016Disparate).

## Structure
The FAT3 protein is a large, single-pass transmembrane protein characterized by an extensive extracellular region and a cytoplasmic tail. The extracellular domain includes 34 cadherin repeats, a Laminin G domain, and EGF-like motifs, which are involved in calcium binding and cell adhesion (Katoh2006Comparative; Cheng2016Disparate). The cytoplasmic region contains novel motifs such as VCSVxPxLP and SDYxS, which are conserved among FAT family members, indicating a role in intracellular signaling (Katoh2006Comparative).

FAT3 undergoes alternative splicing, which affects its distribution and function. This splicing can disrupt a conserved Kinesin/Kif5 Interaction domain (Kif5-ID), crucial for binding to the motor protein Kif5B, impacting the protein's transport within cells (Cheng2016Disparate). The alternative splicing events are significant during retinal development, influencing the protein's role in neuronal morphogenesis (Cheng2016Disparate).

While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of FAT3 are not provided, the presence of these domains and motifs suggests a complex structure that facilitates its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Katoh2006Comparative; Cheng2016Disparate). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, although these are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The FAT3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the cadherin superfamily, which is involved in cell adhesion and interaction mechanisms. In healthy human cells, FAT3 plays a significant role in tissue morphogenesis by influencing cell adhesion and interaction, as well as participating in the Wnt signaling pathway (Nada2022Identification). The protein contains multiple cadherin repeat domains, a laminin G domain, and EGF-like Ca +2 binding domains, which are crucial for calcium binding and cell adhesion processes (Nada2022Identification).

FAT3 is highly expressed in the nervous system, where it affects neuronal morphology, indicating its role in neural development (Nada2022Identification). It is also expressed in intervertebral discs and vertebral bone, suggesting a role in skeletal morphogenesis (Nada2022Identification). In zebrafish models, FAT3 is involved in cartilage differentiation and polarity during craniofacial development, working in conjunction with other proteins like Dchs2 and REREa to regulate chondrocyte stacking and differentiation (Le2014FatDachsous). These functions highlight FAT3's importance in maintaining cellular architecture and contributing to the development and organization of tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FAT3 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), FAT3 has been identified as a candidate gene. Studies have found an enrichment of rare, potentially protein-altering variants in FAT3 among AIS patients, particularly in those with severe scoliosis. Specific variants, such as rs139595720 and rs80293525, are more prevalent in severe cases, suggesting a potential role in the development or progression of AIS (Nada2022Identification).

FAT3 is also involved in neurodevelopmental disorders. It is part of the cadherin family, which is crucial for synapse connectivity and neural circuit formation. Mutations in cadherin family genes, including FAT3, have been linked to psychiatric and developmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Okajima2020Atypical). In microglial cells, FAT3 regulates morphology and is influenced by hypoxanthine, a compound associated with hypoxic conditions at birth and linked to ASD (Okajima2020Atypical).

In neurodegenerative diseases, FAT3 downregulation has been observed in mouse models of Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), correlating with neurodegeneration and autophagy defects (Baron2019Fat). However, conditional knockout of FAT3 in adult mouse brains did not result in neurodegeneration, indicating a complex interaction between FAT3 and neurodegenerative processes (Baron2019Fat).

## Interactions
FAT3 (FAT atypical cadherin 3) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neural development. One significant interaction is with the kinesin motor protein Kif5B. FAT3 contains a conserved Kif5-Interaction domain (Kif5-ID) that facilitates its binding to Kif5B, which is essential for the transport of FAT3 to specific cellular locations. This interaction is regulated by alternative splicing, which can alter the Kif5-ID and affect FAT3's cellular localization (Cheng2016Disparate).

FAT3 also interacts with actin regulators from the Ena/VASP family, including VASP, EVL, and Mena. These interactions occur through EVH1 binding sites in the intracellular domain of FAT3, which are crucial for recruiting these proteins to specific cellular locations. This binding influences the cytoskeletal organization and is important for the development of retinal amacrine cells (Krol2016Fat3).

The interaction between FAT3 and these proteins highlights its role in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular transport, contributing to the development of neuronal polarity and morphology (Krol2016Fat3; Cheng2016Disparate).
