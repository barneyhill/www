# CXCL1

## Overview
CXCL1 is a gene that encodes the protein C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1, a member of the CXC chemokine family. This protein is a chemokine, a type of signaling molecule that plays a crucial role in immune responses by mediating the recruitment and activation of neutrophils. CXCL1 is characterized by its ability to exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with each form having distinct functional implications. The protein interacts primarily with the CXCR2 receptor, facilitating various cellular processes such as angiogenesis, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation, and endothelial cell migration. CXCL1 is also involved in the activation of signaling pathways like ERK1/2, which are essential for cellular proliferation and development. Clinically, alterations in CXCL1 expression are associated with several cancers and inflammatory diseases, highlighting its significance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Sawant2016Chemokine; Filipovic2007The; Korbecki2024The).

## Structure
The CXCL1 protein, also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1, is characterized by its ability to exist in equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms. The primary structure of CXCL1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which includes a highly conserved N-terminal ELR motif crucial for receptor activation (Sawant2016Chemokine). The secondary structure of the monomeric subunit includes an extended N-loop, a turn of a 3_10 helix, three β-strands, and a C-terminal α-helix (Poluri2013Molecular).

The tertiary structure of CXCL1 involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, stabilized by disulfide linkages. The quaternary structure is defined by the dimerization of CXCL1, with intermolecular disulfide linkages (Cys-28-Cys-28') across the dimer interface (Poluri2013Molecular). The electrostatic surface analysis reveals that the β-sheet face is negatively charged, while the helical face is positively charged, which is significant for its interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (Poluri2013Molecular).

CXCL1 interacts with GAGs through specific lysine and arginine residues located in two non-overlapping domains, which are crucial for forming chemotactic gradients and guiding neutrophil migration (Sawant2016Chemokine). These interactions enhance the structural integrity and stability of the dimer (Poluri2013Molecular).

## Function
CXCL1, a member of the CXC chemokine family, plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the human fetal brain. CXCL1 promotes OPC proliferation indirectly through astrocytes, which release interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon CXCL1 stimulation. This process is crucial for the development and maintenance of oligodendrocytes, although CXCL1 does not directly influence their differentiation (Filipovic2007The).

In endothelial cells, CXCL1 is crucial for angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. It sustains cellular viability and promotes endothelial cell migration and proliferation. CXCL1 achieves these effects through the CXCR2 receptor and the activation of the ERK1/2 and EGF pathways. This chemokine is essential for endothelial cell behavior, influencing processes like wound healing and tissue regeneration (Miyake2013Expression).

CXCL1 is also involved in the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is necessary for OPC proliferation. This activation occurs primarily in astrocytes and is crucial for the proliferation of OPCs, highlighting CXCL1's role in brain development (Filipovic2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL1 gene are implicated in various cancers and inflammatory diseases. In lung cancer, CXCL1 expression is elevated in atypical lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although some studies report decreased expression in NSCLC. Factors such as smoking, air pollution, and chronic inflammation are linked to increased CXCL1 expression, contributing to cancer onset and progression (Korbecki2024The). In pancreatic cancer, CXCL1 expression is upregulated due to KRAS mutations and interactions with the tumor microenvironment, influencing tumor progression and metastasis (Korbecki2023The).

In malignant melanoma, CXCL1 expression is significantly higher compared to healthy skin, promoting cell proliferation and migration, and is associated with resistance to chemotherapy (Korbecki2024The). In colorectal cancer, CXCL1 acts as a hub gene, facilitating cancer cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis, particularly to the liver (Korbecki2023The).

CXCL1 is also involved in inflammatory bowel diseases, with elevated levels observed in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, contributing to the inflammatory response and tissue damage (Korbecki2022The). In ovarian cancer, CXCL1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, playing a role in metastasis (Korbecki2023Involvement).

## Interactions
CXCL1 interacts primarily with the CXCR2 receptor, playing a significant role in neutrophil recruitment and activation. This interaction is crucial for the chemokine's function in immune responses, as CXCL1 acts as a potent agonist for CXCR2, facilitating the influx of extracellular calcium in neutrophils and CXCR2-expressing cells (Rajarathnam2019How). CXCL1 can exist in both monomeric and dimeric forms, with each form having distinct interactions and functional implications. The dimer form of CXCL1 has a higher affinity for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are present on cell surfaces and the extracellular matrix. This interaction with GAGs is important for forming chemotactic gradients that guide neutrophil migration (Rajarathnam2019How; Sawant2016Chemokine).

The binding of CXCL1 to GAGs also influences its receptor activity. While the dimer form binds GAGs with higher affinity, it is the monomeric form that is more active at lower concentrations in receptor activation assays (Sawant2016Chemokine). The interaction with GAGs not only affects CXCL1's localization and stability but also modulates its ability to activate CXCR2, highlighting the complex regulatory mechanisms governing CXCL1's role in immune responses (Sawant2016Chemokine).
