# TARS3

## Overview
TARS3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme threonyl-tRNA synthetase 3, which is a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family. This enzyme is pivotal in the process of protein synthesis, as it catalyzes the attachment of the amino acid threonine to its corresponding tRNA, a critical step in translating genetic information into functional proteins. Threonyl-tRNA synthetase 3 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. The gene exhibits tissue-specific expression, with notable upregulation in the brain, spinal cord, muscle, and heart, reflecting its significant role in meeting the protein synthesis demands of these tissues. Dysregulation or mutations in TARS3 have been implicated in various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer, underscoring its importance in cellular function and organismal health (Anisimova2023Human).

## Function
The TARS3 gene encodes threonyl-tRNA synthetase 3, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of threonine to its corresponding tRNA. This process is essential for the accurate translation of the genetic code into proteins, ensuring proper cellular function and organismal development. TARS3 is particularly active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining protein homeostasis within cells (Anisimova2023Human).

In human tissues, TARS3 is notably upregulated in the brain, spinal cord, muscle, and heart, suggesting its significant role in these tissues' protein synthesis demands. This upregulation is consistent with the high abundance of threonyl-tRNA synthetase observed in muscle and heart tissues in mice, indicating a conserved function across species (Anisimova2023Human). The efficient transcription of TARS3 in the brain and muscles, as indicated by data from GTEx and FANTOM, underscores its importance in supporting the specific functional demands of these tissues (Anisimova2023Human).

The differential expression of TARS3 and other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases across various tissues highlights the complex regulation of the translation machinery in human cells, contributing to the diverse translational landscapes observed in different tissues (Anisimova2023Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation in the TARS3 gene can lead to various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer. Altered expression or interactions of TARS3 may disrupt protein homeostasis, contributing to disease pathogenesis. In neurodevelopmental disorders, mutations in TARS3 can impair the proper synthesis of proteins by affecting the attachment of threonine to its corresponding tRNA, which is crucial for normal brain development and function. This disruption can lead to developmental delays and other neurological symptoms. In cancer, dysregulation of TARS3 expression or its interactions can contribute to the uncontrolled growth and proliferation of cells. The precise mechanisms by which TARS3 mutations or dysregulation lead to these conditions are still under investigation, but they highlight the critical role of TARS3 in maintaining cellular and protein homeostasis. Understanding these pathways may offer potential therapeutic targets for treating diseases associated with TARS3 abnormalities.
