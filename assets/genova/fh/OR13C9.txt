# OR13C9

## Overview
The OR13C9 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 13 subfamily C member 9, a protein that is part of the extensive family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are integral to the olfactory system, playing a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. The OR13C9 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, which facilitates its function in signal transduction across the cell membrane. As a member of the olfactory receptor family, OR13C9 is involved in the initial molecular interactions that lead to the perception of smell. The protein's function and stability are influenced by post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are common regulatory mechanisms in GPCRs (Cheng2017The; Dehghani2021A).

## Structure
The OR13C9 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which belongs to the class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs. The primary structure of the OR13C9 protein consists of amino acid sequences that form alpha-helices in the secondary structure. These helices are organized into a three-dimensional conformation, representing the tertiary structure of the protein. Olfactory receptors, including OR13C9, generally do not form quaternary structures (Cheng2017The; Dehghani2021A).

Post-translational modifications of olfactory receptors like OR13C9 may include glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence the protein's function and stability. These modifications are common in GPCRs and play a role in receptor signaling and regulation (Cheng2017The).

The OR13C9 protein is involved in the detection of odor molecules, contributing to the sense of smell. While specific details about splice variant isoforms of OR13C9 are not provided, olfactory receptors typically exhibit a high degree of variability, which may include alternative splicing (Dehghani2021A).
