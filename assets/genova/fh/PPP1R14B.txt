# PPP1R14B

## Overview
PPP1R14B is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 14B, a member of the CPI-17 family of proteins. This protein functions primarily as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase, and plays a critical role in regulating smooth muscle contractility by modulating the activity of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) (Casamayor2020Controlling; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). The PPP1R14B protein is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular signaling pathways and phosphorylation states (Casamayor2020Controlling). Its interactions with other proteins, such as ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27A) and protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunits, underscore its involvement in cellular processes, including cancer progression and drug resistance (Liao2022Protein). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its significance in clinical outcomes and potential as a therapeutic target (Zhao2023Development; Deng2021PPP1R14B).

## Function
PPP1R14B, also known as PHI-1, is a protein that functions as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a serine/threonine-specific phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PPP1R14B plays a crucial role in regulating smooth muscle contractility by inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) upon phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC). This regulatory mechanism is essential for controlling smooth muscle contraction, which is hormonally regulated and vital for maintaining vascular tone and blood pressure (Casamayor2020Controlling; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

PPP1R14B is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with the highest levels in the skin, appendix, placenta, colon, and esophagus. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates phosphorylation states and cellular signaling pathways (Casamayor2020Controlling). The protein is also involved in cellular homeostasis, particularly in endothelial and epithelial cell functions, by targeting PP1 to phosphorylated sites, thus influencing muscle contraction and focal adhesions (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

Defects in the PPP1R14 family, including PPP1R14B, have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions (Casamayor2020Controlling).

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R14B gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and genetic mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PPP1R14B is significantly overexpressed, correlating with worse survival outcomes, advanced tumor stages, and higher tumor grades. Its expression is linked to immune status and response to therapies, suggesting a role in cancer initiation and progression (Zhao2023Development). In a pan-cancer analysis, high PPP1R14B expression is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma, mesothelioma, and melanoma. Genetic alterations, particularly amplifications, are observed in several cancers, including bladder and pancreatic cancers, contributing to increased mRNA expression and poor clinical outcomes (Deng2021PPP1R14B).

The gene's expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which promote tumor progression and suppress immune responses (Deng2021PPP1R14B). Additionally, miR-194, a tumor suppressor, targets PPP1R14B, inhibiting its expression and reducing cell proliferation in gastrointestinal cancers, highlighting its oncogenic role (Huang2022Genomewide). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PPP1R14B in cancer prognosis and treatment strategies.

## Interactions
PPP1R14B, also known as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 14B, interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), PPP1R14B forms a complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) catalytic subunits PP1a and PP1g, which is crucial for the phosphorylation and stabilization of the protein STMN1. This interaction is essential for the regulation of STMN1 at specific serine sites, impacting cancer progression and drug resistance (Liao2022Protein).

PPP1R14B also interacts with ribosomal protein S27a (RPS27A), which stabilizes PPP1R14B at the posttranscriptional level. RPS27A recruits the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X to prevent the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of PPP1R14B, leading to its overexpression in TNBC tissues. This interaction is significant for the stability and function of PPP1R14B, influencing TNBC cell proliferation and metastasis (Liao2022Protein).

In addition to these interactions, PPP1R14B is associated with the CPI-17 family and is involved in regulating smooth muscle contraction and modulating endothelial and epithelial cell functions. It targets PPP1CB to phosphorylated sites, suggesting its involvement in cellular signaling pathways (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).
