# RSBN1

## Overview
RSBN1, or round spermatid basic protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, particularly during spermatogenesis. The RSBN1 protein functions as a lysine demethylase, specifically targeting histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20) to convert its trimethylated and dimethylated forms to monomethylated H4K20. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining genome integrity, as it plays a significant role in DNA damage repair and telomere length regulation. RSBN1 is predominantly localized in the nucleus of germ cells, especially in round and elongated spermatids, where it contributes to meiotic and post-meiotic progression. Beyond its role in spermatogenesis, RSBN1 is expressed in various tissues, with notable levels in the testis and brain, and is implicated in broader epigenetic regulation and chromatin structure modulation. Its interactions with proteins involved in histone modification and RNA splicing further underscore its importance in cellular biosynthetic processes (Lobo‐Alves2019Region; Pina2022Polypyrimidine; Wang2021Comparative).

## Structure


## Function
RSBN1 (round spermatid basic protein 1) is involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation during spermatogenesis. It functions as a demethylase for histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20), specifically converting trimethylated and dimethylated H4K20 to monomethylated H4K20. This activity is crucial for maintaining genome integrity during spermatogenesis, as it regulates DNA damage repair and telomere length (Wang2021Comparative). RSBN1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of germ cells, particularly in round and elongated spermatids, where it plays a role in meiotic and post-meiotic progression (Wang2021Comparative).

The gene is expressed in various tissues, with high levels in the testis and brain, and moderate levels in the heart, lung, liver, and ovary (Wang2021Comparative). Although its function in healthy human cells is not fully understood, RSBN1 is speculated to be involved in epigenetic regulation, potentially influencing chromatin structure and transcriptional activity (Lobo‐Alves2019Region). Its role in hypoxia response, particularly in the context of breast cancer, has been suggested but not confirmed (AbuJamous2017In).

## Clinical Significance
The RSBN1 gene has been implicated in several conditions, although its direct role in specific diseases is not fully established. In the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoporosis (OP), RSBN1 is located in the 1p13.2 region, which has been identified as significant in regulating these conditions. The gene is part of a locus that includes other genes like PTPN22 and PHTF1, which are associated with RA and bone mineral density (BMD) (Liu2021Identification). 

RSBN1 has also been suggested to play a role in the hypoxia response in breast cancer. It is identified as a potential target of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and is induced under hypoxic conditions, indicating a possible involvement in breast cancer progression (AbuJamous2017In). 

In cancer progression, RSBN1 expression is noted to decrease as cancer advances, with lower expression levels in late-stage cancers compared to early-stage cancers and normal tissue. This pattern suggests that RSBN1 may be downregulated during cancer progression, although specific diseases linked to its mutations or expression changes are not detailed (Li2017Transcriptional).

## Interactions
RSBN1, also known as round spermatid basic protein 1, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in histone modification and chromatin biology. RSBN1 has been identified as a lysine demethylase that interacts with histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20), specifically demethylating H4K20me3 and H4K20me2 to H4K20me1. This activity is crucial during mouse spermatogenesis, where RSBN1 is localized in the heterochromatic regions of round spermatids (Wang2021Comparative).

RSBN1 also interacts with polypyrimidine tract binding protein PTBP2, a protein involved in splicing conditions. This interaction suggests a role for RSBN1 in histone modification processes linked to RNA splicing and cellular biosynthetic processes (Pina2022Polypyrimidine).

In addition, RSBN1 is enriched in interactions with Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) proteins, particularly CHD1-3 and CHD8. These interactions are significant for nucleosome remodeling and DNA replication, as RSBN1 acts as a demethylase on the histone mark H4K20me2, which is involved in recruiting the origin recognition complex for DNA replication initiation (Tabar2024Intrinsically). These interactions highlight RSBN1's role in chromatin organization and gene expression regulation.
