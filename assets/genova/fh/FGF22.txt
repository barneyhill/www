# FGF22

## Overview
FGF22, or fibroblast growth factor 22, is a gene that encodes a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, which is involved in a variety of biological processes including development, cell growth, and tissue repair. The protein product, fibroblast growth factor 22, is categorized as a growth factor and plays a pivotal role in the nervous system, particularly in the formation and maturation of synapses. It functions as a presynaptic organizer, crucial for the differentiation of excitatory synapses, and is involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle clustering, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic function. FGF22 interacts with specific receptors such as FGFR1 and FGFR2, facilitating synaptic maturation and recovery after neural injury. Additionally, it is implicated in auditory and visual system development, with its dysfunction linked to conditions such as hidden hearing loss and impaired retinal nerve terminal formation (Terauchi2010Distinct; Singh2012Fibroblast; Hou2022FGF22).

## Function
FGF22 (fibroblast growth factor 22) is a critical protein involved in the development and maintenance of the nervous system, particularly in synapse formation and maturation. It acts as a presynaptic organizer, promoting the differentiation of excitatory synapses, especially in the hippocampal CA3 region. FGF22 is expressed by CA3 pyramidal neurons and is essential for the proper clustering of synaptic vesicles, which is crucial for neurotransmitter release and synaptic function (Terauchi2010Distinct).

FGF22 signaling is mediated through its interaction with specific receptors, FGFR1 and FGFR2, which are expressed by projection neurons in the motor cortex and along corticospinal tract axons. This signaling is vital for synapse maturation and functional recovery after spinal cord injury, highlighting its role in circuit remodeling and motor function recovery (Jacobi2015FGF).

In the auditory system, FGF22 is involved in maintaining the function of inner hair cell ribbon synapses. Its deletion leads to hidden hearing loss by affecting synaptic vesicle function and calcium-triggered exocytosis, indicating its importance in auditory signal transmission (Hou2022FGF22). FGF22 also regulates insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) expression, which is crucial for synapse stabilization in an activity-dependent manner (Terauchi2016Retrograde).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the FGF22 gene have been linked to several neurological and auditory conditions. FGF22 plays a critical role in the function of inner hair cell (IHC) ribbon synapses, which are essential for auditory signal transmission. Deletion of FGF22 in mice leads to hidden hearing loss, characterized by a decrease in wave I amplitude of auditory brainstem responses, despite normal hearing thresholds and latency. This condition is associated with a reduction in synaptic vesicles at ribbon synapses and decreased efficiency of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis, which affects neurotransmitter release (Hou2022FGF22).

FGF22 is also involved in the development of retinal nerve terminals. In FGF22 knockout mice, there is an impairment in the formation and maturation of retinal nerve terminals in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, indicating its importance in synaptic organization. This suggests that FGF22 is crucial for the differentiation of retinal axons into presynaptic terminals during retinogeniculate synapse formation (Singh2012Fibroblast).

Additionally, FGF22 signaling is important for synapse formation and recovery after spinal cord injury. Disruption of FGF22 signaling impairs synapse formation and maturation, leading to delayed recovery of motor function post-injury (Jacobi2015FGF).

## Interactions
FGF22 interacts with several proteins that facilitate its synaptic targeting and function. It preferentially moves with the scaffolding protein SAP102, which acts as an adaptor for its transport to excitatory synapses. This interaction is crucial for the synaptic localization of FGF22, as silencing SAP102 results in a diffuse distribution of FGF22, indicating its importance in the synaptic targeting process (Terauchi2014Selective). FGF22 also colocalizes with PSD95, another scaffolding protein at excitatory synapses, suggesting a physical interaction that supports its role in synaptic differentiation (Terauchi2014Selective).

The transport of FGF22 to synapses involves motor proteins KIF3A and KIF17, which are essential for its excitatory synaptic targeting. Disruption of these motor proteins reduces the presence of FGF22 puncta in neurons, highlighting their role in FGF22 transport (Terauchi2014Selective). Additionally, FGF22 signaling regulates the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), which is involved in the stabilization of presynaptic terminals, although the direct physical interactions between FGF22 and IGF2 are not detailed (Terauchi2016Retrograde). These interactions underscore the complex network of proteins that FGF22 engages with to fulfill its role in synaptic development and function.
