# SLC15A5

## Overview
SLC15A5 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 15 member 5, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family of transporters. This family is known for its role in facilitating the transport of peptides and other molecules across cellular membranes. The SLC15A5 protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter, playing a significant role in various cellular processes, including nutrient absorption, neurotransmitter regulation, and cellular signaling. By mediating peptide transport, SLC15A5 is essential for maintaining cellular metabolism and homeostasis, influencing both intracellular and extracellular peptide concentrations. The study of SLC15A5 is ongoing, with research focusing on its specific substrates, transport dynamics, and potential implications in disease states, which could inform future therapeutic strategies targeting peptide transport dysfunctions (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
SLC15A5 is a member of the solute carrier family, which is involved in the transport of peptides and other molecules across cellular membranes. This protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as nutrient absorption, neurotransmitter regulation, and cellular signaling. SLC15A5 is believed to facilitate peptide transport, which is essential for maintaining cellular metabolism and homeostasis. By transporting peptides, SLC15A5 contributes to the regulation of intracellular and extracellular peptide concentrations, impacting various metabolic pathways and signaling cascades. The activity of SLC15A5 is integral to the proper functioning of cells, influencing processes that are vital for the organism's overall health and stability. The precise mechanisms by which SLC15A5 operates within the cell, including its specific substrates and transport dynamics, remain areas of active research. Understanding the function of SLC15A5 in healthy human cells is important for elucidating its potential roles in disease states and for developing therapeutic strategies targeting peptide transport dysfunctions.
