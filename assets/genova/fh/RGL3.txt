# RGL3

## Overview
RGL3 is a gene that encodes the protein ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator like 3, which is a member of the RalGDS family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). This protein plays a critical role in cellular signaling by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ral GTPases, thereby influencing various cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell proliferation (Gentry2014Ral; Ferro2010RalGDS). RGL3 is characterized by its domain architecture, which includes a CDC25 homology domain, a Ras Exchange Motif (REM), and a Ras/Rap Binding Domain (RBD), enabling it to mediate interactions with Ras and Ras-related proteins (Ferro2010RalGDS). The gene has been associated with physiological processes such as blood pressure regulation and neurogenesis, particularly in the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (Toledo2017Molecular; Hujoel2023Hidden).

## Structure
The RGL3 protein, a member of the RalGDS family, shares a common domain architecture with other family members. It contains a central CDC25 homology domain, an upstream Ras Exchange Motif (REM), and a C-terminal Ras/Rap Binding Domain (RBD) (Gentry2014Ral; Ferro2010RalGDS). The CDC25 homology domain functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways (Ferro2010RalGDS). The REM domain is necessary for maintaining the conformation of the catalytic domain and may be involved in regulatory phosphorylation (Ferro2010RalGDS). The RBD mediates GTP-dependent interactions with Ras and Ras-related proteins, allowing RGL3 to mediate cross-talk between small G proteins (Ferro2010RalGDS).

The RBD is highly conserved among RalGDS family members and assumes an ubiquitin-like conformation with a ββαββαβ-type tertiary structure, similar to the Ras effector Raf (Ferro2010RalGDS). While specific post-translational modifications for RGL3 are not detailed, phosphorylation by kinases such as PKA and PKC is a common regulatory mechanism within the RalGDS family (Ferro2010RalGDS). However, RGL3 does not share the PKA phosphorylation site found in RGL2 (Ferro2010RalGDS). Information on primary, secondary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, is not provided in the available context.

## Function
The RGL3 gene encodes a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Ral family of GTPases, which are involved in various cellular processes such as vesicle trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell proliferation. RGL3 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in modulating signal transduction pathways that influence cell growth and differentiation. In the context of blood pressure regulation, a low-frequency deletion in exon 6 of the RGL3 gene is associated with lower blood pressure and decreased hypertension risk. This deletion results in a loss of function effect, suggesting that RGL3 is involved in maintaining normal blood pressure levels. The deletion causes splicing into a novel splice acceptor, leading to an inframe substitution in the protein sequence. Despite this alteration, individuals homozygous for the deletion appear to be generally healthy, indicating that RGL3 knockout might be well-tolerated (Hujoel2024Proteinaltering; Hujoel2023Hidden). The RGL3 gene is also implicated in the development of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, where it contributes to signaling pathways in the ventral midbrain during neurogenesis, particularly through the Wnt signaling pathway (Toledo2017Molecular).
