# ZNF287

## Overview
ZNF287 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 287, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by C2H2-type zinc finger domains. These domains are integral to the protein's ability to bind DNA, thereby playing a crucial role in gene regulation. Zinc finger protein 287 is involved in various cellular processes, potentially including transcriptional regulation, due to its structural features that allow specific DNA interactions. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can modulate its function and interactions with other cellular components. ZNF287 has been implicated in Smith-Magenis syndrome, a developmental disorder, highlighting its clinical significance. Additionally, the gene's potential involvement in cancer biology and stem cell pluripotency underscores its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Collins2001All; Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

## Structure
ZNF287 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. The primary structure of ZNF287 consists of amino acid sequences that form these zinc finger domains, enabling specific interactions with DNA sequences. The secondary structure of ZNF287 typically includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the stability and functionality of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a stable three-dimensional conformation, essential for its biological activity.

Zinc finger proteins like ZNF287 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence their function and interactions with other molecules. These modifications can play a role in regulating the protein's activity and its involvement in various cellular processes. Additionally, ZNF287 may have splice variant isoforms, resulting in different protein versions with potentially distinct functions. These isoforms can arise from alternative splicing events, allowing the protein to participate in diverse cellular pathways and regulatory mechanisms. The structural versatility and modifications of ZNF287 underscore its importance in gene regulation and cellular function.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF287 is associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, sleep disturbances, and distinctive facial features. This association arises from a deletion involving ZNF287, suggesting its potential clinical significance in the syndrome (Collins2001All). Although the specific clinical implications of ZNF287 expression alterations are not fully detailed, its involvement in Smith-Magenis syndrome highlights the importance of maintaining proper ZNF287 function and expression levels.

The SCAN domain of ZNF287, which facilitates dimerization among SCAN family members, is not directly linked to transcriptional activation or repression. However, the clustering of SCAN family genes in regions associated with cytogenetic abnormalities suggests a potential link to tumor suppressor genes, indicating that alterations in ZNF287 could have broader implications in cancer biology (Collins2001All).

While ZNF287 is part of the broader investigation into KRAB-ZNF expression in stem cells, its specific role in pluripotency and differentiation remains unclear. The study of KRAB-ZNFs, including ZNF287, in stem cells suggests a potential role in maintaining pluripotency, but direct clinical implications are not specified (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).
