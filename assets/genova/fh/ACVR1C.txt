# ACVR1C

## Overview
ACVR1C is a gene that encodes the activin A receptor type 1C, also known as ALK7, which is a type I receptor in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in mediating cellular responses to specific ligands, such as Nodal, Activin A/B, and GDF3, through the activation of SMAD signaling pathways (Asnaghi2018ACVR1CSMAD2). ALK7 is predominantly expressed in endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues, including the pancreas and adipose tissue, where it plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic processes such as insulin secretion and lipid metabolism (Ibáñez2021Regulation). The receptor's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and its potential implications in metabolic disorders and cancer (Ibáñez2021Regulation; Asnaghi2018ACVR1CSMAD2). Variants in the ACVR1C gene have been associated with conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and type 2 diabetes, highlighting its clinical relevance (Emdin2018DNA).

## Function
The ACVR1C gene encodes the ALK7 protein, a type I receptor in the TGF-β superfamily, which plays a significant role in various cellular and physiological processes. ALK7 is predominantly expressed in endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues, including the pancreas, adipose tissue, and certain brain regions (Ibáñez2021Regulation). In the pancreas, ALK7 is involved in regulating insulin secretion and β-cell function, where it negatively regulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, maintaining metabolic homeostasis (Ibáñez2021Regulation).

In adipose tissue, ALK7 is crucial for regulating energy storage and lipid metabolism. It is expressed in mature adipocytes and influences adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation (Ibáñez2021Regulation). ALK7 signaling affects lipolysis and catecholamine sensitivity, acting as a negative regulator of catecholamine sensitivity and β3-adrenergic signaling, which impacts fat mobilization (Ibáñez2021Regulation).

ALK7 also plays a role in brown adipose tissue, where it regulates lipid metabolism and energy expenditure, particularly under nutrient stress conditions (Ibáñez2021Regulation). Variants in the ACVR1C gene have been associated with altered body fat distribution and a protective role against type 2 diabetes, suggesting its involvement in metabolic regulation (Ibáñez2021Regulation; Emdin2018DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACVR1C gene, which encodes the ALK7 receptor, have been associated with several metabolic and reproductive conditions. In humans, variants in ACVR1C are linked to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), characterized by reproductive and metabolic defects such as abnormal estrous cyclicity, ovulatory dysfunction, and insulin resistance (Ibáñez2021Regulation). Additionally, genetic variants in ACVR1C have been found to influence body fat distribution and provide protection against type 2 diabetes. Specific variants, such as Asn150His, Ile195Thr, Ile482Val, and rs72927479, are associated with a lower waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (Emdin2018DNA).

In the context of cancer, ACVR1C/SMAD2 signaling has been implicated in the invasiveness and growth of retinoblastoma, a type of eye cancer. Elevated ACVR1C expression and activation of its signaling pathway have been observed in invasive retinoblastoma cases, suggesting a role in promoting tumor progression (Asnaghi2018ACVR1CSMAD2). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ACVR1C in various diseases, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for conditions like obesity, metabolic syndrome, and certain cancers.

## Interactions
ACVR1C, also known as activin A receptor type 1C, is a type I receptor of the TGF-β family that participates in several key interactions with other proteins. It primarily interacts with ligands such as Nodal, Activin A/B, and GDF3. These interactions lead to the activation of downstream SMAD signaling, particularly the phosphorylation of SMAD2, which is a main effector of the Nodal/TGF-β pathway (Asnaghi2018ACVR1CSMAD2). 

The ACVR1C receptor forms complexes with type II receptors, facilitating the phosphorylation and activation of SMAD proteins. This process is crucial for regulating cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation (Asnaghi2018ACVR1CSMAD2). In the context of retinoblastoma, ACVR1C signaling has been shown to promote tumor invasion and growth, with increased mRNA levels of ACVR1C observed in invasive retinoblastoma cells. Inhibition of ACVR1C signaling, either pharmacologically or genetically, has been demonstrated to suppress invasion, growth, and survival of retinoblastoma cells (Asnaghi2018ACVR1CSMAD2).

The ACVR1C/SMAD2 pathway is also involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as evidenced by the reduction of mesenchymal markers ZEB1 and Snail upon inhibition of ACVR1C signaling (Asnaghi2018ACVR1CSMAD2).
