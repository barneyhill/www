# UROC1

## Overview
The UROC1 gene encodes the enzyme urocanate hydratase 1, commonly referred to as urocanase, which is a hydratase enzyme involved in the catabolic pathway of the amino acid histidine. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of urocanic acid to 4-imidazolone-5-propionic acid, a critical step in histidine degradation that ultimately contributes to the production of glutamate, an amino acid essential for various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of folate metabolites (Espinos2009Mutations). Urocanase is primarily expressed in the liver, where it plays a significant role in maintaining nitrogen balance and energy production (Glinton2019Untargeted). Mutations in the UROC1 gene can lead to metabolic disorders such as urocanic aciduria, characterized by elevated levels of urocanic acid in the urine and associated with neurological symptoms (YOSHIDA1971Urocanic; Kalafatic1980A). The study of UROC1 and its encoded enzyme provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying histidine metabolism and its broader implications for human health.

## Structure
The UROC1 gene encodes the enzyme urocanase, which plays a role in the metabolism of urocanic acid. The molecular structure of the UROC1 protein includes an alpha-helix spanning residues 63 to 70. This structural feature is significant as mutations in this region, such as p.L70P, can disrupt the α-helix, affecting the enzyme's solubility and function (Espinos2009Mutations).

The enzyme's tertiary structure is crucial for its activity, particularly the residue R450, which is essential for forming a salt bridge with the substrate urocanate. The p.R450C mutation disrupts this interaction, leading to a loss of enzymatic activity. This residue is highly conserved across species, underscoring its importance in the enzyme's function (Espinos2009Mutations).

The study of the UROC1 protein also involved using the structure of urocanase from Pseudomonas putida as a reference for understanding the impact of mutations on the enzyme's function. This comparative analysis highlights the evolutionary conservation of key structural elements necessary for enzymatic activity (Espinos2009Mutations). The potential role of urocanase in folate metabolism through the histidine catabolic pathway is also noted, which may relate to observed metabolic deficiencies (Espinos2009Mutations).

## Function
The UROC1 gene encodes the enzyme urocanase, also known as urocanate hydratase, which plays a critical role in the catabolism of the amino acid histidine. In healthy human cells, urocanase catalyzes the conversion of urocanic acid to 4-imidazolone-5-propionic acid, a key step in the histidine degradation pathway (Espinos2009Mutations). This pathway is essential for the production of glutamate, an important amino acid involved in various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of folate metabolites crucial for DNA synthesis and repair (Espinos2009Mutations).

Urocanase activity is primarily localized in the liver, where it contributes to maintaining nitrogen balance and energy production within cells (Glinton2019Untargeted). The enzyme's function is vital for preventing the accumulation of urocanic acid, which can lead to metabolic disorders such as urocanic aciduria if not properly metabolized (YOSHIDA1971Urocanic; Kalafatic1980A). The UROC1 gene is located on chromosome 3q21 and is almost exclusively expressed in the liver, highlighting its specific role in hepatic histidine metabolism (Glinton2019Untargeted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UROC1 gene, which encodes the enzyme urocanate hydratase, are associated with urocanic aciduria, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of urocanic acid in the urine. This condition can lead to neurological symptoms such as mental retardation and intermittent ataxia. The study identified two specific missense mutations, p.L70P and p.R450C, in a patient with persistent urocanic aciduria and mental retardation, suggesting a diagnosis of urocanase deficiency (Espinos2009Mutations).

The p.L70P mutation is believed to disrupt an α-helix in the N-terminus of the enzyme, altering its properties and leading to protein aggregation, as it was only detected in the pellet fraction during protein expression analysis (Espinos2009Mutations). The p.R450C mutation, which is highly conserved across species, affects the binding of urocanate to urocanase, resulting in a loss of enzyme activity. This mutation is predicted to be pathogenic and is considered crucial for enzymatic activity (Espinos2009Mutations).

Urocanase deficiency, first reported in 1971, is linked to impaired histidine catabolism and has been associated with neurological symptoms. However, it has also been considered a benign condition in some cases (Espinos2009Mutations). The study also noted a partial cerebral folate deficiency in the patient, potentially linked to impaired pterin and biogenic amines status in cerebrospinal fluid, as urocanase is involved in folate metabolite synthesis through the histidine catabolic pathway (Espinos2009Mutations).
