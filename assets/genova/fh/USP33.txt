# USP33

## Overview
USP33 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 33, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various cellular processes. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, USP33 plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby influencing their stability and function. The protein is characterized by a zinc-finger ubiquitin binding motif and a catalytic domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Li2013USP33; Allen2007The). USP33 is implicated in centrosome biogenesis, mitophagy, and the modulation of signaling pathways, such as those involving β-arrestin and Robo1, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Li2013USP33; Wen2014USP33; Niu2019USP33). Dysregulation of USP33 has been associated with various cancers, where it can either promote or inhibit tumor progression depending on the context, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Liu2023USP33; Huang2014USP33).

## Structure
The molecular structure of USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, includes a zinc-finger ubiquitin binding motif and a catalytic domain, which are shared with its related enzyme USP20 (Li2013USP33). The ZnF UBP domain of USP33 is characterized by the presence of three zinc ions, which is distinct from the USP5 domain that contains only one zinc ion. This domain exhibits an aabbabbb secondary structure with antiparallel beta-strands and three bound zinc ions. The first zinc ion is coordinated by cystine and histidine residues, the second by cystine and histidine at the N terminus, and the third by histidines and cystines (Allen2007The).

Despite structural similarities with other ZnF UBP domains, the USP33 domain does not bind ubiquitin, likely due to differences in loop length and residue composition, such as the substitution of Arg 221 with glutamate, which affects hydrogen bonding with ubiquitin (Allen2007The). USP33 is also involved in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. The enzyme may exist in several isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Li2013USP33).

## Function
USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating various molecular processes. It is involved in centrosome biogenesis by deubiquitinating the centriolar protein CP110, which is essential for stabilizing CP110 levels during the cell cycle. This regulation prevents centrosome over-duplication and ensures proper cell cycle progression, thereby maintaining centrosome integrity and function in healthy human cells (Li2013USP33).

USP33 also interacts with PRKN (parkin), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to regulate mitophagy, a process crucial for the clearance of damaged mitochondria. By deubiquitinating PRKN, USP33 modulates PRKN activity and its substrate ubiquitination, impacting mitochondrial quality control and cellular homeostasis (Niu2019USP33).

In addition, USP33 is negatively regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, which affects its stability and function in inhibiting cell proliferation and invasion. This regulation highlights USP33's role as a tumor suppressor in healthy cells (Cheng2017Deubiquitinase).

## Clinical Significance
USP33 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in deubiquitinating proteins, which affects signaling pathways and cellular homeostasis. In pancreatic cancer, USP33 is upregulated, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Its interaction with TGFBR2 prevents lysosomal degradation, leading to sustained TGF-β signaling, which is crucial for cancer progression (Liu2023USP33). In prostate cancer, USP33 inhibits apoptosis and enhances cell viability, contributing to chemotherapy resistance. It stabilizes DUSP1, which dephosphorylates JNK, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (Guo2019Deubiquitinating).

In colorectal cancer, USP33 is downregulated, which correlates with increased cell migration and poor patient survival. It stabilizes Robo1, a receptor in the Slit-Robo signaling pathway, which inhibits cancer cell migration (Huang2014USP33). Similarly, in lung cancer, USP33 is downregulated, affecting Slit-Robo signaling and correlating with poor prognosis (Wen2014USP33). In gastric cancer, reduced USP33 expression decreases the inhibitory effects of Slit2-Robo1 signaling on cell migration and EMT, correlating with worse clinical outcomes (Xia2019Reduced). In hepatocellular carcinoma, USP33 is overexpressed, associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages (Gan2020USP33).

## Interactions
USP33, a deubiquitinating enzyme, interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It physically interacts with the centriolar protein CP110, stabilizing it through deubiquitination, which is crucial for centrosome biogenesis and duplication (Li2013USP33). USP33 also interacts with β-arrestin, a key player in G protein-coupled receptor signaling. It deubiquitinates β-arrestin, affecting its interaction with the β2 adrenergic receptor and modulating β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways (Shenoy2009βArrestindependent).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, USP33 interacts with the transcription factor SP1, enhancing its stability by deubiquitination. This interaction upregulates c-Met expression, facilitating cancer metastasis (Gan2020USP33). USP33 also interacts with PRKN (parkin), a protein involved in mitophagy. It deubiquitinates PRKN, modulating its activity and impacting mitochondrial quality control (Niu2019USP33).

In lung cancer, USP33 interacts with Robo1, a receptor involved in Slit-Robo signaling, stabilizing it by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction is important for inhibiting cancer cell migration (Wen2014USP33). These interactions highlight USP33's role in diverse cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.
