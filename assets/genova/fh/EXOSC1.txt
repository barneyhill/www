# EXOSC1

## Overview
EXOSC1 is a gene that encodes the protein exosome component 1, a crucial structural subunit of the RNA exosome complex. This complex is essential for RNA processing and degradation, functioning in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of human cells. The protein encoded by EXOSC1 is part of the cap structure of the exosome, forming a trimeric central pore with EXOSC2 and EXOSC3, which is vital for the stable assembly and function of the exosome. The RNA exosome plays a significant role in RNA quality control and gene expression regulation by facilitating the 3′-to-5′ processing or degradation of RNA substrates. EXOSC1 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with particularly high levels in the cerebellum, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular function and genomic stability (de2023Analysis; Fraga2020Posttranscriptional; Zinder2017Targeting).

## Structure
EXOSC1, also known as Csl4, is a structural component of the RNA exosome complex, which is crucial for RNA processing and degradation. The protein is part of the cap structure of the exosome, forming a trimeric central pore along with EXOSC2 and EXOSC3. This cap is essential for the stable assembly of the exosome's core and is involved in RNA binding through its S1 and KH domains (Sterrett2021A; Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

The primary structure of EXOSC1 includes an N-terminal domain and S1-KH RNA-binding domains, which are critical for its function in the exosome complex (Somashekar2021Bi‐allelic). The N-terminal domain is particularly significant as it is involved in the stable assembly of the exosome core (Somashekar2021Bi‐allelic).

In terms of tertiary and quaternary structure, EXOSC1 is part of a nine-subunit structural barrel that forms the exosome complex. This barrel is composed of an upper ring of three S1/KH cap subunits, including EXOSC1, and a lower ring of six PH-like subunits (Sterrett2021A). The interactions between these subunits are crucial for the exosome's function in processing and degrading various RNA targets (Sterrett2021A).

## Function
EXOSC1 is a structural subunit of the RNA exosome complex, a critical component in RNA processing and degradation in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of human cells. The RNA exosome is involved in the 3′-to-5′ processing or degradation of RNA substrates, playing a vital role in RNA quality control and gene expression regulation (Zinder2017Targeting). EXOSC1, along with EXOSC2 and EXOSC3, forms a trimeric central pore that caps the barrel-like structure of the exosome, facilitating RNA substrate processing by recruiting RNA and protein cofactors to the complex (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

In healthy human cells, EXOSC1 is ubiquitously expressed across tissues, with particularly high transcript levels in the cerebellum, indicating its essential role in maintaining cellular function in this region (de2023Analysis). The RNA exosome, including EXOSC1, is crucial for the degradation of AU-rich element (ARE)-containing RNAs, which are involved in maintaining redox potential and DNA damage response, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis and differentiation (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional). The exosome's involvement in telomerase regulation, through processing a poly(A)+ precursor of telomerase RNA (TERC), highlights its role in maintaining genomic stability (Fraga2020Posttranscriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXOSC1 gene have been associated with pontocerebellar hypoplasia, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by developmental delay, microcephaly, subtle dysmorphism, hypotonia, and delayed myelination. A specific bi-allelic missense variant, c.104C>T p.(Ser35Leu), has been identified in patients with this condition. This variant is thought to affect protein stability by leading to a loss of polar contact, which impacts the function of the RNA exosome complex (Somashekar2021Bi‐allelic).

EXOSC1 mutations are also linked to a broader class of diseases known as exosomopathies. These conditions are associated with a range of clinical symptoms, including hypoplastic cerebellum, cerebral atrophy, hyperextensibility of the skin, cardiomyopathy with reduced left ventricular ejection, and hypotonia. There have been reports of patients with EXOSC1 mutations experiencing severe outcomes, such as renal failure (de2023Analysis).

In the context of cancer, EXOSC1 has been identified as a 'harmful gene' in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), where its expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes. High expression levels of EXOSC1 correlate with decreased RNA levels and a higher number of downregulated genes, suggesting its role in influencing RNA processing and cell cycle regulation in MCL (Zhang2019Exosome).

## Interactions
EXOSC1, a component of the exosome complex, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is part of the exosome complex, a multi-protein assembly crucial for RNA processing and degradation. Within this complex, EXOSC1 interacts with other exosome components such as EXOSC2 and EXOSC3, forming a core structure that aids in the stable assembly of the exosome (Somashekar2021Bi‐allelic). 

EXOSC1 has been shown to cleave single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), particularly at cytosine sites, which can lead to C>A transversions. This activity is enhanced by the presence of K+ and Mg2+ ions and is optimal at pH 7.0. The cleavage activity of EXOSC1 is inhibited by other exosome members like EXOSC6, EXOSC7, and EXOSC8, indicating that its function can be modulated by interactions with these proteins (Xiao2021Exosome). 

EXOSC1 can also disassociate from the exosome complex, suggesting it may have functions independent of the complex. This disassociation allows EXOSC1 to act as an endogenous source of mutagenesis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), where it sensitizes cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (Xiao2021Exosome).
