# ATXN7

## Overview
The ATXN7 gene encodes the protein ataxin 7, which is a critical component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, a chromatin-modifying transcriptional coactivator. Ataxin 7 is involved in both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions, playing a significant role in transcription regulation and cytoskeletal stability. In the nucleus, it anchors the deubiquitinase module (DUBm) of the SAGA complex, influencing gene expression and chromatin modification. In the cytoplasm, ataxin 7 associates with microtubules, contributing to the maintenance of cytoskeletal integrity. Mutations in the ATXN7 gene, particularly expansions of the CAG trinucleotide repeat, are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia and retinal degeneration (CornelioParra2021Function; Goswami2022The).

## Structure
The ATXN7 protein is composed of 892 amino acids and features a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract starting at amino acid position 30, which is implicated in the pathology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) (Young2007Proteolytic). The protein contains a leucine-type nuclear export signal (NES) in its N terminus (positions 340-349) and nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in its C terminus (positions 705 and 835), facilitating its shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Young2007Proteolytic). A zinc-binding domain is located between amino acids 311 and 406, which is crucial for its interaction with the SAGA complex, a chromatin-modifying transcriptional coactivator (Young2007Proteolytic; Goswami2022The).

ATXN7 is a subunit of the SAGA complex, where it anchors the deubiquitinase module (DUBm) through its N-terminal residues, intertwining among the DUBm subunits (Goswami2022The). The protein is also associated with microtubules, with amino acids 120-400 being critical for binding to a-tubulin, contributing to cytoskeletal stability (Nakamura2011Ataxin7). Post-translational modifications, such as cleavage by caspase-7 at specific sites (amino acids 266 and 344), modulate its cellular toxicity and transcriptional dysregulation (Young2007Proteolytic).

## Function
The ATXN7 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of healthy human cells. In the nucleus, ATXN7 is a component of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex, where it is essential for anchoring the deubiquitinase module (DUBm) to the complex. This anchoring allows the DUBm to interact with nucleosomes, influencing gene expression and chromatin modification (CornelioParra2021Function). ATXN7's involvement in the SAGA complex is critical for maintaining balanced ubiquitination, which is necessary for nervous system homeostasis and normal mitochondrial function (CornelioParra2021Function).

In the cytoplasm, ATXN7 associates with microtubules (MTs) and contributes to the stabilization of the cytoskeletal network. This function is independent of the polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence of ATXN7 and is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton. ATXN7 protects MTs from degradation by nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting agent, and its knockdown leads to enhanced MT degradation (Nakamura2011Ataxin7). The dynamic distribution of ATXN7 between the nucleus and cytoplasm suggests its involvement in multiple cellular processes, including transcription regulation and cytoskeletal maintenance (Nakamura2011Ataxin7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATXN7 gene are primarily associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. SCA7 is characterized by the expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the ATXN7 gene, leading to the production of an abnormal polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-7 protein. This abnormal protein forms aggregates in neurons, disrupting normal cellular functions and causing symptoms such as cerebellar ataxia, retinal degeneration, and progressive blindness (Sujkowski2023Progressive; Goswami2022The).

The disease exhibits genetic anticipation, where symptoms appear earlier and more severely in successive generations, particularly when the mutation is paternally inherited (Goswami2022The). SCA7 can be classified into adult-onset, young adult/juvenile, and infantile forms, with varying ages of onset and severity (Goswami2022The).

Polyglutamine expansion in ATXN7 also affects its role in the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex, leading to transcriptional dysregulation and retinal degeneration. The expanded ataxin-7 inhibits the histone acetyltransferase activity of the STAGA complex, contributing to the pathogenesis of SCA7 (Palhan2005Polyglutamineexpanded). Additionally, alterations in ATXN7 expression have been linked to psychiatric traits such as depression and metabolic changes in unaffected individuals (Goswami2022The).

## Interactions
ATXN7 is a component of the SAGA transcriptional coactivator complex, where it plays a crucial role in anchoring the deubiquitinase module (DUBm) to the complex. This interaction is significant for regulating the stability and localization of other subunits, such as SCAR, which is important for actin cytoskeleton organization (Cloud2018Ataxin7). ATXN7 interacts with several components of the TFTC/STAGA chromatin remodeling complexes, including GCN5, ATXN7L3, and USP22. These interactions are not affected by the SUMOylation status of ATXN7, indicating that SUMOylation does not significantly influence its interaction with these complexes (Janer2009SUMOylation).

Polyglutamine expansions in ATXN7 do not alter its incorporation into TFTC complexes or its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. However, these expansions can lead to deregulated recruitment of TFTC/STAGA complexes to genomic regions, affecting chromatin structure and gene expression (Helmlinger2006GlutamineExpanded). ATXN7 also interacts with the photoreceptor-specific transcription factor CRX, facilitating the recruitment of the STAGA complex to CRX target genes, which is crucial for transcription regulation in the retina (Palhan2005Polyglutamineexpanded). These interactions highlight ATXN7's role in transcription regulation and its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases like spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7).
