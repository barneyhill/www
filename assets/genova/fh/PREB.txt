# PREB

## Overview
The PREB gene encodes the prolactin regulatory element binding protein, a member of the WD-repeat protein family, which is characterized by its involvement in protein-protein interactions and transcriptional regulation. The PREB protein is notable for its role in binding to the prolactin promoter, thereby influencing prolactin gene expression. It contains three conserved WD-repeat motifs that form a beta-propeller structure, facilitating its function as a transcriptional regulator. Additionally, PREB is involved in interactions with viral proteins, such as the hepatitis C virus NS4B protein, which implicates it in viral replication processes. The protein's ability to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and its potential alternative splicing, suggest a complex regulatory role in cellular signaling pathways (Fliss1999Expression; Kong2016Prolactin; Taylor2000Cloning).

## Structure
The PREB protein, encoded by the human PREB gene, is a member of the WD-repeat protein family, characterized by the presence of WD motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Fliss1999Expression; Taylor2000Cloning). The protein consists of 417 amino acids and includes three conserved WD-repeat motifs, which are crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation (Taylor2000Cloning). These motifs contribute to the formation of a beta-propeller structure, typical of WD-repeat proteins, although PREB's ability to bind DNA directly suggests it may represent a novel class within this family (Fliss1999Expression; Taylor2000Cloning).

PREB also contains two proline and glutamine-rich regions, which are implicated in transcriptional activation and repression (Fliss1999Expression). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its activity, particularly in response to cAMP-mediated signaling pathways (Fliss1999Expression). The potential for alternative splicing of PREB transcripts suggests the existence of isoforms with distinct functional properties (Fliss1999Expression; Taylor2000Cloning). These structural features underscore PREB's role in regulating prolactin promoter activity and possibly other transcriptional processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PREB gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. PREB is involved in the replication of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) through its interaction with the viral NS4B protein. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the membranous replication compartment necessary for HCV RNA replication. Elevated expression of PREB has been observed in HCV-infected cells and liver tissues, suggesting its role in facilitating HCV replication both in vitro and in vivo (Kong2016Prolactin). Silencing PREB expression using siRNA has been shown to reduce HCV replication, indicating its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention against HCV infection (Kong2016Prolactin).

The study also explored the specificity of PREB's role by examining its effect on other viruses, finding that PREB silencing affected poliovirus replication but not dengue virus, suggesting a specific interaction with HCV (Kong2016Prolactin). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PREB in the context of viral infections, particularly HCV, and suggest that targeting PREB could be a viable strategy for controlling HCV replication and potentially other viral infections.

## Interactions
PREB (prolactin regulatory element binding protein) is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein NS4B, which is crucial for HCV replication. This interaction facilitates the recruitment of PREB into the HCV RNA replication complex, where it colocalizes with double-stranded RNA and newly synthesized HCV RNA in replicon cells. The interaction is specific, as a mutant form of PREB lacking the NS4B-binding region does not colocalize with double-stranded RNA or shift to detergent-resistant membranes (Kong2016Prolactin).

PREB also interacts with the Tas protein of the prototype foamy virus (PFV), inhibiting PFV replication by affecting Tas-mediated transcriptional activation. This interaction involves the DNA-binding domain and activation domain of Tas, and the C-terminal 329-418 amino acids of PREB are key for this inhibitory effect. Coimmunoprecipitation assays confirm the interaction between PREB and Tas, with PREB affecting Tas's transactivation function (Zhang2023PREB).

In addition to these viral interactions, PREB acts as a transcriptional activator of the prolactin promoter, binding specifically to the PRL regulatory element 1P. It can mediate transcriptional stimulation by protein kinase A (PKA) and may interact with other transcription factors like Pit-1 (Fliss1999Expression).
