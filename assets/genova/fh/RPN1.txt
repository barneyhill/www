# RPN1

## Overview
RPN1 is a gene that encodes ribophorin I, an integral membrane protein primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. Ribophorin I is a crucial component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is essential for the N-linked glycosylation process. This protein is characterized as a transmembrane protein, playing a significant role in the attachment of oligosaccharides to nascent polypeptides, a modification vital for protein folding and stability (Wilson2008Ribophorin). The RPN1 gene is involved in various cellular processes, including protein quality control and the regulation of substrate delivery to the OST complex, thereby influencing the efficiency of glycosylation (Ding2021Knockdown). Alterations in RPN1 expression have been linked to several cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shen2024RPN1).

## Structure
RPN1 (ribophorin I) is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum and a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is crucial for N-linked glycosylation. The primary structure of RPN1 includes a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain, which are essential for its integration into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The secondary structure of RPN1 is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its stability and function within the OST complex.

In terms of tertiary structure, RPN1's configuration allows it to interact effectively with other components of the OST complex, facilitating its role in glycosylation processes. The quaternary structure of RPN1 is defined by its association with other proteins in the OST complex, highlighting its importance in the assembly and function of this multi-protein complex.

RPN1 undergoes common post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is critical for its function and stability. These modifications may influence the protein's activity and interactions within the OST complex. The structural features of RPN1, including its domains and post-translational modifications, underscore its essential role in the glycosylation pathway.

## Function
Ribophorin I (RPN1) is a critical component of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which plays a vital role in the N-glycosylation process within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. This process involves the attachment of high mannose oligosaccharides to asparagine residues on nascent polypeptides, a modification essential for proper protein folding and stability (Wilson2008Ribophorin; Ding2021Knockdown). RPN1 is specifically involved in the regulation of substrate delivery to the OST complex, enhancing the efficiency of N-glycosylation for selected substrates by capturing and presenting them to the catalytic core (Wilson2008Ribophorin).

RPN1's function is substrate-specific, as its depletion affects the glycosylation of certain proteins but not others, indicating a regulatory role in substrate access to the OST complex (Wilson2008Ribophorin). It facilitates the N-glycosylation of specific glycoprotein substrates, such as the invariant chain of the MHC class II complex, by ensuring their efficient modification (Wilson2008Ribophorin). This selective role is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis and function, as abnormalities in RPN1 can lead to hypoglycosylation, protein misfolding, and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Ding2021Knockdown).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the RPN1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. RPN1 is significantly upregulated in multiple cancer types, including glioma and breast cancer, and is associated with poor prognosis in these conditions (Zheng2024Integrated; Shen2024RPN1). In breast cancer, RPN1 promotes cell proliferation and invasion through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Shen2024RPN1). High expression of RPN1 is also linked to increased tumor mutational burden and immune cell infiltration, which may contribute to cancer progression and affect responses to immunotherapy (Zheng2024Integrated).

Mutations in RPN1, particularly missense mutations, are prevalent across various cancer types and may impact its role in genomic stability and tumor progression (Zheng2024Integrated). The phosphorylation of RPN1 at serine 361 is crucial for proteasome assembly and function, and disruptions in this process can lead to impaired cellular homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction (Liu2019Reversible). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RPN1 in cancer biology and suggest that targeting its expression or function could offer new avenues for cancer treatment.

## Interactions
Ribophorin I (RPN1) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the context of the proteasome and the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex. RPN1 is a component of the OST complex, which is crucial for N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum. It interacts with other proteins in this complex, such as RPN2, facilitating the co-translational modification of nascent polypeptides.

In the proteasome, RPN1 acts as a receptor for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, playing a significant role in substrate binding and deubiquitination. It provides receptor sites for substrate binding, engaging with ubiquitinated substrates through specific binding modes. RPN1 interacts with ubiquitin via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, and it has been shown to bind K48-linked diubiquitin, which is important for targeting substrates for proteolysis by the proteasome (Shi2016Rpn1).

RPN1 also interacts with the Bag-1 protein, involving both the UbL and BAG domains of Bag-1. The BAG domain forms hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with RPN1, while the UbL domain maintains electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Can2021Interactome). These interactions highlight RPN1's role in protein quality control systems and its involvement in complex cellular processes.
