# LPCAT1

## Overview
LPCAT1 (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1) is a gene that encodes a critical enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, specifically the remodeling of phospholipids. The enzyme, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1, is categorized as an acyltransferase and plays a pivotal role in converting lysophosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylcholine, a major component of cell membranes. This conversion is essential for maintaining membrane integrity and fluidity, impacting various physiological processes such as inflammation and surfactant production in the lungs (Bellon2021Increased; Bridges2010LPCAT1). LPCAT1 is particularly significant in pulmonary function, contributing to the synthesis of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, a key component of pulmonary surfactant necessary for proper lung function (Bridges2010LPCAT1). Beyond its physiological roles, LPCAT1 has been implicated in cancer progression, where its altered expression influences tumor growth and metastasis through interactions with key signaling pathways (Ji2021LpCat1; Wei2019LPCAT1).

## Function
LPCAT1 (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a major component of cell membranes. In healthy human cells, LPCAT1 is involved in the remodeling of phospholipids by converting lysophosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylcholine, which is essential for maintaining cell membrane integrity and fluidity (Bellon2021Increased). This enzyme is active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it participates in lipid metabolism processes that impact various physiological functions, including inflammation and surfactant production in the lungs (Bellon2021Increased).

LPCAT1 is particularly important in the lungs, where it contributes to the production of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, a key component of pulmonary surfactant. This surfactant is crucial for reducing surface tension in the alveoli, thereby preventing alveolar collapse and ensuring proper lung function (Bridges2010LPCAT1). LPCAT1's activity in surfactant synthesis is vital for the transition to air breathing, as demonstrated in studies involving mice (Bridges2010LPCAT1). The enzyme's role in maintaining retinal photoreceptor homeostasis further underscores its importance in normal cellular and physiological functions (Bellon2021Increased).

## Clinical Significance
LPCAT1 (lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), LPCAT1 is upregulated, correlating with increased tumor grade, stage, and size, and is associated with poor overall survival. Its overexpression promotes cancer progression by altering phospholipid metabolism, specifically increasing phosphatidylcholine levels while decreasing lysophosphatidylcholine levels (Du2017Lysophosphatidylcholine).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LPCAT1 is overexpressed and serves as an independent prognostic biomarker. High LPCAT1 expression is linked to poor prognosis and is associated with enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. It also correlates with immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, suggesting a role in tumor immunity regulation (Li2022LPCAT1; He2021LPCAT1).

LPCAT1 is also overexpressed in endometrial cancer, where it is associated with lower survival rates and higher tumor grades. Its expression influences the tumor microenvironment, affecting immune cell infiltration and potentially impacting immunotherapy responses (Zhao2021Elevated).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma, LPCAT1 overexpression is linked to increased tumor invasiveness and migration, promoting cancer progression through enhanced biosynthesis of platelet-activating factor (ShidaSakazume2015Lysophosphatidylcholine).

## Interactions
LPCAT1 is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. In lung adenocarcinoma, LPCAT1 interacts with the MYC protein, a key player in cancer progression. This interaction is part of the PI3K/AKT/MYC signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Co-immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the interaction between LPCAT1 and MYC, suggesting that LPCAT1 may play a role in activating this pathway, thereby promoting brain metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma (Wei2019LPCAT1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), LPCAT1 interacts with STAT1, a tumor suppressor gene. This interaction negatively regulates STAT1 expression, leading to enhanced cell proliferation and metastasis. The suppression of STAT1 by LPCAT1 results in the upregulation of cell cycle-related proteins such as CyclinD1, CyclinE, and CDK4, and a decrease in the cell cycle inhibitor p27 kip1. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses (Ji2021LpCat1).

These interactions highlight LPCAT1's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes, contributing to cancer progression and metastasis.
