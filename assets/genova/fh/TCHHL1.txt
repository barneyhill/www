# TCHHL1

## Overview
The TCHHL1 gene encodes the trichohyalin-like 1 protein, a member of the fused S100 protein family, which is characterized by its calcium-binding EF-hand motifs. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and anti-apoptotic processes, particularly in normal human keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma cells. The trichohyalin-like 1 protein plays a significant role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis by modulating key signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 and AKT, which are essential for cell growth and survival. Alterations in TCHHL1 expression have been linked to various dermatological conditions, including psoriasis vulgaris and squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Additionally, genetic studies suggest a possible association of TCHHL1 with atopic dermatitis and a weak link to Parkinson's disease, although further research is required to elucidate these connections (Jansen2017Discovery; Makino2020Trichohyalinlike; Løset2019Genetics).

## Structure
The TCHHL1 protein is a member of the fused S100 protein family, characterized by a conserved N-terminal S100 domain with two calcium-binding EF-hand motifs (Mlitz2021The). The protein is encoded by the human TCHHL1 gene and consists of 904 amino acids (Makino2020Trichohyalinlike). The molecular structure includes an EF-hand domain at the N-terminus, followed by a large domain, although specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context (Makino2020Trichohyalinlike).

The TCHHL1 protein is involved in the proliferation and anti-apoptosis of normal human keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma cells, suggesting its role in cell survival and homeostasis (Makino2020Trichohyalinlike). The protein's function is linked to the activation of ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Makino2020Trichohyalinlike). However, specific post-translational modifications, splice variant isoforms, or detailed structural features beyond the EF-hand domain are not detailed in the provided context. The C-terminal domain of TCHHL1, like other SFTPs, may contribute to its specific functions, but further structural details are not available (Mlitz2021The).

## Function
The TCHHL1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the proliferation and anti-apoptotic processes of normal human keratinocytes (NHKs) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. TCHHL1 is expressed in the basal layer of the normal epidermis and is involved in key biological functions such as cellular movement, cell death and survival, and cellular development (Makino2020Trichohyalinlike). 

In healthy human cells, TCHHL1 is essential for maintaining epidermal homeostasis by promoting cell proliferation and preventing apoptosis. The protein affects the activation of the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways, which are crucial for cell growth. Knockdown of TCHHL1 results in decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT, leading to inhibited cell proliferation and induced early apoptosis. This is associated with increased expression of apoptosis-related molecules such as FOXO1, BCL2, and BCL2L11 (Makino2020Trichohyalinlike).

TCHHL1's role in keratinocyte proliferation and survival suggests its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions involving abnormal keratinocyte proliferation, such as psoriasis vulgaris and SCC (Makino2020Trichohyalinlike).

## Clinical Significance
The Trichohyalin-like 1 (TCHHL1) gene has been implicated in several dermatological conditions due to its role in cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis. Alterations in TCHHL1 expression are associated with hyperproliferative skin disorders such as psoriasis vulgaris, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). In SCC, TCHHL1 is strongly expressed in tumor cells, and its knockdown has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis, suggesting its involvement in tumor growth and survival (Makino2020Trichohyalinlike). The knockdown of TCHHL1 affects key signaling pathways, including ERK1/2, AKT, and STAT3, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation (Makino2020Trichohyalinlike).

TCHHL1 has also been identified as a potential novel risk gene for atopic dermatitis (AD) through genetic studies, although specific mutations or expression alterations directly linking TCHHL1 to AD have not been detailed (Løset2019Genetics). Additionally, TCHHL1 has shown a weak association with Parkinson's disease, though the evidence is not strong enough to establish a direct link (Jansen2017Discovery). These findings suggest that TCHHL1 may play a role in various conditions, but further research is needed to fully understand its clinical significance.
