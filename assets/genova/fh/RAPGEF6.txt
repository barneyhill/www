# RAPGEF6

## Overview
RAPGEF6, or Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to cell adhesion and migration. The protein functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), specifically activating the small GTPase Rap2 over Rap1, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the formation and maintenance of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesions (levy2013exploring). RAPGEF6 is active in the cytoplasm and at cell membranes, where it interacts with multiple proteins, indicating its involvement in complex signaling networks. Its role in integrin and cadherin signaling is essential for neural migration and cell connectivity, suggesting a significant impact on neural development and function (levy2013exploring). Additionally, mutations in the RAPGEF6 gene have been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, as well as conditions like laryngeal paralysis in dogs, highlighting its clinical significance (levy2013exploring; Hadji2019A).

## Structure


## Function
RAPGEF6, or Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6, is a protein that plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways, particularly in cell adhesion and migration. It functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rap, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is crucial for activating Rap proteins. RAPGEF6 preferentially activates Rap2 over Rap1, influencing various cellular processes (levy2013exploring).

In healthy human cells, RAPGEF6 is involved in the formation and maintenance of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesions. It is essential for the maturation of E-cadherin-containing adherens junctions in epithelial cells, and its knockdown results in immature junctions and reduced E-cadherin levels (levy2013exploring). RAPGEF6 also regulates integrin-mediated adhesion, which is vital for cellular migration and maintaining tight junctions (levy2013exploring).

RAPGEF6 is active in the cytoplasm and at cell membranes, where it interacts with various proteins, including tyrosine phosphatase PTP1E and Interleukin-16, indicating its involvement in complex cell signaling networks (levy2013exploring). Its role in integrin and cadherin signaling is crucial for neural migration and cell connectivity, suggesting a potential impact on neural development and function (levy2013exploring).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RAPGEF6 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, most notably schizophrenia. A de novo deletion of RAPGEF6 was identified in a sporadic case of schizophrenia, suggesting a potential causal link. This deletion affected exons 2 through 11 of the gene, highlighting the significance of this region in the disorder (levy2013exploring). Additionally, RAPGEF6 is located within the chromosome 5q31 locus, which has been associated with schizophrenia through various genetic studies (levy2013exploring). Mouse models with RAPGEF6 deletions exhibit schizophrenia-related endophenotypes, such as hyperactivity, impaired prepulse inhibition, and diminished fear conditioning, indicating dopaminergic imbalances and amygdala dysfunction (levy2013exploring).

In dogs, a 36 bp insertion in exon 15 of the RAPGEF6 gene has been identified as a major risk factor for laryngeal paralysis, particularly in Miniature Bull Terriers. This genetic variant leads to aberrant splicing and a frameshift, resulting in a truncated protein, which significantly increases the risk of developing the condition (Hadji2019A). These findings underscore the gene's role in both human and animal health, with implications for understanding its broader physiological significance.

## Interactions
RAPGEF6, also known as Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6, is involved in several protein interactions that influence intracellular signaling pathways. It acts as a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPases RAP1 and RAP2, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is crucial for their activation (Levy2015Deletion; Maeta2016Crucial). RAPGEF6 interacts with proteins such as JamA, Afadin, Bag3, Riam, and RapL, which are involved in cell adhesion and migration, affecting adherens junctions, integrin junctions, and actin organization (Levy2015Deletion).

In the context of cancer, RAPGEF6 has been shown to interact with the K-RAS M67L mutant, a variant that preferentially binds GDP. This interaction leads to increased RAP1 activation compared to wild-type K-RAS, suggesting a role in atypical signaling pathways (Qian2022A). The M67L mutant binds strongly to the RA domain of RAPGEF6, which is significant for activating downstream effectors like RAP1-GTP and CDC42, potentially influencing the ERK pathway (Qian2022A). These interactions highlight RAPGEF6's role in modulating signaling pathways that are critical for cellular functions and disease processes.
