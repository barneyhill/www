# CHKB

## Overview
The CHKB gene encodes the enzyme choline kinase beta (ChoKβ), which is a critical component of the phospholipid biosynthesis pathway. As a kinase, ChoKβ catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline to phosphocholine, marking the initial step in the Kennedy pathway for phosphatidylcholine synthesis, a major constituent of cell membranes (Sher2006A; GallegoOrtega2009Differential). This enzyme is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and plays a vital role in lipid metabolism and membrane stability, contributing to normal muscle function and cellular membrane repair (Sher2006A). Unlike its isoform, choline kinase alpha, ChoKβ does not significantly contribute to carcinogenesis, indicating its specialized role in maintaining phospholipid homeostasis without oncogenic effects (GallegoOrtega2009Differential). Mutations in the CHKB gene are linked to neuromuscular disorders such as Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy and Proximal Myopathy with Focal Depletion of Mitochondria, underscoring its clinical significance (Brady2016Proximal; Bardhan2021Megaconial).

## Structure
The CHKB gene encodes the choline kinase beta (ChoKβ) enzyme, which plays a crucial role in phospholipid biosynthesis. The primary structure of ChoKβ consists of 395 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 45 kDa (Lacal2021Choline; Janardhan2006Choline). The protein includes conserved motifs such as Brenner's motif, which is involved in phosphotransfer reactions, and the choline motif, important for substrate binding (Janardhan2006Choline). 

The secondary structure of ChoKβ features alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a central core with helices and a hairpin loop, an insertion subdomain with helices connected by a β hairpin motif, and a C-terminal subdomain with five helices (Janardhan2006Choline). 

In terms of tertiary structure, ChoKβ forms a specific 3D shape necessary for its function, with a catalytic domain conserved for ATP, choline, and Ca+2 binding sites (Janardhan2006Choline). 

ChoKβ functions as a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure, and can also form heterodimers with other isoforms, although it displays lower enzymatic activity compared to its alpha counterparts (Chen2017Molecular). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and function (Chen2017Molecular).

## Function
The CHKB gene encodes choline kinase beta, an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major phospholipid component of cell membranes. This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of choline to phosphocholine, the first committed step in the Kennedy pathway, which is essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (Sher2006A; GallegoOrtega2009Differential). Phosphatidylcholine is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes and is involved in cellular signaling processes (Sher2006A).

In healthy human cells, CHKB is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and membrane stability (Sher2006A). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of phospholipids, which is necessary for normal muscle function and cellular membrane repair (Sher2006A). Unlike its isoform choline kinase alpha, CHKB does not play a significant role in carcinogenesis, as its overexpression does not induce cell transformation or tumor growth (GallegoOrtega2009Differential). This suggests that CHKB has a distinct physiological role in lipid metabolism, focusing on maintaining phospholipid homeostasis without oncogenic implications (GallegoOrtega2009Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CHKB gene are associated with several neuromuscular disorders, primarily Megaconial Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDCMC) and Proximal Myopathy with Focal Depletion of Mitochondria (PMFDM). MDCMC is characterized by early-onset muscle weakness, intellectual disability, and distinctive muscle biopsy findings, including enlarged 'megaconial' mitochondria at the periphery of muscle fibers (Brady2016Proximal; Bardhan2021Megaconial). Patients may also exhibit symptoms such as autistic behavior, ichthyotic skin changes, and cardiomyopathy (Haliloglu2015Clinical; Bardhan2021Megaconial). PMFDM, on the other hand, presents with mild, non-progressive muscle weakness and normal cognitive function (Brady2016Proximal).

CHKB mutations often result in a loss of function, leading to reduced choline kinase activity, which is crucial for phospholipid biosynthesis. This disruption can cause mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in these disorders (Bardhan2021Megaconial; Marchet2019Alteration). The phenotypic spectrum of CHKB-related conditions ranges from severe congenital muscular dystrophy with intellectual disability to milder forms resembling limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (Oliveira2015New). These mutations are typically inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (Daneshjoo2020Evidence).

## Interactions
CHKB (choline kinase beta) is involved in the formation of integrin complexes, which are crucial for maintaining muscle cell integrity. In Chkb-deficient mice, there is a disruption in the integrin-mediated linkage between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix (ECM), particularly affecting the integrin-vinculin-talin complex. This disruption is characterized by the mislocalization of vinculin, a key component of the complex, which is normally associated with the plasma membrane. In the absence of functional CHKB, vinculin is internalized and poorly associated with the membrane/cytoskeleton, indicating a defect in costamere function (Tavasoli2024Defects).

The binding of vinculin, talin, and α-actinin to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) is crucial for integrin complex formation. In Chkb -/- mice, decreased choline kinase activity leads to a redistribution of PI(4,5)P2 from the plasma membrane, affecting the localization of vinculin and its association with the plasma membrane. Overexpression of CHKB can restore PI(4,5)P2 localization and vinculin translocation to the plasma membrane, highlighting the role of CHKB in maintaining the integrity of the integrin-vinculin-talin complex (Tavasoli2024Defects).
