# FRRS1L

## Overview
The FRRS1L gene encodes the protein ferric chelate reductase 1 like, which is integral to the biogenesis and function of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) complexes in the brain. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and plays a pivotal role in the early stages of AMPAR assembly, particularly influencing the glycosylation and synaptic localization of AMPAR subunits such as GLUA2 and GLUA4 (Stewart2019Loss). FRRS1L is involved in the dynein-dependent transport of AMPARs, associating with dynein vesicles and contributing to the trafficking and stability of these receptors (Han2017Ferric). Mutations in the FRRS1L gene are linked to severe neurological disorders, including epileptic encephalopathies, underscoring its critical role in maintaining proper synaptic function and neuronal health (Stewart2019Loss; Abdelmoumen2020Boricua).

## Function
The FRRS1L gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the function and regulation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which are essential for fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. FRRS1L is involved in the early stages of AMPA receptor complex biogenesis, binding to core AMPA proteins (GLUA1-4) and dissociating before the final auxiliary proteins bind to form a functional receptor (Stewart2019Loss). It is crucial for the mature glycosylation of AMPA receptor subunits, specifically GLUA2 and GLUA4, which is necessary for their correct localization at the synaptic membrane (Stewart2019Loss).

In neurons, FRRS1L is associated with dynein vesicles, suggesting a role in dynein-dependent transport of AMPARs (Han2017Ferric). The protein is primarily located outside synapses but associates with a subpopulation of GluA1-containing AMPARs, indicating its involvement in AMPAR complex formation and trafficking (Han2017Ferric). Loss of FRRS1L leads to a reduction in AMPA receptor levels and modifications in synaptic transmission, which are associated with various neurodevelopmental, motor, cognitive, and electrographical abnormalities (Stewart2019Loss). These findings highlight the importance of FRRS1L in maintaining proper synaptic function and receptor stability in neurons.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FRRS1L gene are associated with several severe neurological disorders. Biallelic pathogenic variants in FRRS1L have been linked to epileptic encephalopathy, specifically early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 37 (EIEE37). This condition is characterized by epileptic spasms, developmental regression, and cerebral atrophy, with many patients initially diagnosed with infantile spasms evolving to Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (Abdelmoumen2020Boricua). A specific homozygous in-frame deletion, c.737_739delGAG (p.Gly246del), has been identified as a founder variant in individuals of Puerto Rican ancestry, leading to symptoms such as severe motor and speech delays, intractable epilepsy, and dyskinetic movements (Abdelmoumen2020Boricua).

Loss-of-function mutations in FRRS1L result in a deficiency of AMPA receptor levels in the brain, disrupting glutamatergic signaling and leading to neurological disorders like choreoathetosis, cognitive deficits, and epileptic encephalopathies (Stewart2019Loss). These mutations often result in a premature stop codon, causing a loss of function (Stewart2019Loss). In mouse models, the absence of FRRS1L leads to motor deficits, hyperactivity, working memory issues, and sleep fragmentation, mirroring the human phenotypes (Stewart2019Loss). The gene's role in AMPA receptor biogenesis and trafficking is crucial for normal brain development and function, and its mutations are implicated in intellectual disabilities and epileptic conditions (Brechet2017AMPAreceptor).

## Interactions
FRRS1L is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, particularly within AMPA receptor (AMPAR) complexes. It forms ternary complexes with CPT1c and Sac1, which are involved in synaptic transmission and intellectual ability. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and stability of AMPAR complexes. FRRS1L and CPT1c co-assemble with GluA1-4 subunits of AMPARs into high molecular weight complexes, with about equimolar ratios of GluAs and FRRS1L/CPT1c (Brechet2017AMPAreceptor). 

FRRS1L is also associated with dynein vesicles, indicating a role in AMPAR trafficking. It is found in dynein vesicles along with AMPARs, but not in kinesin vesicles, suggesting a specific association with dynein vesicles (Han2017Ferric). In the endoplasmic reticulum, FRRS1L forms complexes with CPT1c during the early stages of AMPAR biogenesis. These complexes co-assemble with newly synthesized GluA tetramers, preparing them for subsequent interaction with auxiliary proteins such as TARPs and CNIHs (Brechet2017AMPAreceptor). 

FRRS1L does not form dimers or oligomers with itself, as demonstrated in co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK cells (Han2017Ferric). It is involved in the dimerization of AMPAR subunits, working alongside CPT1c to promote the dissociation of ABHD6, which enables the formation of tetrameric receptors (Matthews2021Biology).
