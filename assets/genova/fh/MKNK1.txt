# MKNK1

## Overview
MKNK1 is a gene that encodes the protein MAPK interacting serine/threonine kinase 1, commonly referred to as Mnk1. Mnk1 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which is integral to regulating cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and stress response. The protein is activated by MAPKs, including ERK1, ERK2, and p38, but not JNK1, through phosphorylation at specific sites, which is crucial for its function (Waskiewicz1997Mitogenactivated). Mnk1 is involved in the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), a modification that enhances mRNA translation initiation, particularly under conditions of cellular stress (Fukunaga1997MNK1). The activity of Mnk1 is regulated by its interactions with MAPKs, and it is implicated in various cellular functions, including cell cycle progression and survival (Cargnello2011Activation). MKNK1 has clinical significance, particularly in oncology, where its expression levels are associated with cancer progression and therapeutic resistance (PintoDíez2020Deeping).

## Function
MKNK1 encodes a kinase that plays a crucial role in the MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in regulating various cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and stress response. The MKNK1 protein, also known as Mnk1, is activated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) like ERK1, ERK2, and p38, but not JNK1. This activation is dependent on phosphorylation at specific sites within its T-loop, which are essential for its function (Waskiewicz1997Mitogenactivated).

Mnk1 phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) at Ser209, a modification that enhances its affinity for the 5' cap structure of mRNAs, facilitating translation initiation. This phosphorylation is crucial for regulating mRNA translation, particularly in response to mitogens and environmental stresses such as insulin and anisomycin (Fukunaga1997MNK1; Waskiewicz1997Mitogenactivated). Despite its role in eIF4E phosphorylation, studies suggest that this modification is not essential for general protein synthesis or cell growth during development, as evidenced by normal development in Mnk1/2 knockout mice (Ueda2004Mnk2).

Mnk1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cell cycle progression and survival by integrating signals from MAPK pathways (Cargnello2011Activation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MKNK1 gene, which encodes MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (MNK1), have been implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of MNK1 is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including glioblastoma, lung, liver, ovarian, and breast cancers. In these cancers, MNK1 contributes to oncogenic activity by phosphorylating eIF4E, a process crucial for tumor progression and resistance to therapies targeting the mTOR pathway (PintoDíez2020Deeping).

In contrast, MNK1 acts as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer, where its down-regulation is linked to advanced disease stages and poor overall survival. Low MNK1 expression serves as an independent prognostic factor for poor clinical outcomes in bladder cancer (Chen2020MAP).

MNK1 is also involved in maintaining protein synthesis in cancer cells under stress conditions, such as treatment with mTOR inhibitors. This compensatory mechanism can lead to resistance to therapies, highlighting the potential of MNK1 as a therapeutic target in combination with other treatments (Grzmil2014MNK1). MNK1 inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials for their potential to enhance the efficacy of existing cancer therapies (PintoDíez2020Deeping).

## Interactions
MKNK1, also known as MAPK interacting serine/threonine kinase 1, interacts with several proteins, primarily through its role in the MAP kinase signaling pathway. MKNK1 is activated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1, ERK2, and p38, but not by JNK1. This activation is crucial for its function in phosphorylating the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) on Ser209, which is important for the regulation of translation in mammalian cells (Fukunaga1997MNK1; Waskiewicz1997Mitogenactivated).

MKNK1 interacts with ERK and p38 MAP kinases through its C-terminal domain, which is essential for its binding and activation. The interaction with ERK2 is particularly strong, and the phosphorylation state of ERK2 affects its binding affinity to MKNK1, with dephosphorylated ERK2 showing a higher affinity (Waskiewicz1997Mitogenactivated). MKNK1 also forms complexes with these kinases, which are necessary for its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF-4E (Fukunaga1997MNK1).

The C-terminal domain of MKNK1 plays a dual role in regulating its activity, ensuring low basal activity and allowing activation by ERK or p38 signals. This domain can obstruct access to the catalytic domain, explaining why MKNK1 isoforms with different C-terminal structures exhibit varying activities (Goto2009The).
