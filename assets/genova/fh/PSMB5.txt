# PSMB5

## Overview
PSMB5 is a gene that encodes the proteasome 20S subunit beta 5, a critical component of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The proteasome is a multi-subunit protease complex that plays a central role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins and maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell. The PSMB5-encoded protein is categorized as a protease and is essential for the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity, which is crucial for the breakdown of damaged or misfolded proteins, regulation of the cell cycle, and modulation of immune responses (Hwang2007AgeAssociated; Voges1999The). Alterations in PSMB5 expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer, where they are associated with resistance to proteasome inhibitors used in treatment (Oerlemans2008Molecular; Barrio2018Spectrum).

## Structure
The PSMB5 gene encodes the beta 5 subunit of the 20S proteasome, a critical component of the proteasome complex involved in protein degradation. The primary structure of PSMB5 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the beta subunit, with a precursor molecular weight of approximately 28,500 and an isoelectric point (pI) of 7.02. After processing, the subunit has a molecular weight of 22,500 and a pI of 8.75 (Elenich1999The). The mouse PSMB5 subunit, which shares high sequence identity with its human counterpart, consists of 264 amino acids, with post-translational processing removing the N-terminal 59 amino acids to yield a processed subunit of 205 amino acids (Kohda1997Structural).

The tertiary structure of PSMB5 involves its folding into a three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its function within the proteasome. In the quaternary structure, PSMB5 assembles with other proteasome subunits to form the 20S core proteasome complex, which is a cylindrical structure composed of four stacked heptameric rings (Elenich1999The). This assembly is essential for the proteasome's role in protein degradation and cellular protein homeostasis.

## Function
PSMB5 encodes a subunit of the 20S proteasome, which is a core component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for degrading ubiquitinated proteins. This degradation process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating the cell cycle, and modulating immune responses. PSMB5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to protein turnover and cellular stress responses (Voges1999The).

In healthy human cells, PSMB5 plays a crucial role in maintaining proteasome function and protein homeostasis. It is involved in the degradation of damaged or misfolded proteins, which is vital for various cellular processes, including the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis (Hwang2007AgeAssociated). The chymotrypsin-like activity of PSMB5 is particularly important for the proteolytic function of the proteasome, which helps in the removal of oxidized and ubiquitinated proteins, thereby preventing their accumulation, a hallmark of cellular aging (Hwang2007AgeAssociated).

The expression and activity of PSMB5 are also linked to the self-renewal and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, where it helps maintain cellular integrity by regulating oxidative stress and mitochondrial function (Zhao2016Essential). This suggests that PSMB5 is integral to both cellular maintenance and the prevention of age-related cellular damage.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PSMB5 gene are clinically significant in the context of multiple myeloma (MM), particularly concerning resistance to proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib. PSMB5 mutations, such as Ala49Thr, have been identified in bortezomib-resistant cells, leading to overexpression of the mutant β5-subunit protein and correlating with resistance levels (Oerlemans2008Molecular). These mutations can cause conformational changes in the proteasome's drug-binding site, reducing the affinity for proteasome inhibitors and impairing the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity (Barrio2018Spectrum).

In MM patients, PSMB5 mutations are more frequently observed in relapsed or refractory cases compared to newly diagnosed ones, suggesting that these mutations are acquired as a response to prolonged drug treatment (Barrio2018Spectrum). The presence of PSMB5 mutations has been linked to resistance not only to bortezomib but also to second-generation proteasome inhibitors like carfilzomib and ixazomib, due to structural similarities between these drugs (Allmeroth2020Bortezomib). These findings underscore the importance of PSMB5 mutations in influencing treatment outcomes and highlight the need for tailored therapeutic strategies to manage drug resistance in MM (Robak2021The).

## Interactions
PSMB5, a component of the 20S core proteasome, is involved in several critical interactions that influence its function and regulation. It interacts with the Coxiella burnetii effector protein CirB, which inhibits the proteasome's chymotrypsin-like activity. This interaction is facilitated by a specific region of CirB, spanning amino acids 91-120, which acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the 20S proteasome, causing conformational changes that reduce its activity (Fu2022A).

PSMB5 is also implicated in the resistance mechanisms against proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib. Mutations in PSMB5, such as Ala49Thr, and its overexpression have been linked to bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma and other cancer cell lines. These mutations can alter the drug-binding site, reducing the efficacy of the inhibitor (Oerlemans2008Molecular; Barrio2018Spectrum).

In the context of transcriptional regulation, PSMB5 expression is influenced by the transcription factor THAP1. Loss-of-function mutations in THAP1 lead to reduced PSMB5 expression, impairing proteasome function. This interaction highlights the regulatory role of THAP1 in maintaining PSMB5 levels necessary for cellular viability (Ramage2024Lossoffunction).
