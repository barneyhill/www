# PCDH11X

## Overview
PCDH11X is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein protocadherin 11 X-linked, a member of the δ1-protocadherin subfamily. This protein is primarily involved in cell-cell adhesion and signaling within the brain, playing a crucial role in neural development and function. Protocadherin 11 X-linked is characterized by its seven extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region, and a variable cytoplasmic domain, which allows for diverse intracellular interactions and signaling pathways (Kim2011Nonclustered; Zhang2014Protocadherin). The protein is implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism, ADHD, and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its significance in cognitive and neural processes (Priddle2012Protocadherin; Carrasquillo2009Genetic).

## Structure
PCDH11X, a member of the protocadherin family, is characterized by its unique molecular structure. The protein features an ectodomain with seven extracellular cadherin repeats (ECs), which are crucial for its role in cell-cell adhesion (Zhang2014Protocadherin). The transmembrane region is relatively short, and the cytoplasmic domain varies in length among different isoforms, indicating potential for diverse intracellular signaling (Kim2011Nonclustered; Zhang2014Protocadherin). 

The cytoplasmic domain of PCDH11X contains conserved motifs, including CM1, CM2, and CM3, which may interact with intracellular signaling proteins (Peek2017Regulation; Pancho2020Protocadherins). These motifs are involved in binding to protein phosphatase-1α (PP1α), suggesting a regulatory role in cellular processes (Pancho2020Protocadherins). 

PCDH11X is expressed in various brain regions and is involved in neural development, particularly influencing neural stem cell differentiation and proliferation (Zhang2014Protocadherin). The protein's structure and function are further diversified by alternative splicing, which generates isoforms with different cytoplasmic tail lengths, potentially affecting its role in signaling pathways (Pancho2020Protocadherins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PCDH11X gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. Disruptions in PCDH11X, such as deletions, have been associated with severe language delay in males, suggesting that these genetic changes may be less tolerated in males and could contribute to a higher male propensity for conditions like autism and ADHD (Speevak2011Non‐syndromic; Priddle2012Protocadherin). A duplication within PCDH11X has also been linked to intellectual disability in two brothers, further indicating its role in cognitive development (Priddle2012Protocadherin).

The PCDH11X gene has been studied in the context of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within PCDH11X, rs5984894, has shown a strong association with increased risk of LOAD, particularly in females, although subsequent studies have not consistently confirmed this association (Hirabayashi2013Protocadherins; Carrasquillo2009Genetic). The gene's expression levels and potential epigenetic modifications, such as methylation status, may also be relevant to psychiatric conditions, although these aspects remain inconclusive (Priddle2012Protocadherin). Overall, PCDH11X is considered a candidate gene for various neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, based on genomic analyses (Giouzeli2004ProtocadherinXY; Hirabayashi2013Protocadherins).

## Interactions
PCDH11X, a member of the δ1-protocadherin family, is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its function in the brain. The cytoplasmic domain of PCDH11X interacts with β-catenin, a protein crucial for the formation of the dorso-ventral axis and neuronal precursor development. This interaction may prevent the breakdown of β-catenin, allowing it to remain in dividing cells and potentially influencing cerebral asymmetry (Redies2005δProtocadherins:; Priddle2009The). 

PCDH11X also contains a protein phosphatase 1α (PP1α)-binding motif, known as CM3, which is characteristic of δ1-protocadherins. This motif mediates the interaction with PP1α, a protein involved in synaptic plasticity (Redies2005δProtocadherins:; Vanhalst2005δProtocadherins:). The CM3+CM1 domain is the major interaction site for PP1α, and this interaction is crucial for the function of PCDH11X (Vanhalst2005δProtocadherins:).

Additionally, PCDH11X is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is significant in various cellular processes, including neural development and function (Priddle2012Protocadherin). These interactions suggest that PCDH11X plays a role in cell signaling and adhesion processes in the brain.
