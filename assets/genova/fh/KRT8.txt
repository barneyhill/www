# KRT8

## Overview
Keratin 8 (KRT8) is a gene that encodes the type II intermediate filament protein known as keratin 8, which is predominantly expressed in simple epithelial cells. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and mechanical resilience of epithelial tissues, such as those found in the liver, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract (Karantza2010Keratins; Treiber2006Keratin). Keratin 8 forms heterodimers with keratin 18 (KRT18), a type I keratin, to create a robust cytoskeletal framework essential for various cellular processes, including apoptosis regulation, cell signaling, and organelle positioning (Omary2009Toward). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions are implicated in several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, liver disorders, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Yamashiro2010Ectopic; Ku2003Keratin; Owens2004Human).

## Structure
Keratin 8 (KRT8) is a type II intermediate filament protein primarily expressed in simple epithelial cells. Its primary structure consists of a central alpha-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains (Snider2011Keratin; Ho2022Update). The secondary structure is characterized by coiled-coil motifs, which facilitate the formation of dimeric structures (Ho2022Update). 

In terms of tertiary structure, KRT8 assembles into filamentous structures, which are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity. The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers with keratin 18 (KRT18), another type I keratin, through hydrophobic interactions, forming the basic building blocks of intermediate filaments (Ho2022Update). 

KRT8 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which are important for its function and regulation (Snider2011Keratin). Sumoylation, another post-translational modification, occurs on lysine residues within the rod domains and affects the solubility and filament dynamics of KRT8. Hypersumoylation has been linked to decreased solubility and is associated with liver disease mutations (Snider2011Keratin). These structural and functional characteristics of KRT8 are essential for its role in cellular processes and its involvement in various diseases.

## Function
Keratin 8 (KRT8) is a type II intermediate filament protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and resilience of epithelial cells against mechanical stress. It is predominantly expressed in simple epithelial tissues, including the liver, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract, where it forms heteropolymers with type I keratins, such as keratin 18 (KRT18), to create a robust cytoskeletal framework (Karantza2010Keratins; Treiber2006Keratin).

KRT8 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of apoptosis, cell signaling, and organelle positioning. It provides cytoprotection by modulating the targeting and density of the Fas receptor on the cell surface, thereby conferring resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in hepatocytes (Gilbert2001Simple). KRT8 also interacts with signaling proteins like Raf-1 kinase and acts as a phosphate 'sponge' during stress, contributing to its antiapoptotic functions (Omary2009Toward).

In addition to its mechanical roles, KRT8 is crucial for maintaining cellular functions such as apico-basal polarization, protein translation control, and membrane protein targeting. Its deficiency can lead to mistargeting of proteins and altered organelle distribution, as seen in K8-deficient hepatocytes and intestines (Omary2009Toward; Karantza2010Keratins). These functions underscore the importance of KRT8 in maintaining epithelial cell health and function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the KRT8 gene are associated with several diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, has been linked to specific KRT8 mutations such as Gly62 to Cys, Ile63 to Val, and Lys464 to Asn. These mutations affect keratin filament assembly, potentially compromising the mechanical resilience of the intestinal epithelium and predisposing individuals to IBD (Owens2004Human). 

KRT8 mutations are also implicated in liver diseases. They are more frequent in patients with liver conditions like biliary atresia, hepatitis B/C, and alcohol-related liver disease, suggesting a role in predisposing individuals to liver disease rather than directly causing it (Ku2003Keratin). KRT8 is a major component of Mallory-Denk bodies, which are associated with several liver diseases (Omary2009Toward).

In the context of cancer, KRT8 expression is upregulated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where its coexpression with KRT18 is linked to increased invasiveness and metastatic potential (Yamashiro2010Ectopic). Altered KRT8 expression is also associated with pancreatic disorders, including chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer (Treiber2006Keratin).

## Interactions
Keratin 8 (KRT8) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It forms heterodimers with keratin 18 (KRT18), which is crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity in epithelial cells (Baek2017Autophagy). KRT8 also interacts with phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3), which modulates its phosphorylation status. This interaction is significant in colorectal cancer progression, as PRL-3 dephosphorylates KRT8 at serine residues S73 and S431, enhancing cell motility and metastatic potential (Mizuuchi2009Down‐modulation).

In the context of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), KRT8 is found on the cell surface and is associated with plasminogen-induced invasion, suggesting its involvement in tumor invasiveness (Albaret2021Combined). KRT8 is also implicated in the replication of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), where its expression enhances HBV replication, indicating a potential role in viral pathogenesis (Zhong2013Keratin).

KRT8's interactions extend to its role in protecting retinal pigment epithelium cells under oxidative stress, where it facilitates autophagosome-lysosome fusion, thereby enhancing autophagic clearance and providing resistance to apoptosis (Baek2017Autophagy). These interactions highlight KRT8's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and disease progression.
