# SUMO3

## Overview
SUMO3 is a gene that encodes the protein Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier 3, which is a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein family. This protein is involved in the post-translational modification process known as SUMOylation, which is crucial for regulating the stability, localization, and activity of various target proteins. SUMO3 is predominantly active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays significant roles in DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is particularly noted for its ability to form poly-SUMO chains, a feature that distinguishes it from other SUMO proteins and is essential for modulating protein functions such as transcription and cell cycle regulation (Shi2022The; Huang2024Mechanisms). The SUMO3 protein is also implicated in immune responses, influencing pathways such as NF-κB activity and Th17 differentiation (Huang2024Mechanisms). Given its involvement in critical cellular processes, SUMO3 is a subject of interest in the study of various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (Anderson2017Sumoylation:; Küçükali2020Small).

## Structure
SUMO3 (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier 3) is a protein involved in post-translational modification processes, sharing a high degree of sequence identity with SUMO2. The primary structure of SUMO3 includes a conserved C-terminal diglycine motif essential for its conjugation to target proteins (Tatham2001Polymeric). SUMO3, like other SUMO proteins, possesses a β-grasp fold, a common structural motif that contributes to its stability and function (Tatham2001Polymeric).

The secondary structure of SUMO3 is characterized by α-helices and β-sheets, with the internal cysteine residue playing a crucial role in maintaining its stability. A Cys to Ala modification in SUMO3 results in a significant decrease in α-helical content and a lower melting temperature, indicating a substantial impact on its stability (Bouchenna2019The). This cysteine is located in the α-helix of the SUMO-3 core domain, with its side-chain pointing towards the hydrophobic core, suggesting its importance in the protein's structural integrity (Bouchenna2019The).

SUMO3 can form polymeric chains through lysine 11, a feature that distinguishes it from SUMO1. This ability to form poly(SUMO) chains is facilitated by the presence of a consensus SUMO modification site (KXE) in its N-terminal region (Tatham2001Polymeric). These chains are involved in various cellular processes, including responses to environmental stresses (Tatham2001Polymeric).

## Function
SUMO3 (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier 3) is a protein involved in the post-translational modification process known as SUMOylation, which influences the stability, localization, and activity of target proteins. SUMO3 is primarily active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays significant roles in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcriptional regulation, and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhao2007Sumoylation; Huang2024Mechanisms).

SUMO3, along with SUMO2, is involved in forming poly-SUMO chains due to their internal SUMO consensus motif, which is crucial for regulating protein functions such as transcription, cell cycle, and DNA repair (Shi2022The). In immune cells, SUMO3 modulates NF-κB activity, which is important for immune responses, and is involved in the regulation of Th17 differentiation and IL-17 expression in T cells (Huang2024Mechanisms). SUMO3 also affects the subcellular localization of proteins, such as PKR, by concentrating it around the perinuclear membrane and recruiting it to nuclear dots, which may influence its function and stability (Maarifi2018Differential).

Overall, SUMO3 plays a critical role in modulating protein functions and maintaining cellular homeostasis, impacting various biological processes and immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the SUMO3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In Parkinson's disease (PD), specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SUMO3 gene have been identified, although these variants were not directly associated with clinical features of PD. However, an increased family history of cancer was observed in patients with these SUMO3 variants, suggesting a potential link between SUMO3 mutations and cancer predisposition (Küçükali2020Small).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, SUMO3 is involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). SUMO3 conjugation to mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) increases protein stability and accelerates intracellular aggregate formation, contributing to ALS progression (Anderson2017Sumoylation:). Additionally, in cerebral ischemia, SUMO3 is suggested to play a neuroprotective role by responding to hypoxic stress, potentially protecting neurons by down-regulating glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission (Anderson2017Sumoylation:).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SUMO3 in various diseases, emphasizing its role in cellular stress responses and its potential as a therapeutic target. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which SUMO3 contributes to these conditions could inform the development of targeted treatments.

## Interactions
SUMO3, a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier protein family, participates in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in post-translational modification. One significant interaction is with the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme, Ubc9. This interaction is essential for the SUMOylation process, where SUMO3 is covalently attached to target proteins. The structural basis of this interaction involves a strong hydrophobic interaction at the helix-sheet interface of SUMO3, and the flexibility of Ubc9 is key to its binding with the relatively rigid SUMO3 (Shi2007Structural).

SUMO3 also interacts with proteins through SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs), which facilitate noncovalent interactions. These motifs are typically hydrophobic sequences that bind to a conserved groove in SUMO proteins, including SUMO3. This interaction is important for recruiting other proteins and modulating their functions, such as in DNA repair and transcription regulation (Yau2021SUMO).

SUMO3, along with SUMO2, can form poly-SUMO chains, which are involved in stress response and other cellular processes. These chains are formed through interactions with specific sequences in the N-terminal extensions of SUMO2/3 (Johnson2004Protein).
