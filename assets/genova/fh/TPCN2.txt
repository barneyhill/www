# TPCN2

## Overview
TPCN2 is a gene that encodes the two-pore segment channel 2 (TPC2), a transmembrane protein that belongs to the two-pore channel family. TPC2 is primarily localized to the membranes of lysosomes and endosomes, where it plays a critical role in regulating the flow of calcium (Ca²⁺) and sodium (Na⁺) ions. This ion channel is integral to various cellular processes, including endocytic and endo/lysosomal membrane trafficking, autophagy, and maintaining ionic homeostasis within acidic organelles (She2019Structural; Tong2021Lysosomal). TPC2 is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) and is involved in the physiological functions of the endolysosome, such as vesicular trafficking and fusion processes (She2019Structural; Grimm2014High). Mutations in the TPCN2 gene have been linked to various diseases, including a form of albinism and Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Tong2021Lysosomal; Wang2023A).

## Structure
TPCN2, also known as two-pore segment channel 2, is a protein that forms part of the two-pore channel family. The protein is characterized by having two homologous six-transmembrane domains (6-TM I and 6-TM II) within each subunit, which contribute to its dimeric structure (She2019Structural). The transmembrane region is domain-swapped, with the S1-S4 voltage-sensing domain (VSD) from one 6-TM interacting with the S5-S6 pore domain from the neighboring 6-TM (She2019Structural). 

The primary structure of TPCN2 includes specific residues that form constriction points, determining its Na+ selectivity (She2019Structural). The secondary structure features helices, such as the IS6 helix, which undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding, crucial for the gating mechanism (She2019Structural). 

In terms of quaternary structure, TPCN2 forms homodimers, which are essential for its function as an ion channel (She2019Structural). The protein is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2), which binds at the junction formed by IS3, IS4, and the IS4-S5 linker, interacting with multiple basic residues (She2019Structural). 

Post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, have been observed in the pore regions of TPCN2, which may influence its activity and stability (Penny2016Isolated).

## Function
TPCN2 encodes a protein that functions as a two-pore channel (TPC2), primarily involved in the regulation of calcium (Ca²⁺) and sodium (Na⁺) ion flow within lysosomes and endosomes. In healthy human cells, TPC2 is crucial for NAADP-mediated calcium release from lysosomal stores, which is essential for various cellular processes, including endocytic and endo/lysosomal membrane trafficking events like autophagy (Tong2021Lysosomal). TPC2 is localized to the endolysosomal membrane and plays a significant role in maintaining ionic homeostasis within these acidic organelles (She2019Structural).

The activity of TPC2 facilitates the fusion of endolysosomal structures through small Ca²⁺ fluxes, which is vital for proper autophagy-lysosome fusion and lysosomal pH balance (Tong2021Lysosomal). TPC2 is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) and is involved in regulating physiological functions of the endolysosome, including vesicular trafficking and fusion processes (She2019Structural; Grimm2014High). This channel is also implicated in the trafficking and degradation of macromolecules such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, which is crucial for maintaining hepatic cholesterol homeostasis and preventing liver diseases (Grimm2014High).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TPCN2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A gain-of-function mutation, R210C, in the TPCN2 gene is associated with a unique form of albinism characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance. This mutation increases the affinity of TPC2 to the endogenous agonist PI(3,5)P2, leading to increased Ca2+ release and lysosomal acidification, which affects melanosomes and results in hypopigmentation due to decreased melanin production (Wang2023A).

In the context of cancer, specific genetic variants in the TPCN2 gene have been linked to cancer risk and progression. The rs3750965:GG genotype is associated with a slightly lower risk of developing cancer, while the rs35264875:TA and rs72932540:GA genotypes are linked to an increased risk of cancer susceptibility. The rs35264875:TA genotype is also associated with lower odds of metastatic cancer (Alharbi2021The).

In Alzheimer's disease, a gain-of-function mutation in TPCN2 leads to excessive activity of a putative Ca2+/H+ exchanger, resulting in lysosomal alkalization and impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, contributing to amyloid plaque accumulation and memory deficits (Tong2021Lysosomal).

## Interactions
TPCN2, also known as Two-Pore Channel 2, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in cellular processes. TPCN2 interacts with SNARE proteins, which are crucial for membrane fusion events. These interactions facilitate the fusion of vesicles with target membranes, a process that is regulated by calcium ions (Ca2+) (Krogsaeter2019The). TPCN2 is also associated with Rab7, a protein involved in endolysosomal tethering and fusion machinery, suggesting its role in endosomal trafficking (Ambrosio2015TPC2).

In addition to SNARE proteins, TPCN2 interacts with Annexins, specifically ANXA1 and ANXA2, which are Ca2+-activated membrane-binding proteins. These interactions are important for Ca2+-dependent processes within the cell (Krogsaeter2019The). TPCN2 is also implicated in the trafficking of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, indicating its involvement in endosomal transport and viral uptake (Krogsaeter2019The).

Furthermore, TPCN2 forms homomeric complexes but does not form heteromers with TPCN1, highlighting its specific protein-protein interaction profile (Zong2009The). These interactions underscore TPCN2's role in calcium signaling pathways and its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
