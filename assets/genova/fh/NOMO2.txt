# NOMO2

## Overview
NOMO2, or NODAL modulator 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the modulation of NODAL signaling pathways, which are critical for various developmental and cellular processes. The protein encoded by NOMO2 is categorized as a modulator, playing a significant role in regulating the activity of NODAL, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins. This modulation is crucial for embryonic development and cellular differentiation. Alterations in the expression or function of NOMO2 have been linked to several pathological conditions, including cancer and glaucoma, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological and disease contexts (Schueler2019Induction; Moazzeni2019Identification).

## Clinical Significance
NOMO2 (NODAL modulator 2) has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mutations in NOMO2 are associated with acquired resistance to the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib, potentially through increased Nodal signaling, which is linked to poor prognosis (Schueler2019Induction). In ovarian cancer, copy number variations (CNVs) in NOMO2 have been detected in patients resistant to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting a role in chemotherapy resistance (Sharbatoghli2022Copy). 

In oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC), higher NOMO2 expression correlates with poorer prognosis, indicating its potential role in tumor progression (Liang2023Mutationassociated). NOMO2 has also been identified as a gene potentially involved in glaucoma pathogenesis, with its regulation by transcription factors like PITX2 affecting NODAL signaling pathways relevant to the disease (Moazzeni2019Identification). These findings suggest that NOMO2 may serve as a biomarker for certain cancers and contribute to the understanding of complex diseases like glaucoma.
