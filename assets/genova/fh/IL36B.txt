# IL36B

## Overview
IL36B is a gene that encodes the protein interleukin 36 beta (IL-36β), a member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokine family. IL-36β is primarily involved in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation, functioning as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. It is expressed in various cell types, including epithelial cells, myeloid immune cells, T cells, and neurons. The protein plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and enhancing antiviral immunity by modulating signaling pathways such as NF-κB and MAPK through its interaction with the IL-36 receptor complex. This interaction is essential for the activation of downstream signaling cascades that lead to the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. IL-36β is also implicated in the modulation of autophagy-related pathways, particularly in CD8+ T cells, thereby influencing antitumor immune responses (Peñaloza2021Interleukin36; Han2020IL36).

## Function
IL36B, or interleukin 36 beta, is a cytokine that plays a significant role in the immune response and inflammation. It is part of the IL-1 family and is primarily expressed in epithelial cells, myeloid immune cells, T cells, and neurons. IL-36β is involved in signaling through the IL-36 receptor IL-1R6, activating NF-κB and MAPK pathways in a MyD88-dependent manner. This signaling involves forming a ternary complex with the accessory protein IL-1R3, which recruits MyD88, IRAK1, and TOLLIP, leading to the activation of pro-inflammatory pathways (Han2020IL36).

IL-36β is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, particularly at physiological barriers, and plays a protective role against microbial and viral infections. It enhances antiviral immunity by increasing type I IFN receptor expression, which is vital for effective interferon signaling. In models of HSV-1 infection, IL-36β promotes antiviral immunity by increasing type I IFN receptor expression, and IL-36β-deficient mice exhibit impaired IFN responses and increased viral replication in skin keratinocytes (Han2020IL36).

IL-36β also modulates autophagy-related pathways in CD8+ T cells, enhancing their antitumor function through the mTORC1 pathway. This suggests a role in immune response modulation and inflammation in human cells (Han2020IL36).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IL36B gene, which encodes interleukin 36 beta, have been implicated in several inflammatory diseases. In psoriasis, IL-36β is significantly upregulated, contributing to the disease's pathogenesis by promoting keratinocyte activation and inflammatory responses (Müller2018IκBζ; Mahil2017An). The cytokine is involved in a feedforward loop that sustains inflammation in psoriatic lesions, and its expression is linked to psoriasis susceptibility loci (Mahil2017An).

In rheumatoid arthritis, elevated levels of IL-36β have been observed in synovial tissues, suggesting a role in the inflammatory processes of the disease (Swindell2018RNASeq). IL-36β is also associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, where it is produced in inflamed mucosa and contributes to intestinal inflammation through NF-κB and MAPK activation (Han2020IL36).

The dysregulation of IL-36β can lead to excessive inflammation, exacerbating conditions like hidradenitis suppurativa and atopic dermatitis, where elevated levels of IL-36 cytokines have been detected in lesional skin (Neurath2020IL36). These findings highlight the potential of IL-36β as a therapeutic target in various inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
IL36B, or interleukin 36 beta, is a cytokine that interacts with the IL-1Rrp2/IL-1RAcP receptor complex to initiate inflammatory signaling pathways. Once cleaved and activated, IL36B binds to the IL-1Rrp2 receptor, which is expressed on various immune cells. This binding recruits the accessory protein IL-1RAcP, forming a receptor-ligand complex that triggers an intracellular signaling cascade. This cascade involves the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as MyD88 and IRAK, leading to the activation of NF-kB and MAPK pathways, which promote the expression of proinflammatory genes (Peñaloza2021Interleukin36; Han2020IL36).

IL36B is also involved in activating the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) through the MyD88/IKK/PI3K/Akt pathway, enhancing the antitumor function of CD8+ T cells (Han2020IL36). It is expressed in epithelial cells and various immune cells, playing a role in protective immune responses against pathogens by promoting type I IFN receptor expression and antiviral immunity (Han2020IL36). IL36B's interactions with these pathways highlight its role in modulating immune responses and inflammation. However, specific physical interactions of IL36B with nucleic acids are not detailed in the available literature.
