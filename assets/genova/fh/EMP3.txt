# EMP3

## Overview
The EMP3 gene encodes the epithelial membrane protein 3, a transmembrane glycoprotein that is part of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) family. This protein is characterized by its four hydrophobic transmembrane domains, which contribute to its multi-pass structure within the lipid bilayer, and is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane organization and regulation of tight junctions (Thornton2020Disruption; Mellai2017EMP3). EMP3 is expressed in a wide range of human tissues and plays a significant role in erythropoiesis by interacting with CD44, stabilizing it in the plasma membrane, and potentially regulating signaling complexes (Thornton2020Disruption). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as EGFR and integrins, suggest its involvement in receptor trafficking and cell motility, which are critical in cancer progression (Martija2023EMP3; Martija2021The). Alterations in EMP3 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it can function as either a tumor suppressor or an oncogene, depending on the context (Li2024EMP3; Xue2013Epithelial).

## Structure
The epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3) is a transmembrane glycoprotein consisting of 163 to 165 amino acids, depending on the source, and is a member of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene family (Zhang2022Unraveling; Mellai2017EMP3). EMP3 features four hydrophobic transmembrane domains, which are located at amino acid residues 4 to 24, 66 to 86, 100 to 120, and 139 to 159 (Mellai2017EMP3). These domains contribute to its multi-pass structure within the lipid bilayer (Mellai2017EMP3).

The protein contains two extracellular loops, with the first loop harboring N-linked glycosylation sites at positions Asn47 and Asn56, which are crucial for its glycosylation (Mellai2017EMP3; Christians2019Characterization). EMP3 also has phosphorylation sites, including S2, S9, and T23, and an N-myristoylation region, but lacks a casein kinase 2 phosphorylation site (Zhang2022Unraveling).

EMP3 is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 19q13.33 and is composed of five exons, producing at least nine different alternative splicing isoforms (Mellai2017EMP3). The protein is primarily localized to the cell membrane but also shows partial localization in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Christians2019Characterization). Its structure and post-translational modifications play significant roles in its function in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Mellai2017EMP3).

## Function
The EMP3 gene encodes epithelial membrane protein 3, a member of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) family, characterized by four transmembrane domains. EMP3 is involved in various cellular functions, particularly related to membrane organization and regulation of tight junctions (Thornton2020Disruption). It is expressed in a wide range of human tissues, including haematopoietic tissues, and plays a role in erythropoiesis by interacting with CD44 in erythroid cells. EMP3 stabilizes CD44 in the plasma membrane, potentially regulating the formation of a signaling complex by controlling the incorporation of CD44 into lipid rafts (Thornton2020Disruption).

In erythroid cells, EMP3 acts as a suppressor of proliferation. In vitro studies have shown that EMP3-deficient cultures exhibit increased proliferation compared to controls, suggesting that EMP3 normally suppresses erythroid cell proliferation (Thornton2020Disruption). Despite this, individuals lacking EMP3 do not show signs of erythrocytosis in vivo, indicating compensatory mechanisms may exist (Thornton2020Disruption). EMP3 is also involved in the regulation of CD44 expression on erythroid progenitors, influencing cell proliferation and maturation (Thornton2020Disruption). The protein's role in healthy human cells includes contributing to membrane assembly and possibly regulating cell proliferation, similar to other members of its protein family (Thornton2020Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EMP3 gene have been implicated in various cancers, demonstrating its dual role as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the cancer type. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), EMP3 expression is upregulated and correlates with poor prognosis. High levels of EMP3 are associated with more malignant glioma subtypes, and its expression is an independent risk factor for overall survival in glioma patients. EMP3 is also linked to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, promoting tumor progression and drug resistance (Li2024EMP3).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EMP3 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Its expression is frequently decreased in cancerous tissues, and lower EMP3 levels are associated with higher tumor stages and poorer prognosis. The study suggests that EMP3's reduced expression is linked to increased cell proliferation and cancer development (Xue2013Epithelial).

In upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma, EMP3 overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and migration, implicating it in cancer progression through the ErbB2-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway (Wang2014Potential). EMP3's role in these pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
EMP3 (epithelial membrane protein 3) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cell signaling and cancer progression. EMP3 is extensively glycosylated, with N-glycosylation sites at positions N47 and N56, which are crucial for its function and interactions (Christians2019Characterization). It primarily localizes to the cell membrane and interacts with several proteins involved in signal transduction and trafficking.

EMP3 has been shown to interact with proteins such as FLOT1, HTATIP2, RAP2A, and PLP2, with these interactions being validated through Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) assays. These interactions are mainly observed in cytoplasmic and membrane compartments (Christians2019Characterization). EMP3 also interacts with the purinergic receptor P2X7 and TGFBR2, playing a role in regulating PI3K-AKT signaling (Christians2019Characterization).

In glioblastoma cells, EMP3 interacts with EGFR and several endocytic trafficking regulators, including components of clathrin-coated vesicles, retromer, and SNARE complexes. These interactions suggest a role in regulating receptor trafficking and degradation, particularly by restricting RAB7-mediated degradation of EGFR in cooperation with TBC1D5 (Martija2023EMP3). EMP3's interaction with CD44 and integrins further highlights its role in stabilizing membrane receptors and influencing cell motility and tumor progression (Martija2021The).
