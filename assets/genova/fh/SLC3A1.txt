# SLC3A1

## Overview
The SLC3A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 3 member 1, also known as rBAT (related to b0,+ amino acid transporter). This protein is a type II transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the heterodimeric amino acid transporter system b0,+, which is responsible for the Na+-independent transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids across epithelial cell membranes in the kidneys and intestines (Liu2022Clinical; Ellingsen2021The). The rBAT protein forms a heterodimer with the b0,+AT1 protein, encoded by the SLC7A9 gene, and this complex is essential for the reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids, preventing their excessive excretion and maintaining amino acid balance (Li2020Genetic; Wu2020Structural). Mutations in the SLC3A1 gene are associated with cystinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the formation of cystine stones due to defective amino acid transport (Guillén2000Association; Botzenhart2002Cystinuria).

## Structure
The SLC3A1 gene encodes the rbAT protein, a heavy chain subunit of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family. The primary structure of rbAT consists of 685 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 85 kDa when glycosylated and 78 kDa when unglycosylated (Wagner2001Function). The protein is classified as a type II membrane protein, initially thought to have a single transmembrane helix, but studies suggest it may contain four transmembrane helices (Wagner2001Function). 

The tertiary structure of rbAT includes a (β/α)8 TIM-barrel fold followed by eight antiparallel β-sheets, featuring a unique cation-binding site within subdomain B, which is crucial for dimerization and may involve a Ca2+ ion (Wu2020Structural). The quaternary structure involves forming a heterotetrameric complex with two heavy and two light chain subunits, specifically with the b(0,+)AT1 transporter, which adopts a LeuT fold (Wu2020Structural). 

Post-translational modifications include heavy glycosylation, indicating a significant portion of the COOH terminus is extracellular (Wagner2001Function). The protein's glycosylation is essential for its stability and function, facilitating its role in amino acid transport across cell membranes (Wu2020Structural).

## Function
The SLC3A1 gene encodes the rBAT protein, which is a crucial component of the heterodimeric amino acid transporter system b0,+. This system is responsible for the high-affinity, Na+-independent transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids, such as ornithine, lysine, and arginine, across the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the small intestine and renal proximal tubules (Liu2023Novel; Liu2022Clinical; Ellingsen2021The). The rBAT protein, encoded by SLC3A1, forms a heterodimer with the b0,+AT protein, encoded by the SLC7A9 gene, through a covalent disulfide bond. This bond is essential for the proper expression, trafficking, and stability of the transporter complex (Li2020Genetic; Lee2023Interpretation).

In healthy human cells, the SLC3A1 gene plays a vital role in the reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the kidneys and intestines, preventing their excessive excretion into the urine and maintaining amino acid balance (Liu2023Novel; Kandasamy2018Amino). This function is critical for preventing cystinuria, a condition characterized by the formation of cystine stones due to defective renal reabsorption of cystine (Liu2022Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC3A1 gene are primarily associated with cystinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the excessive excretion of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the urine, leading to the formation of cystine stones in the kidneys, ureter, and bladder (Botzenhart2002Cystinuria; Saadi1998Molecular). The SLC3A1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a transporter for cystine and dibasic amino acids, and mutations in this gene disrupt the reabsorption process, resulting in increased cystine excretion (Guillén2000Association).

Cystinuria is classified into different types based on the genetic mutations involved. Type I cystinuria is associated with mutations in the SLC3A1 gene, where heterozygotes typically exhibit normal amino acid excretion patterns, indicating an autosomal recessive inheritance (FontLlitjos2005New). The M467T mutation in SLC3A1 is notably frequent among cystinuria patients and is a significant contributor to the disorder (Botzenhart2002Cystinuria; FontLlitjos2005New).

The genetic heterogeneity of cystinuria is highlighted by the presence of numerous mutations in the SLC3A1 gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing defects, which contribute to the complexity of the disease (FontLlitjos2005New). Understanding these mutations is crucial for elucidating the genotype-phenotype correlation and the role of digenic inheritance in cystinuria (FontLlitjos2005New).

## Interactions
The SLC3A1 gene encodes a protein that forms a heterodimer with SLC7A9, creating the amino acid transport system b0,+. This complex is essential for the high-affinity, Na+-independent transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the kidney and intestine. The interaction between SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 is crucial for their function, as SLC3A1 is rapidly degraded in the absence of SLC7A9, while SLC7A9 remains stable without SLC3A1. Both subunits are necessary for the apical surface expression of the transporter (Wu2020Structural; Ellingsen2021The).

The SLC3A1 protein, also known as rBAT, is involved in the assembly of tetrameric heteromeric amino acid transporter complexes. It shares structural features with 4F2hc, including a (β/α)8 TIM-barrel fold and additional motifs. The dimerization of rBAT protomers is mediated by interactions within subdomain B, forming a unique dimerization motif (Wu2020Structural). The interaction between SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 involves van der Waals contacts and a conserved intermolecular disulfide bond, which are essential for the transporter's function and stability (Wu2020Structural). These interactions are critical for the proper functioning of the amino acid transport system and are implicated in conditions such as cystinuria when disrupted (Wu2020Structural).
