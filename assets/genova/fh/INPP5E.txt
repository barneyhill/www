# INPP5E

## Overview
The INPP5E gene encodes the enzyme inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E, a crucial phosphatase involved in phosphoinositide metabolism and cellular signaling. This enzyme is primarily localized to the ciliary membrane, where it plays a vital role in maintaining ciliary stability and function by regulating phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways. INPP5E is integral to processes such as Hedgehog signaling and T-cell activation, highlighting its importance in both developmental and immune functions (Chiu2023INPP5E; Zhang2022INPP5E). Structurally, the protein features a conserved catalytic domain and a C-terminal CaaX motif, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and membrane localization (Kösling2017Mechanism; Sharif2021Deletion). Mutations in INPP5E are linked to ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome, underscoring its significance in ciliary function and human health (Humbert2012ARL13B; Jacoby2009INPP5E).

## Structure
The INPP5E protein is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function. It contains an N-terminal proline-rich domain with an SH3-binding motif and 12 PXXP motifs, which are important for protein-protein interactions (Jacoby2009INPP5E). The protein also features a large phosphatase active site encoded by exons 3 to 9, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Sharif2021Deletion). The catalytic domain, spanning residues 273-621, is highly conserved and essential for the protein's function, with many pathogenic variants located within this domain (Sangermano2021Broadening).

The C-terminal region of INPP5E includes a CaaX motif, which is involved in farnesylation, a post-translational modification that facilitates membrane anchoring and ciliary localization (Thomas2013A; Kösling2017Mechanism). The protein's tertiary structure has been modeled for the C-terminal 349 amino acids, with the N-terminal half classified as a disordered region (Sangermano2021Broadening). INPP5E exists in two splice variant isoforms: a full-length variant that is membrane-anchored and a shorter, soluble variant lacking exon 10 and the CaaX box (Sharif2021Deletion). These structural features are critical for INPP5E's role in ciliary function and signaling.

## Function
The INPP5E gene encodes the enzyme inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase E, which plays a critical role in phosphoinositide metabolism, particularly in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, INPP5E is primarily active in the ciliary membrane, where it is essential for maintaining ciliary stability and function. It hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) to generate phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), creating a specific phosphoinositide environment necessary for signaling processes such as Hedgehog signaling (Jacoby2009INPP5E; Zhang2022INPP5E).

INPP5E is also involved in T-cell activation by regulating the distribution of phosphoinositides at the immune synapse. It interacts with the TCR/CD3 complex, influencing the recruitment and phosphorylation of CD3ζ and ZAP-70, which are crucial for T-cell signaling. This regulation affects the secretion of IL-2 and the translocation of NFκB, indicating its importance in early T-cell signaling and immune response coordination (Chiu2023INPP5E).

Mutations in INPP5E are associated with ciliopathies, such as Joubert syndrome, due to its role in ciliary function and stability. These mutations can lead to defects in ciliary signaling and structure, highlighting the gene's importance in cellular signaling and development (Humbert2012ARL13B; Jacoby2009INPP5E).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the INPP5E gene are associated with a range of ciliopathies, including Joubert syndrome (JBTS) and MORM syndrome. Joubert syndrome is characterized by neurological symptoms, such as hypotonia, ataxia, and developmental delay, often accompanied by retinal degeneration (Travaglini2013Phenotypic; Sangermano2021Broadening). INPP5E mutations in JBTS patients often involve missense changes affecting conserved amino-acid residues within the phosphatase domain, leading to defects in ciliary function (Travaglini2013Phenotypic). MORM syndrome, another condition linked to INPP5E mutations, is characterized by mental retardation, obesity, retinal dystrophy, and micropenis, resulting from primary cilium signaling defects and ciliary instability (Jacoby2009INPP5E).

Recent studies have expanded the phenotypic spectrum of INPP5E-related diseases to include non-syndromic inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs), such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and rod-cone degeneration (RCD). These conditions are marked by early-onset retinal degeneration, with LCA presenting severe symptoms like nystagmus and retinal atrophy, while RCD is associated with milder symptoms such as nyctalopia (Sangermano2021Broadening; Sangermano2020Early). The broad range of phenotypes suggests that genetic modifiers may influence the clinical manifestations of INPP5E mutations (Sangermano2021Broadening).

## Interactions
INPP5E interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling and ciliary function. It forms a complex with CD3ζ, ZAP-70, and Lck at the immune synapse, which is essential for T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. This interaction is important for the recruitment of CD3ζ and the phosphorylation of ZAP-70, facilitating T-cell activation (Chiu2023INPP5E).

INPP5E also interacts with AURKA (Aurora kinase A), a centrosomal kinase involved in ciliary disassembly. AURKA phosphorylates INPP5E, enhancing its phosphatase activity, which in turn regulates AURKA transcription through an AKT-dependent mechanism. This interaction is significant for maintaining primary cilia stability and is implicated in diseases such as Joubert Syndrome (Plotnikova2014INPP5E).

In the context of ciliary targeting, INPP5E interacts with ARL13B and PDE6D. ARL13B is required for INPP5E's ciliary localization, while PDE6D assists in its membrane association. The interaction between INPP5E and PDE6D is dependent on the C-terminal CaaX motif of INPP5E (Humbert2012ARL13B). These interactions highlight INPP5E's role in phosphoinositide signaling and ciliary function.
