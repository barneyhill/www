# ZNF121

## Overview
ZNF121 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 121, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger motifs, which are critical for DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression and plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. ZNF121 interacts with key proteins such as ZBRK1, BRCA1, and MYC, influencing pathways related to cancer biology and cellular homeostasis (Luo2016Zinc; Luo2018ZNF121). The gene's expression and interactions have been implicated in breast cancer and intervertebral disc degeneration, highlighting its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Luo2016Zinc; Yuan2020Exosomes).

## Function
ZNF121 (zinc finger protein 121) is a zinc finger transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, primarily functioning in the nucleus where it influences gene expression. It interacts with several key proteins, including ZBRK1 and BRCA1, to regulate target genes in mammary epithelial cells. This interaction suggests a role in transcriptional regulation and DNA repair processes, as both ZBRK1 and BRCA1 are involved in these cellular functions (Luo2018ZNF121). ZNF121 forms a complex with ZBRK1 and BRCA1 to regulate the expression of genes such as ANG1, which is involved in cancer-related pathways. In breast epithelial cells, ZNF121 overexpression reduces ANG1 mRNA levels, indicating its role in gene expression regulation (Luo2018ZNF121).

ZNF121 also interacts with the MYC oncoprotein, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis. This interaction occurs through their N-terminal regions and influences the expression of MYC and its target genes, suggesting a regulatory feedback loop. In epithelial cells, ZNF121 knockdown leads to reduced MYC expression and cell cycle arrest, highlighting its role in cell cycle regulation (Luo2016Zinc). These interactions and regulatory functions underscore ZNF121's involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer biology.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF121 has been implicated in breast cancer, particularly in the luminal A subtype, where its upregulation is associated with poorer patient survival. The gene interacts with the MYC oncoprotein, a key regulator of cell proliferation, and this interaction affects the expression levels of both proteins, suggesting a regulatory relationship. Knockdown of ZNF121 in breast epithelial cell lines results in decreased cell proliferation, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis (Luo2016Zinc). ZNF121 is also involved in the regulation of genes associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, interacting with proteins such as ZBRK1 and BRCA1 (Luo2018ZNF121).

In intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD), ZNF121 expression is down-regulated, and this is exacerbated by the upregulation of miR-4450, which targets ZNF121. This interaction leads to increased apoptosis and inflammatory responses in nucleus pulposus cells, contributing to the progression of IDD. Therapeutic strategies involving the inhibition of miR-4450 have been shown to up-regulate ZNF121, thereby alleviating IDD symptoms and improving cell proliferation and migration (Yuan2020Exosomes). These findings suggest that alterations in ZNF121 expression and its interactions play significant roles in the pathogenesis of these conditions.

## Interactions
ZNF121, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with ZBRK1 and BRCA1 in mammary epithelial cells. The interaction with ZBRK1 was identified using a yeast two-hybrid assay and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation in 293T cells. This interaction is crucially mediated by the zinc finger region of ZBRK1. ZNF121 also interacts with BRCA1, with the BR-2 region of BRCA1 mediating this interaction. These interactions suggest that ZNF121 may regulate target genes in mammary epithelial cells through its association with ZBRK1 and BRCA1 (Luo2018ZNF121).

ZNF121 also interacts with the MYC oncoprotein, affecting MYC's expression and function. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal regions of both proteins and has been shown to influence cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in breast cancer. Overexpression of ZNF121 increases MYC levels, while knockdown decreases it, indicating a regulatory relationship (Luo2016Zinc).

In the context of intervertebral disc degeneration, ZNF121 is targeted by miR-4450, which negatively regulates its expression. Inhibition of miR-4450 leads to upregulation of ZNF121, reducing apoptosis and inflammation in nucleus pulposus cells (Yuan2020Exosomes).
