# TPSD1

## Overview
TPSD1 is a gene located on chromosome 16 that encodes the protein tryptase delta 1, a member of the trypsin subfamily of serine peptidases. Despite its classification, tryptase delta 1 is largely inactive due to a premature stop codon that results in a truncated protein lacking a significant portion of its active site (Atiakshin2018Tryptase; Lyons2021Mast). This truncation leads to the absence of essential substrate binding residues, distinguishing it from other active tryptases such as α-tryptase (Goettig2019Surface). Tryptase delta 1 is primarily synthesized in mast cells located in the large intestine, lungs, and heart, suggesting a specific tissue distribution (Atiakshin2018Tryptase). Although it does not exhibit typical catalytic activity, the gene's expression has been associated with various inflammatory conditions, indicating a potential role in inflammatory processes (Tsuchiya2023Increase).

## Structure
TPSD1, encoding δ-tryptase, is a gene located on chromosome 16. The protein product of TPSD1 is characterized by a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated form that lacks a significant portion of its active site, rendering it largely inactive (Atiakshin2018Tryptase; Lyons2021Mast). The δ-tryptase shares approximately 80% structural similarity with α-tryptase, but due to the truncation of 40 C-terminal residues, it lacks essential substrate binding residues (Goettig2019Surface).

The primary structure of δ-tryptase includes specific motifs typical of the trypsin subfamily of serine peptidases, such as 'GDSGGP' for serine, 'TAAHC' for histidine, and 'DIMLL' for aspartate, which are crucial for the enzyme's function (Yousef2004Sequence). However, due to the truncation, δ-tryptase does not exhibit the typical catalytic activity associated with these motifs.

In terms of quaternary structure, tryptases generally form tetramers, but the biological inactivity of δ-tryptase suggests it may not participate in such assemblies effectively (Lyons2021Mast). The protein is primarily synthesized in mast cells of the large intestine, lungs, and heart, indicating a specific tissue distribution (Atiakshin2018Tryptase).

## Clinical Significance
The TPSD1 gene has been implicated in various inflammatory conditions, particularly in the context of hip osteoarthritis (HOA) in overweight patients. Increased expression of TPSD1 in the synovium of these patients is associated with inflammatory processes that contribute to joint degradation. This upregulation is linked to the role of β-tryptase in producing inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL6, which are known to exacerbate inflammation in osteoarthritis (Tsuchiya2023Increase). The study suggests that the elevated expression of TPSD1 in overweight individuals with HOA may be due to a higher number or ratio of mast cells in the synovial tissue, although the expression levels in mast cells themselves do not differ significantly between normal and overweight patients. This indicates that non-mast cell populations might also contribute to the increased TPSD1 expression (Tsuchiya2023Increase).

Additionally, TPSD1 expression is elevated in other conditions such as aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and regenerative rotator cuff tear, suggesting a broader role in inflammatory diseases (Tsuchiya2023Increase). Despite being largely inactive due to a premature stop codon, the increased expression of TPSD1 might indicate heightened mast cell activity, contributing to the pathogenesis of these inflammatory conditions (Tsuchiya2023Increase).
