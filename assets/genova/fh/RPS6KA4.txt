# RPS6KA4

## Overview
RPS6KA4 is a gene that encodes the protein ribosomal protein S6 kinase A4, a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family. This protein is characterized by its two non-identical kinase domains and is primarily activated by the MAPK pathway, specifically through ERK1 and ERK2. Ribosomal protein S6 kinase A4 plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation. It is involved in the phosphorylation of substrates that influence gene expression and cell growth, and it plays a significant role in the p53 pathway, mediating cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage (Lee2007p90). Additionally, RPS6KA4 is implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers, where its expression levels can serve as prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets (Kuk2024Prognostic).

## Function
RPS6KA4, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase A4, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is a member of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family, which is characterized by two non-identical kinase domains. These kinases are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation (Lee2007p90). RPS6KA4 is activated primarily by the MAPK pathway, specifically through ERK1 and ERK2, and is involved in the phosphorylation of substrates that influence gene expression and cell growth (Lee2007p90).

In healthy human cells, RPS6KA4 is implicated in the p53 pathway, where it mediates cell cycle arrest by influencing the expression of p21 cip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. This function is crucial for the cellular response to DNA damage, such as that caused by ionizing radiation (Lee2007p90). RPS6KA4 also plays a role in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway, where it can activate histone H3 by phosphorylation, leading to increased transcription of genes like c-fos and c-jun, which are important for cell proliferation and differentiation (Zhang2023Establishment).

## Clinical Significance
RPS6KA4, also known as ribosomal protein S6 kinase A4, is implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. Alterations in the expression of RPS6KA4 have been associated with various cancers. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), RPS6KA4 is overexpressed in cases with perineural invasion, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. This overexpression is linked to poorer disease-specific survival, indicating its significance in OSCC progression (Kuk2024Prognostic). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), RPS6KA4 is highly expressed in cancer stem-like cells, contributing to radioresistance and poor survival outcomes. It is involved in the ΔNp63α/RSK4/GSK-3β axis, which enhances cancer stem cell properties and radioresistance, making it a potential therapeutic target (Li2020Ribosomal).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), RPS6KA4 is part of a prognostic risk model based on MAPK pathway-related genes. Its expression is associated with better prognosis and drug sensitivity, highlighting its potential role in influencing cancer progression and treatment response (Zhang2023Establishment). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RPS6KA4 in cancer biology.

## Interactions
RPS6KA4, also known as ribosomal S6 protein kinase 4 (RSK4), is involved in several protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. RSK4 is known to phosphorylate GSK-3β at Ser9, which is crucial for the stabilization of β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is important for maintaining cancer stem cell properties and radioresistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) (Li2020Ribosomal). RSK4 directly interacts with GSK-3β, as confirmed by GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays (Li2020Ribosomal). 

RSK4 is also a transcriptional target of ΔNp63α, a p63 isoform frequently amplified in ESCC. ΔNp63α directly transactivates RSK4 expression, enhancing cancer stem cell properties and radioresistance (Li2020Ribosomal). The interaction between RSK4 and GSK-3β is mediated by the N-terminal kinase domain of RSK4, and higher levels of phosphorylated GSK-3β are associated with worse clinical outcomes in ESCC (Li2020Ribosomal). 

These interactions highlight the role of RSK4 in modulating key signaling pathways, contributing to its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
