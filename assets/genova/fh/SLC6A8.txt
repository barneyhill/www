# SLC6A8

## Overview
The SLC6A8 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 6 member 8, a creatine transporter that is integral to cellular energy metabolism. This protein is a member of the solute carrier family 6 (SLC6), specifically within the GABA transporters (GATs) subfamily, and is characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, which facilitate the transport of creatine across cell membranes (Salazar2020Classification). The SLC6A8 protein plays a crucial role in tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain and muscles, by enabling the uptake of creatine, which is vital for ATP regeneration and energy homeostasis (Rosenberg2007Functional; Béard2010Synthesis). Mutations in the SLC6A8 gene can lead to creatine transporter deficiency, a condition associated with intellectual disabilities and neurological symptoms, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Clark2014Diagnostic; Betsalel2012Detection).

## Structure
The SLC6A8 gene encodes the creatine transporter, a member of the solute carrier family 6 (SLC6), specifically within the GABA transporters (GATs) subfamily. The protein is expected to contain 12 transmembrane domains, typical of SLC6 transporters, with small cytosolic N- and C-terminal domains (Salazar2020Classification). The secondary structure includes α-helices, with a notable π-helix identified in transmembrane helix 10 (TM10), which is crucial for substrate selectivity and binding (Colas2020Studies). 

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the membrane, forming a binding site that is highly complementary to the size and shape of its ligands (Colas2020Studies). Key residues such as C144 in TM3 and S479 in TM10 play significant roles in binding specificity and substrate orientation (Colas2020Studies). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for proper protein folding and trafficking, with pathogenic variants often leading to misfolding and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (Salazar2020Classification). The protein's quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins or forming homodimers, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The SLC6A8 gene encodes a creatine transporter protein that is essential for the uptake of creatine into cells, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the brain and muscles. This transporter facilitates the movement of creatine across cell membranes, which is crucial for energy storage and supply. In healthy human cells, the SLC6A8 protein supports cellular energy homeostasis by enabling the regeneration of ATP from ADP through the creatine/phosphocreatine system, which is vital for maintaining high energy levels necessary for various cellular functions (Rosenberg2007Functional; Béard2010Synthesis).

In the central nervous system, SLC6A8 is expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, but not in astrocytes, and is involved in the transport of creatine across the blood-brain barrier. This process is important for maintaining creatine homeostasis, which is essential for energy metabolism and neurotransmission in brain cells (Béard2010Synthesis; Braissant2010Dissociation). The transporter is also expressed in microcapillary endothelial cells, facilitating creatine uptake into the brain, although the blood-brain barrier's limited permeability means the brain relies significantly on its own creatine synthesis (Béard2010Synthesis; Braissant2008AGAT).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC6A8 gene, which encodes a protein responsible for creatine transport, lead to creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), a significant cause of X-linked intellectual disabilities. CTD is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, severe speech deficits, and sometimes autistic behaviors. Seizure disorders are also common, particularly in males, due to the X-linked nature of the disorder, although females can present with varying phenotypes (Clark2014Diagnostic; Mancini2004Two; Betsalel2012Detection).

The condition is part of the broader category of cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS), which also includes AGAT and GAMT deficiencies. These disorders are marked by cerebral creatine deficiency, detectable via brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and increased urinary creatine:creatinine ratios in males (Rosenberg2004High; Betsalel2012Detection).

Mutations in SLC6A8 can include missense mutations, splice site mutations, and deletions, all of which impair creatine transport and lead to reduced creatine levels in the brain. This deficiency is linked to intellectual disabilities and other neurological symptoms (Mancini2004Two; Rosenberg2004High). The prevalence of SLC6A8 mutations in X-linked mental retardation is significant, with estimates ranging from 0.8% to 2.1% in various studies (Rosenberg2004High; Clark2006Xlinked).

## Interactions
The SLC6A8 gene encodes a creatine transporter protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions. A study using the STRING database identified 49 proteins that interact with SLC6A8, highlighting its involvement in a complex network of interactions (Yang2022PanCancer). Among these interacting proteins, PNK1 and SGK1 were identified as common members between STRING-based interacting proteins and GEPIA-based correlated genes, suggesting a significant role in cellular pathways (Yang2022PanCancer).

The SLC6A8 protein is part of the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily, which is known for its involvement in transmembrane transport and interaction with various cellular components. The SLC family, including SLC6A8, shares interaction partners across different clusters, indicating functional relevance in cellular processes such as ion homeostasis and cell volume regulation (Frommelt2024The). The study of the SLC superfamily interactome also identified chaperones like HSP70 and HSP90 as significant interactors, particularly for SLC12A family members, suggesting a role in protein quality control, which may extend to SLC6A8 (Frommelt2024The). These interactions underscore the importance of SLC6A8 in maintaining cellular energy metabolism and its potential involvement in various signaling pathways.
