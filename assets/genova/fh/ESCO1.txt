# ESCO1

## Overview
ESCO1 is a human gene that encodes the enzyme establishment of sister chromatid cohesion N-acetyltransferase 1, a critical acetyltransferase involved in chromosomal dynamics. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the acetylation of the cohesin complex subunit SMC3, which is essential for the proper cohesion and segregation of sister chromatids during cell division (RiveraColón2016Molecular). The protein encoded by ESCO1 is categorized as an acetyltransferase and is integral to maintaining genomic stability by ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. ESCO1's function extends beyond the S phase of the cell cycle, as it is expressed throughout the entire cycle and can acetylate SMC3 independently of DNA replication (Minamino2015Esco1). The gene's activity is crucial for preventing premature chromatid separation, and its dysfunction has been linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance in cellular processes and disease (Zhang2015Increased; RiveraColón2016Molecular).

## Function
The ESCO1 gene encodes an acetyltransferase enzyme that plays a crucial role in the acetylation of the cohesin complex subunit SMC3, which is essential for the proper separation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis (RiveraColón2016Molecular). This acetylation is necessary for the cohesin complex to form a ring around sister chromatid pairs, ensuring correct chromosome segregation (RiveraColón2016Molecular). ESCO1 is expressed throughout the entire cell cycle and can acetylate SMC3 independently of DNA replication, highlighting its role in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion beyond the S phase (Minamino2015Esco1).

ESCO1 interacts with Pds5 proteins, which are essential for its localization to chromatin-bound cohesin complexes and for the acetylation process (Minamino2015Esco1). The interaction between ESCO1 and Pds5A and Pds5B is mediated through a conserved Pds5-binding domain, crucial for its function in sister chromatid cohesion (Minamino2015Esco1). The acetylation of SMC3 by ESCO1 is critical for stabilizing the chromatin association of sororin, a protein that regulates cohesin's function, thereby preventing premature separation of sister chromatids (Minamino2015Esco1). ESCO1's activity is vital for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, with mutations in its acetyltransferase domain linked to diseases such as endometrial cancer (RiveraColón2016Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ESCO1 gene have been implicated in several cancers. In endometrial cancer, somatic mutations in ESCO1 are found in a small percentage of tumors, with specific mutations like R786C and E338X potentially affecting protein function and contributing to chromosomal instability (Price2013Sequencing). ESCO1 mutations are also associated with endometrial cancers, where they may act as rare pathogenic driver mutations (Price2013Sequencing).

In bladder cancer, ESCO1 is often overexpressed, correlating with poor patient survival and aggressive tumor characteristics such as higher grade and stage. This overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation, reduced apoptosis, and enhanced migration and invasion of cancer cells, making ESCO1 a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in bladder cancer (Zhang2015Increased).

ESCO1 is also considered a susceptibility gene for prostate cancer, particularly in cases involving the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (Zhang2015Increased). The gene's role in maintaining genome integrity suggests that its dysfunction could contribute to broader genomic instability, impacting cancer development and progression (Kawasumi2017ESCO12’s).

## Interactions
ESCO1, a human gene encoding the enzyme establishment of sister chromatid cohesion N-acetyltransferase 1, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. ESCO1 interacts directly with the cohesin complex, which is essential for sister chromatid cohesion. This complex includes proteins such as SMC1, SMC3, and SCC1, and can also incorporate SA1 or SA2 to form a tetrameric structure. ESCO1 acetylates the SMC3 subunit, a process that is stimulated by the presence of ATP and DNA, which enhance the ATPase activity of SMC3, facilitating its acetylation (Ajam2020Alternative; Ajam2024Investigation).

ESCO1 also interacts with Pds5, a cohesin regulatory subunit, which is not observed for its homolog ESCO2. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing cohesin around single chromatids during interphase (Ajam2024Investigation). The presence of the SA1 subunit in the cohesin complex significantly enhances the rate of SMC3 acetylation by ESCO1 (Ajam2024Investigation).

Mutations in ESCO1, particularly at residues S809 and D810, disrupt its ability to acetylate SMC3, underscoring the importance of these residues for its catalytic activity (Ajam2020Alternative). These interactions highlight ESCO1's role in maintaining chromosomal stability and its involvement in critical cellular processes.
