# KCNAB2

## Overview
The KCNAB2 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A regulatory beta subunit 2, commonly referred to as Kvβ2. This protein is a regulatory component of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, which are crucial for the repolarization of the cell membrane following an action potential. Kvβ2 belongs to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and is characterized by its involvement in forming heteromeric complexes with Kvα subunits, particularly those from the Kv1 family, thereby modulating neuronal excitability and muscle contraction (Proepper2014The; Villa2016Potassium). The protein's structure includes a conserved C-terminal β-barrel fold, which is part of a triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel motif, allowing it to interact with a variety of substrates (Raph2019Biochemical). Kvβ2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in maintaining normal neuronal function and synaptic targeting, with its absence linked to increased neuronal excitability and seizures (Proepper2014The; Pongs2010Ancillary).

## Structure
The KCNAB2 gene encodes the Kvβ2 protein, a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels. Kvβ2 is part of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and consists of 367 amino acids (Proepper2014The). The protein features an N-terminal aldo-keto reductase activity region and a conserved C-terminal β-barrel structural fold with a tightly bound nicotinamide cofactor (Raph2019Biochemical). This β-barrel fold is part of a triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel motif, which provides flexibility in binding and metabolizing a wide range of substrates (Raph2019Biochemical).

Kvβ2 proteins form tetrameric complexes with Kv channels, contributing to their quaternary structure. The β1 and β2 regions, along with the α2-β5-α3 region, form the intersubunit interface for β tetramerization, while the α5-α6 region interacts with the T1 docking domains of Kvα proteins (Raph2019Biochemical). Kvβ2 lacks an inactivating N-terminus tail-like structure, unlike Kvβ1 and Kvβ3, but shares a common binding affinity to the α subunit T1 domain (Raph2019Biochemical). The protein is involved in synaptic targeting and interacts with ProSAP2/Shank3, suggesting a role in synaptic function (Proepper2014The).

## Function
The KCNAB2 gene encodes the Kvβ2 subunit, a regulatory component of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, which are essential for repolarizing the cell membrane following an action potential. Kvβ2 is primarily active in the cell membrane, where it modulates electrical signaling in neurons and muscle cells, influencing processes such as neurotransmitter release and muscle contraction (Villa2016Potassium).

Kvβ2 interacts with the pore-forming Kvα subunits, particularly those from the Kv1 family, to form heteromeric complexes that influence neuronal excitability. These complexes regulate action potential duration and threshold potential, with Kvβ2 shifting the activation curve to more negative membrane potentials (Pongs2010Ancillary). Kvβ2 also plays a role in the biosynthesis and surface expression of Kv channels by stabilizing the Kv1.2 α subunit, promoting its proper folding and glycosylation, and facilitating its exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (Shi1996βSubunits).

In the brain, Kvβ2 is the predominant ancillary subunit and is involved in maintaining normal neuronal function. Its absence can lead to increased neuronal excitability, seizures, and other physiological changes, highlighting its importance in regulating excitability and preventing excessive neuronal activity (Villa2016Potassium; Pongs2010Ancillary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KCNAB2 gene are associated with several neurological and cognitive disorders. The gene is linked to monosomy 1p36 deletion syndrome, a condition characterized by cognitive impairments ranging from moderate learning difficulties to severe mental retardation, as well as neurological abnormalities such as seizures. In mouse models, deletion of the Kcnab2 gene results in associative memory impairments and increased neuronal excitability in the amygdala, suggesting that the loss of KCNAB2 contributes to the cognitive and neurological impairments observed in patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome (Perkowski2011Deletion).

In humans, a homozygous missense variant in KCNAB2 has been identified in a patient with developmental delay and epilepsy, indicating that dysfunction in this gene is a significant risk factor for epileptic phenotypes. Hemizygous deletions of KCNAB2 in individuals with 1p36 syndrome have been linked to epilepsy or epileptiform activity, suggesting that haploinsufficiency of KCNAB2 contributes to these conditions (Prasad2018Clinical).

KCNAB2 also plays a role in hormone secretion in somatotroph pituitary adenomas. Alterations in its expression can affect growth hormone levels, with potential implications for conditions like acromegaly (Ashton2021Role).

## Interactions
KCNAB2 encodes the Kvβ2 subunit, which interacts with various proteins, playing a crucial role in modulating the activity of voltage-gated potassium channels. Kvβ2 interacts with the ProSAP2/Shank3 protein within the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons. This interaction is significant for synaptic anchoring and regulation of ion channels, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and may be linked to neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (Proepper2014The). 

Kvβ2 also associates with Kv1 α-subunits, including Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.4, and Kv1.6, but not with Kv2.1. This association is crucial for forming K+ channel complexes in the brain, influencing neuronal excitability and synaptic efficacy (Rhodes1997Association). Kvβ2 is more prevalent in these complexes compared to Kvβ1, and it is involved in the trafficking and surface expression of these channels (Proepper2014The; Rhodes1997Association).

In addition to protein interactions, KCNAB2 may interact with nucleic acids, such as the long noncoding RNA NEAT1, and components of the growth hormone signaling pathway, influencing hormone secretion in somatotroph pituitary adenomas (Ashton2021Role).
