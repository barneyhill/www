# GOLGA8N

## Overview
GOLGA8N is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member N, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are primarily involved in the structural organization and function of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or use within the cell. Golgin A8 family member N is implicated in various cellular processes, including vesicle tethering and membrane trafficking. The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several diseases, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in conditions such as osteoporosis, pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, and myocardial infarction (Wang2023Bioinformatics; Shi2021Comprehensive; Cucchi2020Harnessing; Feng2024Integration).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The GOLGA8N gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression or genetic mutations. In osteoporosis (OP), GOLGA8N is identified as a key gene related to glutamine and pyrimidine metabolism, potentially influencing bone reconstruction by affecting osteoblast and osteoclast activities. It is considered a promising biomarker for OP diagnosis and progression tracking (Wang2023Bioinformatics; Feng2024Integration).

In pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML), GOLGA8N expression is negatively correlated with drug resistance to 2-CdA, suggesting that higher expression levels may increase sensitivity to this drug (Cucchi2020Harnessing). The gene is also noted for its involvement in tumor suppression, particularly in controlling tumor proliferation and migration (Khan2022Crosscontinental).

GOLGA8N has been associated with myocardial infarction (MI), where its expression varies across different molecular subtypes, although its specific clinical significance in MI is not fully detailed (Shi2021Comprehensive). Additionally, GOLGA8N is part of a chromosomal region frequently amplified in rectal neuroendocrine tumors, indicating a potential role in cancer-related processes (Li2023Wholeexome).
