# AMPH

## Overview
The AMPH gene encodes the protein amphiphysin, which plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, particularly in neuronal cells. Amphiphysin is characterized by its N-terminal BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain, which is involved in membrane curvature and tubulation, and its C-terminal SH3 domain, which facilitates interactions with proline-rich motifs in other proteins such as dynamin and synaptojanin, essential for endocytosis (Miele2004Two; Zeno2019Structured). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, with amphiphysin 1 predominantly expressed in the brain and amphiphysin 2 more widely distributed across tissues (Wigge1997Amphiphysin; Miele2004Two). Amphiphysin's interactions and functions are modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can influence its role in cellular processes such as actin dynamics and membrane trafficking (Yamada2009Dynamic; Zeno2019Structured).

## Structure
Amphiphysin, encoded by the AMPH gene, is a protein involved in endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling. It features a structured N-terminal BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain. The BAR domain is crescent-shaped, facilitating membrane curvature and tubulation by assembling into cylindrical scaffolds on membrane surfaces (Zeno2019Structured). The SH3 domain interacts with proline-rich motifs, notably binding to dynamin and synaptojanin, which are crucial for endocytosis (Owen1998Crystal; Miele2004Two).

The SH3 domain of amphiphysin-2 (Amph2) has a compact, five-stranded, anti-parallel β-barrel structure, a common topology among SH3 domains. It includes unique features such as a large patch of negative electrostatic potential and two extra inserts, contributing to its substrate specificity and ability to prevent dynamin self-assembly (Owen1998Crystal). The n-Src loop, referred to as the dynamin assembly prevention sequence (DAPS), is crucial for preventing dynamin-dynamin interactions necessary for ring formation (Owen1998Crystal).

Amphiphysin exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, affecting its function and tissue distribution. Amphiphysin 1 is primarily expressed in the brain, while amphiphysin 2 is more widely distributed (Wigge1997Amphiphysin; Miele2004Two). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and functions (Zeno2019Structured).

## Function
Amphiphysin, encoded by the AMPH gene, is a protein primarily involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a critical process for synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons. It interacts with dynamin, a GTPase essential for the fission of vesicles from the plasma membrane, facilitating the internalization of synaptic vesicle membranes after exocytosis (Wigge1997Amphiphysin; David1996A). Amphiphysin contains an SH3 domain that binds to dynamin and the phosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin, and an N-terminal BAR domain that interacts with lipid bilayers to generate and sense membrane curvature (Yamada2009Dynamic).

In addition to its role in endocytosis, amphiphysin is involved in actin dynamics. It stimulates N-WASP-dependent Arp2/3 actin nucleation, which is crucial for actin polymerization, a process important for cellular events like morphogenesis, migration, and intracellular traffic (Yamada2009Dynamic). This interaction is enhanced by phosphatidylserine-containing liposomes, leading to ruffle formation on the cell surface (Yamada2009Dynamic). Amphiphysin's function in actin regulation is integral to its role as an endocytic adaptor and in membrane shaping during endocytosis (Yamada2009Dynamic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the AMPH gene, which encodes the protein amphiphysin, have been implicated in various neurological disorders. Amphiphysin is associated with synaptic vesicle endocytosis and membrane trafficking, and its dysfunction can lead to synaptic abnormalities. One of the primary conditions linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies is paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS), which can manifest in a range of neurological symptoms, including encephalitis, peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy, and cerebellar syndrome (Amano2023Case). These antibodies are often associated with underlying malignancies such as breast cancer, small-cell lung cancer, and, in some cases, gastric adenocarcinoma (Kwatra2021Bilateral; Amano2023Case).

Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS) and its variants, such as stiff-limb syndrome (SLS), are also linked to anti-amphiphysin antibodies. These conditions are characterized by muscle rigidity and spasms, often associated with impaired GABAergic neurotransmission (Gogia2021Case). The presence of anti-amphiphysin antibodies in these disorders suggests a direct pathogenic role, potentially causing synaptic dysfunction and internalization of synaptic complexes (Amano2023Case). Treatment strategies often involve immunotherapy and addressing the underlying malignancy, which can lead to symptom improvement (Amano2023Case).

## Interactions
Amphiphysin (AMPH) is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for its role in endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling. It interacts with dynamin, a GTPase crucial for vesicle scission, through its SH3 domain. This interaction is vital for recruiting dynamin to sites of endocytosis and facilitating its self-assembly into rings at clathrin-coated pits (Wigge1998The). Amphiphysin also binds to synaptojanin, a lipid phosphatase, which may regulate dynamin recruitment by occupying SH3 domains at the membrane (Wigge1998The).

Amphiphysin interacts with clathrin and adaptor protein complexes such as AP-1 and AP-2. It binds directly to clathrin through conserved sequences in its central region, although this interaction is mutually exclusive with dynamin binding (Wigge1998The). Amphiphysin's interaction with AP-1 is independent of clathrin, as demonstrated by co-localization and cross-linking experiments (huser2013role; Huser2013Interaction). The protein also interacts with the plasma-membrane adaptor complex AP-2 via its α subunit, which helps localize amphiphysin to the presynaptic plasma membrane (Wigge1998The).

In addition, amphiphysin forms heterodimers with Amph2, enhancing its ability to recruit multiple dynamin molecules to sites of endocytosis (Wigge1997Amphiphysin). These interactions position amphiphysin at the center of a network of protein-protein interactions crucial for endocytosis at nerve terminals.
