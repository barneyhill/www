# LUZP1

## Overview
LUZP1, or leucine zipper protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and function. The protein, also named LUZP1, is characterized by its leucine zipper motifs, which facilitate dimerization and oligomerization, essential for the assembly of actomyosin bundles (Wang2023LUZP1; Hyodo2022LUZP1). LUZP1 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, suggesting a significant role in neural development (Gonçalves2019LUZP1). Functionally, LUZP1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell division, migration, and ciliogenesis, by stabilizing actin filaments and interacting with other cytoskeletal proteins (Gonçalves2019LUZP1; BozalBasterra2021LUZP1). Clinically, mutations in the LUZP1 gene have been linked to disorders such as Townes-Brocks Syndrome and 1p36 deletion syndrome, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and developmental processes (BozalBasterra2019LUZP1; Gonçalves2019LUZP1).

## Structure
LUZP1 is a large protein with a molecular weight of approximately 120 kD. It contains three leucine zipper motifs at its N-terminus, which are crucial for its function in dimerization and oligomerization, facilitating the assembly of actomyosin bundles (Wang2023LUZP1; Hyodo2022LUZP1). The protein has two splice variants, consisting of 1076 and 1026 amino acids, which share identical sequences from residues 1-1024 but differ in their C-terminal regions (Wang2024LUZP1; Wang2023LUZP1). The longer isoform, LUZP1-1076, is more abundant in certain cell types, such as U2OS cells (Wang2023LUZP1).

The N-terminal region, including the leucine zipper motifs, is essential for localizing to thick actomyosin bundles, while the middle and C-terminal regions are associated with thin stress fibers (Wang2024LUZP1; Wang2023LUZP1). The protein also contains a coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus, contributing to its structural stability and interaction with other proteins (Hyodo2022LUZP1). LUZP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and functions within the cell (BozalBasterra2021LUZP1).

## Function
LUZP1 (leucine zipper protein 1) is a critical regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, influencing various cellular processes such as cell division, migration, and invasion. In healthy human cells, LUZP1 plays a significant role in organizing actin filaments, which are essential for maintaining cell shape, adhesion, and motility. The absence of LUZP1 results in reduced stress fibers and increased cell motility, highlighting its importance in actin dynamics (BozalBasterra2021LUZP1). LUZP1 is involved in the regulation of the constriction velocity of the contractile ring during cytokinesis, colocalizing with AURKB during cell division phases (Hyodo2022LUZP1). It also acts as a negative regulator of ciliogenesis, with its loss leading to increased ciliation in certain cell types (Gonçalves2019LUZP1).

LUZP1 localizes to the centrosome, basal body, and actin filaments, interacting with proteins such as EPLIN to stabilize actin structures (Gonçalves2019LUZP1). It is predominantly expressed in the brain and neural lineages, suggesting a role in neural development (Gonçalves2019LUZP1). The protein's involvement in actin stabilization and its interactions with cytoskeletal proteins underscore its role in maintaining cellular structure and function (BozalBasterra2020LUZP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the LUZP1 gene are implicated in Townes-Brocks Syndrome (TBS), a genetic disorder characterized by malformations of the digits, heart, and kidneys. These defects are linked to dysfunctional cilia, as LUZP1 is a regulator of primary cilia and the actin cytoskeleton. In TBS, truncated forms of the SALL1 protein interact with LUZP1, leading to its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which may contribute to the TBS phenotype by affecting ciliogenesis and actin cytoskeleton stability (BozalBasterra2019LUZP1; BozalBasterra2020LUZP1).

LUZP1 mutations have also been associated with cardiovascular defects and neural tube closure defects, which are common features in ciliopathies. These defects are thought to arise from aberrant Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling and changes in actin architecture, as observed in LUZP1 knockout mice (BozalBasterra2019LUZP1; Gonçalves2019LUZP1).

The clinical significance of LUZP1 extends to its potential contribution to the 1p36 deletion syndrome, a developmental disorder with symptoms such as short stature, microcephaly, and congenital heart disease. LUZP1's role in these conditions underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions related to cilia and cytoskeleton dynamics (Gonçalves2019LUZP1).

## Interactions
LUZP1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and actin cytoskeleton regulation. It associates with centrosomal and actin cytoskeleton-related proteins, localizing to the pericentriolar material, actin cytoskeleton, and midbody. LUZP1 interacts with centrosome-associated proteins like CCP110 and CEP97, which are key regulators of ciliogenesis (BozalBasterra2020LUZP1). It also interacts with actin-related proteins, including filamin A (FLNA) and ACTR2, indicating its involvement in actin filament bundling and stress fiber assembly (Wang2023LUZP1; BozalBasterra2021LUZP1).

LUZP1 forms a complex with the tumor suppressor EPLIN, acting as a negative regulator of primary cilia formation (Gonçalves2019LUZP1). It also interacts with DAPK3, influencing the phosphorylation of MYL9, which is crucial for actomyosin contraction during cytokinesis (Hyodo2022LUZP1). The interaction between LUZP1 and DAPK3 is mediated by the coiled-coil domain of LUZP1, highlighting its role in regulating the constriction velocity of the contractile ring during cell division (Hyodo2022LUZP1).

LUZP1's interactions are dynamic and may involve other bridging factors, contributing to its regulatory functions in the actin cytoskeleton and ciliogenesis (BozalBasterra2020LUZP1).
