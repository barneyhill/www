# CAPZB

## Overview
CAPZB is a gene that encodes the beta subunit of the capping actin protein of muscle Z-line, a critical component of the actin-capping protein complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of actin filament dynamics by binding to the barbed ends of actin filaments, thereby preventing further polymerization and depolymerization. The capping actin protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein due to its involvement in maintaining the stability and proper length of actin filaments, which are essential for various cellular processes such as cell division, migration, and morphogenesis (Terry2018Capping). The CAPZB gene is expressed in multiple isoforms, which contribute to its diverse functional roles in different cellular contexts, including muscle contraction and cell motility (di2017An). Additionally, CAPZB has been implicated in several pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, where its expression levels and methylation status can serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis (Mukaihara2016Expression; Cai2024CAPZB).

## Structure
The CAPZB gene encodes the beta subunit of the capping protein that binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments, playing a crucial role in regulating actin filament dynamics. The protein forms a heterodimer with an alpha subunit, known as CapZ, which exhibits a pseudo 2-fold rotational symmetry (Yamashita2003Crystal). The beta subunit of CapZ includes a C-terminal extension that is amphiphilic, with a hydrophobic side involved in actin binding and a hydrophilic side that may interact with isoform-specific target proteins (Yamashita2003Crystal).

The structure of CapZ is characterized by an elongated form with dimensions of approximately 90 x 50 x 55 Å. Each subunit consists of three domains: an N-terminal domain with a bundle of three antiparallel helices, a middle domain composed of beta strands forming reverse turns, and a C-terminal domain with an antiparallel beta sheet flanked by helices (Yamashita2003Crystal). The C-terminal domains of the subunits form a single antiparallel beta sheet through interstrand main-chain hydrogen bonding, contributing to the stability of the heterodimer (Yamashita2003Crystal).

CAPZB has splice variant isoforms, such as CAPZB1 and CAPZB2, which differ at their COOH-termini. CAPZB2 contains an additional 111 nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift and a stop codon in the insert exon (Wang2014Identification). These isoforms encode proteins with 272 and 277 amino acids, respectively, and are 98% identical in the first 246 amino acids (Wang2014Identification).

## Function
The CAPZB gene encodes the beta subunit of the actin-capping protein complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating actin filament dynamics by binding to the barbed ends of actin filaments. This action prevents further polymerization and depolymerization, thereby maintaining the stability and proper length of actin filaments. CAPZB is essential for various cellular processes, including cell division, migration, adhesion, and morphogenesis (Terry2018Capping).

During cytokinesis, CAPZB is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics, particularly in the maturation of the midbody, a critical phase for successful cell division. Depletion of CAPZB results in cytokinesis failure, leading to the formation of binucleated cells, highlighting its importance in cell division (Terry2018Capping). CAPZB also plays a role in spindle orientation during mitosis, acting independently of its traditional role in actin regulation. It is involved in the regulation of dynein/dynactin cortical activity and microtubule dynamics, which are crucial for proper spindle orientation and cell division (di2017An).

In addition to its role in cytokinesis and spindle orientation, CAPZB is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in muscle cells, where it stabilizes the actin cytoskeleton, contributing to muscle contraction and cell motility (di2017An).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAPZB gene have been linked to various cancers. In epithelioid sarcoma, CAPZB is overexpressed and associated with increased cell growth and motility. Silencing CAPZB in these cells inhibits tumor growth, invasion, and migration, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Mukaihara2016Expression). In liver cancer, downregulation of CAPZB by the HBxΔ3 protein enhances invasion and metastasis, indicating a role in cancer progression (Cai2024CAPZB). 

In cervical cancer, CAPZB mRNA levels decrease with the severity of cervical lesions, while DNA methylation levels increase. This pattern suggests that CAPZB could serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between different grades of cervical lesions (Cai2024CAPZBa; Cai2024CAPZB). In ovarian cancer, CAPZB is differentially methylated, with hypermethylation observed in patients, which may contribute to disease progression (Cai2024CAPZB).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, lower expression of CAPZB is associated with better survival outcomes, highlighting its potential impact on prognosis (Cai2024CAPZB). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CAPZB in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

## Interactions
CAPZB, a subunit of the capping protein complex, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate actin dynamics and cellular processes. It binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments, preventing the addition or loss of actin monomers, which is crucial for actin polymerization and stabilization (Papa1999Alphaactinin–CapZ). CAPZB interacts with α-actinin, a protein involved in the structural organization of the cytoskeleton. This interaction occurs independently of actin and is primarily mediated by the 55 kDa spectrin-like domain of α-actinin (Papa1999Alphaactinin–CapZ).

CAPZB also plays a role in endosomal trafficking by associating with early endosomes. It recruits Rabaptin-5 and Rabex-5, which are RAB5 effectors, facilitating the activation of RAB5 and influencing endosomal maturation (Zhu2024The). The interaction of CAPZB with phosphoinositides, such as PIP2, modulates its binding affinity with α-actinin and other actin-binding proteins, affecting its regulatory functions (Papa1999Alphaactinin–CapZ). These interactions highlight CAPZB's role in cytoskeletal organization and cellular trafficking processes.
