# PDE9A

## Overview
PDE9A is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphodiesterase 9A, which is a member of the phosphodiesterase family of proteins. This enzyme is specifically involved in the hydrolysis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a critical second messenger in various cellular signaling pathways. The PDE9A gene is located on chromosome 21q22.3 and is characterized by its complex structure, including 22 exons and multiple splice variants that result in tissue-specific expression patterns (Singh2014Phosphodiesterase). The phosphodiesterase 9A protein is a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase, playing a vital role in regulating intracellular cGMP levels, which influences processes such as vascular smooth muscle relaxation, neuronal signaling, and platelet aggregation (Fisher1998Isolation; Rentero2006Specificuseofstartcodonsandcellularlocalizationofsplicevariantsofhumanphosphodiesterase9Agene). The enzyme's activity is dependent on divalent metal ions and exhibits high affinity for cGMP, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular signaling homeostasis (Fisher1998Isolation). PDE9A's clinical relevance is highlighted by its involvement in various diseases, including colorectal cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Susmi2021Prognostic; Azevedo2013Clinical).

## Structure
The PDE9A gene encodes the phosphodiesterase 9A enzyme, which is involved in the hydrolysis of cyclic GMP (cGMP). The primary structure of PDE9A consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, with the gene located on chromosome 21q22.3 in humans and comprising 22 exons. Alternative splicing results in 20 different mRNA transcripts, leading to tissue-specific expression patterns (Singh2014Phosphodiesterase).

The secondary structure of PDE9A includes 16 α-helices within its catalytic domain, which is similar to that of PDE4D2 but distinct from PDE5A1 (Huai2004Crystal). The tertiary structure features a conserved catalytic domain at the C-terminus, which includes a nucleotide recognition pocket and a hydrolytic center (Singh2014Phosphodiesterase). This domain is characterized by a deep hydrophobic pocket composed of four subsites: a metal-binding site, a core pocket, a hydrophobic pocket, and a lid region (Singh2014Phosphodiesterase).

The quaternary structure of PDE9A involves dimerization through hydrogen bonds involving specific residues (Singh2014Phosphodiesterase). The enzyme's active site contains two metal ions, likely zinc and magnesium, which are crucial for its catalytic activity (Huai2004Crystal). The enzyme is highly specific for cGMP, with unique structural features such as a glutamate residue (GLU406) that interacts with GLN453, influencing substrate selectivity (Singh2014Phosphodiesterase).

## Function
PDE9A (phosphodiesterase 9A) is a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase that plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a second messenger involved in various signal transduction pathways. This enzyme hydrolyzes cGMP into GMP, thereby modulating processes such as vascular smooth muscle relaxation, platelet aggregation, and neuronal signaling (Fisher1998Isolation; Rentero2006Specificuseofstartcodonsandcellularlocalizationofsplicevariantsofhumanphosphodiesterase9Agene).

PDE9A is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including the brain, spleen, small intestine, and prostate, with varying levels of mRNA expression (Rentero2003Identification; Fisher1998Isolation). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm, although different splice variants of PDE9A can localize to distinct subcellular regions, such as membrane ruffles and the Golgi apparatus, which may allow for the regulation of cGMP degradation in specific cellular microdomains (Rentero2006Specificuseofstartcodonsandcellularlocalizationofsplicevariantsofhumanphosphodiesterase9Agene).

The activity of PDE9A is dependent on divalent metal ions, such as Mn2+ and Mg2+, and it exhibits high affinity for cGMP, with a Km of 170 nM (Fisher1998Isolation). This high affinity and specific activity suggest that PDE9A plays a significant role in maintaining cGMP levels, thereby influencing cellular signaling and function in healthy human cells (Wang2003Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The phosphodiesterase 9A (PDE9A) gene has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PDE9A is significantly downregulated in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This downregulation is associated with poorer survival outcomes, as higher PDE9A expression correlates with better overall survival, relapse-free survival, and disease-specific survival in CRC patients (Susmi2021Prognostic). The gene's expression is also influenced by DNA methylation, with hypomethylation correlating with reduced expression in CRC (Susmi2021Prognostic).

PDE9A's role extends beyond cancer, as it is involved in cognitive functions and has been studied in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibition of PDE9A has been shown to improve learning and memory in rodent models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like Alzheimer's disease (Azevedo2013Clinical). Additionally, PDE9A inhibitors are being explored for their therapeutic potential in cardiovascular diseases and erectile dysfunction due to their ability to modulate cGMP levels (Wang2010Insight). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PDE9A in various pathophysiological conditions.

## Interactions
PDE9A interacts with several proteins, playing a role in various physiological processes. One significant interaction is with the Neuralized E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (NEURL1), which acts as a ubiquitin ligase for PDE9A. NEURL1 promotes the polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of PDE9A, primarily utilizing lysine residue K27 of ubiquitin. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments, indicating that NEURL1 regulates PDE9A protein levels (Taal2019Neuralized).

In the context of colorectal cancer, PDE9A is part of a complex interaction network. It interacts with proteins such as MAPK14, which is significant for colon cancer prognosis, and GUCY1A2, with which it has a high-confidence interaction. These interactions are involved in pathways related to platelet homeostasis and cancer prognosis, as shown by network analysis using databases like GeneMANIA and STRING (Susmi2021Prognostic).

PDE9A also has a conserved catalytic domain that interacts with metal ions, such as zinc and magnesium, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity. These interactions facilitate the hydrolysis of cGMP, a process important for synaptic plasticity and memory (Singh2014Phosphodiesterase).
