# PADI4

## Overview
PADI4, or peptidyl arginine deiminase 4, is a gene that encodes an enzyme belonging to the peptidyl arginine deiminase family, which is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through citrullination. This enzyme is primarily active in the nucleus and plays a significant role in gene regulation and chromatin remodeling by converting arginine residues into citrulline, thereby influencing protein charge and function (Anzilotti2010Peptidylarginine; Cuthbert2004Histone). PADI4 is implicated in various biological processes, including hormone-dependent transcriptional pathways and cellular stress responses, due to its calcium-dependent activity (Anzilotti2010Peptidylarginine; Cuthbert2004Histone). Clinically, PADI4 is associated with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancer, where it plays roles in inflammation, tumorigenesis, and drug resistance, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Zhu2023Role; BagheriHosseinabadi2023Implications).

## Structure
PADI4 is a 663 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 74 kDa. It has a boot-shaped structure measuring about 125 × 45 × 50 Å and forms a head-to-tail dimer with another PADI4 molecule, indicating its quaternary structure (Anzilotti2010Peptidylarginine). The protein is composed of two main domains: an N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-300) with two immunoglobulin-like subdomains, and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 301-663) that is highly conserved among species (Anzilotti2010Peptidylarginine). The C-terminal domain includes an α helix/β fold structure, contributing to the enzyme's tertiary structure (Chang2010PADI4).

PADI4 contains five non-EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites, and the binding of calcium ions induces conformational changes that activate the enzyme by forming the active site cleft (Arita2004Structural). This structural change is crucial for its enzymatic activity, which involves the conversion of arginine residues to citrulline (Chang2010PADI4). PADI4 also possesses a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS, amino acids 56-63), allowing it to translocate to the nucleus upon cell activation (Anzilotti2010Peptidylarginine). The enzyme's activity can be regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and it may exist in different splice variant isoforms, affecting its function and localization.

## Function
PADI4 (peptidyl arginine deiminase 4) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the post-translational modification of proteins through a process known as deimination or citrullination. This process involves the conversion of arginine residues into citrulline, which affects protein charge and function, influencing gene regulation and chromatin remodeling (Anzilotti2010Peptidylarginine). PADI4 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it targets histone H3, converting specific arginine residues to citrulline. This modification antagonizes arginine methylation, a key process in transcriptional activation, thereby influencing gene expression (Cuthbert2004Histone).

PADI4 is involved in the regulation of hormone-dependent transcriptional pathways by repressing transcriptional activation through its deiminase activity. It is recruited to specific gene promoters, such as the pS2 promoter, in response to hormonal signals, leading to transcriptional repression (Cuthbert2004Histone). The enzyme's activity is calcium-dependent, and it can be activated by calcium influx during cellular stress (Anzilotti2010Peptidylarginine).

In healthy human cells, PADI4's ability to modulate histone modifications plays a significant role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression, impacting various cellular processes and responses to hormonal stimuli (Cuthbert2004Histone).

## Clinical Significance
The PADI4 gene is clinically significant due to its involvement in various diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cancer. In RA, PADI4 is a susceptibility gene identified through genome-wide association studies. It is highly expressed in immune cells and contributes to the production of citrullinated proteins, which are targets for RA-specific autoantibodies. Variants of PADI4, such as the rs1748033 T allele, are associated with increased RA risk and higher disease activity scores (BagheriHosseinabadi2023Implications; Suzuki2016Decreased). PADI4's role in RA is further supported by studies showing that Padi4 knockout mice exhibit decreased severity of experimental autoimmune arthritis, indicating its contribution to inflammation and disease progression (Suzuki2016Decreased).

In cancer, PADI4 acts as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, influencing tumorigenesis, proliferation, migration, and drug resistance. It mediates cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through gene expression regulation and affects macrophage activation in lung cancer, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and inhibiting apoptosis (Zhu2023Role). PADI4 also contributes to tumor resistance and angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Zhu2023Role).

## Interactions
PADI4 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. It associates with DNMT3A, a DNA methyltransferase, stabilizing the protein and enhancing its activity. This interaction involves the citrullination of DNMT3A by PADI4, which increases DNMT3A's stability and affects DNA methylation patterns (Deplus2014Citrullination). PADI4 also interacts with SYVN1, an E3 ligase, inhibiting its ubiquitination activity. This interaction is mediated by the SYVN1 unique domain and is independent of PADI4's enzymatic activity (Aratani2017Inhibitory).

PADI4's interactions extend to histones, where it can citrullinate histone H3, affecting chromatin structure and gene expression. The enzyme's autodeimination alters its interactions with proteins like histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), although it does not significantly change its enzymatic activity (Slack2011Autodeimination). The presence of certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PADI4 can increase its affinity for histone H3 and HDAC1, potentially influencing inflammatory responses (Slack2011Autodeimination). These interactions highlight PADI4's role in modulating protein stability and gene regulation through post-translational modifications.
