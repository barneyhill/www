# H1-3

## Overview
H1-3 is a gene that encodes the H1.3 linker histone, a protein integral to chromatin structure and gene regulation. As a member of the histone H1 family, the H1.3 protein functions primarily as a chromatin-binding protein, playing a pivotal role in the compaction and stabilization of chromatin. This protein is characterized by a central globular domain flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal tails, which facilitate its interaction with DNA and other chromatin-associated proteins (Syed2010Singlebase). The H1.3 linker histone is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional repression and DNA methylation, by forming complexes with histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases (Prendergast2021The). Its expression and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are crucial for its function in chromatin dynamics and gene expression regulation (Prendergast2021The). The gene's role in cancer biology, particularly in ovarian cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Medrzycki2014Histone; Bauden2017Histone).

## Structure
H1-3, also known as H1.3, is a linker histone protein that plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation. The primary structure of H1.3 consists of a central globular domain flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal tails. The secondary structure includes alpha helices within the globular domain, which are essential for its interaction with DNA (Syed2010Singlebase). The globular domain of H1.3 interacts specifically with the DNA minor groove at the nucleosome center, protecting a 10-bp region symmetrically around the nucleosomal dyad (Syed2010Singlebase).

Post-translational modifications of H1.3, such as phosphorylation, significantly influence its function. H1.3 is phosphorylated at serine residue 174, a modification that is independent of the cell cycle, suggesting a unique role for this variant (Prendergast2021The). This phosphorylation status affects its ability to repress transcription, as seen in the dephosphorylation leading to transcriptional repression of specific promoters (Prendergast2021The).

The quaternary structure of H1.3 is less defined, but it is known to form stable complexes with other proteins, such as HDAC3 and its cofactors, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Prendergast2021The).

## Function
The H1.3 linker histone is a variant of the H1 histone family that plays a significant role in chromatin structure and function in healthy human cells. It is involved in the compaction and stabilization of chromatin, acting as an intermediate condenser of chromatin, which influences chromatin compaction and gene regulation (Lyubitelev2016Structure). H1.3 has a higher affinity for chromatin compared to some other variants, contributing to its functional activity in chromatin binding and condensation (Lyubitelev2016Structure).

H1.3 is particularly active during the S phase of the cell cycle, where it shows a significant increase in expression, and it forms a stable complex with HDAC3 and its cofactors during the G2/M phases. This complex is involved in deacetylating H3K9 during mitosis, suggesting a role in regulating microtubule dynamics (Prendergast2021The). H1.3 is also implicated in transcriptional repression, particularly in hormone signaling-dependent gene regulation, and is enriched at sites with H3K9me3, major satellite elements, and LINES (Prendergast2021The).

In addition, H1.3 is involved in restoring DNA methylation at imprinting control regions, such as H19 and GTL2, by interacting with DNMT1 and DNMT3B, which promotes CpG methylation and gene silencing (Prendergast2021The). Despite its roles in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation, H1.3 knockout mice develop normally, indicating that its function may be compensated by other histone variants (Prendergast2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the H1-3 gene, also known as H1.3 linker histone, have been implicated in various cancers. In ovarian cancer, overexpression of H1.3 has been shown to suppress the expression of the H19 noncoding RNA, which is often overexpressed in these tumors and associated with tumor growth. This suppression leads to reduced cell growth and colony formation in ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that H1.3 acts as a tumor suppressor in this context (Medrzycki2014Histone). 

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), H1.3 is significantly more frequent in tumor tissues compared to healthy controls. Its expression is associated with poorer survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Patients with positive H1.3 expression have a decreased median survival, suggesting that H1.3 may contribute to the aggressiveness of PDAC (Bauden2017Histone).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), low expression of H1-3 is linked to better prognosis and a more differentiated phenotype of leukemic cells. The epigenetic down-regulation of the HIST1 locus, which includes H1-3, is associated with improved outcomes, indicating that H1-3 may influence the differentiation state of leukemia cells (Garciaz2019Epigenetic).

## Interactions
H1.3 linker histone, also known as H1-3, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. H1.3 forms a stable complex with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and its cofactors, which becomes more abundant during the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. This complex is involved in deacetylating H3K9 during mitosis and localizes to polar microtubules and spindle poles, suggesting a role in regulating microtubule dynamics (Prendergast2021The).

H1.3 interacts with DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3B, recruiting them to imprinting control regions (ICRs) of genes like H19 and GTL2, thereby promoting DNA methylation and gene silencing. This interaction inhibits the methyltransferase SET7/9 from binding to chromatin (Prendergast2021The).

H1.3 also interacts with nuclear receptor corepressor complexes SMRT and NCOR1, which are displaced in the presence of retinoic acid, allowing interaction with p300/CBP. This interaction is linked to the transcriptional repression of genomic regions responsive to nuclear hormone receptors (Prendergast2021The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of H1.3 in chromatin structure and gene expression regulation.
