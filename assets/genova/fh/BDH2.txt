# BDH2

## Overview
BDH2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 2, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. This enzyme is characterized by a NAD(H) binding Rossmann-fold domain, which is essential for its function in catalyzing redox reactions (Kwiatkowski2021The). BDH2 plays a pivotal role in metabolic processes, including ketone body metabolism and proline degradation, by facilitating the conversion of 3-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate and the reduction of 4-oxo-L-proline to cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline, respectively (Li2019Inactivation). Additionally, BDH2 is involved in iron homeostasis through the synthesis of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, a mammalian siderophore that aids in iron transport (Li2019Inactivation). The enzyme's structural and functional attributes underscore its significance in maintaining cellular and metabolic homeostasis, with implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer (Li2019Inactivation).

## Structure
BDH2, identified as 4-oxo-L-proline reductase, is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. The enzyme features a typical NAD(H) binding Rossmann-fold domain, which is crucial for its function as a dehydrogenase/reductase (Kwiatkowski2021The). The Rossmann fold is a common motif in proteins that bind nucleotides, such as NAD(H), and is characterized by a series of alternating beta strands and alpha helices (Akagashi2024Crystal).

BDH2's primary structure includes key catalytic residues that are conserved among its orthologues, indicating a one-domain architecture (Kwiatkowski2021The). The enzyme's structure is closely related to that of L-2-keto-3-deoxyfuconate 4-dehydrogenase (l-KDFDH), sharing over 50% sequence homology and a similar binding mode for substrates (Akagashi2024Crystal).

The quaternary structure of BDH2 is not explicitly detailed in the available context, but its structural homology with other SDR enzymes suggests it may form dimers or tetramers, as is common in this enzyme family (Li2023Mechanism). The enzyme's activity and substrate specificity are influenced by its structural features, although specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms are not mentioned in the provided context.

## Function
BDH2 (3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 2) is an enzyme involved in several critical metabolic processes in healthy human cells. It primarily functions in the metabolism of ketone bodies, catalyzing the conversion of 3-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate, which is a key step in ketogenesis and energy homeostasis (Li2019Inactivation). BDH2 is also involved in the reduction of 4-oxo-L-proline to cis-4-hydroxy-L-proline, a reaction that is part of the L-proline degradation pathway. This activity suggests a role in proline metabolism, potentially influencing the intracellular concentration of 4-oxo-L-proline and its related metabolic pathways (Kwiatkowski2021The).

In addition to its metabolic functions, BDH2 plays a role in iron homeostasis. It is involved in the synthesis of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, a mammalian siderophore that facilitates iron transport across cell membranes, thereby maintaining intracellular iron balance (Li2019Inactivation). This function is crucial for regulating cell proliferation and growth, as iron is a vital nutrient for cellular processes. BDH2's activity in these pathways highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and metabolic homeostasis in human tissues (Li2019Inactivation).

## Clinical Significance
BDH2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in iron metabolism and tumor suppression. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), BDH2 is significantly downregulated, which is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This downregulation leads to iron retention in cells, promoting carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Ectopic expression of BDH2 in NPC cells has been shown to inhibit these processes by reversing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2019Inactivation).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), BDH2 expression levels do not significantly differ between tumor and adjacent pre-tumor tissues. However, BDH2 mRNA levels are inversely correlated with tumor grade, indicating a potential role in tumor aggressiveness and progression (Yousefi2022The).

BDH2 is also involved in the metabolism of 4-oxo-L-proline, with its activity potentially influencing cell survival through metabolic pathways. Alterations in BDH2 activity could affect proline metabolism, impacting cell viability and contributing to disease states (Kwiatkowski2021The).

Overall, BDH2's role in cancer and metabolism highlights its clinical significance, particularly in relation to its tumor-suppressor functions and involvement in iron homeostasis.
