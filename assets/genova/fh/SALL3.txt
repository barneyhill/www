# SALL3

## Overview
SALL3 is a gene that encodes the spalt like transcription factor 3, a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression and developmental processes. The SALL3 protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. These domains enable SALL3 to interact with specific DNA sequences and other proteins, influencing chromatin structure and gene transcription. SALL3 is part of the spalt gene family, which plays a significant role in vertebrate development, including limb and organ formation. The protein is involved in various signaling pathways, such as FGF, Wnt, and BMP-2, which are essential for developmental processes. Additionally, SALL3 interacts with DNA methyltransferases, impacting epigenetic regulation and cellular differentiation. Its clinical significance is highlighted by its role in cancer, where promoter hypermethylation of SALL3 is associated with tumorigenesis and poor prognosis in several cancers (Sweetman2006The; Kuroda2019SALL3; Wei2015Aberrant).

## Structure
The SALL3 protein is characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. These domains include four C2H2 double zinc finger (DZF) domains and an amino-terminal C2HC putative single zinc finger domain. The fourth DZF encoding region is separated by an intron of 1431 base pairs, indicating a complex genomic organization (Kohlhase1999SALL3). The zinc finger domains facilitate DNA binding, particularly to AT-rich regions, which is a conserved feature among SALL family proteins (Ru2022Structural).

The SALL3 protein structure includes three double zinc finger domains, with the third domain being spliced out, suggesting alternative splicing that may lead to different protein isoforms (Kohlhase1999SALL3). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions between these zinc finger domains and DNA, involving specific amino acids such as Asn1155, Ile1130, and Thr1152, which form hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions with DNA bases (Ru2022Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the function and stability of SALL3, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's structure and function are integral to its role in transcriptional regulation and development.

## Function
SALL3 is a zinc finger transcription factor involved in transcriptional regulation and development. It is part of the spalt gene family, which plays a crucial role in vertebrate development, including limb and organ formation such as the kidney and heart (Sweetman2006The). SALL3, like other spalt proteins, is characterized by zinc finger domains that are essential for its function as a transcription factor, influencing gene expression by interacting with chromatin and other proteins (Sweetman2006The).

In healthy human cells, SALL3 is thought to be involved in transcriptional regulation, although specific target genes have not been extensively identified. The protein is active in the nucleus, where it likely influences chromatin structure and gene transcription, impacting cellular differentiation and development (Sweetman2006The). While the precise role of SALL3 in healthy cells is not fully detailed, it is suggested that spalt proteins, including SALL3, interact with signaling pathways such as FGF, Wnt, and BMP-2, which are important for limb patterning and development (Sweetman2006The). SALL3's involvement in these pathways indicates its potential role in regulating developmental processes and maintaining proper cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
The SALL3 gene is implicated in various cancers through its epigenetic regulation, particularly via promoter hypermethylation. In cervical cancer, SALL3 promoter hypermethylation is associated with reduced mRNA expression, contributing to carcinogenesis by inhibiting its tumor suppressor function. This hypermethylation is often linked to high-risk HPV infections, suggesting a role in the disease's progression (Wei2015Aberrant). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), SALL3 promoter hypermethylation is an independent predictor of poor survival, correlating with decreased disease-free survival and increased disease recurrence (Misawa2017Epigenetic). 

In thymic carcinoma, SALL3 shows significantly higher promoter methylation compared to thymomas, indicating its potential as a biomarker for distinguishing between these tumor types. This methylation is associated with poorer relapse-free survival, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer prognosis (Kishibuchi2019DNA). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SALL3 functions as a tumor suppressor, with its methylation status affecting cancer development (Álvarez2021SALL). These findings underscore the potential of SALL3 as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various malignancies.

## Interactions
SALL3 interacts with DNMT3B, a DNA methyltransferase, playing a significant role in modulating its function. This interaction is crucial for regulating the differentiation propensity of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). SALL3 binds to CpG islands in gene bodies of WNT3A and WNT5A, repressing their methylation and DNMT activity, which affects the differentiation propensity of hiPSCs (Kuroda2019SALL3). Immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between SALL3 and DNMT3B, highlighting SALL3's role in inhibiting DNMT3B function, which influences DNA methylation sites in hiPSCs (Kuroda2019SALL3).

SALL3 also interacts with AT-rich DNA regions, similar to other SALL family proteins. Structural studies have shown that SALL3's zinc finger cluster 4 (ZFC4) domain binds specifically to AT-rich DNA motifs, such as AATATT-containing sequences, indicating a conserved DNA recognition mode among SALL family members (Ru2022Structural). These interactions with DNA and DNMT3B suggest that SALL3 plays a role in epigenetic regulation, impacting cellular differentiation and development processes.
