# S100A10

## Overview
S100A10 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A10, also known as p11, which is a member of the S100 protein family. Unlike other S100 proteins, S100A10 is unique in that it does not bind calcium due to specific structural modifications, yet it maintains a conformation similar to the calcium-bound state of other S100 proteins (SantamariaKisiel2011Identification; Rescher2007S100A10p11:). The protein is primarily known for forming a heterotetrameric complex with annexin A2, which is crucial for its role in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, ion channel regulation, and fibrinolysis (Okura2023Recent; Seo2020Modulation). S100A10 is expressed in a variety of tissues and is involved in significant physiological and pathological processes, such as angiogenesis, macrophage recruitment, and tumor progression (Donato2012Functions; Seo2020Modulation). Its interactions and functions make it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in diseases like cancer, where it is implicated in tumor growth and metastasis (Zheng2021Comprehensive; Li2021Prognostic).

## Structure
S100A10, also known as p11, is a member of the S100 protein family characterized by EF-hand motifs, although it is unique in that it cannot bind calcium due to specific substitutions and deletions in these motifs (SantamariaKisiel2011Identification; Rescher2007S100A10p11:). The protein maintains an open conformation similar to the calcium-bound state of other S100 proteins, which is crucial for its function (SantamariaKisiel2011Identification; Okura2023Recent).

The primary structure of S100A10 includes four α-helical domains (H-I, H-II, H-III, and H-IV) separated by loops and a flexible linker region (Noye2018S100A10). The secondary structure is stabilized by a salt bridge between residues Y24 and K65, which is not found in other S100 proteins (SantamariaKisiel2011Identification). 

In terms of quaternary structure, S100A10 forms a heterotetrameric complex with annexin A2, known as AIIt. This complex involves a central S100A10 dimer interacting with two annexin A2 chains, providing a hydrophobic surface for protein binding (Bharadwaj2021The; Rescher2007S100A10p11:). The interaction is facilitated by specific residues on S100A10, such as E6, M9, and F14, which form strong contacts with annexin A2 (Okura2023Recent).

## Function
S100A10, also known as p11, is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It forms a heterotetrameric complex with annexin A2, which is crucial for its cellular localization, stability, and functionality (Okura2023Recent; Seo2020Modulation). This complex is involved in membrane trafficking and the regulation of ion channels and receptors, including sodium, calcium, and potassium channels, which are essential for maintaining ion homeostasis and cellular function (Seo2020Modulation).

S100A10 is also involved in the fibrinolytic system, where it forms a complex with annexin A2 on the surface of endothelial cells. This complex is essential for binding plasminogen and facilitating its conversion to plasmin, a serine protease involved in fibrinolysis, which is crucial for dissolving fibrin clots and preventing inappropriate clot formation (Okura2023Recent). The protein also plays a role in angiogenesis, macrophage recruitment, and tumor progression by mediating plasmin-dependent signaling (Donato2012Functions; Seo2020Modulation).

S100A10 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and liver, and is particularly abundant in endothelial cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells (Saiki2019Multiple; Seo2020Modulation). Its interaction with annexin A2 is calcium-independent, distinguishing it from other S100 proteins (Seo2020Modulation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the S100A10 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), S100A10 is upregulated and associated with tumor size, pathological TNM stage, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, poor prognosis, and drug resistance. It is up-regulated by the Smad4-dependent transforming growth factor-β 1 signaling pathway and is involved in plasminogen activation during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Li2021Prognostic). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), S100A10 shows medium protein expression and a high mutation rate, with its high mRNA expression linked to poor overall survival. It is associated with immune infiltration, affecting various immune cell types (Zheng2021Comprehensive).

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), S100A10 is involved in plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis, processes critical to APL pathology. The PML-RARα fusion protein increases S100A10 expression, enhancing plasminogen activation, which can be down-regulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment (Li2020Critical). S100A10 also plays a role in lung cancer, where it interacts with the tumor suppressor gene DLC1, affecting tumor invasiveness and metastasis (Li2020Critical). These findings highlight S100A10's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various malignancies.

## Interactions
S100A10, also known as p11, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily forming a heterotetrameric complex with annexin A2 (ANXA2). This complex is crucial for several cellular processes, including membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton linkages (Saiki2019Multiple; Seo2020Modulation). Unlike other S100 proteins, S100A10 does not bind calcium, allowing it to maintain a calcium-loaded conformation and interact with annexin A2 independently of calcium presence (Okura2023Recent).

S100A10 also interacts with a variety of other proteins, including serotonin receptors, potassium channels like TASK-1, and epithelial calcium channels TRPV5 and TRPV6. These interactions influence the trafficking and function of these channels and receptors (Okura2023Recent; van2003Functional). The S100A10-annexin A2 complex is essential for the functional expression and membrane localization of TRPV5 and TRPV6, which are involved in calcium absorption (van2003Functional).

In cancer biology, S100A10 acts as a plasminogen receptor on tumor cell surfaces, facilitating the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which is crucial for extracellular matrix degradation and cancer cell migration (Saiki2019Multiple). The protein's interactions extend to the regulation of ion channels and receptors, impacting various physiological and pathological processes (Seo2020Modulation).
