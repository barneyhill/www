# GAP43

## Overview
GAP43, or growth-associated protein 43, is a gene that encodes a neuron-specific protein crucial for axonal growth and synaptic plasticity. The protein, also referred to as neuromodulin, is categorized as an intrinsically disordered protein, which allows it to engage in dynamic interactions with other proteins and cellular membranes. GAP43 is predominantly expressed in the growth cones of neurons, where it plays a pivotal role in axon guidance, regeneration, and synaptic efficacy. It is involved in modulating the actin cytoskeleton and interacts with various signaling molecules, including GTP-binding proteins and calmodulin. The protein undergoes significant post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase C, which is essential for its function in nerve-terminal sprouting and synaptic plasticity (Mosevitsky2005Nerve; Benowitz1997GAP-43:). The clinical significance of GAP43 is underscored by its altered expression in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, as well as its potential role in cancer metastasis (Chung2020GAP43; Zhang2018GAP43).

## Structure
GAP-43, also known as growth-associated protein 43, is a neuron-specific protein involved in axonal growth and synaptic plasticity. The primary structure of GAP-43 includes a highly conserved N-terminal domain, which is crucial for its function and membrane association (Mosevitsky2005Nerve). This domain contains cysteine residues, specifically Cys-3 and Cys-4, which undergo palmitoylation, a post-translational modification that facilitates membrane attachment through thioester linkages with fatty acids like palmitic acid (Mosevitsky2005Nerve; Skene1989Posttranslational).

GAP-43 is intrinsically disordered, lacking a stable secondary or tertiary structure, which contributes to its dynamic interactions with other proteins and membranes (Zakharov2010Oligomeric). The protein does not form a quaternary structure (Mosevitsky2005Nerve). It contains an effector domain (residues 37-52) that binds calmodulin and is targeted by protein kinase C (PKC) and calpain, playing a role in signal transduction (Mosevitsky2005Nerve).

Phosphorylation is another significant post-translational modification of GAP-43, with Ser-41 being a major site phosphorylated by PKC, affecting its interaction with phospholipids and actin-associated proteins (Zakharov2010Oligomeric; Widmer1993Phosphorylationsite). Despite extensive studies, the exact biological function of GAP-43 remains unclear, though it is known to interact with proteins involved in intracellular signaling (Widmer1993Phosphorylationsite).

## Function
GAP43, also known as growth-associated protein 43, is a critical component in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. It is predominantly active in the growth cones of neurons, where it plays a vital role in axon guidance and regeneration. GAP43 is involved in modulating the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for growth cone motility and axonal pathfinding (Mosevitsky2005Nerve; Benowitz1997GAP-43:). The protein interacts with GTP-binding proteins, such as G_o and G_i, influencing their responsiveness to signals, which can affect growth cone dynamics (Benowitz1997GAP-43:).

GAP43 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC), a modification that is crucial for its role in nerve-terminal sprouting and synaptic efficacy (Benowitz1997GAP-43:). This phosphorylation is linked to long-term potentiation (LTP), a process associated with learning and memory, highlighting GAP43's role in synaptic plasticity (Mosevitsky2005Nerve; Benowitz1997GAP-43:). In the central nervous system, GAP43 is necessary for forming topographical maps in sensory cortices and proper axonal pathfinding, with its absence leading to motor and sensory impairments (Shen2008Both).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GAP43 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), GAP-43 levels are decreased in the neocortex but preserved or elevated in the hippocampus, suggesting a compensatory response that fails to establish functional connections. This aberrant sprouting is associated with amyloid deposition, indicating the need for therapies targeting axon remodeling barriers (Chung2020GAP43). In Parkinson's Disease (PD), GAP-43 and BASP1 are downregulated, with reduced expression in the cerebral spinal fluid and remaining dopaminergic neurons. Modulating GAP-43 activity through CaN can alter axonal degeneration and provide neuroprotection, as shown in a rat model of PD (Chung2020GAP43).

In schizophrenia, decreased levels of GAP-43 have been observed in the dentate gyrus, particularly in the hilus and inner molecular layer, which may contribute to cognitive deficits by disrupting neural circuitry (Chambers2005Growthassociated). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high GAP43 expression is linked to an increased risk of brain metastasis and poorer survival outcomes, suggesting its role in promoting cell migration and invasion (Zhang2018GAP43). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GAP43 in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
GAP43, also known as neuromodulin, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity. One of the primary interactions of GAP43 is with calmodulin, a calcium-binding messenger protein. This interaction is specific and occurs under physiological conditions, but it is inhibited by the phosphorylation of GAP43 at serine 41 (Chao1996Use; Ollom2008A). The N-terminal third of GAP43 binds more strongly to calmodulin than the full-length protein, suggesting a modulatory role of the C-terminus (Chao1996Use).

GAP43 also interacts with components of the synaptic core complex, including SNAP-25, syntaxin, and VAMP, in a calcium-dependent manner. These interactions are linked to synaptic vesicle exocytosis and are enhanced by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of GAP43 (HARUTA1997Ca2+dependent).

Additionally, GAP43 is associated with the cannabinoid receptor CB1R, with the interaction being modulated by the phosphorylation state of GAP43 at serine 41. This interaction is synapse-specific and occurs primarily at presynaptic boutons (Maroto2023Control). These interactions highlight GAP43's role in modulating synaptic transmission and neuronal signaling pathways.
