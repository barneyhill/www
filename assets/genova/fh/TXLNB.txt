# TXLNB

## Overview
TXLNB is a gene that encodes the protein taxilin beta, which is primarily involved in intracellular transport and proteostasis. Taxilin beta is categorized as a centrosomal adapter protein, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), particularly within cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including intrinsically disordered regions and a central coiled-coil domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function in cellular processes. Taxilin beta is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating protein synthesis and degradation, especially under stress conditions. Its expression and function are significant in cardiac biology, where it helps manage proteasomal activity and protein turnover, thereby influencing cardiac health and disease states. Additionally, TXLNB has been identified as a potential biomarker in gastric cancer and is linked to immune function through its association with immunoglobulin G N-glycosylation (Li2020Identification; McLendon2024A; Shadrina2021Multivariate).

## Structure
The TXLNB protein, also known as taxilin beta, is characterized by its structural domains that facilitate its role in intracellular processes. It contains intrinsically disordered N-and C-terminal domains (IDPRs) flanking a central coiled-coil domain (CCD). These IDPRs provide flexibility and enable dynamic molecular interactions, while the CCD forms a tight helical structure that allows high-affinity binding to other protein helices (McLendon2024A). The overall structure of TXLNB resembles a 'Y' shape, with the IDPRs acting as 'arms' and the CCD as a 'stalk'. The distal 'foot' of this structure may function as a microtubule-binding domain, suggesting structural homology with dynein, a motor protein that binds microtubules (McLendon2024A).

TXLNB is proposed to act as a microtubule-dependent centrosomal-adapter protein, potentially bridging perinuclear centrosomes with proteasomes or ubiquitin substrates to enhance their delivery to proteasomes (McLendon2024A). Although specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variants are not provided, the protein's migration at a higher molecular weight than expected suggests possible post-translational modifications or unique structural characteristics (McLendon2024A).

## Function
The TXLNB gene encodes the taxilin beta protein, which plays a significant role in maintaining proteostasis, particularly in cardiac cells. TXLNB is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a critical pathway for protein degradation and turnover. In cardiomyocytes, TXLNB functions as a centrosomal adapter protein, influencing the composition of centrosomes and enhancing the efficiency of the UPS. This role is crucial for regulating protein synthesis and degradation, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cardiac stress (McLendon2024A).

TXLNB is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes, where it localizes to perinuclear compartments, suggesting its involvement in linking centrosomes and proteasomes. This localization is essential for coordinating protein synthesis and degradation, which is vital for cellular stress responses and maintaining protein homeostasis (McLendon2024A). The protein contains intrinsically disordered regions and a coiled-coil domain, facilitating interactions with other proteins and potentially acting as a microtubule-dependent centrosomal adapter (McLendon2024A).

In healthy human cells, TXLNB's role in intracellular transport and vesicle trafficking is mediated through interactions with syntaxins, key components of the SNARE complex, which are involved in membrane fusion processes (Wong2016Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
The TXLNB gene, encoding taxilin beta, has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in proteostasis and cellular stress responses. In cardiac biology, TXLNB is crucial for maintaining cardiac homeostasis through its involvement in the centrosome-proteasome axis. Dysregulation of TXLNB is associated with heart failure, as its loss exacerbates proteasomal insufficiency and leads to increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, contributing to cardiac dysfunction under stress conditions such as transverse aortic constriction (McLendon2024A). Overexpression of TXLNB in cardiomyocytes has been shown to enhance proteasome activity and reduce ubiquitinated protein accumulation, suggesting a protective role against cardiac hypertrophy (McLendon2024A).

In addition to its role in cardiac conditions, TXLNB has been identified as a hub gene in gastric cancer, where it is differentially expressed between normal and tumor tissues. This suggests potential diagnostic and therapeutic value in gastric cancer, although specific mechanisms remain under investigation (Li2020Identification). Furthermore, TXLNB has been associated with fucosylation in immunoglobulin G N-glycosylation, indicating a possible link to immune function (Shadrina2021Multivariate).

## Interactions
TXLNB (taxilin beta) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly within the context of cardiac biology and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). It is suggested to act as a centrosomal adapter protein, facilitating the delivery of ubiquitin substrates to proteasomes, although it does not directly affect the expression of proteasomal subunits (McLendon2024A). TXLNB interacts with various cardiac-relevant proteins related to ubiquitin ligation and proteasomes, indicating its potential multifaceted roles in proteostasis (McLendon2024A). 

The protein is enriched in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and localizes to perinuclear compartments in cardiomyocytes, consistent with centrosomal proteins. Overexpression of TXLNB in cardiomyocytes reduces ubiquitinated protein accumulation and increases proteasome activity, suggesting a role in regulating proteostasis (McLendon2024A). TXLNB's interactome involves about 300 proteins, with significant enrichment in cytoskeletal, microtubule, and UPS categories (McLendon2024A). 

In the context of centrosomal dynamics, the loss of TXLNB results in the upregulation of other centrosomal proteins, such as Txlna and Cep63, indicating altered centrosomal dynamics and potential compensatory mechanisms within the taxilin family (McLendon2024A).
