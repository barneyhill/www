# IMPG2

## Overview
The IMPG2 gene encodes the interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 2, a transmembrane proteoglycan that plays a pivotal role in the structure and function of the retina. This protein is integral to the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), where it facilitates essential interactions between photoreceptor cells and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), contributing to processes such as metabolite exchange and retinoid transport (Castellini2023Identification). IMPG2 is characterized by its heavily glycosylated structure, featuring multiple glycosylation sites and domains that undergo proteolytic processing, resulting in distinct extracellular and membrane-bound fragments (Kuehn1999Molecular; Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). The protein's proper localization and function are dependent on its interaction with another proteoglycan, IMPG1, highlighting a co-dependent mechanism crucial for retinal health (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). Mutations in the IMPG2 gene have been linked to various inherited retinal dystrophies, underscoring its significance in visual function and retinal integrity (Castellini2023Identification).

## Structure
The IMPG2 protein, also known as IPM 200, is a heavily glycosylated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with a core protein molecular weight of approximately 130 kDa, which appears as 200 kDa on SDS-PAGE due to glycosylation (Kuehn1999Molecular). It contains six potential N-linked glycosylation sites and at least twenty-three consensus sites for O-linked glycosylation (Kuehn1999Molecular). The protein features a transmembrane domain, distinguishing it from its related proteoglycan, IPM 150 (Kuehn1999Molecular).

IMPG2 includes two EGF-like domains and two SEA domains, with the SEA-2 domain being proteolytic, contributing to the protein's maturation process (Castellini2023Identification; Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). The extracellular region of IMPG2 also contains five hyaluronan-binding motifs (Castellini2023Identification). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation (Castellini2021Expression).

IMPG2 is expressed as a single transcript of approximately 6.2 kb in the human retina, indicating no spliced isoforms in this tissue (Kuehn1999Molecular). The protein's structure is conserved among vertebrates, with significant sequence identity in the SEA and EGF-like domains between human and zebrafish homologues (Castellini2023Identification).

## Function
The IMPG2 gene encodes a proteoglycan that plays a critical role in the retina, particularly in the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM), which is essential for normal retinal function. This matrix facilitates interactions between photoreceptor cells and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), crucial for processes such as metabolite exchange, retinoid transport, and the alignment and adhesion of photoreceptor outer segments to the RPE (Castellini2023Identification). IMPG2 is a transmembrane proteoglycan located in the inner segment of the retina and undergoes proteolysis in the SEA-2 domain, resulting in an extracellular portion and a membrane-retained fragment. The extracellular portion localizes around the inner and outer segments of photoreceptors, while the membrane portion remains in the inner segment (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor).

The proper localization of IMPG2 is dependent on the presence of another proteoglycan, IMPG1, indicating a mutual dependency for correct positioning within the retina. This co-dependent trafficking system is crucial for the structural organization and localization of photoreceptor components, which are vital for normal visual function (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). Mutations in the IMPG2 gene have been associated with inherited retinal dystrophies, highlighting its importance in maintaining retinal health (Castellini2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IMPG2 gene are associated with several inherited retinal dystrophies, including autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) and vitelliform macular dystrophy (VMD), which can be either autosomal dominant or recessive. Retinitis pigmentosa is characterized by the progressive degeneration of photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelial cells, leading to vision loss. Vitelliform macular dystrophy, also known as Best disease, involves the accumulation of lipofuscin-like material within and beneath the retinal pigment epithelium, resulting in a progressive loss of central vision (Castellini2023Identification).

In Lhasa Apso dogs, a LINE-1 insertion in the promoter region of the IMPG2 gene is linked to autosomal recessive progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a condition characterized by bilateral retinal atrophy and eventual blindness. This insertion disrupts the regulation of the IMPG2 gene, affecting its expression and contributing to the disease (HittiMalin2020A). In humans, mutations in IMPG2 have been associated with childhood-onset rod-cone dystrophy with early macular involvement, as well as early onset retinitis pigmentosa and maculopathy (HittiMalin2020A). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in maintaining retinal health and function.

## Interactions
IMPG2 is involved in the interphotoreceptor matrix of the retina and participates in several interactions crucial for its function. It is hypothesized to form a heterodimeric complex with IMPG1 through non-covalent interactions, which is essential for their proper localization and function in the retina. This interaction likely occurs after proteolysis, with the formation of 'sticky' ends that facilitate the assembly of the IMPG1-IMPG2 complex (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor). The localization of the extracellular portion of IMPG2 (IMPG2ec) is dependent on the presence of IMPG1, indicating a mutual dependency between these two proteoglycans for proper localization in photoreceptors (Mitchell2022Interphotoreceptor).

IMPG2 may also interact with the vitronectin receptor (αvβ3 integrin) on the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells, suggesting a role in retinal adhesion (Kuehn1999Molecular). However, the precise molecular mechanisms and potential interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not fully elucidated. The study of IMPG2 in zebrafish has shown that it shares conserved domains with human IMPG2, indicating evolutionary conservation, but specific interactions in zebrafish are not detailed (Castellini2023Identification).
