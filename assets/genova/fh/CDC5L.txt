# CDC5L

## Overview
The CDC5L gene encodes the cell division cycle 5-like protein, which is a pivotal component of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery in human cells. This protein is integral to the Prp19/CDC5L complex, playing a crucial role in the second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing, although it is not necessary for the initial assembly of the spliceosome (Ajuh2000Functional). Beyond its splicing function, CDC5L is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly influencing the transition from the G2 to M phase, and is implicated in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Ajuh2000Functional; Mu2014Depletion). The protein's interactions with various other proteins, such as CTNNBL1 and CWC15, underscore its role in forming stable complexes essential for its functions (van2015CTNNBL1). CDC5L's involvement in cell cycle regulation and its upregulation in several cancers highlight its significance as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Zhang2020Depletion; Chen2015Expression).

## Structure
The CDC5L protein is a component of the human Prp19/CDC5L complex, which plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA splicing. The protein is 803 amino acids long and contains several important domains, including two SANT (c-Myb) domains in its N-terminal half, which share over 40% homology with its yeast homolog, Cef1. The C-terminal half of CDC5L is less conserved and includes a second coiled-coil domain, which is absent in Cef1 (Grote2010Molecular). This C-terminal region is involved in interactions with other proteins such as hPrp19 and SPF27, suggesting its role in maintaining the structural integrity of the complex (Grote2010Molecular).

CDC5L interacts with CTNNBL1 and CWC15 within a trimeric complex, with the N-terminal NLS region and a small region within the Myb domain contributing to these interactions (van2015CTNNBL1). The protein can dimerize, but this dimerization is mutually exclusive with its association in the hPrp19/CDC5L complex (Grote2010Molecular). CDC5L is also involved in cell cycle regulation, potentially affecting the G2 phase (Ajuh2000Functional). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which is mitogen-dependent (Liu2003Distinct).

## Function
The CDC5L gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery in human cells. This protein is part of the Prp19/Cdc5L complex, which is essential for the second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing, although it is not required for the initial assembly of the spliceosome (Ajuh2000Functional). CDC5L associates with the spliceosome in an ATP-dependent manner and interacts with the U2 snRNP, indicating its involvement early in the splicing pathway (Ajuh2000Functional).

CDC5L is also involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the transition from G2 to M phase. Overexpression of CDC5L can shorten the G2 phase, while its depletion leads to mitotic arrest and chromosome misalignment, highlighting its role in proper mitotic progression (Ajuh2000Functional; Mu2014Depletion). The protein is phosphorylated by CDK2, which is necessary for its association with the spliceosome and for binding to the nuclear RNA binding protein NIPP1 (Petasny2021Splicing). CDC5L's role in splicing and cell cycle regulation underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Mu2014Depletion).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDC5L gene have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer, CDC5L is upregulated, correlating with poorer overall survival. Its knockdown inhibits cancer cell growth, proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, while promoting apoptosis, indicating its critical role in tumorigenesis (Zhang2020Depletion). In osteosarcoma, CDC5L is frequently overexpressed, and its genomic DNA amplification is common, suggesting its role in facilitating tumorigenesis. The gene's overexpression is more frequent than other genes in the 6p12-p21 amplicon, highlighting its pivotal role in osteosarcoma pathogenesis (Lu2008Cell).

CDC5L is also overexpressed in gliomas, where it is associated with tumor progression and poorer survival outcomes. Its knockdown in glioma cells leads to decreased proliferation and cell cycle arrest, suggesting its involvement in cell cycle regulation and tumor progression (Chen2015Expression). In lung adenocarcinoma, CDC5L is upregulated and promotes cancer progression by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, further supporting its role as an oncogene (Yu2024m6A). These findings underscore the potential of CDC5L as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
CDC5L is a core component of the Prp19/CDC5L complex, which is essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It interacts with several proteins, including PRPF19, PLRG1, SPF27, and CTNNBL1, forming a stable core complex that is resistant to high salt concentrations and protease treatment (Grote2010Molecular). CDC5L also interacts with CWC15, facilitated by CTNNBL1, which acts as a bridge to enhance the interaction between CDC5L and CWC15 (van2015CTNNBL1).

CDC5L can dimerize, although this dimerization is mutually exclusive with its association with the hPrp19 complex (Grote2010Molecular). The protein is involved in ATP-dependent interactions with the spliceosome, binding to pre-mRNA and splicing intermediates (Ajuh2000Functional). CDC5L's interaction with the spliceosome is crucial for the second catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing, and its immunodepletion inhibits splicing activity (Ajuh2000Functional).

The CDC5L complex also interacts with other splicing factors, including snRNPs and SR proteins, and is suggested to join the pre-mRNA splicing cycle early, possibly concomitant with U2 snRNP binding (Ajuh2000Functional).
