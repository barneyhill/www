# ACTMAP

## Overview
The ACTMAP gene encodes the actin maturation protease, a crucial enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of actin proteins. This protease plays a significant role in the maturation and stabilization of actin filaments, which are essential components of the cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. Actin maturation protease is categorized as a proteolytic enzyme, specifically functioning to cleave precursor forms of actin to their mature states, thereby facilitating proper cellular structure and motility. The activity of this protease is vital for various cellular processes, including cell division, signaling, and intracellular transport. Dysregulation of ACTMAP expression or function has been implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
