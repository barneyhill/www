# ZNF561

## Overview
ZNF561 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 561, which is part of a large family of proteins characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in binding to DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 561 is implicated in the regulation of gene expression and has been associated with oncogenic pathways, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC). The gene's expression and its interaction with long non-coding RNAs, such as ZNF561-AS1, highlight its potential significance in cancer biology and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Si2021Oncogenic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF561, a zinc finger protein, has been implicated in various diseases, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC), due to alterations in its expression levels. The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ZNF561-AS1 is significantly upregulated in CRC, where it plays a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation and survival. This lncRNA regulates the expression of the oncogenic factor SRSF6 by sponging microRNAs miR-26a-3p and miR-128-5p, forming a regulatory axis essential for CRC progression (Si2021Oncogenic).

Silencing ZNF561-AS1 in CRC cells leads to reduced cell growth, increased apoptosis, and decreased expression of cell cycle-promoting factors, while increasing levels of cell cycle inhibitors and apoptotic factors (Si2021Oncogenic). In vivo studies using xenograft models have confirmed that depletion of ZNF561-AS1 results in smaller tumors, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC treatment (Si2021Oncogenic).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZNF561 and its associated lncRNA in cancer, suggesting that targeting the ZNF561-AS1/miR-26a-3p/miR-128-5p/SRSF6 axis could offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention in colorectal cancer (Si2021Oncogenic).
