# FMN2

## Overview
FMN2, or Formin 2, is a gene that encodes the protein formin 2, which is a member of the formin family of proteins known for their role in actin filament assembly. Formin 2 is characterized by its formin homology 2 (FH2) domain, which is essential for actin nucleation and polymerization, distinguishing it as a key player in cytoskeletal dynamics (Montaville2016Role; Higgs2005Phylogenetic). Unlike many other formins, FMN2 is not regulated by Rho GTPases and lacks the C-terminal auto-regulatory DAD region, which influences its unique functional properties (Montaville2016Role). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, cytokinesis, and neuronal development, and plays a critical role in oocyte maturation and meiotic spindle positioning, which are vital for female fertility and embryonic development (Schönichen2010Fifteen; LabatdeHoz2021Formins). Disruptions in FMN2 function have been linked to several human disorders, including premature ovarian insufficiency and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2022Heterozygous; LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

## Structure
Formin 2 (FMN2) is a protein involved in the assembly of actin filaments, characterized by its conserved formin homology 2 (FH2) domain, which is crucial for actin nucleation and polymerization (Montaville2016Role; Higgs2005Phylogenetic). The FH2 domain forms a head-to-tail dimer that encircles the terminal and subterminal actin subunits at the barbed end of the filament, cycling between 'closed' and 'open' states during processive elongation (Montaville2016Role). This dimerization suggests a quaternary structure where FMN2 can form dimers, which is essential for its function in actin filament assembly (Higgs2005Phylogenetic).

FMN2 also contains a C-terminal extension known as the Formin-Spire-Interaction (FSI) peptide, which is crucial for its interaction with the Spire protein and its processive activity in actin assembly (Montaville2016Role). The FSI region binds G-actin and weakly caps the barbed end of actin filaments, and its deletion converts FMN2 into a capping protein, reducing its processive activity (Montaville2016Role). Unlike other formins, FMN2 is not regulated by Rho GTPases and lacks the C-terminal auto-regulatory DAD region (Montaville2016Role).

## Function
FMN2 (formin 2) is a protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell shape maintenance, motility, and division. In healthy human cells, FMN2 is involved in actin filament nucleation and elongation, processes crucial for cell migration and cytokinesis (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). It is particularly important during the maturation of oocytes, where it facilitates the correct positioning of the meiotic spindle, ensuring proper chromosome segregation. This function is vital for female fertility and embryonic development, as it prevents the formation of daughter cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes (Schönichen2010Fifteen).

FMN2 also interacts with Filamin A to influence the proliferation of mesenchymal progenitor cells, which differentiate into myoblasts, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, playing a role in skeletal and muscular formation (Lian2017FilaminA). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for neuronal development and function, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). Disruption in FMN2 function can lead to developmental anomalies and is associated with various inherited human disorders (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FMN2 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. FMN2 is associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), a condition characterized by amenorrhea and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels in women under 40, leading to infertility. Novel heterozygous missense variants, such as c.1949C > T (p.Ser650Leu) and c.1967G > A (p.Arg656His), have been identified in cases of POI, suggesting a role in the genetic etiology of this condition. These variants may impair DNA repair processes, contributing to ovarian dysfunction (Li2022Heterozygous).

FMN2 mutations are also implicated in intellectual disabilities, specifically mental retardation, autosomal recessive 47. These cases often involve homozygous frameshift and nonsense mutations, typically found in consanguineous families, and large de novo heterozygous deletions (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

Altered FMN2 expression has been observed in neuropsychiatric conditions, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and Alzheimer's disease, where lower FMN2 mRNA levels have been reported. This suggests a potential link between FMN2 downregulation and these disorders (LabatdeHoz2021Formins). FMN2 is also associated with cancer, with its expression levels varying across different cancer types, indicating its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (LabatdeHoz2021Formins).

## Interactions
FMN2 (formin 2) is involved in several key interactions that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. It interacts with the Spire protein, a WASP homology domain 2 (WH2) repeat protein, to stimulate the assembly of a dynamic cytoplasmic actin meshwork. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal extension of the formin homology domain 2 (FH2) of FMN2, known as the Formin-Spire-Interaction (FSI) peptide, and the KIND domain of Spire. This interaction is essential for the synergy between FMN2 and Spire in actin assembly (Montaville2016Role).

FMN2 also directly binds and bundles both F-actin and microtubules (MTs) through its FH2FSI domain. This domain has a higher affinity for F-actin and MTs compared to the FH2_ΔFSI domain, indicating the importance of the FSI region in these interactions. The FH2FSI domain can bundle F-actin filaments and MTs, stabilizing MTs against depolymerization (Kundu2021Coupling).

In neuronal growth cones, FMN2 facilitates the co-organization of F-actin and MTs, promoting their alignment and stability. This interaction is crucial for MT dynamics and the stabilization of filopodial protrusions, which are essential for growth cone chemotaxis and axonal pathfinding (Kundu2021Coupling).
