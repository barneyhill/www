# RAPH1

## Overview
RAPH1, also known as the Ras association (RalGDS/AF-6) and pleckstrin homology domains 1, is a gene that encodes the protein lamellipodin. This protein is integral to cellular processes such as motility and cytoskeletal organization, primarily through its role in the formation and stabilization of filopodia and lamellipodia. Lamellipodin functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating interactions between Ras GTPases and talin, which are crucial for integrin activation and directional cell migration (Lagarrigue2015A). It is transported to the tips of filopodia by the motor protein Myosin-X, where it contributes to actin polymerization and cell migration (Miihkinen2022MyosinX). The protein's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in physiological events such as wound healing and embryonic development, as well as its potential implications in pathological conditions like cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Roşianu2022Loss; Kurozumi2018Clinicopathological).

## Structure


## Function
RAPH1, also known as lamellipodin, is a protein that plays a significant role in cell motility and cytoskeletal organization. It is involved in the formation and stability of filopodia, which are slender, actin-rich protrusions on the cell surface that facilitate cell migration by probing and interacting with the environment (Miihkinen2022MyosinX). RAPH1 is transported to the tips of filopodia by the molecular motor protein Myosin-X (MYO10), where it supports filopodia formation and stability, although it does not regulate integrin activity at these sites (Miihkinen2022MyosinX).

RAPH1 interacts with Ena/VASP proteins and is localized at the tips of lamellipodia and filopodia, contributing to actin polymerization and cell migration (Coló2012The). It acts as a scaffold connecting Ras GTPases to talin, thereby recruiting talin to the plasma membrane and activating integrins, which is crucial for directional cell migration (Lagarrigue2015A). In neuronal cells, RAPH1 is involved in endocytosis and membrane trafficking, processes regulated by NDR1/2 kinases, which are important for maintaining neuronal homeostasis (Roşianu2022Loss). These functions highlight RAPH1's critical role in cellular structures and functions, impacting processes like wound healing and embryonic development.

## Clinical Significance
The RAPH1 gene, also known as lamellipodin, has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cell motility and cytoskeletal organization. In breast cancer, RAPH1 overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes, including higher grade tumors, increased proliferation, and the triple-negative phenotype. It is linked to poor prognosis and shorter survival, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kurozumi2018Clinicopathological). 

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, RAPH1 is involved in endocytosis and membrane trafficking processes. Alterations in these pathways, particularly due to the loss of NDR1/2 kinases, can lead to impaired autophagy and neurodegeneration. RAPH1 acts downstream of NDR1/2 kinases, and its dysregulation may contribute to the accumulation of autophagy-related proteins, which is a feature of neurodegenerative conditions (Roşianu2022Loss).

RAPH1 has also been mentioned in the context of alopecia areata, where it is located within a chromosomal region associated with the disease. However, specific mutations or expression alterations directly linking RAPH1 to alopecia areata have not been detailed (Coda2011Integration).

## Interactions
RAPH1, also known as Lamellipodin, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with FOXQ1, a transcription factor, in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This interaction is crucial for promoting aggressiveness and radioresistance in TNBC cells through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. The co-expression of RAPH1 and FOXQ1 enhances STAT3 phosphorylation and the expression of target genes such as CCND1, MCL1, Bcl-XL, and MMP2, which are associated with cancer progression and survival (Liu2023Nuclear).

RAPH1 also interacts with MYO10, a motor protein, which recruits RAPH1 to filopodia tips. This interaction is mediated by the MYO10-FERM domain and is essential for the localization of RAPH1 at these cellular structures. The presence of RAPH1 at filopodia tips contributes to their stability and dynamics, potentially through interactions with other proteins like VASP, which are involved in actin filament dynamics (Miihkinen2022MyosinX).

These interactions highlight RAPH1's role in modulating cell motility, cancer cell migration, and invasion, making it a significant player in both normal cellular functions and disease states.
