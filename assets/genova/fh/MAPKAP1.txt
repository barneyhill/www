# MAPKAP1

## Overview
MAPKAP1 is a gene that encodes the MAPK-associated protein 1, also known as Sin1, which is a pivotal component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2). This protein plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as growth, metabolism, and survival by facilitating the assembly and stability of mTORC2. Sin1 is characterized by several functional domains, including a Ras-binding domain and a pleckstrin homology domain, which contribute to its interactions with other proteins and cellular membranes (Ruan2019Sin1mediated). The protein is involved in key signaling pathways, notably the phosphorylation of Akt, which is essential for various cellular activities (Yang2006Identification). Beyond its role in mTORC2, MAPKAP1 is implicated in stress response mechanisms and has clinical significance in conditions such as mood disorders and schistosomiasis (Ghosh2008A; Zhu2014MAPKAP1).

## Structure
The MAPKAP1 gene encodes the Sin1 protein, a crucial component of the mTORC2 complex. Sin1 contains several distinct domains, including an N-terminal region, a conserved region in the middle (CRIM), a Ras-binding domain (RBD), and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The N-terminal region is important for interactions with proteins such as Rictor and MEKK2, while the CRIM domain is involved in recruiting proteins to mTORC2 and is highly conserved across species (Ruan2019Sin1mediated). The RBD motif binds to Ras protein, suggesting a role in inhibiting Ras signaling (Ruan2019Sin1mediated). The PH domain binds phosphoinositides in cellular membranes, contributing to mTORC2 activation (Ruan2019Sin1mediated).

Sin1 exists in multiple isoforms, including Sin1α and Sin1β, which are involved in forming mTORC2, while Sin1γ and Sin1δ have distinct roles and localizations (Ruan2019Sin1mediated). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating Sin1's interactions and stability within the mTORC2 complex (Scaiola2020The). The structural organization of Sin1 within mTORC2 is essential for the complex's integrity and function, with its N-terminal region interacting tightly with Rictor and mLST8 (Scaiola2020The).

## Function
MAPKAP1, also known as Sin1, is a critical component of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), which plays a significant role in regulating cell growth, metabolism, and survival. In healthy human cells, MAPKAP1 is essential for the assembly and stability of mTORC2, interacting specifically with Rictor and mTOR, but not with Raptor, which distinguishes mTORC2 from mTORC1 (Ruan2019Sin1mediated; Yang2006Identification). This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, a key step in Akt signaling pathways that control various cellular activities, including growth and survival (Ruan2019Sin1mediated; Yang2006Identification).

MAPKAP1 also plays a role in cellular stress responses. It is involved in counteracting environmental stress by interacting with proteins such as poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and forming complexes with stress-associated kinases (Ghosh2008A). This function is crucial for organizing anti-apoptotic responses and maintaining cell survival under stress conditions (Ghosh2008A).

In addition to its role in mTORC2, MAPKAP1 is involved in platelet activation and arterial thrombus formation, where it regulates integrin-mediated signaling and Akt phosphorylation, highlighting its importance in hemostasis and thrombosis (Xu2018Sin1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAPKAP1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of mood disorders, the MAPKAP1 gene has been identified as a novel predisposing factor for familial mixed mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder. A specific variant, rs78809014, located in the intronic region of MAPKAP1, was found to segregate with mood disorders in a studied pedigree, suggesting a potential regulatory role. The expression of MAPKAP1 is significantly higher in individuals with MDD before treatment and decreases after treatment, indicating its involvement in the pathophysiology of MDD (Yang2019Whole).

In schistosomiasis japonica, the rs10118570 polymorphism in MAPKAP1 is associated with a protective effect against hepatic fibrosis and infection. The GG genotype of this SNP is linked to a reduced risk of these conditions, highlighting its potential clinical significance in managing schistosomiasis-related complications (Zhu2014MAPKAP1).

Additionally, MAPKAP1 interacts with components of the mTORC1/2 complex, which is relevant in cystic fibrosis pathology. Altered interactions and increased expression of MAPKAP1 have been observed in cells expressing the ΔF508 CFTR mutation, suggesting a role in the altered signaling pathways associated with this mutation (Reilly2017Targeting).

## Interactions
MAPKAP1, also known as SIN1, is a critical component of the mTORC2 complex, interacting with mTOR and RICTOR to maintain the integrity and function of the complex. This interaction is essential for mTORC2's kinase activity, which is crucial for Akt signaling and various cellular functions such as growth, metabolism, and survival (Yang2006Identification). MAPKAP1 does not interact with Raptor, a component of mTORC1, highlighting its specific role in mTORC2 (Yang2006Identification).

MAPKAP1 also interacts with poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2), particularly associating with its N-terminal domain. This interaction is significant in counteracting environmental stress and is involved in cellular responses to stress-related cytokines like TNFα and type I IFN (Ghosh2008A). The interaction between MAPKAP1 and PCBP2 is implicated in modulating stress responses and protecting cells from apoptosis (Ghosh2008A).

In glioblastoma cells, MAPKAP1 is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration through its interaction with mTORC2 and proteins like gelsolin (GSN). This interaction is crucial for promoting the aggressive behavior of glioma cells (Chantaravisoot2023mTORC2).
