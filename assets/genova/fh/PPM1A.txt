# PPM1A

## Overview
PPM1A is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1A, a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in the regulation of various cellular processes. This enzyme is characterized by its requirement for divalent metal ions, such as magnesium or manganese, for its catalytic activity, and it plays a pivotal role in modulating signaling pathways related to stress response, inflammation, and development. The PPM1A protein functions as a negative regulator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and is involved in the dephosphorylation of key signaling molecules, thereby influencing cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and stress responses. It also interacts with several proteins, including STING and TBK1, to modulate antiviral signaling, and with YAP in the Hippo pathway, affecting cellular growth and regeneration. Clinically, alterations in PPM1A expression have been associated with various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2015PPM1A; Kamada2020Metaldependent; Debnath2018A; Mazumdar2019The).

## Structure
The PPM1A protein, also known as protein phosphatase 2C alpha, is characterized by a catalytic core surrounded by two β-sandwiches and four α-helices. The catalytic center is located at the apex of the β-sandwiches, covering the two α-helices, and involves the chelation of at least two divalent metal ions, typically manganese or magnesium (Kamada2020Metaldependent). The structure includes conserved Gly residues near the catalytic domain, which are crucial for the formation and stabilization of the catalytic domain structure. Three conserved amino acid residues (Glu171, Arg174, and Arg195) form salt-bridges near the active site, contributing to the stabilization of the catalytic domain (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

The N-terminal region of PPM1A shares significant identity with PPM1B, containing a β strand and an N-terminus that faces the catalytic center. The Gly residue at the second position is N-myristoylated, affecting membrane association and substrate recognition (Kamada2020Metaldependent). The C-terminal region contains three α-helices and is structurally similar to the C-terminus of PPM1B and PPM1N (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

The crystal structure of PPM1A reveals two tightly bound Mn2+ ions in the active site and a small subdomain called the Flap, which is adjacent to the active site. This Flap structure is proposed to increase specificity through interactions with substrates (Debnath2018A). The presence of a third metal ion, M3, is suggested to stabilize the native structure of the enzyme and is critical for specific substrate recognition (Debnath2018A).

## Function
PPM1A, also known as protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1A, is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a critical role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It functions primarily as a negative regulator of stress response pathways by dephosphorylating multiple members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK (Debnath2018A). This activity contributes to its role as a tumor suppressor by activating p53 and specifically dephosphorylating cyclin-dependent kinases (Lammers2007Role; Debnath2018A).

PPM1A also negatively regulates inflammatory and developmental processes through the TGFβ, nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), and TNFα signaling pathways (SUN2009PPM1A; Debnath2018A). It acts as a phosphatase that dephosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, leading to the termination of TGFβ signaling (Lammers2007Role). In the NFκB pathway, PPM1A dephosphorylates IKKβ, thereby terminating TNFα-induced NFκB activation (SUN2009PPM1A).

Structurally, PPM1A requires millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions for its activity, with its active site containing two tightly bound Mn2+ ions and a third, weakly bound metal ion essential for catalysis (Debnath2018A). This enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and stress responses (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PPM1A gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, prostate, and oral squamous cell carcinoma. In breast cancer, particularly the triple-negative subtype, PPM1A is often underexpressed, correlating with poor clinical outcomes. Its deletion is frequent in ER-negative breast cancers, leading to decreased mRNA expression and promoting tumor growth by failing to inhibit cell cycle progression (Mazumdar2019The). In prostate cancer, PPM1A acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting NF-kB activation. Its expression is significantly lower in metastatic prostate cancer compared to primary tumors, suggesting that its loss may enhance tumorigenic behavior (Lu2013PPM1A).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma, miR-487a-3p targets PPM1A, and its overexpression reduces cancer cell growth and invasion, indicating an oncogenic role for PPM1A in this context (Wang2021MicroRNA487a3p). PPM1A also plays a role in regulating the Hippo signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell growth and organ size control. Alterations in PPM1A expression can lead to impaired cell proliferation and regeneration, particularly in the liver and intestines, potentially contributing to diseases characterized by dysregulated cell growth (Zhou2021The).

## Interactions
PPM1A, a serine/threonine phosphatase, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate various cellular pathways. It interacts with the C-terminal fragment of STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes), a key player in the antiviral innate immune signaling pathway. This interaction is enhanced upon viral infection and is crucial for modulating STING-induced type I interferon signaling. PPM1A dephosphorylates STING, preventing its phosphorylation and aggregation, which are essential for its activation (Li2015PPM1A).

PPM1A also interacts with TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1), another protein involved in antiviral signaling. It dephosphorylates TBK1, reducing its phosphorylation at Ser 172, which is important for controlling the activation of downstream signaling components like IRF3 (Li2015PPM1A).

In the context of the Hippo signaling pathway, PPM1A dephosphorylates YAP (Yes-associated protein), facilitating its nuclear localization and activation. This interaction is vital for processes such as liver and intestinal regeneration, as PPM1A's activity influences YAP's transcriptional activity and cellular localization (Zhou2021The).

PPM1A also interacts with IKKβ, a central molecule in the NF-κB signaling pathway, where it acts to terminate IKKβ-induced NF-κB activation by dephosphorylating IKKβ at specific serine residues (SUN2009PPM1A).
