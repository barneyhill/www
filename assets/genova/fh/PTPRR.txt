# PTPRR

## Overview
PTPRR, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R, is a gene that encodes a family of protein tyrosine phosphatases involved in cellular signaling pathways. The proteins produced by PTPRR, including isoforms such as PTPBR7, PTP-SL, PTPPBSγ-42, and PTPPBSγ-37, play critical roles in regulating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) by preventing their translocation into the nucleus, thus modulating their activity (Hendriks2009PTPRR). These proteins are categorized as receptor-type and cytosolic phosphatases, with distinct subcellular localizations and functions. PTPRR is particularly significant in the brain, where it maintains proper MAPK phosphorylation levels, essential for motor coordination and balance (Schmitt2009PTPRR). Additionally, PTPRR has been implicated in various diseases, including neurological disorders and cancers, where its expression levels and interactions are often altered, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hendriks2023Hereditable; Wang2019Protein).

## Structure
The PTPRR gene encodes multiple protein isoforms through alternative splicing and the use of different transcription start sites. These isoforms include PTPBR7, PTP-SL, PTPPBSγ-42, and PTPPBSγ-37, which differ in size and cellular localization (Hendriks2009PTPRR). PTPBR7 is a classical type I transmembrane protein with a cleaved signal peptide and a transmembrane anchor, while PTP-SL is identified as a type III transmembrane protein due to the lack of a functional signal peptide. The smaller isoforms, PTPPBSγ-42 and PTPPBSγ-37, are cytosolic (Hendriks2009PTPRR).

The molecular structure of PTPRR proteins includes a signal peptide, hydrophobic regions, transmembrane regions, a kinase-interacting motif (KIM), and a protein tyrosine phosphatase domain. The KIM domain is crucial for interaction with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and its phosphorylation affects MAPK localization between the cytoplasm and nucleus (Hendriks2009PTPRR). The receptor-type isoforms, PTPBR7 and PTP-SL, can form homo- and heteromeric complexes, while the cytosolic isoforms cannot (Hendriks2009PTPRR). The enzymatic activity of PTPRR monomers decreases upon multimerization, suggesting that ligand binding could modulate the activity of receptor-type PTPRR isoforms (Hendriks2009PTPRR).

## Function
PTPRR (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type R) is involved in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are crucial for various cellular signaling pathways. PTPRR binds to MAPKs, preventing their translocation into the nucleus and thereby regulating their activity. This interaction is modulated by protein kinase A (PKA), which can phosphorylate PTPRR, affecting its binding and activity (Hendriks2009PTPRR). PTPRR isoforms, such as PTPBR7 and PTP-SL, have distinct subcellular localizations, with PTPBR7 found at the cell surface and throughout the endocytic pathway, while PTP-SL is localized to late endosomes, suggesting distinct roles in cellular processes (Hendriks2009PTPRR).

In the brain, particularly in cerebellar Purkinje cells, PTPRR plays a significant role in maintaining proper phosphorylation levels of MAPKs, which is essential for motor coordination and balance. PTPRR deficiency in mice leads to increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, resulting in motor coordination deficits, highlighting its importance in cerebellar function (Schmitt2009PTPRR). PTPRR also interacts with the β4-subunit of the AP-4 complex, suggesting a role in vesicle sorting and endocytic transport (Hendriks2009PTPRR).

## Clinical Significance
The PTPRR gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In neurological contexts, PTPRR variants have been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) in Chinese females, potentially due to increased gene expression. This is supported by studies in mice, where overexpression of PTPRR led to depressive-like symptoms (Hendriks2023Hereditable). In cancer, PTPRR expression is notably reduced in various types, including ovarian, prostate, cervical, and lung cancers, often correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor progression.

In ovarian cancer, PTPRR is underexpressed, leading to increased β-Catenin phosphorylation and poor survival outcomes (Wang2019Protein). In prostate cancer, PTPRR is down-regulated by androgens, contributing to the hyperactivation of the RAS/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is associated with increased cell proliferation and cancer progression (NunesXavier2019The; Munkley2015Androgenregulation). In cervical cancer, PTPRR acts as a tumor suppressor, with its promoter hypermethylated in invasive cancer tissues, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for disease severity (Su2012Epigenetic). In lung adenocarcinoma, PTPRR is often epigenetically silenced, and its re-expression can sensitize cancer cells to SHP2 inhibition, offering a potential therapeutic strategy (Du2024Reexpression).

## Interactions
PTPRR interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various signaling pathways. In ovarian cancer, PTPRR is involved in the dephosphorylation of β-Catenin at Tyr142, a process crucial for regulating the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway. This interaction is mediated through α-Catenin, which forms a complex with E-Cadherin and β-Catenin, facilitating the dephosphorylation process (Wang2019Protein). The interaction between PTPRR and β-Catenin is dependent on α-Catenin, as knocking down α-Catenin suppresses the dephosphorylation of β-Catenin by PTPRR (Wang2019Protein).

PTPRR also interacts with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as ERK1/2, p38, and JNK. These interactions are facilitated by a kinase interaction motif (KIM) present in PTPRR isoforms, which is crucial for binding and inactivating MAPKs. The interaction is regulated by protein kinase A (PKA), which can phosphorylate a serine residue within the KIM domain, affecting the binding and dephosphorylation of MAPKs (Hendriks2009PTPRR). These interactions highlight PTPRR's role in modulating cellular signaling pathways, impacting processes like growth and differentiation.
