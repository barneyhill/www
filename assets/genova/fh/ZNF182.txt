# ZNF182

## Overview
ZNF182 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 182, a member of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein family, which is the largest class of DNA-binding proteins. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. ZNF182 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). The protein is notably expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (McKenna2018Wholegenome). Additionally, ZNF182 has been associated with certain cancer types, including bladder cancer, and is involved in the regulation of DNA methylation patterns during puberty (Chen2020Evaluating; Bessa2018Methylome). Despite its recognized roles, the precise molecular mechanisms and interactions of ZNF182 remain an active area of research.

## Function
ZNF182 is a C2H2-type zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby influencing the transcriptional landscape of the cell. ZNF182 is active in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of target genes, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and development (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

In the context of neurodevelopment, ZNF182 has been implicated in the regulation of neural stem cell activities, which are essential for normal brain development. These activities include the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, which are critical for brain function (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). Dysregulation of these processes can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the importance of ZNF182 in maintaining normal brain function (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

While ZNF182 has been associated with certain neurodevelopmental disorders, its precise molecular activities and interactions in healthy cells remain an area of active research. The protein's role in transcriptional regulation underscores its significance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF182 has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and Down syndrome. Elevated expression of ZNF182 has been observed in ASD cases, with one patient exhibiting hyperactivity, learning and visual-spatial difficulties, and microcephaly. This patient had a 1.3 Mb microduplication in the Xp11.23p11.3 region, which includes ZNF182, suggesting that increased expression due to gene dosage effects may contribute to ASD phenotypes (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). Another case involved a 335.4 Kb microduplication in the Xp11.2p11.3 segment, including ZNF81 and ZNF182, in a patient with developmental retardation, autistic features, and delayed growth and speech (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

In the context of cancer, ZNF182 has been studied for its role in bladder cancer. It was identified as one of the prognostic genes in bladder cancer, although specific details on its clinical significance, mutations, or expression alterations in cancer progression are not provided (Chen2020Evaluating). The gene was cloned for expression studies, but no significant change in cell viability or migration was observed when ZNF182 was overexpressed in bladder cancer cells (Chen2020Evaluating).

ZNF182 is also associated with changes in DNA methylation patterns during puberty, particularly in central precocious puberty (CPP), where it is one of the zinc finger genes related to differentially methylated regions (Bessa2018Methylome).

## Interactions
ZNF182 is a zinc finger protein that is part of the largest class of DNA-binding proteins, playing a critical role in regulating biological processes. It is widely expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, and is associated with intellectual disability, developmental delay, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (McKenna2018Wholegenome). Elevated expression of ZNF182 has been identified in ASD cases, suggesting that increased dosage of its encoding gene may contribute to ASD phenotypes. A microduplication in the Xp11.23p11.3 region, which includes ZNF182, has been associated with ASD features such as hyperactivity, learning difficulties, and microcephaly (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

In the context of leukemia, ZNF182 has been identified as one of the zinc finger proteins associated with the acetylation-mimic mutation TRIM28-K304Q in leukemic K562 cells. This mutation in TRIM28 affects its interaction with KRAB-zinc-finger proteins, leading to changes in gene expression. ZNF182 is specifically associated with the mutant form of TRIM28, indicating a unique interaction that does not occur with the wild-type TRIM28 (Chang2023AcetylationMimic). However, specific details about the nature of the interaction between ZNF182 and TRIM28 or other proteins are not provided in the available context.
