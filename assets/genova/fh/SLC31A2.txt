# SLC31A2

## Overview
SLC31A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 31 member 2 (CTR2), which is a member of the solute carrier family involved in copper transport. CTR2 is characterized as a transmembrane protein, primarily functioning as a low-affinity copper transporter within intracellular vesicular compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes (Haberkiewicz2022Decreased; Öhrvik2015The). Unlike its high-affinity counterpart CTR1, CTR2 plays a role in mobilizing copper from vesicular stores into the cytoplasm, thereby contributing to the maintenance of copper homeostasis (Wee2013The; Öhrvik2015The). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with significant expression in the brain, spleen, placenta, pancreas, and testis (Öhrvik2015The). The regulation of CTR2 expression and its interaction with other copper transport mechanisms are subjects of ongoing research, particularly in the context of its potential implications in diseases such as lung adenocarcinoma and Menkes disease (Haberkiewicz2022Decreased; Chang2022Development).

## Structure
SLC31A2 encodes a protein that is part of the solute carrier family, specifically involved in copper transport. The primary structure of the SLC31A2 protein consists of amino acid sequences that form transmembrane domains, which are crucial for its function in transporting copper ions across cellular membranes. The secondary structure of the protein likely includes alpha helices, a common feature of membrane proteins, which contribute to the formation of these transmembrane domains.

The tertiary structure of SLC31A2 involves the folding of these alpha helices, which is essential for the protein's ability to facilitate copper ion transport. While specific details about the quaternary structure are less defined, it is possible that SLC31A2 forms complexes with other proteins to perform its function effectively.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in SLC31A2, potentially influencing its function and localization within the cell. These modifications can play a significant role in regulating the activity of the protein and its interactions with other cellular components. The precise nature of these modifications and their impact on the protein's function remain areas of active research.

## Function
The SLC31A2 gene encodes the CTR2 protein, which is involved in copper transport within human cells. Unlike its counterpart CTR1, which is a high-affinity copper transporter, CTR2 functions as a low-affinity copper transporter and is primarily localized to intracellular vesicular compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes (Haberkiewicz2022Decreased; Öhrvik2015The). CTR2 is suggested to play a role in mobilizing copper from these vesicular stores into the cytoplasm, contributing to copper homeostasis (Wee2013The; Öhrvik2015The).

CTR2 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with notable expression in the brain, spleen, placenta, pancreas, and testis in humans (Öhrvik2015The). Its expression and localization can vary depending on cell type and copper levels, indicating a potential regulatory role in response to copper availability (Wee2013The). Although CTR2 does not significantly participate in copper import under normal physiological conditions, it may influence copper distribution by affecting the function of CTR1, particularly in the generation or stability of its truncated form (Öhrvik2015The). The exact molecular mechanisms and physiological significance of CTR2 in copper homeostasis remain areas of active research.

## Clinical Significance
The SLC31A2 gene, part of the solute carrier family, plays a significant role in copper metabolism, and its altered expression has been linked to various clinical implications. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), SLC31A2 is a key component of a copper metabolism-related gene signature (CMRGS). Its expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal lung tissues, and this downregulation is associated with poorer prognosis in LUAD patients. A risk score model incorporating SLC31A2 expression levels has been developed to predict patient outcomes, with lower expression correlating with shorter overall survival (Chang2022Development).

In the context of kidney function, SLC31A2 expression is influenced by factors such as age, sex, and ethnicity, which may affect drug metabolism and response. Although higher expression levels have been observed in certain demographic groups, the clinical significance of these variations remains unclear (Joseph2015Expression).

In a mouse model of Menkes disease, SLC31A2 expression is downregulated in response to copper administration, suggesting a role in protecting against copper nephrotoxicity. However, the precise mechanisms and clinical implications of this regulation are not fully understood (Haberkiewicz2022Decreased).
