# ACSL6

## Overview
ACSL6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 6, which is a crucial component of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family. This enzyme is involved in the activation of long-chain fatty acids by converting them into acyl-CoA thioesters, a vital step in lipid metabolism. The protein exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which affects its substrate specificity and functional roles in various tissues. ACSL6 plays a significant role in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids, influencing processes such as lipid synthesis, fatty acid catabolism, and membrane remodeling. It is particularly important in tissues like skeletal muscle and neuronal cells, where it contributes to lipid storage and membrane plasticity, respectively. Mutations in the ACSL6 gene have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Wu2020ETV6ACSL6; Castillo2022Novel; Soupene2010Activity).

## Structure
ACSL6 is a member of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase family, which plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism. The protein is known to exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, resulting in variations such as ACSL6_v1, ACSL6_v2, ACSL6_v3, ACSL6_v4, and ACSL6_v5. These isoforms differ in their fatty acid Gate domains, which are essential for substrate specificity and are located near the catalytic site (Soupene2006MultipleerythroidisoformsofhumanlongchainacylCoAsynthetasesareproducedbyswitchofthefattyacidgatedomains; Soupene2010Activity).

The primary structure of ACSL6 includes a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, with specific domains such as the AMP-binding domain. The secondary structure is inferred from homology to bacterial forms, as the mammalian structure has not been fully solved (Soupene2008Mammalian). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is affected by mutations such as the valine to methionine substitution at the 126-residue position, altering the protein's energetic and mechanical performance (Castillo2022Novel).

ACSL6 likely forms dimeric complexes, as suggested by studies on bacterial homologues and experimental evidence of dimerization in mammalian forms (Soupene2008Mammalian; Soupene2010Activity). The protein's quaternary structure involves the assembly of these dimeric complexes, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity.

## Function
ACSL6 (acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 6) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the activation of long-chain fatty acids by converting them into acyl-CoA thioesters, a key step in lipid metabolism. This activation is essential for various metabolic pathways, including lipid synthesis, fatty acid catabolism, and membrane remodeling (Soupene2010Activity). ACSL6 is particularly important in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA), where it preferentially activates these fatty acids, facilitating their incorporation into phospholipids or triacylglycerides, or their use in β-oxidation for energy production (Marszalek2005Longchain).

In skeletal muscle, ACSL6 is involved in channeling acyl-CoA substrates towards lipid synthesis rather than β-oxidation, influencing mitochondrial oxidative capacity and lipid storage (Teodoro2016Long‐chain). The enzyme's activity is modulated by nutritional status, with expression levels increasing after acute lipid ingestion and decreasing during fasting and exercise (Teodoro2016Long‐chain). ACSL6 is also expressed in neuronal cells, where it contributes to the rapid turnover and plasticity of plasma membrane lipids, playing a role in maintaining the phospholipid composition of cell membranes (Soupene2010Activity).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACSL6 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurological disorders. A novel missense variant in ACSL6 has been associated with multiple non-related neoplasias, including astrocytoma, thyroid, and breast cancer. This variant results in structural modifications of the ACSL6 protein, which is involved in lipid metabolism and is expressed in tissues associated with these cancers (Castillo2022Novel). The ACSL6 gene is also under-expressed in certain cancers such as leukemia, brain tumors, and cervical cancer, and is mutated in a small percentage of thyroid cancers, astrocytomas, and invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast (Castillo2022Novel).

In the context of hematologic malignancies, the ETV6-ACSL6 fusion gene is linked to myeloid neoplasms, including chronic eosinophilic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. This fusion gene is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to certain treatments, highlighting the clinical significance of ACSL6 in these conditions (Wu2020ETV6ACSL6).

The role of ACSL6 in neurological disorders is also notable, with disruptions in lipid homeostasis and neuronal function potentially contributing to conditions such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, although specific details on these associations are not extensively covered in the provided context.

## Interactions
ACSL6 participates in various protein-protein interactions, primarily forming dimeric complexes. The ACSL6 isoforms can form both homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes, which are crucial for their enzymatic activity. These interactions occur through the Gate-domain motifs, with specific residues like tyrosine in isoform 1 and phenylalanine in isoform 2 playing essential roles in their function (Soupene2010Activity). The formation of these complexes does not require the amino-terminal domain, as demonstrated by the increased dimer formation and stability in constructs lacking this region (Soupene2010Activity).

The study also highlights that inactive isoform 3 can interact with active isoforms 1 and 2, forming heterodimeric complexes that influence enzymatic activity. For instance, the inactive C-terminally tagged isoform 2 can exert a dominant negative effect on the active N-terminally tagged isoform 2, indicating that the structural integrity of the C-terminus is vital for proper function (Soupene2010Activity). These interactions are significant for maintaining lipid composition in cell membranes, particularly in red blood cells and neuronal cells, where ACSL6 is involved in lipid repair and membrane plasticity (Soupene2010Activity).
