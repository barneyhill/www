# HOXA10

## Overview
The HOXA10 gene is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes the homeobox A10 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its homeodomain. This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and in adult tissues, particularly within the reproductive system. As a transcription factor, homeobox A10 is involved in the regulation of endometrial receptivity and implantation, and its expression is modulated by sex steroids such as estrogen and progesterone. Beyond its reproductive functions, HOXA10 is implicated in the development of the prostate gland and has been associated with various pathological conditions, including acute myeloid leukemia and gastric cancer, where its expression levels are often dysregulated. The gene's involvement in these diverse biological processes underscores its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Hatanaka2019HOXA10; Taylor1998HOXA10; Guo2020Overexpression).

## Structure
The HOXA10 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a conserved homeodomain, which is a 60-amino acid sequence responsible for DNA binding. This homeodomain includes a helix-turn-helix motif, a common structural feature in DNA-binding proteins (Benson1995The). The primary structure of HOXA10 includes several conserved motifs, such as the M1 and M2 motifs, which flank the homeodomain and are involved in regulatory functions, particularly in rib-repressing activity (Guerreiro2012Regulatory).

The M1 motif contains phosphorylatable residues, including threonine and serine, which are crucial for its function, suggesting that phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification for HOXA10 (Guerreiro2012Regulatory). The protein also has an activation domain between amino acids 124 and 146, which is necessary for transcriptional activation of certain genes during myeloid differentiation (Bei2007Identification).

HOXA10 is known to produce multiple splice variants, resulting in different isoforms with distinct N-terminal regions. These isoforms share the same homeodomain but differ in their regulatory capabilities due to variations in their N-terminal sequences (Benson1995The). The tertiary and quaternary structures of HOXA10 are less defined in the available literature.

## Function
The HOXA10 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and function of the human reproductive tract, particularly the uterus. In healthy human cells, HOXA10 is involved in the regulation of endometrial receptivity and implantation. It is expressed in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle, with its expression significantly increasing during the mid-luteal phase, which coincides with the time of implantation. This suggests that HOXA10 is crucial for preparing the endometrium for successful implantation (Taylor1998HOXA10; Taylor2000The).

HOXA10 expression is regulated by sex steroids, such as estrogen and progesterone, which up-regulate its expression in the endometrium. This regulation is essential for the menstrual cycle and fertility, as evidenced by studies showing that disruption of HOXA10 leads to uterine factor infertility in mice (Taylor1998HOXA10). In addition to its role in the reproductive system, HOXA10 is involved in the normal development of the prostate gland, where it is expressed at higher levels in normal tissues compared to cancerous tissues, suggesting a role in maintaining normal tissue function (Hatanaka2019HOXA10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HOXA10 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), HOXA10 is overexpressed, which is associated with a poorer prognosis, including shorter overall survival and disease-free survival. This overexpression is linked to increased cell proliferation and apoptosis, contributing to AML pathogenesis (Guo2020Overexpression; Wang2009Constitutively). In gastric cancer, HOXA10 overexpression is correlated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is associated with decreased overall and disease-free survival, particularly when co-expressed with CD44 (Han2015Overexpression).

In reproductive health, HOXA10 mutations are linked to female genital malformations, such as congenital absence of the uterus and vagina. Specific mutations, like the ΔC-HOXA10 and p.Gly51Asp, have been identified in patients with uterine anomalies, suggesting a role in the development of these conditions (Ekici2013HOXA10). In endometriosis, HOXA10 expression is significantly downregulated, particularly in infertile women, indicating a potential link to endometriosis-associated infertility (Özcan2019HOXA10). Aberrant methylation of HOXA10 is also associated with various gynecologic disorders, potentially leading to reproductive dysfunction (Kulp2016Aberrant).

## Interactions
HOXA10 is a homeodomain transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids to regulate gene expression. It forms a heterodimer with Pbx2, a member of the PBC family of proteins, to bind to the ITGB3 promoter, activating transcription during myeloid differentiation (Bei2007Identification). This interaction is part of a multiprotein complex that recruits transcriptional co-activators like CREB-binding protein (CBP), enhancing histone acetylation and promoting gene activation (Bei2007Identification).

HOXA10 also interacts with Pbx1 and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to repress the transcription of the CYBB and NCF2 genes in undifferentiated myeloid cells. This repression is modulated by SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase, where activating mutations in SHP2 can lead to persistent repression, potentially contributing to myeloid malignancies (Lindsey2007Activation).

In smooth muscle cells, HOXA10-1 interacts with the telokin promoter, requiring Pbx for DNA binding specificity. It competes with other proteins like Hoxb8 and Serum Response Factor (SRF) for binding, influencing gene activation and repression (ElMounayri2005Regulation). These interactions highlight HOXA10's role in diverse cellular processes through its ability to form specific protein complexes and modulate gene expression.
