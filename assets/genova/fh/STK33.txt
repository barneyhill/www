# STK33

## Overview
STK33 is a gene that encodes the protein serine/threonine kinase 33, a member of the serine/threonine kinase family. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton and spermatogenesis. As a kinase, STK33 phosphorylates specific substrates, such as the intermediate filament protein vimentin, which is crucial for cellular structural integrity and function (Brauksiepe2008The). The protein is also implicated in male fertility, particularly in the differentiation of spermatids and the maintenance of sperm morphology (Martins2018Stk33). Beyond its physiological roles, STK33 has been associated with various cancers, where it influences tumor growth and metastasis through interactions with key signaling pathways and proteins, such as c-Myc and the HSP90/CDC37 chaperone complex (Azoitei2012Targeting; Yang2014STK33). These interactions underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology.

## Function
STK33 is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the dynamics of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. It phosphorylates the intermediate filament protein vimentin, specifically targeting the head domain, which is crucial for the reorganization of the filament system during cell division and other cellular functions (Brauksiepe2008The). This phosphorylation is important for maintaining the structural integrity and function of cells, as it may lead to structural changes such as disassembly, which is vital for processes like signal transduction and intracellular transport (Brauksiepe2008The).

STK33 is also involved in spermatid differentiation and male fertility. In mice, the absence of STK33 results in abnormal sperm morphology, particularly affecting the tail structure, which is essential for sperm motility and function (Martins2018Stk33). STK33 is expressed in primary spermatocytes and throughout sperm cell development, indicating its critical role in the later stages of spermatogenesis (Martins2018Stk33). Additionally, STK33 has been implicated in protecting cochlear hair cells from gentamicin-induced ototoxicity by modulating apoptotic pathways, suggesting a role in cell survival (Zhou2018STK33).

## Clinical Significance
STK33 (serine/threonine kinase 33) has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of several cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), high STK33 expression is associated with increased proliferation and metastasis, correlating positively with pathways related to inflammation, angiogenesis, and TGFB, while negatively with the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and P53 pathways (Wang2022STK33). In pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), STK33 promotes tumor growth through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhou2019STK33).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), STK33 enhances c-Myc transcriptional activity, contributing to tumorigenesis. Its overexpression is linked to advanced disease stages and poor survival rates (Yang2014STK33). STK33 also plays a role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) as a downstream mediator of HIF1α, promoting cancer growth under hypoxic conditions (Kong2017STK33). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), STK33 is associated with cisplatin resistance through the Hedgehog signaling pathway (Feng2021NFYB). These findings highlight STK33's role in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
STK33 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in various cellular processes. It phosphorylates the intermediate filament protein vimentin, specifically targeting the head domain. This interaction is direct, as demonstrated by co-sedimentation assays, and does not involve intermediate proteins (Brauksiepe2008The).

In the context of KRAS mutant tumors, STK33 interacts with the HSP90/CDC37 chaperone complex. It binds to HSP90 family members, including HSP90AB1 and HSP90AA1, as well as the adaptor protein CDC37. These interactions stabilize STK33, and inhibition of HSP90 leads to its degradation, which is crucial for inducing apoptosis in KRAS mutant cancer cells (Azoitei2012Targeting).

STK33 also interacts with the c-Myc protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It binds to c-Myc, enhancing its transcriptional activity, which is essential for HCC cell proliferation. The C-terminus of STK33 can block this association, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for HCC (Yang2014STK33).
