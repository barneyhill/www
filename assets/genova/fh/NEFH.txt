# NEFH

## Overview
The NEFH gene encodes the neurofilament heavy chain (NFH), a key structural protein within the neuronal cytoskeleton, classified as an intermediate filament protein. NFH is integral to the formation of neurofilaments, which are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of neurons. These filaments, composed of NFH along with neurofilament medium (NFM) and light (NFL) subunits, are crucial for determining axonal diameter and ensuring efficient nerve impulse conduction (Perrot2008Review; Gentil2015Neurofilament). The NFH protein is characterized by its high molecular weight and extensive phosphorylation, particularly at lysine-serine-proline (KSP) repeat motifs, which play a significant role in modulating axonal transport and maintaining axonal caliber (Ackerley2003Neurofilament; Sun1996Phosphorylation). Mutations in the NEFH gene have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, highlighting its clinical significance (Rebelo2016Cryptic; Jacquier2017Cryptic).

## Structure
The NEFH protein, or neurofilament heavy chain, is a critical component of the neuronal cytoskeleton, contributing to the structural integrity and function of neurons. Its primary structure is characterized by a long polypeptide chain with a high molecular weight of approximately 205 kDa due to extensive post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation (Perrot2008Review; Gentil2015Neurofilament). The secondary structure of NEFH includes α-helical domains, which are essential for the formation of coiled-coil structures that facilitate the assembly of neurofilaments (Perrot2008Review).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a stable configuration, allowing NEFH to interact with other cytoskeletal components. The quaternary structure of NEFH is defined by its assembly with other neurofilament proteins, such as NEFL and NEFM, to form heteropolymers that are integral to the neuronal intermediate filaments (Perrot2008Review; Gentil2015Neurofilament).

NEFH contains a unique C-terminal domain rich in Lys-Ser-Pro (KSP) repeat motifs, which are heavily phosphorylated. This phosphorylation is crucial for maintaining axonal caliber and regulating axonal transport (Figlewicz1993Polymorphism; Perrot2008Review). The phosphorylation of these motifs is believed to influence the spacing of cytoskeletal elements and contribute to the radial growth of axons (Gentil2015Neurofilament).

## Function
The NEFH gene encodes the neurofilament heavy chain (NFH), a critical component of neurofilaments, which are intermediate filaments specific to neurons. NFH, along with neurofilament medium (NFM) and light (NFL) subunits, forms heteropolymers essential for maintaining the structural integrity and diameter of axons, which is crucial for nerve impulse propagation velocity (Gentil2015Neurofilament; Rao2002Gene). The NFH protein is primarily active in the axon, where it contributes to the stability and function of the neuronal cytoskeleton, impacting nerve conduction velocity and overall neural integrity (Perrot2008Review).

NFH is extensively phosphorylated, particularly at lysine-serine-proline (KSP) repeats in its tail domain. This phosphorylation is crucial for determining axonal diameter and regulating neurofilament transport along axons (Ackerley2003Neurofilament; Sun1996Phosphorylation). The phosphorylation state of NFH affects its interaction with motor proteins such as kinesin and dynein, influencing the transport rate of neurofilaments (Gentil2015Neurofilament). Phosphorylation by kinases like Cdk5 is a key regulatory mechanism, with hypophosphorylated NFH being transported more rapidly than heavily phosphorylated counterparts (Ackerley2003Neurofilament; Rao2002Gene). These processes are essential for maintaining neuronal function and integrity.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEFH gene are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Frameshift mutations in NEFH can lead to the loss of the termination codon, resulting in the translation of additional amyloidogenic amino acids. This causes protein aggregation, which is a hallmark of CMT2 and can disrupt the neurofilament network, leading to neuronal death (Rebelo2016Cryptic; Jacquier2017Cryptic). These aggregates, known as aggresomes, are characterized by the accumulation of insoluble proteins and ubiquitin conjugates, and are targeted by the autophagic pathway for degradation (Jacquier2017Cryptic).

In addition to CMT2, NEFH mutations have been implicated in ALS, although with varying degrees of penetrance. The aggregation of NEFH proteins can trap interacting proteins, disrupting their normal functions and potentially impeding axonal transport, which is critical for neuronal health (Rebelo2016Cryptic). The presence of NEFH mutations can also lead to altered mitochondrial distribution, further contributing to neuronal dysfunction (Rebelo2016Cryptic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of NEFH in neurodegenerative diseases and highlight the potential for therapeutic strategies aimed at minimizing or clearing these protein aggregates.

## Interactions
The neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular structure and function. NEFH interacts with synaptopodin, a protein important for podocyte structure, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies. This interaction is significant in protecting against synaptopodin reduction and preventing podocyte detachment (Wang2018Neurofilament). NEFH also colocalizes with intermediate filament proteins such as vimentin and nestin in podocytes, suggesting a role in maintaining podocyte morphology and adhesion (Wang2018Neurofilament).

In the nervous system, NEFH interacts with microtubules through phosphorylation, which is essential for the structural integrity of the axoskeleton. This interaction is mediated by tau protein kinase II, which phosphorylates the NFH tail domain (Perrot2008Review). NEFH is also part of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and interacts with synaptic proteins such as SAPAP and spinophilin, which are important for synaptic structure and function (Yuan2016Specialized). Additionally, NEFH is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function and glycolysis, interacting with the Akt-β-catenin pathway in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (Kim2010Neurofilament).
