# C5orf52

## Overview
C5orf52 is a gene located on chromosome 5 in humans, encoding the protein known as chromosome 5 open reading frame 52. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by C5orf52 is not currently categorized under well-known protein families such as kinases, receptors, or transmembrane proteins, indicating that it may have a unique or specialized role within the cell. Research into C5orf52 and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential interactions and implications in human health and disease. Understanding the precise biological functions of C5orf52 could provide insights into its involvement in cellular pathways and its clinical significance (Qiu2020aarFDC).
