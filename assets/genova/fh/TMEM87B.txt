# TMEM87B

## Overview
TMEM87B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 87B, which is involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and membrane trafficking. As a transmembrane protein, TMEM87B is characterized by its hypothesized six-transmembrane structure and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and nucleus (Malaisse1994Expression). The protein is implicated in mechanosensitive cation channel activity and contains multiple phosphorylation sites, suggesting roles in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control (Hoel2022Structure; Han2023Structural). TMEM87B is expressed in a variety of human tissues and has been associated with several clinical conditions, including its interaction with the human papillomavirus type 18 E6 oncoprotein, which may influence oncogenic processes (Malaisse1994Expression). Despite its involvement in critical biological functions, the precise molecular roles of TMEM87B remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure


## Function
TMEM87B is a transmembrane protein involved in several cellular processes, including signal transduction and membrane trafficking. It is classified as a secretory protein with a potential signal peptide cleavage site, indicating its role in the secretory pathway (Malaisse1994Expression). TMEM87B is hypothesized to have a six-transmembrane structure and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and nucleus, suggesting its involvement in intracellular signaling and protein transport (Malaisse1994Expression).

The protein contains multiple phosphorylation sites and functional motifs, such as cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, which are implicated in cell cycle regulation and transcriptional control (Malaisse1994Expression). TMEM87B is also associated with mechanosensitive cation channel activity, playing a role in developmental processes and potentially influencing ion conduction in the Golgi apparatus (Hoel2022Structure; Han2023Structural).

TMEM87B is expressed in various normal human tissues, including the mouth, umbilical cord, lymph node, parathyroid, small intestine, and placenta, with the highest expression observed in neonates and embryoid bodies (Malaisse1994Expression). Despite its involvement in critical biological processes, the specific molecular functions of TMEM87B in healthy human cells remain largely unexplored.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM87B has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression or interactions. It is notably expressed in various tumors, including those of the adrenal, head and neck, breast, and cervix, suggesting a role in oncogenesis. The gene's interaction with the human papillomavirus type 18 E6 oncoprotein, which is associated with cervical cancer, indicates that TMEM87B may contribute to cellular oncogenic transformation by serving as a substrate for E6, potentially influencing tumor suppressor pathways (Malaisse1994Expression).

In addition to its role in cancer, TMEM87B is part of the 2q13 deletion syndrome, which is associated with developmental delay and mild facial dysmorphisms. This syndrome exhibits incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, with some carriers being unaffected. The deletion, which includes TMEM87B, is more prevalent in patients with intellectual disability or developmental delay, suggesting that TMEM87B may contribute to these phenotypes (Hladilkova2015A).

While TMEM87B's specific mutations or expression alterations have not been directly linked to multiple sclerosis, its potential regulatory roles in cellular processes suggest it could be involved in broader disease mechanisms (Ban2020Transcript).

## Interactions
TMEM87B has been identified as a novel interacting partner of the human papillomavirus type 18 E6 (HPV18 E6) oncoprotein. This interaction was discovered using a yeast two-hybrid system, which involved transforming yeast cells with a plasmid containing the HPV18 E6 gene and screening for proteins that bind to it. TMEM87B was identified as a candidate protein through this method, suggesting a potential role in HPV-related oncogenesis (Malaisse1994Expression).

The interaction between TMEM87B and HPV18 E6 was further confirmed by co-culturing transformed yeast cells and observing positive interactions on selective media. This suggests that TMEM87B may function as a coactivator in mammalian transcriptional pathways, potentially influencing the oncogenic strategy of HPV18 E6 (Malaisse1994Expression).

Bioinformatic analysis of TMEM87B indicates that it is a secretory protein with multiple phosphorylation sites and functional motifs, which may be involved in signal transduction and transcriptional control. These features imply that TMEM87B could participate in various cellular processes, although its exact role and interactions in cancer biology remain largely unexplored (Malaisse1994Expression).
