# MEGF6

## Overview
MEGF6, or multiple EGF-like domains 6, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function, particularly in calcium-binding and facilitating protein-protein interactions. The MEGF6 protein is predicted to be secreted and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as migration and signaling pathways, including the TGF-β/SMAD-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition. This protein is implicated in various pathological conditions, notably in cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Variants and mutations within the MEGF6 gene can lead to structural changes in the protein, potentially affecting its function and contributing to disease states (Teerlink2020A).

## Clinical Significance
MEGF6 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In colorectal cancer (CRC), MEGF6 is significantly upregulated and is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor patient survival. It promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway, enhancing metastasis and resistance to the chemotherapy drug 5-FU (Hu2018MEGF6). MEGF6 expression is higher in late-stage CRC and is linked to poor outcomes, suggesting its role as an oncogene (Hu2018MEGF6).

In the context of caspase-2 deficiency, MEGF6 expression varies between different tumor types. It is upregulated in EμMyc/Casp2 -/- tumors, potentially contributing to enhanced lymphomagenesis, while lower expression in Th-MYCN/Casp2 -/- tumors correlates with better survival outcomes in neuroblastoma (Dorstyn2019Transcriptome).

MEGF6 mutations have also been identified in amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, where they are associated with decreased overall survival, indicating a potential prognostic role in this condition (Huang2019Genomic). In liver cancer, MEGF6 has been found to have frameshift insertion mutations, although the specific impact on disease progression is not detailed (Sultana2019A).
