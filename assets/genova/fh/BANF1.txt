# BANF1

## Overview
BANF1 is a gene that encodes the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor 1 (BAF), a highly conserved protein integral to nuclear assembly and chromatin organization. BAF is categorized as a chromatin-associated protein and plays a pivotal role in maintaining nuclear structure and genome integrity. It functions by forming homodimers that bind to double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner, facilitating chromatin compaction and nuclear envelope reassembly. BAF interacts with various nuclear proteins, including histones, lamin A, and LEM-domain proteins, contributing to chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. The protein is also involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in regulating poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) activity following oxidative DNA damage. Mutations in the BANF1 gene are associated with Néstor–Guillermo progeria syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by premature aging features. Additionally, alterations in BANF1 expression have been implicated in various cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis (Cabanillas2011Néstor–Guillermo; He2024BANF1; Bolderson2019Barriertoautointegration).

## Structure
The BANF1 protein, encoded by the BANF1 gene, plays a crucial role in chromatin organization and nuclear assembly. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a protein with significant functional domains. The secondary structure of BANF1 is characterized by typical α-helical profiles, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which indicates that the protein maintains its helical structure under various conditions (Paquet2014NéstorGuillermo; Rose2021The).

The tertiary structure of BANF1 forms a globular shape, which is essential for its function. The protein functions as a dimer, indicating a quaternary structure that is crucial for its interactions with DNA and other proteins (Paquet2014NéstorGuillermo). Specific residues on the 'side' surface of the protein, such as K6, G25, and R75, are important for DNA binding, and mutations in these areas can significantly affect its function (Dharmaraj2019Rare).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in modulating BANF1's function. Mono-phosphorylation at Ser4 significantly reduces its DNA binding capability by altering its local conformation and DNA binding surface (Tang2023Monophosphorylation). These structural and functional insights highlight the complexity and importance of BANF1 in cellular processes.

## Function
The BANF1 gene encodes the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor 1 (BAF), a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining nuclear structure and genome integrity in healthy human cells. BAF is involved in nuclear envelope assembly, chromatin organization, and gene regulation. It forms homodimers that bind to double-stranded DNA in a sequence-independent manner, allowing it to compact or loop DNA, which is essential for maintaining chromatin structure (Rose2021The; Jamin2015Barrier).

BAF interacts with various nuclear proteins, including histones, lamin A, and LEM-domain proteins, contributing to chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation (Sears2020Diverse; Montes2009BarriertoAutointegration). It is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it regulates the activity of poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) following oxidative DNA damage, ensuring proper DNA repair and maintaining genomic stability (Bolderson2019Barriertoautointegration).

BAF's dynamic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are critical for its function and localization, impacting nuclear envelope integrity and facilitating the reformation of the nuclear envelope during mitosis (Rose2021The; Jamin2015Barrier). These processes underscore BAF's essential role in cellular health and its involvement in various cellular pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BANF1 gene are linked to Néstor–Guillermo progeria syndrome (NGPS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by features of premature aging. NGPS patients exhibit an aged appearance, growth retardation, decreased subcutaneous fat, thin limbs, and stiff joints. Unlike other progeroid syndromes, NGPS does not typically involve cardiovascular impairment, diabetes mellitus, or hypertriglyceridemia in early adulthood, but it does include severe skeletal abnormalities. The syndrome progresses slowly, allowing for relatively long survival despite early onset (Cabanillas2011Néstor–Guillermo).

Alterations in BANF1 expression levels are also implicated in various cancers. BANF1 is overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and is associated with cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. High BANF1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and reduced immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, suggesting its role in immune evasion (He2024BANF1). In gastric cancer, BANF1 is identified as a prognostic biomarker, with high expression linked to lower survival rates and reduced immune infiltration (Xu2024Identification). In cervical cancer, BANF1 expression is regulated by miR-203, and its downregulation suppresses cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Mao2015BANF1).

## Interactions
Barrier-to-autointegration factor 1 (BANF1), also known as BAF, is a protein that plays a crucial role in nuclear integrity and chromatin organization. BANF1 interacts with double-stranded DNA and is involved in chromatin compaction and nuclear envelope reassembly. It forms a ternary complex with nuclear envelope proteins lamin A/C and emerin, which is essential for nuclear envelope stability and function (Marcelot2021Diphosphorylated; Montes2009BarriertoAutointegration).

BANF1 also interacts with poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1), a critical DNA repair protein. This interaction is particularly significant following oxidative DNA damage, where BANF1 regulates PARP1 activity by inhibiting its auto-ADP-ribosylation, thereby affecting DNA repair processes (Bolderson2019Barriertoautointegration). The interaction between BANF1 and PARP1 is enhanced under oxidative stress conditions, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where BANF1 modulates PARP1's role in DNA repair (Bolderson2019Barriertoautointegration).

In addition to its interactions with PARP1, BANF1 is known to bind with histones and other chromatin-associated proteins, such as transcription factors and proteins involved in DNA damage response, indicating its broad role in maintaining genome integrity (Montes2009BarriertoAutointegration).
