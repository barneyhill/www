# TMED2

## Overview
TMED2, or transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the p24 family of proteins, which are integral to vesicular trafficking processes within cells. The protein product of TMED2 is categorized as a transmembrane protein, playing a pivotal role in the early secretory pathway by acting as a cargo receptor. It is involved in the selection and packaging of proteins into vesicles for transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein processing (Hou2017Nonalcoholic). TMED2 also participates in various cellular signaling pathways, including the immune response to viral DNA and Hedgehog signaling, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular function and organismal development (Di2020Tmed2regulates; Aber2019Transmembrane). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and various cancers, underscoring its clinical significance (ShiPeng2017TMED2; Hou2017Nonalcoholic).

## Structure
TMED2, or transmembrane p24 trafficking protein 2, is a member of the p24 family involved in vesicular trafficking. The protein structure of TMED2 includes several distinct domains and features. It typically contains a GOLD domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and is crucial for its function in the early secretory pathway. Additionally, TMED2 has a coiled-coil region that likely contributes to its structural stability and interaction with other proteins. The presence of a transmembrane domain is characteristic of its role in trafficking across cellular membranes.

TMED2 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may affect its stability, localization, and function. The ability of TMED2 to form oligomers suggests that it possesses a quaternary structure, which is important for its function in vesicular trafficking. These oligomeric forms may facilitate the assembly of protein complexes necessary for its role in the secretory pathway. The combination of these structural features enables TMED2 to effectively participate in the transport and sorting of proteins within the cell.

## Function
TMED2, a member of the transmembrane emp24 domain (TMED) protein family, plays a crucial role in the vesicular transport machinery, particularly in the early secretory pathway. It functions as a cargo receptor, facilitating the selection and packaging of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal proteins into coatomer (COP) II coated vesicles for transport to the Golgi apparatus. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein processing (Hou2017Nonalcoholic).

TMED2 is involved in several critical cellular processes, including the immune response to viral DNA. It associates with MITA (also known as STING), stabilizing its dimerization and facilitating its translocation into the ER, which is essential for the production of interferon responses to viral DNA (Aber2019Transmembrane). TMED2 also plays a role in ER homeostasis by interacting with AGR2, a protein that acts as a sensor of ER stress (Aber2019Transmembrane).

In addition, TMED2 is implicated in Hedgehog (HH) signaling, where it acts as a repressor by regulating the levels of Smoothened (SMO) at the plasma membrane. This regulation is crucial for controlling the strength of HH signaling, which is important for embryonic development and tissue repair (Di2020Tmed2regulates). TMED2's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the TMED2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a heterozygous mutation in TMED2 leads to increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response, contributing to liver dysfunction and steatosis in mice (Hou2017Nonalcoholic). TMED2 is also implicated in cancer, where its expression levels vary depending on the cancer type. In epithelial ovarian cancer, TMED2 overexpression promotes cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion through the IGF1R/IGF2/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suggesting an oncogenic role (ShiPeng2017TMED2). In breast cancer, increased TMED2 expression is linked to poor prognosis, particularly in Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes (p&gt; Lin2019&lt; Increased). Conversely, in liver cells, reduced TMED2 levels are associated with increased tumorigenesis, indicating a potential tumor suppressor role (Aber2019Transmembrane). TMED2 is also involved in head and neck squamous carcinoma, where its overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and altered immune cell infiltration (Gao2022TMED2910). These findings highlight the complex role of TMED2 in various diseases, influenced by its expression levels and interactions.

## Interactions
TMED2, a member of the p24 family, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. TMED2 interacts with the Wnt segment polarity pathway through a lectin- and decoy-type mechanism, potentially blocking Wnt-Frizzled binding by docking similarly to Frizzled (Fz) (Fiedler2016The). It also shows a unique interaction with collagen-like proteins, exhibiting a slightly superior affinity compared to bacterial collagen-binding domains (Fiedler2016The).

In the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, TMED2 acts as a repressor by regulating the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. TMED2 binds to SMO, restricting it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments, thus controlling its abundance at the plasma membrane. This interaction is disrupted by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signals, allowing SMO to translocate to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for HH pathway activation (Di2022TMED2; Di2020Tmed2regulates).

TMED2 also interacts with other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as PAR-2, P2Y4, and l-opioid receptor 1B, by arresting them in intracellular compartments. However, TMED2 overexpression can increase the plasma membrane abundance of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) (Di2022TMED2). These interactions highlight TMED2's role in GPCR trafficking and signaling regulation.
