# RAB25

## Overview
RAB25 is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically the RAB25 protein, which is a small GTPase involved in intracellular trafficking. The RAB25 protein plays a critical role in the regulation of vesicular transport and recycling processes, particularly in epithelial cells, where it is essential for maintaining cell polarity and adhesion. It is primarily associated with the recycling endosome system and interacts with other Rab proteins to facilitate the apical recycling of membrane proteins and lipids. This protein is notably involved in the trafficking and recycling of integrins, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling. The functional dynamics of RAB25 have significant implications in cancer biology, where its expression and activity can influence tumor progression and metastasis, with its role varying across different cancer types (Krishnan2013Rab25; Casanova1999Association; Nam2010Loss).

## Function
RAB25 is a member of the RAS oncogene family and plays a significant role in regulating intracellular trafficking and maintaining cellular polarity. In healthy human cells, RAB25 is primarily active in epithelial cells, where it is involved in the trafficking and recycling of integrins, particularly α5β1-integrins, which are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling. This protein is essential for maintaining the localization and expression of integrins at the plasma membrane, thereby influencing cell polarity and differentiation (Krishnan2013Rab25).

RAB25 is associated with the recycling endosome system, where it interacts with other Rab proteins like Rab11a, to facilitate the apical recycling of membrane proteins and lipids. This function is critical for the proper recycling of membranes and maintaining the integrity of epithelial cell surfaces (Casanova1999Association). RAB25's role in integrin trafficking is distinct from other Rab proteins, as it specifically regulates the expression of α5-integrin, impacting β1-integrin expression as a secondary effect (Krishnan2013Rab25).

The protein's activity is linked to maintaining tissue homeostasis, as it influences processes like cell migration and proliferation. Its proper function is crucial for preventing the loss of cell polarity, which is associated with epithelial transformation and neoplasia (Nam2010Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RAB25 gene have been implicated in various cancers, with its role varying depending on the cancer type. In breast cancer, RAB25 is often lost, particularly in hormone receptor-negative and triple-negative breast cancers, where its absence is associated with increased tumor growth and progression (Cheng2010Tumor). Conversely, in ovarian cancer, RAB25 is frequently overexpressed, contributing to enhanced tumor growth and invasiveness by increasing cellular ATP and glycogen stores, which protect cancer cells from bioenergetic stress (Cheng2012Rab25).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), RAB25 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its downregulation, often due to promoter hypermethylation, is linked to poorer prognosis and increased tumor invasiveness (Tong2012Rab25). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, the loss of RAB25 is associated with increased tumor formation, particularly in the context of Apc mutations, suggesting its role in maintaining normal cellular adhesion and signaling (Nam2010Loss).

RAB25's involvement in integrin trafficking and cellular metabolism highlights its complex role in cancer, where it can either suppress or promote tumor progression depending on the tissue context (Dozynkiewicz2012Rab25).

## Interactions
RAB25, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cancer progression. It interacts with β1 integrin, playing a crucial role in cancer cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by modulating the β1 integrin/EGFR/VEGF-A/Snail signaling axis (Jeong2018Rab25). RAB25 also interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), facilitating its recycling to the cell surface and maintaining active EGFR signaling, which is associated with radioresistance in cancer cells (Zhang2020Rab25Mediated).

RAB25 forms complexes with FIP-family proteins, and this interaction is targeted by stapled peptide inhibitors like RFP14, which disrupt the RAB25-FIP complex, affecting cancer cell migration and proliferation (Mitra2017Stapled). The interaction between RAB25 and CLIC3 is significant for integrin recycling, promoting cancer cell invasion and survival by recycling integrins from late endosomes/lysosomes back to the plasma membrane (Dozynkiewicz2012Rab25).

RAB25 also interacts with β1 integrin to regulate the trafficking of integrin-recycling vesicles, influencing the PI3K/AKT pathway and contributing to drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (Wang2019Rab25). These interactions highlight RAB25's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular dynamics in cancer.
