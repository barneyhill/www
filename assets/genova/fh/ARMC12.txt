# ARMC12

## Overview
ARMC12 is a gene that encodes the protein armadillo repeat containing 12, which is characterized by the presence of armadillo repeat domains. These domains are integral to the protein's function, facilitating protein-protein interactions that are crucial in various cellular processes. ARMC12 is particularly noted for its role in the progression of neuroblastoma, a pediatric cancer, through its interaction with retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4). This interaction enhances the formation of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), leading to the repression of tumor suppressor genes and promoting cancer cell growth and aggressiveness. The protein is highly conserved among primates, indicating its evolutionary importance. Research suggests that targeting the ARMC12-RBBP4 interaction could offer therapeutic potential in treating neuroblastoma and possibly other cancers where ARMC12 is overexpressed (Huang2021ARMC; Li2018Armadillo).

## Structure
ARMC12 is a protein characterized by the presence of armadillo repeat domains, which are crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions. These domains typically consist of tandem repeats approximately 42 amino acids in length, forming a platform for binding with other proteins (Huang2021ARMC). The ARM domain, particularly the ARM2 region (amino acids 206-245), is essential for its interaction with retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4) (Li2018Armadillo). This interaction is significant in the context of neuroblastoma progression, as it facilitates the formation of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), enhancing EZH2 activity and leading to the repression of tumor suppressor genes (Li2018Armadillo).

The ARMC12 protein is highly conserved in primates, with a 99% identity between the ARMC12 protein of gorillas and humans, and an 84% identity with that of mice (Huang2021ARMC). While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of ARMC12 are not provided, the protein's functional significance is largely attributed to its ARM repeat domain, which is involved in critical protein-protein interactions (Huang2021ARMC; Li2018Armadillo). The potential for post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms is suggested but not detailed in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance
ARMC12 is implicated in the progression of neuroblastoma (NB), a pediatric cancer. High expression levels of ARMC12 in NB tissues are associated with poor patient outcomes, including lower survival rates and advanced disease stages (Li2018Armadillo). ARMC12 interacts with retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4) to enhance the formation and activity of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), leading to the repression of tumor suppressor genes such as CADM1, EGLN3, HRK, HS6ST3, and SMAD9. This repression promotes the growth and aggressiveness of NB cells (Huang2021ARMC; Li2018Armadillo).

The interaction between ARMC12 and RBBP4 is crucial for its oncogenic activity, and disrupting this interaction has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy. Experimental approaches, such as using inhibitory peptides to block the ARMC12-RBBP4 interaction, have shown promise in reducing tumor growth and metastasis in NB models (Li2018Armadillo).

ARMC12 is also overexpressed in various other cancers, correlating with lower survival probabilities, indicating its broader role in cancer progression (Li2018Armadillo). However, genetic variants of ARMC12 are rare in NB cases, and its copy number is not significantly altered in NB (Li2018Armadillo).

## Interactions
ARMC12, an armadillo repeat-containing protein, is known for its significant role in neuroblastoma progression through its interactions with other proteins. A key interaction is with the retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4), facilitated by the ARM domain of ARMC12, particularly the ARM2 region, and the N-terminus of RBBP4. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which includes other proteins such as EZH2, SUZ12, and EED (Li2018Armadillo).

The ARMC12-RBBP4 interaction enhances the activity of EZH2, leading to increased levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a modification associated with the transcriptional repression of tumor suppressor genes. This interaction is essential for the oncogenic roles of ARMC12, as it promotes neuroblastoma cell growth and aggressiveness (Li2018Armadillo).

Blocking the ARMC12-RBBP4 interaction with inhibitory peptides, such as RBP23, has been shown to suppress the aggressive features of neuroblastoma cells, highlighting the potential therapeutic significance of targeting this interaction (Li2018Armadillo).
