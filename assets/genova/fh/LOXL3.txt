# LOXL3

## Overview
LOXL3 (lysyl oxidase-like 3) is a gene that encodes a member of the lysyl oxidase family of proteins, which are crucial for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The LOXL3 protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and a variable N-terminal region, which includes scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains. This protein is involved in both extracellular and intracellular functions, contributing to ECM stability and genomic integrity, respectively. LOXL3 plays a significant role in cellular processes such as the DNA damage response and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), interacting with various proteins to maintain genomic stability and influence tumor progression. Mutations in the LOXL3 gene have been associated with connective tissue disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Wei2020Role; Laurentino2019LOXL3; Santamaría2017Lysyl).

## Structure
The LOXL3 protein is a member of the lysyl oxidase family, characterized by a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and a variable N-terminal region. The C-terminal domain includes a copper-binding motif, lysyl-tyrosyl-quinone (LTQ) cofactor residues, and a cytokine receptor-like (CRL) domain, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Jeong2017LOXL3sv2; Laurentino2019LOXL3). The N-terminal region contains four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains and a signal peptide cleavage site (Laurentino2019LOXL3). LOXL3 can be glycosylated, with three putative O-glycosylation sites and five N-glycosylation sites, contributing to variations in its molecular weight (Laurentino2019LOXL3).

LOXL3 exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, including LOXL3-sv1 and LOXL3-sv2. LOXL3-sv1 lacks exons 1, 2, 3, and 5, resulting in a shorter protein with a molecular weight of 44 kDa, while LOXL3-sv2 lacks exons 4 and 5, encoding a protein of 67.4 kDa (Jeong2017LOXL3sv2; Laurentino2019LOXL3). Both isoforms retain some glycosylation sites and the ability to be cleaved by bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP-1) (Laurentino2019LOXL3). The protein is predicted to be secreted and processed in the extracellular space, with potential nuclear translocation suggested by a bipartite nuclear localization signal and a putative nuclear exporting signal (Laurentino2019LOXL3).

## Function
LOXL3 (lysyl oxidase-like 3) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by catalyzing the cross-linking of collagen and elastin fibers. This cross-linking is essential for the structural integrity and mechanical properties of connective tissues, contributing to tissue stability and elasticity (Wei2020Role). LOXL3 is primarily secreted by smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, where it facilitates the transformation of ECM components into a non-soluble state, which is vital for ECM stability (Wei2020Role).

In addition to its extracellular functions, LOXL3 has significant intracellular roles. It is involved in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression, particularly through its participation in the DNA damage response (DDR) and repair processes. LOXL3 interacts with proteins such as BRCA2, MSH2, and SMC1A, which are crucial for homologous recombination and genome integrity (Santamaría2017Lysyl). The enzyme is found in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, supporting its association with nuclear partners and involvement in mitotic progression (Santamaría2017Lysyl). These functions highlight LOXL3's importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on tissue development and repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LOXL3 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Autosomal recessive mutations in LOXL3 have been linked to Stickler syndrome, a connective tissue disorder characterized by high myopia, cleft palate, and retinal abnormalities. A specific homozygous missense variant in LOXL3 was identified in a family with micrognathia, cleft palate, and severe myopia, supporting its role in this syndrome (Chan2018LOXL3; Laurentino2019LOXL3). LOXL3 mutations are also implicated in early-onset high myopia (eoHM), with several pathogenic variants identified in patients exhibiting this condition. These variants are considered a common cause of autosomal recessive eoHM, distinct from other genetic conditions like Stickler syndrome (Jiang2023The).

Alterations in LOXL3 expression levels are linked to various cancers. In melanoma, LOXL3 is involved in tumorigenesis and progression, with its upregulation associated with the oncogenic BRAF pathway. Silencing LOXL3 in melanoma cells leads to DNA damage response and apoptosis, indicating its role in maintaining genomic stability (Laurentino2019LOXL3). LOXL3 is also downregulated in keratoconus, a condition causing irregular astigmatism, and may play a role in glaucoma (Laurentino2019LOXL3).

## Interactions
LOXL3 (lysyl oxidase like 3) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes and disease progression. It interacts with the transcription factor SNAIL, contributing to the repression of the E-cadherin gene (CDH1) and facilitating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for tumor progression and metastasis (Laurentino2019LOXL3). This interaction is stabilized by protein kinase D1 (PKD1), which phosphorylates SNAIL, promoting its interaction with LOXL3 and histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and 2) (Laurentino2019LOXL3).

LOXL3 also interacts with proteins involved in maintaining genomic integrity and mitosis, such as BRCA2, RAD51, SMC1A, MSH2, SMC3, and NUMA1. These interactions are crucial for DNA repair and the evasion of apoptosis, supporting LOXL3's role in genomic stability and cancer progression (Laurentino2019LOXL3; Santamaría2017Lysyl). In melanoma, LOXL3 is associated with the oncogenic BRAF pathway and influences the expression of EMT-related transcription factors, including SNAIL1 and PRRX1, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (VázquezNaharro2022Loxl3).

Additionally, LOXL3 is involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) and mitotic processes, interacting with proteins like NUMA1 and SMC1A, which are essential for proper mitotic spindle function and genomic stability (Santamaría2017Lysyl). These interactions highlight LOXL3's multifaceted role in cellular function and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
