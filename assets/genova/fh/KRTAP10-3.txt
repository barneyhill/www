# KRTAP10-3

## Overview
KRTAP10-3 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 10-3, which is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family. These proteins are integral to the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers, as they interact with keratin intermediate filaments within the hair cortex. The keratin-associated protein 10-3 is primarily involved in determining hair texture and quality, and it plays a significant role in the skin's wound healing processes by being upregulated during skin lesion repair (Marquardt2015Characterization). Beyond its structural role, KRTAP10-3 is implicated in cellular stress responses through its interaction with the GSTP1 protein, which is involved in oxidative stress and apoptosis pathways (Bartolini2016The). Additionally, the gene has been noted for its hypermethylation in tongue squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in oncogenic processes (ZHANG2013Genomewide).

## Function
KRTAP10-3 encodes keratin-associated protein 10-3, which plays a crucial role in the formation and structure of hair. These proteins interact with keratin intermediate filaments, contributing to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers. They are primarily active in the hair cortex, influencing hair texture and quality. In the context of skin wound healing, KRTAP10-3 has been observed to be upregulated, suggesting a role in the repair processes of skin lesions (Marquardt2015Characterization). 

In addition to its role in hair structure, KRTAP10-3 has been implicated in various cellular processes. It is involved in protein-protein interactions, as evidenced by its interaction with the GSTP1 protein, which is part of the oxidative stress response and apoptosis regulation pathways (Bartolini2016The). This interaction suggests that KRTAP10-3 may have a broader role in cellular stress responses and possibly in skin homeostasis (Bartolini2016The). 

Furthermore, KRTAP10-3 has been identified as hypermethylated in tongue squamous cell carcinoma, indicating potential involvement in cancer-related processes (ZHANG2013Genomewide). However, the specific function of KRTAP10-3 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.
