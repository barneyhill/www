# PGAM1

## Overview
Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1, a key player in the glycolytic pathway. This enzyme is classified as a mutase, facilitating the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate, a critical step in the metabolic process of glycolysis (Liu2017Conformation; p&gt; Li2020&lt; Phosphoglycerate). PGAM1 is a homodimeric protein predominantly located in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining the balance of glycolytic intermediates, which is essential for cellular energy homeostasis (Sharif2019Phosphoglycerate). The enzyme's activity is modulated by its structural conformation and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its role in cellular metabolism and cancer progression (Liu2017Conformation; Hitosugi2013Tyr26). PGAM1 is overexpressed in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (p&gt; Li2020&lt; Jiang2013The; Phosphoglycerate).

## Structure
Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is a homodimeric enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway, catalyzing the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate. The enzyme is composed of 254 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 28,784 Da (p&gt; Li2020&lt; Jiang2013The; Phosphoglycerate). PGAM1's active site includes key residues such as His11, Arg62, and His186, which are crucial for its catalytic function (Jiang2013The).

The C-terminal region of PGAM1, comprising residues 234-254, is intrinsically disordered and plays a significant role in the enzyme's catalytic cycle. This region undergoes large-scale conformational changes, transitioning the enzyme between open and closed states, which is essential for substrate binding and product release (Liu2017Conformation). The flexibility of the C-terminal region is highlighted by its lack of interpretable electron density in several crystal structures, indicating its dynamic nature (Liu2017Conformation).

PGAM1 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions. The enzyme's expression is regulated by pathways like PI3K/Akt/mTOR/HIF-1α, affecting its role in cellular metabolism (p&gt; Li2020&lt; Phosphoglycerate). PGAM1 is overexpressed in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (p&gt; Li2020&lt; Jiang2013The; Phosphoglycerate).

## Function
Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is a crucial enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, catalyzing the reversible conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG) (Liu2017Conformation; p&gt; Li2020&lt; Phosphoglycerate). This reaction is essential for the efficient breakdown of glucose, contributing to energy production in the form of ATP (Liu2017Conformation). PGAM1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is a homodimer with a molecular weight of approximately 28,804 Da (p&gt; Li2020&lt; Phosphoglycerate).

In healthy human cells, PGAM1 plays a significant role in maintaining the balance of glycolytic intermediates, which is vital for cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Sharif2019Phosphoglycerate). The enzyme's activity is regulated by its structural conformation, particularly the C-terminal region, which influences substrate entrance and product release during the catalytic cycle (Liu2017Conformation). PGAM1 also links glycolysis with biosynthesis, contributing to the production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) and maintaining the balance of glycolytic intermediates (Sharif2019Phosphoglycerate).

PGAM1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, liver, and muscle, where it exists in different forms such as BB-PGAM and MM-PGAM (PGAM2) (p&gt; Li2020&lt; Phosphoglycerate). Its activity is essential for proper metabolic function and energy production in these tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PGAM1 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. PGAM1 is frequently upregulated in numerous cancer types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, glioma, and oral squamous cell carcinoma, among others. This overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of metastasis (Sharif2019Phosphoglycerate; Li2020PGAM1). In NSCLC, high PGAM1 expression correlates with advanced clinical stages and poor survival outcomes, making it a potential prognostic biomarker (Sun2018Phosphoglyceric; Li2020PGAM1).

PGAM1's role in cancer progression is linked to its involvement in glycolysis and its interaction with various signaling pathways, such as the mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cellular growth and proliferation (Sharif2019Phosphoglycerate; Sun2018Phosphoglyceric). Phosphorylation of PGAM1 at specific sites, such as tyrosine 26, enhances its metabolic activity, providing a growth advantage to tumors (Hitosugi2013Tyr26). This phosphorylation is mediated by oncogenic tyrosine kinases, suggesting potential therapeutic targets (Hitosugi2013Tyr26).

Inhibition of PGAM1 has been shown to reduce tumor growth and proliferation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Several small molecule inhibitors have been identified, which disrupt PGAM1's role in cancer cell metabolism (Sharif2019Phosphoglycerate).

## Interactions
Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cancer progression. PGAM1 interacts with ACTG1, a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton regulation, which is crucial for cell migration and invasion. This interaction is particularly significant in prostate cancer, where exosomal PGAM1 promotes angiogenesis and metastasis by facilitating podosome formation and neovascular sprouting in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Luo2023Exosomal).

PGAM1 also interacts with ACTA2, influencing cytoskeleton remodeling and metastasis in a metabolically independent manner (Sharif2019Phosphoglycerate). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PGAM1 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, affecting the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin (Liu2018Phosphoglycerate).

PGAM1 is a downstream target of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, although its silencing does not significantly affect the phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR, indicating a complex interaction (Liu2018Phosphoglycerate). Additionally, PGAM1 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) exhibit positive mutual regulation, with silencing of either protein leading to decreased expression of both (Liu2018Phosphoglycerate).
