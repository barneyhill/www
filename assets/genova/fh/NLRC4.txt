# NLRC4

## Overview
The NLRC4 gene encodes the NLR family CARD domain containing 4 protein, a pivotal component of the innate immune system. This protein is categorized as a pattern recognition receptor and plays a crucial role in the formation of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex essential for host defense against bacterial infections. The NLRC4 protein is characterized by its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, and caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), which facilitate its structural and functional roles in immune signaling. Upon detection of intracellular bacterial components, such as flagellin and type III secretion system proteins, NLRC4 undergoes structural reorganization to form oligomeric complexes that activate procaspase-1, leading to the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of pyroptosis (Sundaram2021Advances; Hu2015Structural). Mutations in the NLRC4 gene are associated with various autoinflammatory diseases, highlighting its significance in immune regulation and homeostasis (Alehashemi2020Human; Sundaram2021Advances).

## Structure
The NLRC4 protein is a member of the NLR family, characterized by its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, and caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD). The NBD is a three-layered α/β structure with an additional β hairpin, playing a crucial role in maintaining the protein's autoinhibited state through ADP binding (Hu2013Crystal). The LRR domain is involved in sequestering NLRC4 in a monomeric state, interacting with the NBD to maintain structural integrity (Hu2013Crystal). 

Upon activation, NLRC4 undergoes significant structural reorganization, forming oligomeric complexes known as inflammasomes. This involves a rotation of the WHD-HD2-LRR module, which is essential for transitioning from an inactive to an active state (Zhang2015Cryo-EM). The protein can form disk-like structures with varying symmetries, such as C10, C11, and C12, indicating its structural flexibility (Zhang2015Cryo-EM). 

NLRC4's CARD domain facilitates interactions with other CARD-containing proteins, such as caspase-1, through CARD-CARD interactions, which are crucial for inflammasome assembly and function (Li2018CryoEM). The protein's structure is further stabilized by intermolecular salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions, contributing to its oligomerization and activation (Matico2024Structural).

## Function
The NLRC4 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the innate immune system, primarily involved in the formation of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that plays a significant role in host defense against bacterial infections. In healthy human cells, NLRC4 is activated in the cytoplasm upon detection of intracellular bacterial components, such as flagellin and type III secretion system (T3SS) proteins, through interactions with NLR family apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs) (Sundaram2021Advances; Hu2015Structural).

Upon activation, NLRC4 undergoes structural reorganization to form a wheel-like architecture, which facilitates the recruitment and activation of procaspase-1. This activation leads to the cleavage of pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, which are then released to initiate an immune response (Duncan2017The; Hu2015Structural). The inflammasome's activation also results in pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death, which helps in controlling bacterial infections (Sundaram2021Advances).

NLRC4 is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis by detecting and responding to bacterial infections, thereby preventing the spread of infection and contributing to the organism's overall immune defense (Duncan2017The; Sundaram2021Advances).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NLRC4 gene are linked to a range of autoinflammatory diseases due to its role in inflammasome activation. These mutations can lead to conditions such as early-onset recurrent fever flares, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), and neonatal-onset enterocolitis (Sundaram2021Advances). Specific mutations, like p.Val341Ala, are associated with periodic fever and enterocolitis, while familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) is linked to enhanced caspase-1 activation and increased IL-1β production (Sundaram2021Advances). The p.G172S mutation in the NBD domain is associated with mild autoinflammation and recurrent urticaria, altering the protein's spatial structure and enhancing inflammatory responses (Wang2021A).

The NLRC4 gene also plays a role in immune dysregulation, with the A160T mutation linked to ulcerative colitis and increased IL-18 levels, suggesting a connection to inflammatory bowel disease (Steiner2021Recessive). Gain-of-function mutations in NLRC4 are associated with systemic inflammation and high serum IL-18 levels, predisposing individuals to MAS (Alehashemi2020Human). These mutations can cause symptoms like recurrent fever, skin erythema, and inflammatory arthritis, with treatments targeting cytokine signaling showing promise (Sundaram2021Advances).

## Interactions
NLRC4 interacts with NAIP proteins to form the NLRC4 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex crucial for immune responses. NAIP proteins, such as NAIP2 and NAIP5, recognize bacterial ligands like flagellin and type III secretion system (T3SS) components, which then interact with NLRC4 to initiate its oligomerization and activation (Zhao2011The; Fusco2018Novel). The interaction between NAIP and NLRC4 is ligand-dependent, with NAIP proteins binding specific bacterial components to facilitate NLRC4 activation (Fusco2018Novel).

The NLRC4 protein has distinct 'receptor' and 'catalytic' surfaces that are essential for its activation and oligomerization. The catalytic surface of an activated NLRC4 molecule interacts with the receptor surface of an inactive molecule, promoting the assembly of the inflammasome complex (Fusco2018Novel). Mutations in these surfaces can affect the interaction and assembly of the inflammasome, highlighting their importance in NLRC4 function (Hu2015Structural).

NLRC4 can also directly interact with caspase-1 through its CARD domain, bypassing the need for ASC, which is typically required for caspase-1 activation in other inflammasomes (Fusco2018Novel). This direct interaction underscores a unique mechanism of action for the NLRC4 inflammasome.
