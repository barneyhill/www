# ENHO

## Overview
The ENHO gene encodes the peptide hormone adropin, which is integral to the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolic processes. Adropin is primarily expressed in the liver and brain, where it plays a crucial role in modulating glucose and lipid metabolism. As a regulatory protein, adropin enhances insulin signaling and reduces hepatic glucose production, thereby contributing to improved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health (Kumar2008Identification; Ali2022Adropin’s). Additionally, adropin influences lipid metabolism by modulating serum triglyceride levels and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which are vital for cardiovascular health (Ali2022Adropin’s). The expression of adropin is sensitive to dietary macronutrients, linking it to metabolic adaptations during fasting and feeding cycles (Kumar2008Identification). Given its multifaceted roles, adropin is a significant focus of research for its potential implications in metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases.

## Function
The ENHO gene encodes the protein adropin, which plays a significant role in energy homeostasis and metabolic regulation. Adropin is primarily expressed in the liver and brain, where it influences glucose and lipid metabolism. It is involved in regulating glucose homeostasis by enhancing insulin signaling pathways and reducing hepatic glucose production, which helps alleviate insulin resistance (Kumar2008Identification; Ali2022Adropin’s). Adropin also affects lipid metabolism by reducing serum triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, contributing to improved cardiac function and lipid profiles (Ali2022Adropin’s).

In cellular processes, adropin promotes glucose oxidation in skeletal muscle and regulates hepatic lipogenic genes, impacting lipogenesis and energy substrate utilization (Ali2022Adropin’s). It also plays a role in endothelial cell function by upregulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression, enhancing nitric oxide release, and facilitating neovascularization, which protects the cardiovascular system (Zheng2024Development). Adropin's expression is influenced by dietary macronutrients, linking it to energy homeostasis and metabolic adaptation during fasting and feeding cycles (Kumar2008Identification). These functions highlight adropin's critical role in maintaining metabolic balance and protecting against metabolic disorders.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ENHO gene, which encodes the peptide hormone adropin, have been associated with various diseases and conditions. Reduced adropin levels are linked to metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In particular, adropin deficiency in knockout mice leads to worsened glucose homeostasis and fat metabolism disorders, contributing to the development of T2DM and fatty pancreas disease (Chen2017Adropin). Mutations in the ENHO gene, such as p.Cys56Trp, have been identified in patients with these conditions, suggesting a genetic basis for the observed metabolic derangements (Chen2017Adropin).

In cardiovascular contexts, reduced adropin levels are observed in hypertensive individuals and are associated with increased target organ damage (Kolben2020Adropin). In systemic sclerosis, decreased ENHO expression is linked to endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy, key features of the disease (Zheng2024Development). In colorectal cancer, decreased adropin expression in tumor cells is associated with macrophage infiltration and tumor progression, although adropin may also exhibit antitumor effects (Jia2023Lowdose). These findings highlight the potential of adropin as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various diseases.
