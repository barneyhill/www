# HPX

## Overview
The HPX gene encodes the protein hemopexin, a plasma glycoprotein primarily involved in heme binding and transport. Hemopexin is categorized as a serum glycoprotein and plays a crucial role in protecting the body from oxidative damage by sequestering free heme, which can be toxic if not properly managed. The protein's structure is characterized by a unique arrangement of beta-propeller domains that facilitate high-affinity heme binding, allowing it to transport heme to the liver for safe degradation and recycling (Smith2015Hemopexin; Baker1999Crystalstructureofhemopexinrevealsanovelhighaffinityhemesiteformedbetweentwoβpropellerdomains). Hemopexin's interactions with cellular receptors and its involvement in modulating immune responses underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing inflammation (Vanacore2019Safe; Smith2015Hemopexin). The protein's clinical significance is highlighted in conditions such as sickle cell disease, sepsis, and malaria, where its levels and function can influence disease outcomes (Vercellotti2016Hepatic; Li2023Doubleedged).

## Structure
Hemopexin (HPX) is a 60 kDa serum glycoprotein with a unique molecular structure that facilitates its role in heme binding and transport. The primary structure of hemopexin is characterized by a sequence rich in cysteine residues, which form disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's stability. The secondary structure includes beta-sheets and alpha-helices, which are organized into a distinctive tertiary structure comprising two homologous domains of approximately 200 residues each, connected by a 20-residue linker (Baker1999Crystalstructureofhemopexinrevealsanovelhighaffinityhemesiteformedbetweentwoβpropellerdomains).

These domains form a four-bladed β-propeller fold, a structural motif that is crucial for the high-affinity binding of heme. The heme binding site is located between the two β-propeller domains and involves two histidine residues, His 213 and His 266, which coordinate the heme iron in a bis-histidyl Fe(III) complex (Baker1999Crystalstructureofhemopexinrevealsanovelhighaffinityhemesiteformedbetweentwoβpropellerdomains). The quaternary structure of hemopexin is typically monomeric, and the protein undergoes common post-translational modifications, including glycosylation (Baker1999Crystalstructureofhemopexinrevealsanovelhighaffinityhemesiteformedbetweentwoβpropellerdomains). This structural arrangement allows hemopexin to sequester free heme effectively, protecting the body from oxidative damage and limiting pathogen access to heme.

## Function
Hemopexin (HPX) is a plasma glycoprotein that plays a critical role in protecting healthy human cells from heme toxicity. It binds free heme with high affinity, preventing oxidative damage and inflammation that can result from the breakdown of hemoglobin during hemolysis (Vanacore2019Safe; Smith2015Hemopexin). HPX facilitates the transport of heme to the liver, where it is metabolized into bilirubin, carbon monoxide, and iron. The iron is then stored or reused, contributing to iron homeostasis (Smith2015Hemopexin; Li2023Doubleedged).

In the liver, HPX-heme complexes are endocytosed by hepatocytes, where heme is degraded, and iron is either stored or utilized for metabolic processes (Vanacore2019Safe; Smith2015Hemopexin). This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress (Vanacore2019Safe). HPX also plays a role in modulating immune responses by downregulating inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, thus mitigating inflammation (Smith2015Hemopexin).

HPX is active in various tissues, including the liver, nervous system, and kidneys, and circulates in plasma at concentrations of 0.5-1.5 mg/ml (Li2023Doubleedged). Its protective functions are essential in conditions of systemic stress and oxidative damage, highlighting its importance in maintaining organismal health (Smith2015Hemopexin).

## Clinical Significance
Hemopexin (HPX) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its ability to bind free heme and mitigate oxidative stress. Alterations in HPX levels or function can impact disease outcomes. In sickle cell disease (SCD), low plasma levels of HPX due to chronic hemolysis increase vulnerability to heme toxicity, leading to inflammation and vascular complications. Increasing HPX levels through hepatic overexpression has been shown to reduce inflammation and microvascular stasis in murine models of SCD (Vercellotti2016Hepatic).

In sepsis, lower HPX levels are associated with higher mortality rates, as HPX helps neutralize oxidative damage caused by free heme. Its administration in animal models has demonstrated protective effects against tissue damage and lethality (Li2023Doubleedged). In malaria, the heme to HPX ratio inversely correlates with disease severity and mortality, highlighting the importance of HPX in managing heme toxicity (Li2023Doubleedged).

HPX is also implicated in nephrotic syndrome, where increased levels during relapse suggest a role in inducing proteinuria, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (PukajłoMarczyk2021Involvement). These findings underscore the clinical significance of HPX in various hematological and inflammatory conditions.

## Interactions
Hemopexin (HPX) is primarily known for its high-affinity binding to free heme, forming a complex that interacts with the CD91/LRP1 receptor on liver cells to facilitate heme clearance through receptor-mediated endocytosis (Vanacore2019Safe; Smith2015Hemopexin). This interaction is crucial for preventing heme-induced oxidative stress and inflammation (Poillerat2020Hemopexin). HPX also interacts with haptoglobin (Hp) in the context of hemolysis, where both proteins work to mitigate heme toxicity by binding hemoglobin and heme, respectively (Smith2015Hemopexin; Li2023Doubleedged).

In the central nervous system, HPX is expressed by neurons and glial cells, where it binds heme to protect against blood-related injuries. This interaction involves antioxidation and the downregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and caspase-3, which are associated with cellular protection (Li2023Doubleedged). HPX also plays a role in modulating immune responses by downregulating inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6 in macrophages, which helps limit systemic inflammation (Smith2015Hemopexin).

HPX's interaction with the cytokine IL-6 can alter the response of liver cells to heme-HPX complexes, potentially affecting pathways like the mitogen-activated protein kinase C-Jun kinase (JNK) pathway (Montecinos2019What). These interactions highlight HPX's multifaceted role in heme metabolism and its protective effects against oxidative damage and inflammation.
