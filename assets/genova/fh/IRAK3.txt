# IRAK3

## Overview
IRAK3, also known as interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase M, is a gene that encodes a pseudokinase protein involved in the regulation of immune responses. The IRAK3 protein plays a crucial role as a negative regulator within the innate immune system, particularly in modulating the signaling pathways of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) (Nguyen2022Modulation). Unlike other kinases, IRAK3 is characterized by a pseudokinase domain, which lacks catalytic activity due to specific amino acid substitutions, yet it retains significant regulatory functions (Lange2021Dimeric). The protein's unique structure, including a death domain and a proline-serine-threonine-rich region, facilitates its interaction with other signaling molecules, thereby inhibiting the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and controlling inflammatory responses (Freihat2019IRAK3). Dysregulation of IRAK3 has been associated with various inflammatory diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Nguyen2022Modulation).

## Structure
The pseudokinase IRAK3, also known as interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase M, exhibits a unique molecular structure characterized by a closed, pseudoactive conformation. Its primary structure includes a death domain, a proline-serine-threonine-rich (ProST) region, and a pseudokinase domain, which is catalytically inactive due to specific amino acid substitutions (Lange2021Dimeric; Rebl2019At). The secondary structure of IRAK3 features an N-lobe consisting of an anti-parallel β-sheet and a C-lobe composed of tightly packed α-helices, maintaining the eukaryotic kinase fold (Lange2021Dimeric).

IRAK3 forms a dimer through a unique head-to-head interface, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bridges, which are suggested to be regulated by redox mechanisms (Lange2021Dimeric). This dimerization is distinct from other kinases and involves specific residues such as L210 and E214 (Lange2021Dimeric). The quaternary structure of IRAK3 also allows for potential hetero-oligomerization with IRAK4, which may modulate signaling pathways by inhibiting IRAK4's catalytic activity (Lange2021Dimeric).

IRAK3's structure includes a regulatory spine (R-spine) and a catalytic spine (C-spine), with a conserved cysteine residue suggesting a redox-based regulatory mechanism (Lange2021Dimeric). The protein's G-loop contains a unique hydrophobic anchor, F177, which stabilizes its closed conformation (Lange2021Dimeric).

## Function
IRAK3, also known as IRAK-M, is a critical modulator of inflammation in the innate immune system, primarily expressed in monocytes and macrophages. It functions as a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling pathways, which are essential for inflammatory responses (Nguyen2022Modulation). IRAK3 inhibits the dissociation of IRAK1 or IRAK2 from myddosome complexes, preventing their interaction with TRAF6, a necessary step for NF-κB activation. This inhibition is crucial for controlling inflammatory responses and maintaining immune homeostasis (Nguyen2020Analysis).

IRAK3 contains a pseudokinase domain with a guanylate cyclase center that produces cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This cGMP production is vital for IRAK3's role in modulating downstream signaling pathways, particularly in suppressing NFκB activity in response to lipopolysaccharides (Freihat2019IRAK3). The presence of cGMP may selectively affect downstream signaling pathways by modulating the binding and/or activity of nearby proteins involved in the inflammatory signaling cascade (Freihat2019IRAK3). In healthy cells, IRAK3's ability to produce cGMP and suppress NFκB activity suggests its role in maintaining homeostasis and regulating inflammatory responses (Freihat2019IRAK3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IRAK3 gene have been implicated in various inflammatory diseases. IRAK3 is a critical modulator of inflammation, and its dysregulation can contribute to conditions such as sepsis, asthma, and certain cancers. In sepsis, IRAK3 expression is upregulated during the immunosuppressive phase, correlating with decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6, suggesting its role in managing the immune response (Nguyen2020Analysis). In asthma, elevated IRAK3 expression is associated with severe cases, potentially contributing to cytokine storms (Nguyen2022Modulation).

Mutations in the guanylate cyclase center of IRAK3, such as R372L, impair its ability to produce cGMP and suppress NFκB activity, which can lead to increased inflammation (Freihat2019IRAK3; Nguyen2022Modulation). These mutations can disrupt IRAK3's normal function in inhibiting inflammatory cytokine production, potentially exacerbating inflammatory responses in diseases like asthma and sepsis (Nguyen2022Modulation).

Alterations in IRAK3 expression or function can significantly impact inflammatory cytokine production, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions characterized by dysregulated inflammation (Nguyen2022Modulation).

## Interactions
IRAK3, also known as IRAK-M, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play a crucial role in modulating immune signaling pathways. It primarily acts as a negative regulator by interacting with other members of the IRAK family, such as IRAK1 and IRAK2, forming heterodimers that inhibit downstream NF-κB activation (Freihat2019IRAK3). This interaction is facilitated through the death domain, a common feature in the assembly of signaling complexes in the TLR/IL-1R pathway (Freihat2019IRAK3).

IRAK3 also interacts with the myddosome complex, which includes MyD88 and IRAK4, to inhibit the dissociation of IRAK1 or IRAK2, thereby preventing their interaction with TRAF6, a necessary step for NF-κB activation (Nguyen2020Analysis; Freihat2019IRAK3). This inhibition results in decreased NF-κB DNA binding activity and modulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines (Nguyen2020Analysis).

IRAK3's dimeric structure, characterized by a unique head-to-head interface, suggests a potential mechanism for its negative regulatory role in immune signaling. This dimerization is distinct from other known kinase dimerization modes and involves hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds (Lange2021Dimeric). The potential for IRAK3 to form hetero-oligomers with IRAK4 suggests that such interactions could inhibit IRAK4 activity, further modulating immune responses (Lange2021Dimeric).
