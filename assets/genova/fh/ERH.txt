# ERH

## Overview
The ERH gene encodes the ERH mRNA splicing and mitosis factor, a highly conserved protein that plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation and cell cycle progression. This protein is characterized as a transcriptional coregulator and is involved in essential cellular processes such as mRNA splicing and mitosis. Structurally, the ERH protein forms a dimer through its unique tertiary structure, which is crucial for its function in the nucleus. It interacts with various components of the RNA processing machinery and transcriptional elongation factors, underscoring its role in maintaining cellular function and genomic stability. The ERH protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and is particularly active in rapidly dividing cells, including cancerous tissues, where it is implicated in tumorigenesis and may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Wan2005Structure; Pang2022ERH; Weng2013The).

## Structure
The ERH (Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog) protein is a highly conserved transcriptional coregulator found across eukaryotes. Its primary structure consists of 104 amino acids, with a single amino acid difference noted in zebrafish compared to humans and frogs (Wan2005Structure; Jin2007A). The secondary structure of ERH includes a novel fold composed of three alpha-helices and a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, with the helices positioned on one side of the sheet (Jin2007A; Arai2005Crystal). 

The tertiary structure reveals that ERH forms a dimer through interactions between the beta-sheet regions, creating a pseudo-beta-barrel structure (Jin2007A). This dimerization is characterized by hydrophobic interactions and is crucial for its function (Wan2005Structure; Arai2005Crystal). 

ERH is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at conserved sites such as Thr18 and Ser24, which may influence its dimerization and interactions with other proteins (Wan2005Structure). The protein is involved in transcriptional repression and cell-cycle regulation, interacting with factors like DCoH/PCD and influencing HNF1-dependent gene regulation (Wan2005Structure; Jin2007A).

## Function
The ERH (Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog) protein is a highly conserved transcriptional coregulator involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, ERH plays a significant role in mRNA splicing and cell cycle regulation. It is essential for the proper splicing of mRNA for the mitotic motor protein CENP-E, which is crucial for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Depletion of ERH leads to defects in chromosome alignment and G2/M arrest, highlighting its importance in cell cycle progression (Weng2013The).

ERH is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues and is particularly active in rapidly dividing cells, such as those found in cancerous tissues. It localizes primarily in the nucleus, where it forms homodimers, suggesting a role in nuclear functions related to RNA processing and transcriptional regulation (Weng2013The; Wan2005Structure). The protein interacts with the Sm complex, necessary for spliceosomal assembly, indicating its involvement in RNA splicing (Weng2013The).

ERH also interacts with transcription elongation factors, such as RNA Pol II C-terminal domain phosphatase FCP1 and transcription factor SPT5, suggesting a role in transcriptional elongation (Wan2005Structure). These interactions underline its function in maintaining cell cycle fidelity and normal cellular function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ERH gene have been implicated in various human diseases, particularly cancers. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), ERH expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression correlates with poor prognosis, higher pathological grades, and lymph node metastasis. Knockdown of ERH in ovarian cancer cell lines reduces cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer cell growth and survival (Zhang2020Knockdown).

In colorectal and lung cancers with KRAS mutations, high ERH expression is associated with shorter survival, indicating that ERH may contribute to the malignancy of these tumors. ERH is considered a candidate KRAS synthetic lethal gene, as its depletion reduces the viability of KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines more than KRAS wild-type ones (Weng2013The).

ERH is also overexpressed in bladder cancer, where it promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. It regulates pathways such as TNF and NF-κB, which are involved in tumorigenesis (Pang2020Comprehensive). In gastric cancer, ERH interacts with proteins like Pontin and STAT3, enhancing transcriptional activation of target genes (Pang2022ERHa). These findings suggest that ERH could be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
The ERH protein, also known as Enhancer of Rudimentary Homolog, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. ERH is known to interact with several components of the RNA processing machinery, including the spliceosome subunit SNRPD3, which is essential for mRNA splicing (Kavanaugh2015Enhancer). It also forms part of the EMC complex in fission yeast, interacting with the RNA-binding protein Mmi1, which is crucial for gene silencing and heterochromatin assembly (Xie2019A).

In human cells, ERH interacts with Ciz1, a DNA replication factor, potentially influencing DNA replication and cell cycle regulation by blocking Ciz1's interaction with p21 Cip1/Waf1 (Łukasik2007Ciz1). ERH also associates with proteins involved in transcription regulation, such as the transcriptional co-activator DCoH/PCD, the RNA Pol II C-terminal domain phosphatase FCP1, and the transcription factor SPT5, suggesting a role in transcriptional elongation (Weng2013The).

In cancer cells, ERH interacts with EIF2a, a key component of the ribonucleoprotein complex, indicating its involvement in mRNA processing and translation regulation (Pang2022ERH). These interactions highlight ERH's multifaceted role in RNA processing, transcription, and cell cycle regulation.
