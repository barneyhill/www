# RNASET2

## Overview
RNASET2 is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease T2 protein, a member of the T2 ribonuclease family, which is characterized by its ability to cleave RNA molecules. This enzyme is categorized as an acidic ribonuclease and is primarily active in the lysosome, where it plays a crucial role in RNA processing and degradation. The ribonuclease T2 protein is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of apoptosis, immune response modulation, and oxidative stress management. It also acts as a chemokine, influencing macrophage polarization and contributing to immune system coordination (Acquati2019Innate; Caputa2015RNASET2). Mutations in the RNASET2 gene are associated with RNASET2-deficient leukoencephalopathy, a rare neurogenetic disorder, highlighting its clinical significance (Kameli2019RNASET2deficient).

## Structure
RNASET2 is a member of the T2 ribonuclease family, characterized by its ability to cleave RNA. The primary structure of RNASET2 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of RNASET2 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is often stabilized by disulfide bonds, crucial for maintaining its functional conformation.

RNASET2 contains specific domains, such as the ribonuclease T2 domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is responsible for the catalytic function of the protein, allowing it to cleave RNA molecules effectively. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur in RNASET2, potentially influencing its stability, activity, or localization within the cell.

Splice variant isoforms of RNASET2 may exist, which can alter the protein's function or localization. These isoforms result from alternative splicing events, leading to variations in the amino acid sequence and potentially affecting the protein's interaction with other cellular components. The presence of these isoforms highlights the complexity and versatility of RNASET2 in cellular processes.

## Function
RNASET2 is a member of the T2 ribonuclease family, which is evolutionarily conserved and involved in various physiological functions, including RNA processing and degradation. This enzyme is characterized by its acidic pH preference and is active in the lysosome, where it contributes to the breakdown and recycling of RNA molecules (Acquati2019Innate; Caputa2015RNASET2). In healthy human cells, RNASET2 is expressed at low levels, except in immune-related tissues such as the spleen and lymph nodes, suggesting a role in immune function and stress response (Acquati2019Innate).

RNASET2 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis by mediating the degradation of XIAP mRNA, a master inhibitor of apoptosis, particularly during oxidative stress. This process may sensitize cells to stress and increase their apoptotic potential (Caputa2015RNASET2). The enzyme's role in oxidative stress is further highlighted by its involvement in the propagation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the regulation of antioxidant capacity in cells (Caputa2015RNASET2).

RNASET2 also acts as a chemokine for monocyte/macrophage lineage cells, influencing macrophage polarization and promoting a shift from the antitumor M1 to the pro-tumor M2 state (Acquati2019Innate). This function underscores its role in coordinating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNASET2 gene are linked to RNASET2-deficient leukoencephalopathy, a rare autosomal recessive neurogenetic disorder. This condition is characterized by psychomotor delay, neurological regression, seizures, and microcephaly. Brain imaging typically reveals white matter involvement, calcification, and anterior temporal cysts. The clinical presentation of RNASET2-deficient leukoencephalopathy can mimic congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), both of which also present with neurological symptoms and specific brain imaging findings (Kameli2019RNASET2deficient; Weber2020Zebrafish).

RNASET2 deficiency is also associated with immune-mediated diseases, as the gene plays a role in the immune system. A zebrafish model of RNASET2 deficiency shows similar brain lesions and lysosomal storage issues, suggesting that RNASET2 deficiency is a lysosomal storage disorder (Weber2020Zebrafish). In mouse models, RNASET2 deficiency leads to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairments, with significant changes in microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. This is linked to an upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, indicating a type I interferon-driven neuroinflammatory phenotype (Kettwig2021Interferon-driven).

## Interactions
RNASET2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in different biological processes. In human spermatozoa, RNASET2 interacts with actin and A-kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4). This interaction is crucial for regulating sperm motility, as RNASET2's binding to AKAP4 affects the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and calcium signaling pathways, leading to reduced sperm motility (Xu2018RNASET2). The co-localization of RNASET2 and AKAP4 in the sperm tail has been confirmed through immunofluorescence staining, indicating a direct interaction that modulates these signaling pathways (Xu2018RNASET2).

In the context of ovarian cancer, RNASET2 is targeted by the F-box protein FBXO6, which acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. FBXO6 mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of RNASET2, a process that is significant for the progression of ovarian cancer. This interaction involves the FBA domain of FBXO6, which recognizes glycosylated proteins, leading to K48-linked polyubiquitin modification of RNASET2 (Ji2021FBXO6mediated). The degradation of RNASET2 by FBXO6 is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting the importance of this interaction in tumorigenesis (Ji2021FBXO6mediated).
