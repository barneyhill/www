# SMPX

## Overview
The SMPX gene encodes the small muscle protein X-linked, a proline-rich protein that plays a crucial role in muscle function and inner ear development. This protein is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and mechanotransduction, acting as a mechanosensor to influence muscle fiber size and type (Ferrán2016The; Eftestøl2014Overexpression). In the inner ear, SMPX is essential for protecting cochlear cells from mechanical stress, thereby contributing to normal hearing function (Deng2018A). The protein interacts with various partners, including integrins and Rac1, which are vital for maintaining cellular structures under mechanical stress (Johari2021Missense; Arifuzzaman2018In). Mutations in the SMPX gene are linked to X-linked non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss and muscle-related conditions, highlighting its clinical significance (Deng2018A; Johari2021Missense).

## Structure
The SMPX gene encodes a small protein consisting of 88 amino acids, which is conserved across mammalian species (Tu2021SMPX; Arifuzzaman2019In). The primary structure of SMPX is characterized by its proline-rich composition, which is significant for its function in muscle and hearing processes (Johari2021Missense). Although specific secondary structures such as alpha helices or beta sheets are not detailed in the context, the protein's tertiary structure has been modeled using tools like I-TASSER, with validation indicating good quality models (Arifuzzaman2019In). 

SMPX lacks known functional domains but interacts with various proteins, including insulin-like growth factor 1, integrins, and Rac1, which are crucial for its role in inner ear development and muscle function (Arifuzzaman2019In; Niu2017A). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and glycosylation have been predicted to occur, potentially affecting the protein's stability and function (Arifuzzaman2019In). The protein's quaternary structure or specific splice variant isoforms are not detailed in the provided context. Overall, SMPX plays a critical role in maintaining cellular structures under mechanical stress, particularly in the inner ear and muscle tissues (Tu2021SMPX).

## Function
The SMPX gene encodes a small muscle protein that plays a significant role in muscle function and development. In healthy human cells, SMPX is primarily expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, where it is involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and mechanotransduction, the process by which cells convert mechanical stimuli into chemical activity (Ferrán2016The; Eftestøl2014Overexpression). SMPX is localized at costameres, which are crucial for lateral force transmission during muscle contraction, and is thought to function as a mechanosensor, potentially influencing muscle fiber size and type (Eftestøl2014Overexpression).

SMPX interacts with various proteins, including integrins and Rac1, suggesting its involvement in maintaining the cytoskeleton and protecting cells from mechanical stress (Johari2021Missense; Arifuzzaman2018In). It is also associated with the regulation of muscle cell differentiation, potentially through the activation of transcription factors such as MEF2 and NFAT, although its exact role in this process remains unclear (Ferrán2016The; Eftestøl2014Overexpression).

In the inner ear, SMPX is expressed in several cell types and is believed to protect cochlear cells from mechanical stress, which is crucial for normal hearing function (Deng2018A; Arifuzzaman2019In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMPX gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting hearing and muscle function. SMPX mutations are a known cause of X-linked non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss, specifically DFNX4. This condition is characterized by progressive hearing loss, often with a post-lingual onset. In males, hearing loss typically begins in childhood and progresses to affect all frequencies, while female carriers may experience hearing loss later in life (Deng2018A; Tu2021SMPX). Specific mutations, such as donor splice-site variants, can lead to frameshift mutations and premature termination codons, resulting in mRNA degradation and reduced protein function (Lv2019Whole‐exome).

SMPX is also implicated in muscle-related conditions. Missense mutations in the SMPX gene have been linked to distal myopathy with protein inclusions, a condition characterized by adult-onset distal limb muscle weakness and specific histopathological features, including sarcoplasmic inclusions (Johari2021Missense). These mutations can increase the aggregation propensity of the SMPX protein, affecting muscle function and structure (Johari2021Missense). The role of SMPX in muscle development and maintenance suggests that alterations in its expression or interactions may contribute to these muscular disorders (Ghilardi2021Inner).

## Interactions
The SMPX protein is involved in various interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in muscle and inner ear function. It interacts with proteins such as TRAPPC2, TRAPPC2P1, LDB3, MYOZ2, CMYA5, ACTN2, MYOM2, ITGB1BP2, and CEACAM16, which are important for processes like collagen biosynthesis, ear development, and hearing mechanisms (Arifuzzaman2019In). These interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the SMPX protein, and mutations can disrupt these interactions, leading to conditions such as hearing loss (Arifuzzaman2019In).

SMPX is also localized in the actin-rich cuticular plate of hair cells, suggesting its role in cytoskeleton dynamics and mechanotransduction, which is the process by which hair cells convert mechanical stimuli into neural signals (Ghilardi2021Inner). In muscles, SMPX localizes at focal adhesions and interacts with proteins like vinculin, which are involved in mechanosensing (Ghilardi2021Inner). These interactions highlight SMPX's involvement in cytoskeleton dynamics through pathways such as Rac1/p38 and its role in enhancing transcription factor activity via IGF-1 signaling (Ghilardi2021Inner).
