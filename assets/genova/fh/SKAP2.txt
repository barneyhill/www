# SKAP2

## Overview
SKAP2, or Src kinase associated phosphoprotein 2, is a gene that encodes an intracellular adaptor protein involved in various signaling pathways critical for immune cell function and integrin signaling. The SKAP2 protein is characterized by its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions through its distinct domains, including a dimerization domain, a Pleckstrin homology domain, and a Src homology 3 domain. These structural features enable SKAP2 to participate in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly actin polymerization, which is essential for cell migration and immune responses. SKAP2 is predominantly expressed in immune cells, where it influences processes such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and cellular adhesion. Its interactions with integrins and other signaling molecules underscore its importance in cellular communication and response to the extracellular environment (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A; Bouti2024SKAP2).

## Structure
SKAP2, or Src kinase associated phosphoprotein 2, is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in intracellular signaling. The protein contains an N-terminal dimerization (DIM) domain, a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A; Levillayer2024Role). The DIM domain forms a four-helix bundle structure through hydrophobic interactions, which is crucial for dimerization and subsequent protein-protein interactions (Levillayer2024Role). The PH domain is involved in membrane localization and protein-lipid interactions, specifically binding to phosphoinositides like phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A). This domain's interaction with PIP3 is essential for SKAP2's relocation to the plasma membrane and its role in actin polymerization (Alenghat2012Macrophages).

The SH3 domain facilitates interactions with proline-rich motifs in other proteins, such as FYB and PTK2B (Bureau2018The). SKAP2 is subject to post-translational modifications, including tyrosine phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions with SRC kinases (Ghelman2021SKAP2). These structural features enable SKAP2 to play a significant role in integrin signaling and immune cell migration (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A).

## Function
SKAP2 (Src kinase associated phosphoprotein 2) is an intracellular adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in integrin signaling and immune cell function. It is predominantly expressed in immune cells, where it facilitates the assembly of signaling complexes by interacting with multiple proteins, thereby regulating cellular functions such as motility, migration, and morphology (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A). SKAP2 is involved in the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, essential for cell migration and immune cell function, by influencing actin polymerization and cell migration through interactions with integrins and the WAVE complex (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A).

In neutrophils, SKAP2 regulates CD11b/CD18-mediated functions such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Bouti2024SKAP2). It acts downstream of the CD11b/CD18 integrin complex, facilitating CD18 clustering necessary for cell avidity and effector functions (Bouti2024SKAP2). SKAP2 also plays a role in macrophage function, mediating phagocytosis and influencing macrophage differentiation, particularly in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton necessary for these processes (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A).

SKAP2's interaction with Src family kinases and other proteins like Talin-1 and Kindlin is crucial for immune cell activation and cell adhesion dynamics, highlighting its importance in cellular communication and response to the extracellular matrix (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SKAP2 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly those involving immune system dysfunction and inflammatory processes. SKAP2 is associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), where the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7804356 is linked to poorer glycemic control and increased β-cell apoptosis in newly diagnosed patients. This SNP affects SKAP2 expression in immune cells and is associated with higher HbA1c levels, indicating its role in the pathophysiology of T1D (Fløyel2020SKAP2).

SKAP2 is also implicated in chronic venous disease (CVD) through the SNP rs2030136, which is associated with increased expression of SKAP2 and linked to leukocyte adhesion processes (Ellinghaus2017Genomewide). In cancer, SKAP2 is highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages and is involved in podosome formation, facilitating macrophage infiltration and metastatic progression. SKAP2-null mice show reduced lung metastases, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Tanaka2016SKAP2).

Additionally, SKAP2 is involved in integrin signaling and immune cell migration, with mutations affecting these processes linked to autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A).

## Interactions
SKAP2 (Src kinase associated phosphoprotein 2) is an intracellular adaptor protein that participates in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its role in signaling pathways. It interacts with integrins, which are transmembrane proteins involved in cell adhesion and signaling, facilitating both inside-out and outside-in signaling processes. Upon integrin activation, SKAP2 is involved in the recruitment and activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src-kinases, which are essential for downstream signaling (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A).

SKAP2 interacts with the WAVE complex, a component of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family, which is involved in actin polymerization and cell movement. This interaction is crucial for modulating actin filament dynamics (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A). SKAP2 also binds to Talin-1, a protein that connects integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, promoting integrin clustering and activation at the cell membrane (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A).

In neutrophils, SKAP2 is part of the CD18 complex and interacts with proteins such as ADAP and RIAM. It plays a role in regulating CD11b/CD18 adhesion and clustering, which are necessary for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and phagocytosis (Bouti2024SKAP2). SKAP2 also interacts with the inhibitory receptor SIRPα, enhancing its interaction with SHP1 and SHP2, which modulate downstream signaling pathways (Wilmink2023SKAP2—A).
