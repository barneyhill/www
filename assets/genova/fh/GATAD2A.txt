# GATAD2A

## Overview
GATAD2A is a gene that encodes the GATA zinc finger domain containing 2A protein, which is a critical component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex. This protein plays a significant role in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation, influencing processes such as DNA repair, replication, and cell cycle progression. GATAD2A is particularly important in the silencing of fetal hemoglobin during adult erythropoiesis, where it interacts with other components of the NuRD complex, such as MBD2 and CHD4, to form subcomplexes essential for gene regulation (Liang2021GATA; Sharifi2021Unique). The protein's interactions are facilitated by its coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for recruiting CHD4 to the complex (Liang2021GATA). Additionally, GATAD2A has been implicated in various diseases, including certain cancers, where its expression influences tumor progression and metastasis (Zhang2022lncKRT16P6; Yao2019Hsacirc0058124).

## Structure


## Function
The GATAD2A gene encodes a protein that is a key component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD) complex, which plays a crucial role in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. In healthy human cells, GATAD2A is involved in the silencing of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) during adult erythropoiesis. It contains a coiled-coil domain essential for recruiting chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) to the MBD2-NuRD complex, which is necessary for the repression of the c-globin genes, part of the fetal hemoglobin gene cluster (Liang2021GATA).

GATAD2A also plays a role in the regulation of gene expression by modulating chromatin structure, influencing processes such as DNA repair, replication, and cell cycle progression. It is active in the nucleus, contributing to cellular differentiation and development (Sharifi2021Unique). The protein is involved in the interaction with other components of the NuRD complex, such as MBD2 and CHD4, forming mutually exclusive subcomplexes that are crucial for its function in gene regulation (Sher2019Rational). GATAD2A's proper functioning ensures the silencing of HbF, allowing for the normal expression of adult hemoglobin (Liang2021GATA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GATAD2A gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. A novel nonsense mutation in GATAD2A (c.19 C>T, p. Arg7Ter) has been identified in a patient with Hb E/β0 thalassemia, leading to increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels and reduced transfusion dependency. This mutation is associated with a milder clinical presentation of β-thalassemia, suggesting that GATAD2A haploinsufficiency may ameliorate disease severity by reactivating HbF expression (Liang2021GATA).

In cancer, GATAD2A is involved in the progression of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). In TSCC, the long noncoding RNA lncKRT16P6 promotes tumor progression by sponging miR-3180, which leads to the upregulation of GATAD2A expression. This interaction is associated with increased tumorigenesis and metastasis (Zhang2022lncKRT16P6). In PTC, the circular RNA hsa_circ_0058124 enhances tumorigenesis and invasiveness through the NOTCH3/GATAD2A axis, indicating that GATAD2A plays a role in cancer cell proliferation and survival (Yao2019Hsacirc0058124). These findings highlight the potential of targeting GATAD2A in therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

## Interactions
GATAD2A is a key component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, where it plays a crucial role in mediating interactions between various subunits. It is part of the asymmetric MBD-GATAD2-CHD module, interfacing with the MTA-HDAC-RBBP module, and is essential for recruiting CHD proteins, which confer DNA translocase activity to the complex (Low2020The). GATAD2A interacts directly with MBD3, a methyl-DNA binding domain, which is critical for its recruitment to the NuRD complex (Low2020The).

The protein contains two conserved regions: CR1 and CR2. CR1 mediates associations with MBD, MTA, RBBP, and HDAC proteins, while CR2 is required for interactions with CHD proteins and CDK2AP1 (Spruijt2020Cross‐linking). GATAD2A's interaction with CHD4 is particularly significant, as it is involved in the repression of c-globin genes, impacting fetal hemoglobin expression (Liang2021GATA).

GATAD2A also influences the architecture of the NuRD complex by preventing the binding of a second MBD subunit, thus maintaining the complex's asymmetry (Low2020The). The protein's interactions are facilitated by its coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for recruiting CHD4 to the complex (Liang2021GATA).
