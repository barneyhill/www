# ZNF490

## Overview
ZNF490 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 490, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for its role as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its ability to bind specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. Zinc finger protein 490 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis, by modulating the transcription of target genes. It predominantly functions within the nucleus, contributing to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the proper functioning of biological systems. The activity of ZNF490 is essential for the orderly progression of cellular events, supporting the overall health and development of the organism (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF490, a member of the zinc finger protein family, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, influencing various cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. By modulating the transcription of target genes, ZNF490 contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and the proper functioning of biological systems. It is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it exerts its effects on the transcriptional landscape of the cell. Through its involvement in these molecular processes, ZNF490 helps ensure the orderly progression of cellular events and supports the overall health and development of the organism.
