# FLII

## Overview
The FLII gene encodes the Flightless I protein, a multifunctional actin-binding protein that plays a critical role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is a member of the gelsolin family and is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and gelsolin-like domains, which facilitate its involvement in actin filament capping and remodeling. FLII is integral to various cellular processes, including cell motility, adhesion, and wound healing, by influencing actin polymerization and the formation of cell extensions. Additionally, FLII functions as a transcriptional coactivator, interacting with nuclear hormone receptors to regulate gene transcription and chromatin remodeling. Its interactions with proteins such as non-muscle myosin IIA and small GTPases underscore its role in cellular dynamics and gene expression. The gene's expression and mutations have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and cardiomyopathy, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue repair (Ruijmbeek2023Biallelic; Strudwick2020Multifunctional; Arora2015Flightless).

## Structure
The FLII protein, encoded by the human FLII gene, is a multifunctional protein involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It is composed of 1,256 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 143,672 Da (Davy2001The). The protein structure includes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain at the N-terminus, consisting of 16 tandem repeats of a 23-amino-acid leucine-rich motif, which facilitates protein-protein interactions (Lee2004Developmentally). This LRR domain is characterized by an amphipathic beta sheet/alpha helix motif (Davy2001The).

C-terminal to the LRR region, the FLII protein contains two large duplicated domains, each with three tandemly repeated sequences of 125 to 150 amino acids, showing homology to the gelsolin family of actin-binding proteins. These domains are involved in actin cytoskeletal rearrangements (Davy2001The). The gelsolin-like domain is responsible for actin binding and is involved in actin filament capping and remodeling (Arora2015Flightless).

FLII is known to interact with various proteins, including Diaphanous-related formins (DRF), enhancing actin assembly, and it plays roles in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and migration (Strudwick2020Multifunctional). The protein's translocation and function are influenced by PI 3-kinase and small GTPases, such as Ras, RhoA, and Cdc42 (Davy2001The).

## Function
The FLII gene encodes the Flightless I protein, which is a member of the gelsolin family of actin-binding proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing various cellular processes such as cell motility, adhesion, and wound healing. In healthy human cells, FLII is involved in the regulation of actin polymerization and the formation of cell extensions, which are essential for collagen remodeling and cell migration (Strudwick2020Multifunctional; Arora2015Flightless). FLII interacts with non-muscle myosin IIA (NMMIIA) to facilitate the formation of actin-enriched cell extensions, which generate contractile forces necessary for collagen fibril compaction (Arora2015Flightless).

FLII also acts as a transcriptional coactivator, interacting with nuclear hormone receptors to regulate gene transcription. It is involved in chromatin remodeling and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoter regions, enhancing transcription of nuclear receptor target genes (Strudwick2020Multifunctional). Additionally, FLII modulates the F-actin/YAP1 axis, influencing myogenic differentiation by regulating actin remodeling and YAP1 activity, which affects cell proliferation and differentiation (Nguyen2023FLII). FLII's multifunctional roles highlight its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FLII gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In cancer, elevated levels of FLII are linked to more aggressive forms of squamous cell carcinomas and poorer prognosis in breast cancer. In breast cancer, FLII interacts with the autophagy receptor p62, and its phosphorylation by Akt at Ser436 impedes autophagic clearance, contributing to cancer development. Conversely, phosphorylation by Ulk1 at Ser64 promotes autophagy and correlates with better prognosis. In lung cancer, reduced FLII expression is linked to increased invasion, while in prostate cancer, high FLII levels are associated with better survival, particularly in patients with high androgen receptor expression (Strudwick2020Multifunctional).

In pediatric cardiomyopathy, specifically early-onset dilated cardiomyopathy, biallelic variants in the FLII gene disrupt cardiomyocyte cell adhesion and myofibril organization. These structural defects lead to compromised cardiac wall morphogenesis and systolic heart failure. The variants affect the Notch and Hippo signaling pathways, which are crucial for cardiac development (Ruijmbeek2023Biallelic).

FLII overexpression is also associated with impaired wound healing, as seen in conditions like venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot wounds, where it leads to delayed wound closure and increased scar formation (Strudwick2020Multifunctional).

## Interactions
FLII, also known as Flightless I, is an actin-binding protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes such as migration, adhesion, and transcription regulation. FLII interacts with R-Ras, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases, facilitating cell extension during migration by recruiting R-Ras to adhesion sites in spreading cells (Strudwick2020Multifunctional). It also binds to active Rac1 and its activator P-Rex1, enhancing myosin light chain phosphorylation and myosin II activation, which are crucial for cell contractility and migration (Strudwick2020Multifunctional; Marei2016Differential).

FLII interacts with non-muscle myosin IIA (NMMIIA) at collagen adhesion sites, promoting cell extension formation and collagen compaction (Arora2015Flightless). It also binds to focal contact proteins such as talin, paxillin, and vinculin, which are essential for linking integrin receptors to the actin cytoskeleton (Strudwick2020Multifunctional).

In the context of transcription regulation, FLII interacts with nuclear hormone receptors, including the androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER), and is involved in chromatin remodeling by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex to promoter regions of target genes (Strudwick2020Multifunctional). These interactions highlight FLII's multifunctional role in cellular dynamics and gene expression.
