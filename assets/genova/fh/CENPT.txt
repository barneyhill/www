# CENPT

## Overview
CENPT, or centromere protein T, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the centromere-kinetochore complex, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein, centromere protein T, is a component of the Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN) and plays a pivotal role in maintaining centromere integrity and kinetochore function. It forms a nucleosome-like complex with other centromere proteins, such as CENP-W, CENP-S, and CENP-X, and acts as a chromatin-based receptor for the Ndc80 complex, a key microtubule-binding component of the kinetochore (Schleiffer2012CENPT; Abendroth2015The). The CENP-T protein is characterized by a conserved C-terminal histone-fold domain, which is crucial for its localization to centromeres and interaction with other kinetochore proteins (Prendergast2016The). Mutations in the CENPT gene have been linked to severe developmental disorders, underscoring its critical role in cell division and organismal development (Hung2017A).

## Structure
CENPT, or centromere protein T, is a crucial component of the centromere-kinetochore complex, playing a significant role in chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein is part of the Constitutive Centromere-Associated Network (CCAN) and forms a complex with CENP-W, CENP-S, and CENP-X, which is thought to resemble a nucleosome-like structure at the centromere (Abendroth2015The). The CENP-T protein contains a conserved CENP-T domain, which is essential for its function as a centromere receptor of the Ndc80 complex (Schleiffer2012CENPT).

The CENP-T/W complex forms a heterodimer through C-terminal histone fold domains, which are crucial for its localization to centromeres (Prendergast2016The). The CENP-T C-terminus is specifically proximal to the H3.1 histone variant, indicating a specific interaction pattern within chromatin (Abendroth2015The). This specificity is attributed to the presence of cysteine at position 96 in H3.1, which is not present in H3.2 or H3.3 (Abendroth2015The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may play a role in guiding the CENP-T complex to centromeres (Prendergast2016The). The protein's interactions and proximities are important for understanding the molecular architecture of the kinetochore complex (Abendroth2015The).

## Function
The CENPT gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the inner kinetochore, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. CENPT is part of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) and plays a vital role in maintaining centromere integrity, particularly during the S-phase of the cell cycle. The protein's C-terminal histone-fold domain (HFD) is highly conserved and necessary for correct kinetochore localization to centromeres (Hung2017A). 

CENPT is involved in the recruitment and stabilization of kinetochore components, ensuring proper chromosome alignment and attachment to spindle microtubules. This function is crucial for the accurate distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Hung2017A). In vitro studies have demonstrated that depletion of CENPT can lead to chromosome missegregation, micronuclei formation, and multipolar mitoses, highlighting its importance in genomic stability (Hung2017A).

The protein is active at the centromere, where it helps assemble the kinetochore, facilitating the pulling forces on the centromere during anaphase to ensure faithful sister chromatid segregation (Hung2017A). Defects in CENPT can lead to severe cellular and developmental abnormalities, underscoring its critical role in cell division and organismal development (Hung2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CENPT gene are associated with a novel syndrome characterized by severe growth failure, microcephaly, and short stature. This condition is linked to a homozygous splice-site mutation in CENPT, which leads to aberrant splicing and affects the transcript level, resulting in cellular phenotypes such as micronuclei formation, chromosome missegregation, and multipolar mitoses. These cellular abnormalities contribute to the observed growth and developmental issues, including primordial dwarfism and microcephaly (Hung2017A).

The study of a consanguineous Turkish family identified a specific homozygous c.1186+1G>A donor splice-site variant in exon 12 of CENPT, which results in severe growth failure and primordial dwarfism. This mutation causes the production of three novel alternatively spliced isoforms, one of which retains the C-terminal histone-fold domain and is expressed at higher levels, suggesting a potential rescue mechanism. Affected individuals exhibit reduced CENPT expression and increased multinucleated cells, indicating defects in kinetochore localization and cell division (Hung2017A).

These findings underscore the essential role of CENPT in development and highlight its clinical significance in growth-related disorders, particularly those involving microcephaly and dwarfism (Hung2017A).

## Interactions
CENPT, a centromere protein, is involved in several critical interactions essential for centromere function and kinetochore assembly. It forms a nucleosome-like complex with CENP-T, CENP-W, CENP-S, and CENP-X, which acts as a chromatin-based receptor for the Ndc80 complex, the principal microtubule-binding protein of the kinetochore (Dornblut2014A). CENP-T is a strong binding partner for CENP-S, as demonstrated by fluorescent two-hybrid analysis and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) (Dornblut2014A).

CENPT also interacts with the Holliday junction recognition protein (HJURP), which is crucial for its centromeric assembly. HJURP binds directly to the C-terminal region of CENP-T, facilitating its recruitment to the centromere. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of CENP-T, as a mutant form of CENP-T that cannot bind HJURP fails to localize to the centromere, leading to chromosome misalignment (Ding2019Holliday).

CENPT's interaction with CENP-A is influenced by posttranslational modifications of CENP-A, such as Gly-1 trimethylation, which regulates the recruitment of CENP-T to the centromere. This modification is crucial for proper chromosome segregation during mitosis (Srivastava2018Posttranslational).
