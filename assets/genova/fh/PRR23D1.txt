# PRR23D1

## Overview
PRR23D1 is a gene that encodes the protein proline rich 23 domain containing 1, which is characterized by its proline-rich domain. This protein is part of a family of proteins that are often involved in various cellular processes, although the specific functions of PRR23D1 remain to be fully elucidated. The gene has garnered attention due to its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), where it has been identified as one of the top mutated genes (He2022Exploration). Despite its association with COS, studies have not found a significant link between PRR23D1 and language or cognitive impairments, suggesting that its role may be more specific to certain neurodevelopmental pathways (BenítezBurraco2020Language). Further research is necessary to fully understand the biological functions and clinical implications of PRR23D1.

## Clinical Significance
The PRR23D1 gene has been implicated in childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. A study identified PRR23D1 as one of the top mutated genes in COS, with a mutation frequency of 95% among the patients analyzed. This suggests a potential role for PRR23D1 mutations in the development of COS, highlighting the importance of exploring somatic mutations to understand schizophrenia's pathogenesis (He2022Exploration).

In contrast, another study involving a proband with speech and language deficits found a microdeletion in the 8p23.1 region, which includes the PRR23D1 gene. However, this microdeletion was reported as benign and not associated with language or cognitive impairments. The study noted that none of the genes in the deleted region, including PRR23D1, have been linked to language deficits, indicating that PRR23D1 may not play a significant role in these conditions (BenítezBurraco2020Language).

Overall, while PRR23D1 mutations are associated with COS, their role in other conditions, such as language impairments, remains unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate the clinical significance of PRR23D1 in various diseases.
