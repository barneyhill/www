# XRN2

## Overview
XRN2 is a gene that encodes the protein 5'-3' exoribonuclease 2, a crucial enzyme involved in RNA processing and degradation. This protein is categorized as an exoribonuclease, which functions primarily in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It plays a significant role in the maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), as well as in the degradation of defective RNA species, thereby maintaining RNA quality and genome stability (Nagarajan2013XRN; Miki2013The). XRN2 is also integral to transcription termination, where it facilitates the release of RNA polymerase II from DNA templates, a process described by the 'torpedo model' (West2004Human). Additionally, XRN2 is involved in telomere maintenance and DNA repair, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis (Patidar2020XRN2; Nagarajan2013XRN). Alterations in the XRN2 gene have been linked to various cancers, underscoring its importance in genomic stability and its potential as a therapeutic target (Morales2016XRN2; Dang2022XRN2).

## Structure
The XRN2 protein, also known as 5'-3' exoribonuclease 2, is characterized by its exonuclease domain, which facilitates RNA degradation in a 5' to 3' direction. Structurally, XRN2 shares similarities with XRN1, particularly around the active site, which is conserved and crucial for its catalytic function (Nagarajan2013XRN). The active site includes residues that interact with the phosphate backbone of RNA, and the presence of divalent cations is necessary for catalysis (Xiang2009Structure). 

XRN2's structure includes conserved domains, with the first containing the active site and the second forming a pocket for bivalent cations like Mg²⁺ or Mn²⁺, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Miki2013The). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by interactions with the XTBD domain of PAXT-1, which forms a unique four-helix bundle that binds to a groove on XRN2, enhancing its stability and function (Richter2016Structural). 

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may influence XRN2's function and interactions, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its cellular roles (Nagarajan2013XRN). The interaction with XTBD domains is conserved across species, indicating a direct and conserved mode of interaction (Richter2016Structural).

## Function
XRN2, a 5'-3' exoribonuclease, plays a critical role in RNA processing and degradation in healthy human cells. It is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it is involved in several key molecular processes. XRN2 is essential for the maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), specifically the 5.8S and 28S rRNAs, by trimming 5' extensions following endonucleolytic cleavage (Miki2013The; Wang20105′end). It also participates in the maturation of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and the degradation of aberrant pre-rRNA and pre-mRNA, ensuring the removal of defective RNA species that could lead to harmful protein production (Miki2013The).

In transcription termination, XRN2 degrades the 3' fragment of pre-mRNA after endonucleolytic cleavage, contributing to the release of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) from the DNA template, a process described by the 'torpedo model' (Nagarajan2013XRN; West2004Human). This function is crucial for efficient transcriptional termination and is specific to certain genes in mammalian cells (Miki2013The). XRN2 also plays a role in telomere maintenance by degrading Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), which inhibits telomerase activity, thereby promoting telomere elongation (Nagarajan2013XRN). These activities highlight XRN2's importance in maintaining RNA quality and genome stability.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the XRN2 gene are associated with various cancers due to its role in maintaining genomic stability. Changes in XRN2, such as mutations, copy number variations, and altered mRNA expression, are frequently observed in cancers, leading to genomic instability and increased replication stress, which contribute to carcinogenesis (Patidar2020XRN2). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain cancer, elevated XRN2 mRNA and protein levels correlate with poor patient survival, suggesting its role in tumor progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Dang2022XRN2).

XRN2 deficiency results in increased R-loop formation and DNA damage, which can lead to genomic instability. This deficiency also causes hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents and delays in DNA double-strand break repair, indicating its critical role in the DNA damage response (Morales2016XRN2). The synthetic lethal relationship between XRN2 and PARP1 suggests that XRN2-deficient cancer cells are more sensitive to PARP inhibitors, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting cancers with XRN2 functional loss (Patidar2020XRN2; Viera2024Molecular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of XRN2 in cancer treatment and its potential as a biomarker for disease progression.

## Interactions
XRN2, a 5'-3' exoribonuclease, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in RNA processing and DNA repair. XRN2 interacts with the Collaborator of Alternative Reading Frame Protein (CARF), which retains XRN2 in the nucleoplasm, affecting pre-rRNA processing and potentially leading to cell cycle arrest through p53 activation (Sato2015Collaborator). This interaction is independent of RNA, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments that showed CARF and XRN2 binding persists even after RNase treatment (Sato2015Collaborator).

XRN2 also forms complexes with the NF-κB repressing factor (NKRF) and the RNA helicase DHX15, suggesting a role in ribosome biogenesis (Memet2017The). The interaction with NKRF enhances the binding between DHX15 and XRN2, indicating NKRF's role in stabilizing this complex.

In the context of DNA repair, XRN2 associates with proteins such as PARP1, CDK1, and PRP19, implicating it in DNA replication and repair processes. XRN2's interaction with CDK1 suggests a regulatory role in RNA metabolism and DNA repair (Patidar2020XRN2). Additionally, XRN2 is involved in transcription termination by associating with the multifunctional protein p54nrb/PSF, which recruits XRN2 to facilitate pre-mRNA 3' processing (Kaneko2007The).
