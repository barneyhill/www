# FOSL1

## Overview
FOSL1 is a gene that encodes the protein FOS like 1, a subunit of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex. This protein, also known as Fra-1, is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is crucial for its role in DNA binding and dimerization with JUN family proteins, thereby influencing gene regulation (Fleischmann2000Fra1). As a transcription factor, FOSL1 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, and plays a significant role in embryonic development, immune response, and tissue repair (Liu2017A; Sobolev2022Role). The activity of FOSL1 is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which enhances its stability and function (Sobolev2022Role). Clinically, FOSL1 is implicated in several cancers, where it contributes to tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Khedri2024FOSL1’s; Sobolev2022Role).

## Structure
The FOSL1 protein, also known as Fra-1, is a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. It is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which is essential for DNA binding and dimerization with JUN family proteins (Fleischmann2000Fra1). The primary structure of FOSL1 includes this bZIP domain, which facilitates its role in gene regulation. The secondary structure of FOSL1 involves alpha helices within the bZIP domain, contributing to its ability to form stable dimers (Fleischmann2000Fra1).

In terms of tertiary structure, the folding of these alpha helices allows FOSL1 to effectively dimerize with JUN proteins, forming the quaternary structure of the AP-1 complex (Fleischmann2000Fra1). This dimerization is crucial for the transcriptional activity of the complex, as it binds to specific DNA sequences such as TPA-responsive elements (TRE) and cyclic AMP response elements (CRE) (Sobolev2022Role).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating FOSL1's activity. Phosphorylation of specific serine and threonine residues stabilizes the protein and enhances its biological function (Sobolev2022Role). These modifications are critical for FOSL1's involvement in various cellular processes, including tumorigenesis and cell differentiation.

## Function
FOSL1, also known as Fra-1, is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily located in the nucleus, where it forms part of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) complex, a group of transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to various stimuli (Liu2017A; Sobolev2022Role). FOSL1 is involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival, contributing to processes such as embryonic development, immune response, and tissue repair (Liu2017A; Sobolev2022Role).

In the nucleus, FOSL1 influences transcriptional activity by binding to gene promoters, either inducing or repressing gene expression depending on its binding partners and the transcriptional microenvironment (Sobolev2022Role). It is involved in the regulation of genes such as IL6 and MMP2, interacting with other transcription factors like CREB, C/EBP, and NFκB (Sobolev2022Role). FOSL1 is also crucial for the biosynthesis of phospholipids, essential for membrane biogenesis in migrating cells (Sobolev2022Role).

FOSL1's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which stabilizes the protein and enhances its biological activity, preventing degradation and increasing its function (Sobolev2022Role). This regulation is vital for its role in cellular responses to stress and growth factors, such as FGF2, VEGF, and insulin (Sobolev2022Role).

## Clinical Significance
FOSL1 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in tumor progression and metastasis. In lung cancer, particularly those with KRAS mutations, FOSL1 regulates cell survival and proliferation, making it a potential therapeutic target (Khedri2024FOSL1’s). In colorectal cancer, FOSL1 expression correlates with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis, and it is more intense in mesenchymal cells, indicating a poorer survival rate (Khedri2024FOSL1’s; Sobolev2022Role). In breast cancer, FOSL1 is a prognostic indicator, especially in ER-negative cases, and its high expression is linked to tumor grade and metastasis (Khedri2024FOSL1’s; Sobolev2022Role). 

FOSL1 also plays a role in glioblastoma, where it maintains stem cell properties and contributes to therapy resistance (Khedri2024FOSL1’s). In gastric cancer, FOSL1 overexpression is associated with lymphatic invasion and advanced TNM stage, serving as an independent prognostic risk factor (Zhu2019Expression). Additionally, FOSL1 is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer cell migration, and resistance to therapies, making it a significant target for cancer treatment (Khedri2024FOSL1’s; Sobolev2022Role).

## Interactions
FOSL1, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in gene expression regulation. It forms heterodimers primarily with JUN proteins, as FOS proteins cannot homodimerize, and recognizes specific DNA sequences such as TPA responsive elements (TRE) and cyclic AMP response elements (CRE) (Sobolev2022Role). FOSL1 also interacts with other transcription factors, including members of the bZIP family, forming hybrid heterodimers that may be transcriptionally inactive (Sobolev2022Role).

In human Th17 cells, FOSL1 has been shown to interact with 163 binding partners, including XRN1, AP2A1, PCBP1, ILF3, TRIM21, HNRNPH1, and HDAC2. These interactions are enriched for functions such as RNA binding and clathrin binding, indicating a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation (Shetty2021Mapping). FOSL1 also interacts with eukaryotic translational initiation factors like eIF4G1, eIF4E, eIF3I, and eIF2AK2, which are involved in stabilizing ribosomal pre-initiation complexes (Shetty2021Mapping).

In glioma, FOSL1 interacts with the NF-κB signaling pathway, regulating genes involved in glioma proliferation and stemness. It interacts with the NF-κB p65 subunit, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation within the NF-κB pathway (Ramar2024Interaction). FOSL1 also interacts with HDAC2, which can inactivate p53 and interfere with PTEN function, highlighting its involvement in glioma cell signaling (Ramar2024Interaction).
