# L2HGDH

## Overview
L2HGDH is a gene that encodes the enzyme L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which is a mitochondrial FAD-dependent oxidoreductase. This enzyme plays a critical role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of L-2-hydroxyglutarate to α-ketoglutarate, a key intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The proper functioning of L2HGDH is essential for maintaining metabolic balance and preventing the accumulation of L-2-hydroxyglutarate, which can be toxic at elevated levels (Rzem2004A; Muzammal2022In). Mutations in the L2HGDH gene can lead to L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria, a rare neurometabolic disorder characterized by a range of neurological symptoms (Kranendijk2012Progress; Ullah2018Identification). The enzyme is particularly active in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle, and is crucial for normal mitochondrial metabolism and energy production (Brinkley2020Teleological).

## Structure
The L2HGDH gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the metabolism of L-2-hydroxyglutarate, converting it to α2-ketoglutarate. The protein consists of 463 amino acids and includes a mitochondrial targeting sequence within the first 50 amino acids, indicating its localization to the mitochondria (Steenweg2010An; Muzammal2021A). The enzyme is a member of the family of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, suggesting it has a domain that binds flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (Steenweg2010An; Muzammal2021A).

The primary structure of L2HGDH includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the L2HGDH gene, with a known splice variant consisting of 441 amino acids, which shares the first 399 amino acids with the full-length protein but differs in the remaining sequence due to alternative splicing (Steenweg2010An). The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the provided context, but the protein's structure is crucial for its function, as mutations can lead to misfolding and loss of function (Muzammal2021A). The quaternary structure is not described in the context. The protein's structure and function are significantly impacted by mutations, which can lead to disorders such as L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (Muzammal2021A).

## Function
L2HGDH (L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG) to alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG) within the mitochondria. This conversion is essential for maintaining metabolic balance and preventing the accumulation of L-2-HG, a metabolite that can be toxic at elevated levels (Rzem2004A; Muzammal2022In). In healthy human cells, L2HGDH functions as part of a 'metabolic repair' process, ensuring that L-2-HG, which is produced as a byproduct of other enzymatic reactions, does not accumulate to harmful levels (Ye2018Metabolism).

The enzyme is FAD-dependent and is associated with the mitochondrial membrane, where it likely transfers reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain, possibly at the level of ubiquinone (Rzem2004A). L2HGDH is particularly active in tissues with high metabolic demands, such as the kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle, with the kidney showing the highest expression levels (Brinkley2020Teleological). By maintaining low levels of L-2-HG, L2HGDH supports normal mitochondrial metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which is vital for energy production and cellular homeostasis (Brinkley2020Teleological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the L2HGDH gene are associated with L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA), a rare autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in the urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid, leading to a range of neurological symptoms such as developmental delay, epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and intellectual disability (Kranendijk2012Progress; Steenweg2010An; Ullah2018Identification). The disease is slowly progressive and can result in macrocephaly, tremor, dystonia, hypotonia, and spasticity (Kranendijk2012Progress).

L-2-HGA is diagnosed through MRI findings that reveal characteristic abnormalities in the brain's white matter and basal ganglia, alongside biochemical and genetic testing (Steenweg2010An; Muzammal2022In). Numerous mutations in the L2HGDH gene have been identified, with most being missense mutations that impair the enzyme's activity, leading to elevated levels of L-2-hydroxyglutarate (Kranendijk2012Progress; Sass2008L‐2‐Hydroxyglutaric). The condition has also been linked to an increased risk of central nervous system tumors, although the exact relationship between L-2-hydroxyglutarate and tumorigenesis requires further investigation (Kranendijk2012Progress).

## Interactions
L2HGDH, or L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function. The enzyme interacts with its substrate, L-2-hydroxyglutarate, through conventional hydrogen bonding at specific sites within the FAD-dependent enzyme domain. However, a frameshift mutation in the L2HGDH gene can lead to the loss of these interacting sites, resulting in altered interactions at different positions (Muzammal2021A).

Protein-protein docking studies have shown that L2HGDH interacts with other proteins such as D2HGDH, ALDH4A1, and GLS2. These interactions are significantly altered when the L2HGDH protein is mutated, affecting the docking sites and potentially disrupting normal metabolic processes (Muzammal2021A). The structural distortion caused by the frameshift mutation in L2HGDH leads to misfolding, which prevents the 3D structures of the wild-type and mutated proteins from overlapping, further impacting its interaction capabilities (Muzammal2021A).

These interactions highlight the importance of L2HGDH in maintaining proper metabolic function and underscore the potential consequences of genetic mutations on its activity and interactions with other proteins.
