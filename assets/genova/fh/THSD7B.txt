# THSD7B

## Overview
THSD7B is a gene that encodes the protein thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7B, which is a member of the thrombospondin family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of angiogenesis and the maintenance of the extracellular matrix, playing a crucial role in cell-matrix interactions and cellular adhesion. It is secreted by various cell types, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and is implicated in processes essential for tissue growth and repair. The protein's function extends to influencing signaling pathways related to cell death, invasion, metastasis, and immune response, particularly in the context of cancer, where its expression varies across different cancer types and is associated with tumor progression and prognosis (Luo2024Exerciseaugmented; Aissani2015Evaluation). Additionally, THSD7B has been linked to other conditions such as uterine leiomyoma and dental anomalies, indicating its diverse biological and clinical significance (Haga2013A; Aissani2015Evaluation).

## Function
THSD7B encodes a protein that is part of the thrombospondin family, which is known for its role in inhibiting angiogenesis and influencing cell-matrix interactions. This protein is secreted by various cell types, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and is involved in maintaining the extracellular matrix in healthy human cells (Aissani2015Evaluation). THSD7B plays a significant role in regulating angiogenesis, a process crucial for the formation of new blood vessels, which is essential for tissue growth and repair. The protein's involvement in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions suggests it may help maintain cellular structure and communication within tissues (Aissani2015Evaluation).

In the context of cancer, THSD7B has been associated with cell adhesion, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and oncogenic activities. It influences signaling pathways related to cell death, invasion, metastasis, and immune response, potentially impacting cancer prognosis (Luo2024Exerciseaugmented). The gene's expression is variable across different cancer types, with its upregulation linked to reduced tumor size and weight in certain models, indicating a complex role in oncogenesis and potential as a biomarker for cancer progression (Luo2024Exerciseaugmented).

## Clinical Significance
The THSD7B gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In cancer, THSD7B expression varies significantly across different types, with upregulation observed in cancers such as thyroid, stomach, prostate, liver, pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers, while downregulation is noted in others like bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and thyroid cancers (Luo2024Exerciseaugmented). Its expression is associated with both risk and protective factors for overall survival and disease-free intervals in certain cancers, indicating a complex role in cancer progression (Luo2024Exerciseaugmented).

THSD7B has also been linked to uterine leiomyoma, where the intronic variant rs4954368 shows a moderate association with tumor size in African American and European American populations (Aissani2015Evaluation). This association suggests a potential role in influencing tumor growth, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Aissani2015Evaluation).

In dental anomalies, a genome-wide association study identified a strong association between the SNP rs1469622 in the THSD7B gene and third molar agenesis in Japanese and Korean populations, highlighting its potential involvement in tooth development (Haga2013A). These findings underscore the gene's diverse clinical significance across different conditions.
