# OTX1

## Overview
The OTX1 gene encodes the orthodenticle homeobox 1 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its homeobox domain, which is essential for DNA binding and regulation of gene expression. This protein plays a pivotal role in the development of the central nervous system, particularly in the cerebral cortex, by regulating the cell cycle of neural progenitors and influencing neuronal differentiation and proliferation (Huang2018OTX1). OTX1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the modulation of cortical thickness and the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain (Pantò2004Role). Beyond its developmental functions, OTX1 has been implicated in several cancers, where it interacts with signaling pathways such as the ERK/MAPK and Wnt pathways, affecting tumor progression and metastasis (Zhou2022OTX1; Terrinoni2023OTX). The gene's clinical significance is further underscored by its association with genitourinary developmental defects and its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Zhou2022OTX1; Jorgez2014Genitourinary).

## Structure
The OTX1 protein is a transcription factor characterized by a homeobox domain, which is crucial for its DNA-binding function. The primary structure of OTX1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form this homeobox domain, similar to the Drosophila orthodenticle (otd) protein, and is involved in regulating the cell cycle of neural progenitors in the developing cerebral cortex (Huang2018OTX1). The C-terminal region of OTX1 contains a transcriptional activation domain, which is essential for its function in cell cycle regulation. Mutations in this region, such as D318H, Y319C, and K320T, have been identified in astrocytoma samples, indicating its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Huang2018OTX1).

The secondary structure of OTX1 likely includes alpha helices within the homeodomain, which are typical for DNA-binding proteins. The tertiary structure would involve the overall 3D conformation necessary for its interaction with DNA and other proteins. While specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided, OTX1's function as a transcription factor suggests it may interact with other proteins to form functional complexes. The protein also contains a nuclear localization signal in the N-terminus, facilitating its partial localization in the nucleus (Huang2018OTX1).

## Function
The OTX1 gene encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development of the central nervous system, particularly in the cerebral cortex. OTX1 is involved in regulating the cell cycle progression of neural progenitors, which is essential for the proliferation and differentiation of neurons and glial cells during cortical development (Huang2018OTX1). In the developing human brain, OTX1 is expressed in the proliferative zones of the neocortex, where it is critical for the transition of neural progenitors from a self-expanding to a neuron-generating model of cell division (Huang2018OTX1).

OTX1 is initially localized in the cytoplasm of progenitor cells and translocates to the nucleus during the first week of postnatal life, coinciding with axon remodeling by layer 5 neurons. This nuclear import is facilitated by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) within its N-terminal region, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor in cortical neurons (Zhang2002Regulated). The gene's expression is associated with the regulation of cortical thickness and cell population, influencing the development of GABAergic interneurons and maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain (Pantò2004Role).

## Clinical Significance
The OTX1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In genitourinary (GU) development, deletions in the 2p15 region encompassing OTX1 are associated with defects such as cryptorchidism, hypospadias, micropenis, and bladder exstrophy and epispadias complex (BEEC). These findings suggest that OTX1 plays a crucial role in normal GU development, particularly affecting the testes, penis, and scrotum (Jorgez2014Genitourinary).

In cancer, OTX1 is overexpressed in several types, including cervical, gastric, colorectal, hepatocellular, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and breast cancer. In cervical cancer, high OTX1 expression correlates with lower survival probabilities and is linked to the Wnt signaling pathway, promoting tumorigenesis and progression (Zhou2022OTX1). In gastric cancer, OTX1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival times, influencing cell proliferation and metastasis (Qin2018Dowregulation). Similarly, in hepatocellular carcinoma, OTX1 contributes to tumor progression through the ERK/MAPK pathway (Li2016OTX1). In breast cancer, OTX1 expression is regulated by the p53 gene, suggesting a potential role in pathogenesis (Terrinoni2011OTX1).

## Interactions
OTX1 is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function as a transcription factor. In the context of cancer, OTX1 interacts with long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) such as FEZF1-AS1 and HNF1A-AS1 in colorectal cancer, affecting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the ERK/MAPK pathway (Terrinoni2023OTX). In hepatocellular carcinoma, OTX1 is associated with the lncRNA MAFG-AS1, also regulating the ERK/MAPK pathway (Terrinoni2023OTX). In pancreatic cancer, OTX1 is a downstream target of miR-4516 and is involved in the ZEB1/OTX1 pathway, with miR-4269 modulating this axis (Terrinoni2023OTX).

In cervical cancer, OTX1 interacts with the Wnt signaling pathway, specifically with Wnt9b, leading to increased levels of Wnt9b and β-catenin, and decreased levels of APC, GSK-3β, and AXIN2. This interaction promotes cell migration and invasion (Zhou2022OTX1). In breast cancer, OTX1 expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, which physically interacts with the OTX1 promoter, suggesting a direct regulatory mechanism (Terrinoni2011OTX1). These interactions highlight OTX1's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
