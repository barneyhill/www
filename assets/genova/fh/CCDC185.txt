# CCDC185

## Overview
The CCDC185 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 185 protein, which is characterized by its structural motif known as the coiled-coil domain. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The coiled-coil domain is a structural motif that facilitates protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC185 may play a role in cellular signaling or structural organization. Research has indicated that CCDC185 may be involved in metabolic and neurological processes, as well as reproductive functions in certain species (BarajasOlmos2018Altered; Fang2021Comprehensive; Friedman2019Exposing; Shimada2019Epigenomewide). Despite these associations, the full spectrum of CCDC185's functions and its potential implications in human health and disease are still under active investigation.

## Clinical Significance
The CCDC185 gene has been implicated in various conditions through studies examining its altered expression and methylation patterns. In individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes, altered DNA methylation of CCDC185 was observed in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues, suggesting a potential role in metabolic disorders (BarajasOlmos2018Altered). In the context of narcolepsy, the CCDC185 gene was associated with differentially methylated regions in the lateral hypothalamus, although specific diseases or conditions linked to these alterations were not detailed (Shimada2019Epigenomewide). 

Research on immature hippocampal neurons exposed to excitotoxins found that CCDC185 expression was significantly upregulated, indicating a possible involvement in neuronal response to excitotoxic stress (Friedman2019Exposing). In cattle, CCDC185 was identified as a candidate gene for regulating male reproduction, though specific conditions related to its mutations were not specified (Fang2021Comprehensive). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of CCDC185 mutations or alterations remains under investigation, with no well-documented associations with specific diseases. Further research is needed to elucidate its role in disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications.
