# SLCO2B1

## Overview
The SLCO2B1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 2B1 (OATP2B1), which is a member of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) family. OATP2B1 is a transmembrane protein characterized by its 12 transmembrane domains, facilitating the transport of a wide range of substrates, including pharmaceuticals and endogenous compounds, across cellular membranes (Hagenbuch2013The; Hong2014Critical). This protein is expressed in various tissues such as the liver, small intestine, and kidney, where it plays a crucial role in drug absorption and the uptake of precursor molecules for steroid synthesis (Knauer2013Transport). Additionally, OATP2B1 is involved in cellular iron homeostasis by acting as a heme transporter, which is particularly important under iron-limiting conditions (Unlu2022Metabolicscale). Variations in the SLCO2B1 gene have been linked to clinical outcomes in prostate cancer, highlighting its significance in pharmacokinetics and disease progression (Wang2016Association; Yang2011SLCO2B1).

## Structure
The SLCO2B1 gene encodes the OATP2B1 protein, a member of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) family. These proteins are characterized by having 12 transmembrane domains, which are integral to their function as transporters across cellular membranes (Hagenbuch2013The; Hong2014Critical). The transmembrane domains form a channel that facilitates the transport of various substrates, including pharmaceuticals and endogenous compounds, across the cell membrane (Hong2014Critical).

OATP2B1 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the liver, small intestine, and kidney, and is involved in the uptake of endogenous compounds and drugs (Knauer2013Transport). The protein's structure includes conserved cysteine residues, which are important for forming disulfide bonds that ensure proper surface expression (Hagenbuch2013The). Glycosylation sites are also present, which are crucial for protein processing and function (Hong2014Critical).

The SLCO2B1 gene produces different protein isoforms due to transcriptional start site variants, with the full-length variant being 709 amino acids long and a shorter variant lacking 22 N-terminal amino acids (Knauer2013Transport). These isoforms exhibit similar transport activities for substrates like estrone sulfate and rosuvastatin (Knauer2013Transport).

## Function
The SLCO2B1 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1), a membrane transporter involved in the uptake of various endogenous compounds and drugs. OATP2B1 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the liver, small intestine, kidney, and others, where it facilitates the sodium-independent uptake of amphiphilic organic anions (Knauer2013Transport). This transporter plays a significant role in drug absorption, particularly in the intestine, and in the uptake and supply of precursor molecules for steroid synthesis in the placenta and mammary gland (Knauer2013Transport).

SLCO2B1 is also identified as a heme transporter that enhances cellular iron availability, particularly under iron-limiting conditions. It facilitates the import of heme analogs, which provides sufficient iron for cell proliferation through heme oxygenases (Unlu2022Metabolicscale). The expression of SLCO2B1 allows cells to proliferate under conditions of iron restriction by increasing intracellular iron stores and bypassing the traditional transferrin-mediated iron uptake pathway (Unlu2022Metabolicscale). This function is crucial for maintaining iron homeostasis and supporting cell proliferation under iron-restricted conditions (Unlu2022Metabolicscale).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the SLCO2B1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of prostate cancer. The SLCO2B1 gene encodes the OATP2B1 transporter, which is involved in the uptake of androgens and other organic anions. Variants in this gene, such as rs12422149 and rs1077858, have been associated with differences in time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (Wang2016Association). The SLCO2B1-312Arg variant, for example, is linked to higher androgen uptake and increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression, potentially leading to shorter TTP during ADT (Yang2011SLCO2B1).

The interaction between SLCO2B1 and SLCO1B3 polymorphisms can also significantly affect disease progression, with certain genotype combinations resulting in a more than 2-year difference in median TTP for prostate cancer patients (Yang2011SLCO2B1). Additionally, higher SLCO2B1 expression has been observed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tumors compared to localized tumors, suggesting a role in disease progression and resistance to ADT (Wang2016Association). These findings underscore the potential of SLCO2B1 genetic variations as biomarkers for treatment outcomes in prostate cancer.

## Interactions
The SLCO2B1 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1), which is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and localization. One significant interaction is with the scaffold protein PDZK1, which modulates the expression and function of OATP2B1. PDZK1 enhances the transport capacity of OATP2B1 by increasing its presence in the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by increased transport of estrone 3-sulfate (Ferreira2018The). This interaction is facilitated by a PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminus of OATP2B1, and deletion of this motif reduces the impact of PDZK1 on OATP2B1's transport function (Ferreira2018The).

The interaction between PDZK1 and OATP2B1 is tissue-specific, occurring in the liver, intestine, and kidney, and is crucial for drug absorption and elimination (Ferreira2018The). PDZK1 is part of a multi-protein complex known as the 'urate transportosome' in renal tubular cells, suggesting a role in stabilizing and uniting multiple transporters, including OATP2B1, at the luminal site of proximal tubules (Kinzi2021OATP2B1). These interactions highlight the importance of OATP2B1 in pharmacokinetic processes and its modulation by PDZK1.
