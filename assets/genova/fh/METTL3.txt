# METTL3

## Overview
METTL3 is a gene that encodes the protein methyltransferase 3, N6-adenosine-methyltransferase complex catalytic subunit, which is a critical component of the m6A methyltransferase complex. This protein functions as a methyltransferase, catalyzing the addition of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications to RNA, a prevalent and reversible modification in eukaryotic cells. The METTL3 protein, in conjunction with METTL14, forms a heterodimer where METTL3 serves as the catalytic subunit, while METTL14 provides structural support and aids in RNA binding. This complex plays a significant role in various RNA metabolic processes, including mRNA stability, splicing, translation, and degradation. METTL3 is also involved in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Wu2022The; Moroz‐Omori2021METTL3; Han2019METTL3).

## Structure
The METTL3 protein is a key component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, responsible for catalyzing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications on RNA. The primary structure of METTL3 includes 580 amino acids and features a zinc finger domain (ZFD) and a methyltransferase domain (MT-A70), both essential for its enzymatic activity (Zeng2020Roles). The ZFD contains two tandem CCCH-type zinc fingers connected by an anti-parallel β-sheet, crucial for recognizing and binding to single-stranded RNAs with a specific consensus sequence (Zeng2020Roles; Huang2018Solution).

The tertiary structure of METTL3 is characterized by a Rossmann fold within the MT-A70 domain, which includes a central, curved, eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by four α-helices. This domain also features an interface loop for interaction with METTL14 and two gate loops important for adenosine recognition (Zeng2020Roles). The METTL3-METTL14 complex forms a heterodimer, with METTL3 acting as the catalytic subunit and METTL14 providing structural support and aiding in RNA binding (Śledź2016Structural; Zeng2020Roles).

Post-translational modifications of METTL3 include phosphorylation, which may play a role in its function and regulation (Schöller2018Interactions).

## Function
METTL3 is a core component of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase complex, which is responsible for the methylation of adenosine residues in RNA, a prevalent modification in eukaryotic cells. This modification plays a crucial role in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA stability, splicing, translation, and degradation (Wu2022The; Moroz‐Omori2021METTL3). METTL3 forms a stable heterodimer with METTL14, enhancing its methylation activity, with METTL3 serving as the core catalytic enzyme and METTL14 stabilizing the structure and recognizing target RNAs (Wu2022The).

In healthy human cells, METTL3 is essential for the normal and symmetric differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), playing a significant role in normal hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation (Wu2022The). METTL3 is enriched in endothelial cells and hemogenic endothelium, where it regulates Notch1 signaling, crucial for maintaining hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) identity and differentiation (Wu2022The). The m6A modification process facilitated by METTL3 is reversible and dynamic, involving 'writers' like METTL3, 'erasers', and 'readers' that recognize m6A sites to perform various functions (Wu2022The). METTL3's activity is also assisted by a regulatory complex known as MACOM, which includes proteins like WTAP and VIRMA, contributing to its function in the cell nucleus (Wu2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the METTL3 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), METTL3 is overexpressed, promoting the undifferentiated state and growth of leukemia cells. Disruption of METTL3 leads to increased differentiation and apoptosis of AML cells, affecting the translation efficiency of key oncogenes and activating the PI3K/AKT pathway (Wu2022The). In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), METTL3 upregulation contributes to cell proliferation and resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (Wu2022The).

In gastric cancer, METTL3 is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis. Its expression promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis through enhanced glycolysis and angiogenesis (Wang2019METTL3mediated). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, METTL3 upregulation is associated with increased m6A levels, lymph node invasion, and distant metastasis, impacting patient survival rates (Peng2019Upregulated).

In bladder cancer, METTL3 promotes tumor proliferation by accelerating the maturation of pri-miR221/222 in an m6A-dependent manner, with its expression linked to higher histological grades and poorer prognosis (Han2019METTL3). METTL3's role in mRNA translation and oncogenesis is also noted in lung cancer, where its interaction with eIF3h enhances translation and promotes tumor growth (Choe2018mRNA). These findings highlight METTL3 as a potential therapeutic target in various malignancies.

## Interactions
METTL3 is a key component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, interacting primarily with METTL14 to form a stable heterodimer that is crucial for RNA N6-adenosine methylation. This complex is localized in the nucleus, particularly in nuclear speckles, and requires the splicing regulator WTAP for proper localization. METTL3 provides the catalytic activity, while METTL14 stabilizes RNA binding and contributes to the architecture of the catalytic center (Liu2013A; Schöller2018Interactions).

METTL3 also interacts with WTAP, although this interaction is weaker compared to its interaction with METTL14. WTAP is necessary for the localization of the METTL3/14 complex to nuclear speckles (Liu2013A; Schöller2018Interactions). In cancer cells, METTL3 has m6A-independent functions, associating with ribosomes in the cytoplasm to promote translation. It interacts with translation initiation factors such as eIF3h, eIF4E, and PABPC1, facilitating mRNA translation (Mansfield2024RNA).

METTL3 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, a process influenced by its interactions with METTL14 and WTAP. This phase separation is regulated by the SAM-binding pocket and is essential for the dynamic assembly of the mRNA m6A methyltransferase complex (Han2022Dynamic).
