# SLC44A1

## Overview
The SLC44A1 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 44 member 1, also known as choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1), which is a member of the choline transporter-like family. This protein functions as a Na+-independent, high-affinity choline transporter, playing a pivotal role in the transport of choline across cell membranes. CTL1 is integral to the synthesis of phospholipids and acetylcholine, which are essential for maintaining cell membrane integrity and proper neuronal function (Traiffort2013The; Hedtke2019Choline). The protein is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and is expressed in both plasma and mitochondrial membranes, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes, including choline metabolism and mitochondrial function (Traiffort2013The). The SLC44A1 gene's expression and function are crucial for normal cellular operations and have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers (Traiffort2013The; Hedtke2019Choline).

## Structure
The SLC44A1 protein, part of the choline transporter-like family, is characterized by a complex molecular structure. It is a Na+-independent, high-affinity choline carrier system, primarily involved in choline transport for cell membrane phospholipid synthesis (Traiffort2013The). The protein is expressed in both plasma and mitochondrial membranes, indicating its role in choline transport across these membranes (Traiffort2013The).

Hydropathy analysis suggests that SLC44A1 contains 9-12 transmembrane helices, with a consensus of 10, and includes three potential N-linked glycosylation sites and seven consensus PKC phosphorylation sites (Pelis2014SLC22). The protein structure features an intracellular N-terminus and an extracellular C-terminus, with a large extracellular loop between the first two transmembrane domains and a conserved region in the last four domains (Traiffort2013The).

Alternative splicing of the SLC44A1 gene results in different transcripts, which can affect the C-terminal peptides and potentially alter phosphorylation states (Traiffort2013The). These structural features and modifications are crucial for the protein's function in choline metabolism and its involvement in various physiological processes.

## Function
The SLC44A1 gene encodes the choline transporter-like protein 1 (CTL1), which is integral to choline transport across cell membranes, playing a crucial role in phospholipid metabolism and acetylcholine synthesis. CTL1 is involved in the Na+-independent, high-affinity choline carrier system, essential for supplying choline for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, which are vital for maintaining cell membrane integrity (Traiffort2013The; Hedtke2019Choline). 

In the nervous system, CTL1 is primarily expressed in neurons and oligodendrocytes, facilitating the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, which are critical for brain function and cognition (Hedtke2019Choline). The protein is active in both the plasma and mitochondrial membranes, where it also contributes to mitochondrial choline transport, linking it to the oxidation of choline to betaine, a process important for maintaining choline homeostasis (Traiffort2013The; Hedtke2019Choline).

CTL1's expression is regulated by extracellular choline availability and is upregulated following nerve injury, suggesting a role in membrane synthesis during cell repair processes (Traiffort2013The). Its function is crucial for maintaining cellular functions and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases if disrupted (Hedtke2019Choline).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SLC44A1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. Polymorphisms in SLC44A1, such as rs7873937, rs2771040, and rs6479313, are associated with muscle damage in individuals on a low-choline diet, suggesting these genetic variations may affect choline metabolism and muscle function (Costa2014Identification). The SLC44A1 gene is also linked to cancer, with its expression up-regulated in various cancer cell lines, potentially affecting mitochondrial membrane metabolism and apoptotic signaling (Traiffort2013The).

In neurological contexts, the SLC44A1-PRKCA fusion is a significant molecular marker for papillary glioneuronal tumors (PGNTs), aiding in their diagnosis and differentiation from other tumors (Pages2015Papillary). Additionally, the SLC44A1 gene has been associated with Parkinson's disease progression, where the minor allele of rs382940 correlates with more severe motor symptoms (Iwaki2019Genomewide).

Alterations in SLC44A1 expression are also linked to neonatal respiratory distress syndrome due to its role in phosphatidylcholine synthesis, a major component of pulmonary surfactant (Traiffort2013The). These findings underscore the gene's clinical significance in various physiological and pathological conditions.
