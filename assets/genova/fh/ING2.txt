# ING2

## Overview
The ING2 gene encodes the protein inhibitor of growth family member 2, which is a crucial component in the regulation of cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. As a nuclear protein, ING2 is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation, primarily through its interaction with the p53 tumor suppressor protein and the mSin3a-HDAC1 histone deacetylase complex. The protein is characterized by a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger, which facilitates binding to methylated histones and phosphatidylinositol phosphates, thereby influencing nuclear signaling pathways. ING2's role in modulating cellular responses to genotoxic stress and its involvement in tumor suppressor mechanisms underscore its significance in maintaining genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Guérillon2013ING1; Shi2006ING2; Nagashima2001DNA).

## Structure
The ING2 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. It contains a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger at the C-terminus, which is crucial for binding to methylated histones, specifically H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, and plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling (Shi2006ING2; Coles2008The). The PHD domain also has the ability to bind phosphatidylinositol phosphates, which are important for nuclear signaling (Jacquet2021ING).

The protein includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a polybasic region (PBR), which binds phosphoinositide 5 phosphate (PI5P), a secondary messenger involved in p53-induced apoptosis (Ythier2008The). ING2 also features a leucine zipper-like (LZL) motif at the N-terminus, which may facilitate interactions with other proteins containing similar motifs (Guérillon2013ING1).

Post-translational modifications of ING2 include sumoylation on lysine 195, which enhances its interaction with the mSin3a complex, and potential phosphorylation on serine 201, which may regulate its interaction with mSin3a and affect p21 expression (Guérillon2013ING1). ING2 is expressed in two isoforms, ING2a and ING2b, with ING2a being the predominant form detected at the protein level (Guérillon2013ING1).

## Function
The ING2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair in healthy human cells. ING2 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts with the p53 protein to enhance its transcriptional-transactivation activity, particularly through the acetylation of p53 at lysine 382. This modification is essential for p53's DNA-binding and transcriptional-activation functions, which are critical for suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis (Pedeux2005ING2; Nagashima2001DNA).

ING2 is a component of the mSin3a-HDAC1 histone deacetylase complex, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene repression. The PHD domain of ING2 binds specifically to trimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), stabilizing the complex at the promoters of proliferation genes, particularly in response to DNA damage (Shi2006ING2). This interaction is crucial for modulating cellular responses to genotoxic stress and is implicated in tumor suppressor mechanisms.

ING2 also plays a role in the onset of replicative senescence by enhancing p53 acetylation through its interaction with the histone acetyltransferase p300, thereby preventing indefinite cell growth and promoting cellular aging processes (Pedeux2005ING2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ING2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. ING2 expression is often downregulated in several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which is associated with poor prognosis and tumor progression (Guérillon2014The; Archambeau2019FocusING). In melanoma, decreased nuclear expression of ING2 has been observed, correlating with cancer progression (Guérillon2014The). 

Conversely, ING2 is upregulated in colon cancer, where it enhances the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), contributing to increased cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Kumamoto2009ING2). This upregulation is linked to NF-κB activation, which regulates ING2 expression in colon cancer cells (Kumamoto2009ING2).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ING2 expression is decreased, particularly in adenocarcinoma, and is associated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (Blondel2019Exploiting). The loss of ING2 expression in NSCLC is independent of p53 status and may involve chromosomal deletions or degradation mediated by Smurf 1 (Blondel2019Exploiting). These findings suggest that ING2 plays a complex role in cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while promoting tumor progression in others.

## Interactions
ING2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is a part of the mSin3A-HDAC1/2 complex, where it binds to histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) through its plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. This interaction recruits the complex to chromatin, promoting histone deacetylation and gene repression (Guérillon2013ING1; Shi2006ING2). ING2 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, enhancing its acetylation and transcriptional activity, which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Guérillon2013ING1).

ING2's interaction with p300 acetyltransferase stabilizes p53 and p300 on chromatin, facilitating histone acetylation necessary for nucleotide excision repair (NER) (Guérillon2013ING1). ING2 also binds to phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P), which modulates its regulatory functions in response to cellular stress (Ohkouchi2017ING2). Additionally, ING2 interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), regulating its recruitment to chromatin during DNA replication (Guérillon2013ING1). These interactions highlight ING2's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
