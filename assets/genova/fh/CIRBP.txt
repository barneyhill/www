# CIRBP

## Overview
The CIRBP gene encodes the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein, a member of the glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GRP) family. This protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a glycine-rich domain, which facilitate its role in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. CIRBP is primarily involved in the cellular response to stress, such as cold shock and UV radiation, by stabilizing specific mRNAs and enhancing their translation. It plays a crucial role in maintaining circadian rhythms and cellular homeostasis by interacting with the untranslated regions of target mRNAs. Additionally, CIRBP is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases, where it can act as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the context (Roilo2018Coldinducible; Corre2024Regulation; Morf2012ColdInducible).

## Structure
The cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) is a member of the glycine-rich RNA-binding proteins (GRP) family, characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM) in its N-terminal region. This RRM contains two conserved ribonucleoprotein sequences, RNP1 and RNP2, which adopt a classical fold of four antiparallel beta-sheets between two alpha helices, facilitating interaction with specific mRNA targets, particularly in their 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) (Zhu2016Coldinducible; Corre2024Regulation). The C-terminal region of CIRBP features an unstructured arginine-glycine (RG)-rich domain, decorated with RG/RGG motifs, which is involved in mRNA processing and transport and serves as a platform for post-translational modifications (Corre2024Regulation).

CIRBP is known to undergo post-translational modifications such as methylation, which influences its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and accumulation in stress granules under cellular stress conditions (Zhu2016Coldinducible). The protein is expressed in various tissues and encodes several isoforms due to alternative splicing, with at least 17 distinct polypeptides identified in humans (Corre2024Regulation). These isoforms provide a regulatory layer and potential diversification of CIRBP's sequence, structure, and function (Corre2024Regulation). CIRBP can also form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure.

## Function
The cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) plays a significant role in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. CIRBP is involved in modulating circadian rhythms by binding to the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, stabilizing them, and enhancing their translation. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the amplitude and stability of circadian gene expression, particularly influencing the expression of key circadian proteins such as CLOCK (Morf2012ColdInducible).

CIRBP also plays a role in the cellular response to stress, including cold shock, UV radiation, and hypoxia. It assists in stabilizing specific mRNAs and facilitating their translation, thereby helping cells adapt to environmental changes (Liao2017The). CIRBP enhances the translation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27^kip1 by interacting with its untranslated regions, which may influence cell cycle progression and proliferation (Roilo2018Coldinducible).

In terms of cellular localization, CIRBP is primarily active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences gene expression and cellular homeostasis. It is a nuclear protein composed of an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain and a glycine-rich domain, which may regulate its translocation to the cytoplasm (Liao2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CIRBP gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and inflammatory conditions. In cancer, CIRBP acts as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the context. It is overexpressed in several cancers, including bladder cancer, where it promotes cell proliferation and migration by activating the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways and enhancing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Lu2018CIRBP). In breast cancer, CIRBP is associated with increased proliferation and poor prognosis, particularly in luminal subtypes (Indacochea2020Coldinducible). CIRBP also plays a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its disruption reduces inflammatory cytokine production and tumorigenesis (Sakurai2015Cold‐inducible).

In inflammatory diseases, CIRBP is linked to colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and ulcerative colitis, where it correlates with inflammatory markers and promotes tumorigenesis by regulating apoptosis and cytokine production (Sakurai2014Stress). CIRBP's involvement in inflammation extends to its role as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), activating the NF-κB pathway and increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can contribute to conditions like sepsis and neuroinflammation (Lujan2018Cold‐inducible). These findings suggest CIRBP's potential as a therapeutic target in both cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Interactions
CIRBP, or cold-inducible RNA-binding protein, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular stress responses. CIRBP binds to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of target mRNAs, stabilizing them and enhancing their translation, particularly under stress conditions. It interacts with transcripts such as replication protein A (RPA), thioredoxin (TRX), ATR, HIF-1α, and inflammatory cytokines, promoting their stability and translation (Zhu2016Coldinducible; Roilo2018Coldinducible).

CIRBP also interacts with the 5'-UTR of the p27 mRNA, enhancing its translation and leading to increased p27 protein expression, which slows down cell proliferation in hypothermic conditions (Roilo2018Coldinducible). It binds to DYRK1B/MIRK, inhibiting its kinase activity, which affects the phosphorylation of p27 and cyclin D1, thereby influencing cell-cycle progression (Masuda2012Coldinducible).

In the context of DNA damage response, CIRBP accumulates at sites of DNA damage in a PARP-1 and PAR polymer-dependent manner, promoting double-strand break repair by mediating the association of ATM with chromatin (Chen2018PARP-1–dependent). These interactions underscore CIRBP's multifaceted role in regulating gene expression and maintaining genome stability.
