# NOC4L

## Overview
NOC4L, or Nucleolar Complex Associated 4 Homolog, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes, specifically in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit. The protein encoded by NOC4L is primarily localized in the nucleolus, where it plays a crucial role in the early stages of ribosomal RNA processing and assembly. As part of the pre40S-No1 intermediates, the NOC4L protein interacts with other ribosome biogenesis factors, facilitating the formation of the 18S-E pre-rRNA complexes (Nieto2020Identification). Beyond its fundamental role in ribosome assembly, NOC4L has been implicated in immune regulation, particularly in macrophages, where it modulates inflammatory responses by interacting with the TLR4 receptor (Qin2021Macrophage). This dual functionality underscores the gene's significance in both cellular homeostasis and immune signaling pathways.

## Function
NOC4L is a gene involved in the maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit, a critical component of ribosome biogenesis. In healthy human cells, NOC4L is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it participates in the early stages of ribosomal RNA processing and assembly. It is part of the pre40S-No1 intermediates, which include initial complexes formed upon generation of the 18S-E pre-rRNA. These complexes contain other ribosome biogenesis factors such as ENP1, HEATR1, RRP12, and NOP14, but lack cytoplasmic-maturation RBFs, indicating NOC4L's role is confined to early nucleolar stages of ribosome assembly (Nieto2020Identification).

NOC4L's function in ribosome biogenesis is crucial for protein synthesis and cellular growth, as it ensures the proper maturation and stability of pre-40S ribosomal particles. The gene's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and efficient protein production. Despite its primary role in ribosome assembly, NOC4L has also been implicated in regulating inflammatory responses, particularly in macrophages, where it influences immune signaling pathways (Qin2021Macrophage). However, its specific functions in healthy human cells remain primarily associated with ribosome biogenesis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NOC4L gene have been implicated in several diseases. In Hirschsprung's disease, an exome-wide association study identified a significant association with the NOC4L gene, specifically noting a Gly160Ser variant (Tang2016ExomeWide). This suggests a potential role for NOC4L in the pathogenesis of this congenital disorder affecting the colon.

In Alzheimer's disease, NOC4L has been linked to RNA metabolism, particularly ribosome biogenesis. The study found that proteins related to transcription regulation and ribosomal proteins, including NOC4L, were generally down-regulated in Alzheimer's disease neurons. This down-regulation may contribute to the multifactorial nature of the disease, as neurons attempt to compensate for general gene down-regulation by up-regulating ribosomal protein transcription (MartínezBallesteros2017Machine).

NOC4L has also been associated with liver cancer, where it was found to have frameshift insertion mutations in a liver neoplasm sample. This highlights the gene's potential involvement in cancer through genetic diversity and somatic changes (Sultana2019A). Additionally, NOC4L was identified as part of a genomic gain in a case of transposition of the great arteries, although the clinical significance of this finding remains unclear (Costain2016Genomewide).

## Interactions
NOC4L is involved in several protein interactions, particularly in the context of ribosome biogenesis and immune signaling pathways. In the nucleolus, NOC4L interacts with proteins such as NOP14 and UTP4 as part of the small subunit (SSU) processome, which is essential for the assembly and maturation of the 40S ribosomal subunit (Nieto2020Identification; Qin2016Targeted). 

In macrophages, NOC4L interacts with the TLR4 receptor, inhibiting its endocytosis and blocking the TRIF signaling pathway. This interaction reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines, which is significant in the context of insulin resistance and inflammation (Qin2021Macrophage). The interaction between NOC4L and TLR4 has been demonstrated through various experimental methods, including co-immunoprecipitation, GST pulldown assays, and proximity ligation assays, indicating a direct physical interaction (Qin2021Macrophage). 

These interactions highlight NOC4L's dual role in ribosome biogenesis and immune regulation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for conditions like insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (Qin2021Macrophage).
