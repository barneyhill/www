# TMEM200A

## Overview
TMEM200A is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 200A, which is part of the transmembrane protein family. This protein is characterized by its role in cellular processes that involve membrane-spanning domains, which are crucial for various cellular interactions and signaling pathways. The gene has been studied for its involvement in several diseases, including various cancers and neurological disorders, due to its altered expression patterns in these conditions. TMEM200A's expression has been linked to oncogenic pathways and chemoresistance in cancer, as well as potential roles in immune response modulation and neurodegenerative diseases (The; Chan2021Genome-wide; Han2021The; Kamath2021A; p&gt; Khajavi2023The; Zhang2020&lt). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional implications of TMEM200A and its encoded protein in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM200A has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels. In gastric cancer (GC), TMEM200A is significantly upregulated, although no direct correlation with overall survival rates in GC patients has been established. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggests that TMEM200A may influence GC through pathways such as ECM receptor interaction and cell adhesion molecules (Han2021The). In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), TMEM200A is upregulated and negatively associated with overall survival, indicating a potential oncogenic role (The; p&gt; Zhang2020&lt).

In ovarian cancer, particularly the high-grade serous subtype, TMEM200A is among the hypermethylated genes associated with platinum resistance, suggesting a role in chemoresistance mechanisms (Chan2021Genome-wide). In Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, TMEM200A expression is increased in a specific dopaminergic neuron population, indicating its involvement in disease-associated changes (Kamath2021A).

TMEM200A is also noted in the context of narcolepsy type I, where it is upregulated in CD4 T-cell subsets, potentially playing a role in immune synapse inhibition (Khajavi2023The). These findings highlight TMEM200A's potential involvement in various pathological processes, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance.
