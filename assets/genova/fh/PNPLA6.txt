# PNPLA6

## Overview
The PNPLA6 gene encodes the protein known as neuropathy target esterase (NTE), which is a critical enzyme involved in phospholipid metabolism. This protein is categorized as a phospholipase, specifically functioning as a phospholipase B, and is integral to maintaining cellular membrane homeostasis and fluidity. NTE is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is highly expressed in the brain and lymphocytes, with significant roles in lipid metabolism and cellular processes (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE; Lulić2023The). The protein's structure includes a patatin-homology domain essential for its enzymatic activity, and it interacts with various proteins, including Protein Kinase A, to regulate its function (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE; Richardson2020Neuropathy). Mutations in the PNPLA6 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its importance in neural function and development (Kmoch2015Mutations; Synofzik2013PNPLA6).

## Structure
The PNPLA6 protein, also known as neuropathy target esterase (NTE), is a multi-domain enzyme with a complex molecular structure. It consists of 1375 amino acids in its canonical isoform, with several splice variants that may alter its function and localization (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE; Richardson2020Neuropathy). The protein features a patatin-homology domain, which is crucial for its hydrolase activity, spanning residues 981-1147. This domain includes a catalytic dyad composed of Ser1014 and Asp1134, essential for its enzymatic function (Richardson2020Neuropathy; Lulić2023The).

PNPLA6 contains a transmembrane domain at the N-terminus (residues 60-80), anchoring it to the endoplasmic reticulum (Richardson2020Neuropathy). It also has three cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (CNB1, CNB2, CNB3) that may regulate its activity (Richardson2020Neuropathy). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at several serine and threonine residues and N-linked glycosylation at Asn20 (Richardson2020Neuropathy).

The tertiary structure of the patatin domain has been modeled, suggesting a modified α/β hydrolase fold with a central parallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices (Wijeyesakere2007Modeling). The protein's structure and function are influenced by its interaction with cyclic AMP and Protein kinase A (PKA), with a proposed PKA binding domain between the transmembrane and CNB1 domains (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE; Richardson2020Neuropathy).

## Function
The PNPLA6 gene encodes the neuropathy target esterase (NTE), a crucial enzyme involved in phospholipid metabolism. NTE functions as a phospholipase B, catalyzing the hydrolysis of acyl substituents from the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of phospholipids, with a preference for lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine (Lulić2023The). This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining the homeostasis and fluidity of cell membranes, which is vital for normal cellular functions and signaling (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE).

NTE is predominantly active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a significant role in lipid metabolism and cellular processes (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE). It is highly expressed in the brain and lymphocytes, with lower expression levels in the spinal cord, liver, kidneys, placenta, and spleen, indicating its importance in various tissues (Lulić2023The).

The protein is crucial for embryonal development, as demonstrated by studies showing that its absence leads to placental failure and impaired vasculogenesis, resulting in embryonic death (Lulić2023The). In healthy human cells, PNPLA6 is involved in maintaining normal lipid metabolism and cellular functions, contributing to processes like axonal maintenance and repair (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PNPLA6 gene are associated with a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. Boucher-Neuhäuser syndrome (BNS) is characterized by spinocerebellar ataxia, chorioretinal dystrophy, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, resulting from biallelic pathogenic variants in PNPLA6 (He2022Identification; O’Neil2019Detailed). Gordon Holmes syndrome, another condition linked to PNPLA6 mutations, presents with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and ataxia (Synofzik2013PNPLA6). 

Oliver-McFarlane syndrome (OMS) and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) are also associated with PNPLA6 mutations, leading to severe visual impairments, including night blindness and photoreceptor degeneration (Kmoch2015Mutations; Liu2020Identification). Spastic paraplegia type 39 (SPG39) is characterized by spasticity, weakness, and peripheral neuropathy, linked to mutations in the esterase domain of PNPLA6 (Sen2020Biallelic; Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE).

These mutations often affect the esterase/phospholipase domain, disrupting lipid metabolism and leading to the clinical manifestations observed in these disorders (Kmoch2015Mutations; Synofzik2013PNPLA6). The gene's role in maintaining cell membrane stability is crucial, and its disruption can lead to a wide range of symptoms, including ataxia, hypogonadism, and visual impairments (Doğan2021Chorioretinal).

## Interactions
PNPLA6, also known as neuropathy target esterase (NTE), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. It contains a region homologous to the regulatory subunit of Protein Kinase A (PKA), which is essential for binding to the catalytic subunits of PKA. This interaction is mediated by a specific domain known as the PKA-BD, as demonstrated in studies using Drosophila. Mutations in this domain can affect neuronal degeneration and esterase activity, highlighting its functional importance (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE). 

PNPLA6 can also bind to Drosophila PKA-C3, suggesting a conserved function in mammals. Its activity is regulated by cyclic nucleotide binding, with cAMP levels influencing its phospholipase activity and binding to PKA catalytic subunits (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE). The protein is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it may anchor PKA-C3 catalytic subunits to the membrane, a localization crucial for its function (Kretzschmar2022PNPLA6NTE). 

Additionally, PNPLA6 is part of multiprotein complexes and may interact with nucleic acids, potentially influencing gene expression and cellular responses (Lulić2023The). These interactions are significant for its role in lipid metabolism and neural function.
