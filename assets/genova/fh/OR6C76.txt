# OR6C76

## Overview
The OR6C76 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily C member 76, a protein that belongs to the extensive family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which facilitates their role in signal transduction across the cell membrane. OR6C76 is specifically involved in the olfactory system, where it functions as a receptor for odorant molecules, playing a pivotal role in the sense of smell. The protein is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and contributes to the olfactory signal transduction pathway, which is essential for various survival functions, including foraging, predator avoidance, and mate selection (Wang2020Genome-Wide; Michaelovsky2019Risk). While primarily associated with olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR6C76 may also have broader implications in neurodevelopmental and sensory perception pathways (Michaelovsky2019Risk).

## Structure
The OR6C76 gene encodes a protein that is part of the olfactory receptor family, which belongs to the class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs. The primary structure of OR6C76 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs, allowing the receptor to span the cell membrane effectively.

The tertiary structure of OR6C76 involves the folding of these alpha helices into a specific three-dimensional conformation, which is crucial for its interaction with odorant molecules and subsequent signal transduction. As a GPCR, OR6C76 functions as a monomer, and thus, quaternary structure is generally not applicable.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs, including olfactory receptors like OR6C76. These modifications can influence the receptor's stability, localization, and activity. However, specific details about splice variant isoforms or unique domains within OR6C76 are not provided in the available context (Wang2020Genome-Wide; Fan2019Chromosomelevel; Shin2014Deleted).

## Function
The OR6C76 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Wang2020Genome-Wide). The olfactory receptors, including OR6C76, are involved in the olfactory signal transduction pathway, which is essential for various survival functions such as locating food, detecting predators, and selecting mates (Wang2020Genome-Wide). 

In addition to their primary role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR6C76 may also influence other biological processes. For instance, variations in olfactory receptor genes have been associated with neurodevelopmental processes and sensory perception pathways, suggesting a broader role in sensory and neurological functions (Michaelovsky2019Risk). The gene OR6C76 has been identified in studies related to sensory perception and olfactory transduction pathways, indicating its involvement in these critical biological processes (Michaelovsky2019Risk). However, the specific function of OR6C76 in healthy human cells remains less detailed in the available literature (Chen2023Differential).
