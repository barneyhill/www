# LRRC8E

## Overview
The LRRC8E gene encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 8 VRAC subunit E, which is a component of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein and is integral to the function of VRACs, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating ion and osmolyte transport across the cell membrane. The LRRC8E protein forms heteromeric complexes with other LRRC8 subunits, influencing the channel's permeability and substrate selectivity. These channels are involved in critical cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, and migration, and they play a significant role in the cellular response to oxidative stress and immune signaling (Chen2019More; Lahey2020LRRC8A:CE; Ghouli2022Structurefunction).

## Function
The LRRC8E gene encodes a subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), which plays a crucial role in regulating cell volume by facilitating the transport of ions and osmolytes across the cell membrane. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in response to osmotic stress (Chen2019More). LRRC8E forms heteromeric complexes with other LRRC8 subunits, such as LRRC8A and LRRC8C, to modulate the channel's permeability and selectivity for specific substrates, including negatively charged osmolytes like aspartate and glutamate (Chen2019More; Ghouli2022Structurefunction).

LRRC8E-containing VRACs are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration (Pervaiz2019Absolute). These channels are particularly responsive to oxidative stress, with their activity increasing significantly when exposed to oxidative agents, suggesting a role in mediating pathologies induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Ghouli2022Structurefunction). Additionally, LRRC8E is implicated in the transport of signaling molecules like cGAMP, which is crucial for immune responses, highlighting its role in cell-cell communication and immune regulation (Lahey2020LRRC8A:CE).
