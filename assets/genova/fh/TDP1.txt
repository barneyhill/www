# TDP1

## Overview
TDP1, or tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, is a gene that encodes a critical enzyme involved in the DNA repair process. The TDP1 protein is a member of the phospholipase D superfamily and plays a pivotal role in resolving DNA damage by hydrolyzing the phosphodiester bond between a tyrosine residue and DNA. This enzymatic activity is essential for repairing topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, which, if unresolved, can interfere with DNA replication and transcription. TDP1 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is particularly important in maintaining genomic stability in non-dividing cells, such as neurons. Mutations in the TDP1 gene are linked to spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 1 (SCAN1), a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia and cerebellar atrophy (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases; Takashima2002Mutation).

## Structure
The human TDP1 protein is a 68-kDa polypeptide composed of 608 amino acids, structured into two main domains. The N-terminal domain, while not essential for enzymatic activity, contributes to the recruitment and stability of the protein. The C-terminal domain serves as the catalytic domain and is part of the phospholipase D family, featuring two HKN motifs (H263 K265 N283 and H493 K495 N516) that form the catalytic site (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases). TDP1 functions as a monomer, with its active site located within a narrow, positively charged substrate-binding channel that accommodates single-stranded DNA (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases).

The secondary structure of TDP1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, forming a catalytic domain with a conserved HKN motif crucial for its activity (Flett2018Structural). The tertiary structure involves a substrate-binding groove with a positively charged narrow part for DNA binding and a wider part for peptide fragments (Gushchina2017Structure). TDP1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation at serine 81, SUMOylation at lysine 111, and PARylation, which enhance its stability and recruitment to DNA damage sites (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases). There are known splice variant isoforms that may affect its function and localization (Zaksauskaite2021Tdp1).

## Function
Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) is a crucial enzyme in DNA repair processes, primarily involved in resolving DNA damage by hydrolyzing the phosphodiester bond between a tyrosine residue and DNA. This activity is essential for repairing topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, which can interfere with DNA replication and transcription if not resolved (Interthal2005SCAN1; Takashima2002Mutation). TDP1 operates through a two-step SN2 nucleophilic attack mechanism, involving two histidine residues, to process 3' DNA end blocking lesions and prepare them for further repair by other enzymes (Dyrkheeva2020Human).

In healthy human cells, TDP1 is ubiquitously expressed and plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing single-strand breaks associated with topoisomerase I activity and oxidative DNA damage (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases; Takashima2002Mutation). It is active in the nucleus, where it interacts with other DNA repair proteins, such as polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) and DNA ligase, to facilitate the repair of DNA lesions (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases; Takashima2002Mutation). TDP1's function is particularly important in non-dividing cells, such as neurons, where it helps prevent DNA damage that could lead to cell death or neurodegenerative diseases (Pommier2014TyrosylDNAphosphodiesterases; Takashima2002Mutation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TDP1 gene are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy type 1 (SCAN1), a rare neurodegenerative disorder. The condition is caused by a specific mutation, c.1478A > G, which results in the substitution of histidine with arginine at position 493 (p.His493Arg) in the TDP1 protein. This mutation disrupts the enzyme's active site, leading to a significant reduction in its activity and the accumulation of TDP1-DNA complexes. These complexes cause DNA damage, contributing to the neurodegenerative symptoms observed in SCAN1, such as progressive ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, and axonal sensorimotor neuropathy (Interthal2005SCAN1; Scott2019Spinocerebellar; Takashima2002Mutation).

SCAN1 is characterized by hypersensitivity to camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, due to the impaired repair of topoisomerase I-induced DNA damage. This defect is linked to the persistence of covalent TDP1-DNA intermediates, which are particularly harmful in non-dividing neuronal cells, potentially leading to neuronal apoptosis (ElKhamisy2005Defective; Interthal2005SCAN1). The mutation does not predispose individuals to cancer or affect rapidly replicating tissues, but it significantly impacts large, terminally differentiated neurons (Takashima2002Mutation).

## Interactions
Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) is involved in several protein-protein interactions crucial for DNA repair processes. TDP1 interacts directly with the catalytic domain of DNA ligase III (LigIII), a relationship regulated by the phosphorylation of TDP1's flexible N-terminus. The noncatalytic N-terminal region of TDP1 negatively regulates its interaction with LigIIIα, and phosphorylation at Ser81 enhances this interaction (Rashid2021Direct). TDP1 also forms a stable complex with LigIIIα and XRCC1, with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry, indicating that these interactions are not mutually exclusive (Rashid2021Direct).

TDP1 interacts with PARP1, where the N-terminal domain of TDP1 binds to the C-terminal domain of PARP1. This interaction is crucial for stabilizing TDP1 and recruiting it to DNA damage sites, facilitated by PARylation, which does not inhibit TDP1's catalytic activity (Das2014PARP1–TDP1). TDP1 is also involved in interactions with XRCC1, which are enhanced by PARP1-mediated PARylation, promoting TDP1's recruitment to DNA damage sites (Das2014PARP1–TDP1). These interactions highlight TDP1's role in coordinating DNA repair through complex regulatory mechanisms involving multiple protein partners.
