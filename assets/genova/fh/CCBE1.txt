# CCBE1

## Overview
CCBE1 (collagen and calcium binding EGF domains 1) is a gene that encodes a secreted protein crucial for lymphangiogenesis and cardiac development. The protein, characterized by its collagen-like and EGF-like domains, plays a pivotal role in the extracellular matrix by facilitating the proteolytic activation of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), which is essential for the formation of lymphatic vessels. CCBE1 enhances the activity of the protease ADAMTS3, promoting the cleavage of pro-VEGF-C into its active form, thereby influencing the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling pathway critical for lymphatic development (Jha2017Efficient; Bonet2022CCBE1). Additionally, CCBE1 is involved in heart development, particularly in the formation of the coronary vasculature and the epicardium, highlighting its multifaceted role in human physiology (Bonet2022CCBE1; Bonet2022CCBE1a). Mutations in the CCBE1 gene are linked to genetic disorders such as Hennekam syndrome and generalized lymphatic dysplasia, underscoring its clinical significance (Connell2009Linkage; Jackson2015A).

## Structure
The CCBE1 protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, which include collagen-like repeats and EGF-like repeats. The N-terminal domain of CCBE1 contains three calcium-binding EGF-like repeats, which are involved in the colocalization of pro-VEGF-C with its activating protease ADAMTS3 on the lymphatic endothelial cell surface, enhancing VEGFR-3 signaling (Jha2017Efficient). The C-terminal domain comprises two collagen-like repeats, which are crucial for the activation of VEGF-C, as they accelerate the ADAMTS3-mediated activation of VEGF-C (Jha2017Efficient). 

The collagen domains are essential for the structural integrity and function of CCBE1, particularly the second collagen domain, which is vital for enhancing Vegfc signaling and lymphatic development (Roukens2015Functional). Mutations in these domains, such as G327R, can significantly impair CCBE1 function by affecting the secondary structure of the collagen repeat (Roukens2015Functional). 

Post-translational modifications of CCBE1 may include glycosylation, which is common in proteins with EGF-like domains, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. The protein's structure facilitates its role in lymphangiogenesis by promoting the cleavage activity of ADAMTS3 and organizing lymphatic endothelial cells (Jha2017Efficient).

## Function
The CCBE1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in lymphangiogenesis, the process of forming lymphatic vessels, by modulating the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C). CCBE1 is secreted into the extracellular matrix (ECM), where it binds to collagens or vitronectin proteins, facilitating the proteolytic activation of pro-VEGF-C into its mature form, which is essential for lymphatic development (Bonet2022CCBE1). The protein functions in a non-cell-autonomous manner, meaning it acts outside the cell to influence other cells, and is involved in the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling pathway, which is critical for lymphangiogenesis (Bonet2022CCBE1).

In addition to its role in the lymphatic system, CCBE1 is essential for heart development, particularly in the formation of the coronary vasculature and the epicardium. It is expressed in cardiac progenitors and is necessary for the differentiation of early cardiac precursor cell lineages (Bonet2022CCBE1; Bonet2022CCBE1a). The protein's activity in the ECM is crucial for the development of the lymphatic vasculature and the proper formation of coronary vessels, highlighting its importance in both lymphatic and cardiac development (Bonet2022CCBE1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCBE1 gene are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily affecting the lymphatic system. One of the most notable conditions linked to CCBE1 mutations is Hennekam syndrome, characterized by lymphedema, lymphangiectasia, and intellectual disability. This syndrome is genetically heterogeneous, with some patients exhibiting bi-allelic mutations in CCBE1 (Jackson2015A; Frosk2015A). The gene is also implicated in generalized lymphatic dysplasia (GLD), a severe condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. In GLD, mutations in CCBE1 result in extensive generalized lymphedema, distinguishing it from peripheral lymphatic diseases associated with other genes (Connell2009Linkage).

CCBE1 mutations have also been linked to Aagenaes syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by chronic lymphedema and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (Jackson2015A). Additionally, fetal hydrops has been observed in children with siblings affected by Hennekam syndrome or Aagenaes syndrome, suggesting a broader impact of CCBE1 mutations on lymphatic development (Shah2013CCBE1).

The pathogenicity of CCBE1 mutations is supported by their rarity, predicted deleterious nature, and segregation with disease phenotypes in an autosomal recessive inheritance model (Jackson2015A). These mutations often result in loss of function, disrupting normal lymphangiogenesis and leading to the clinical manifestations observed in these syndromes (Brouillard2014Genetics).

## Interactions
CCBE1 (collagen and calcium binding EGF domains 1) is known for its interactions with several proteins, particularly in the context of lymphangiogenesis. A key interaction is with the protease ADAMTS3, which CCBE1 enhances to promote the proteolytic cleavage of pro-VEGF-C into its active form. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling pathway, which is essential for lymphatic development (Jeltsch2014CCBE1; Bonet2022CCBE1a). The collagen domains of CCBE1 are particularly important for this interaction, as they are necessary for the activation of ADAMTS3 and subsequent VEGFC processing (Roukens2015Functional).

CCBE1 also interacts with kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), also known as the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). This interaction enhances KLK3's ability to cleave VEGF-C at a novel site, further contributing to VEGF-C activation (Bonet2022CCBE1a). Although direct physical interactions between CCBE1 and VEGF-C have not been confirmed, CCBE1 facilitates the processing of VEGF-C, likely through its interactions with these proteases (Jeltsch2014CCBE1). These interactions highlight CCBE1's role in regulating VEGF-C activation and its broader impact on lymphangiogenesis.
