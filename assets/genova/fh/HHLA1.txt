# HHLA1

## Overview
HHLA1, or HERV-H LTR-associating 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the B7 family of immune checkpoint molecules. The protein, known as HHLA1 neighbor of OC90, is a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of immune responses. It plays a critical role in modulating T-cell activity through its interactions with receptors such as TMIGD2 and CD28H. These interactions can either stimulate or inhibit T-cell responses, depending on the specific context, thereby influencing immune regulation. The protein's function in immune modulation has significant implications for cancer immunotherapy, as it may enhance or suppress the immune system's ability to target cancer cells. Understanding the mechanisms of HHLA1's interactions and their effects on immune responses is an area of ongoing research, with potential applications in developing new therapeutic strategies targeting immune checkpoints (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure


## Function


## Interactions
HHLA1, a member of the B7 family of immune checkpoint molecules, is known to participate in significant interactions with other proteins that influence immune regulation. It interacts with receptors such as TMIGD2 and CD28H. These interactions are crucial in modulating T-cell activity, which plays a vital role in immune responses. The binding of HHLA1 to these receptors can either activate or inhibit T-cell responses, depending on the context of the interaction. This modulation of T-cell activity has implications for cancer immunotherapy, as it can potentially enhance or suppress the immune system's ability to target cancer cells. The precise mechanisms of these interactions and their effects on immune responses are areas of active research, with the potential to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting immune checkpoints.
