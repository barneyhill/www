# COX15

## Overview
The COX15 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly homolog COX15, a transmembrane protein integral to the mitochondrial inner membrane. This protein plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of heme a, a vital cofactor for cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. COX15 is characterized by its involvement in the conversion of heme o to heme a, a critical step in the assembly and function of COX, which is essential for efficient cellular respiration and ATP production (Herwaldt2018Cox15; Bareth2013The). The protein's structure includes multiple transmembrane domains and heme-binding sites, facilitating its function in heme a synthesis and interaction with other mitochondrial proteins (Glerum1997COX15; Swenson2016Analysis). Mutations in the COX15 gene can lead to severe mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its importance in energy metabolism and cellular function (Galvão2021A).

## Structure
The COX15 protein is an integral membrane protein localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, characterized by its involvement in heme A biosynthesis, a crucial component for cytochrome c oxidase assembly. The protein is predicted to have seven to eight transmembrane domains, which are hydrophobic regions that likely span the phospholipid bilayer, protecting the protein from proteolytic enzymes (Barros2001Involvement; Glerum1997COX15). 

Structurally, COX15 contains two heme-binding four-helical bundles, each with a pair of conserved histidine residues essential for its function. These histidines are positioned to potentially bind heme by serving as axial ligands for the iron ion, with the N-terminal domain containing the His-169/His-245 pair and the C-terminal domain containing the His-368/His-431 pair (Swenson2016Analysis). The protein's structure was modeled using the Phyre2 server, incorporating elements from cytochrome b, nitric oxide reductase, and respiratory nitrate reductase, suggesting a complex tertiary structure (Swenson2016Analysis).

COX15 also forms stable oligomeric complexes, which are crucial for its function and are stabilized by strong hydrophobic interactions (Swenson2016Analysis). The protein's oligomerization is important for its role in heme a biosynthesis and the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (Swenson2016Analysis).

## Function
The COX15 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the synthesis of heme a, a crucial component of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is essential for converting heme o to heme a, a process that involves the oxidation of a methyl group to a formyl group on the pyrrole ring (Herwaldt2018Cox15; Bareth2013The). COX15 is involved in the early stages of cytochrome c oxidase assembly, forming complexes with other proteins such as Shy1 and Cox1, which are necessary for the proper assembly and function of COX (Herwaldt2018Cox15; Bareth2013The).

In healthy human cells, COX15 is primarily expressed in tissues with high energy demands, such as muscle, heart, and brain, reflecting its critical role in cellular respiration and energy production (rumley2011characterization). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function, as it facilitates the incorporation of heme a into the COX enzyme, which is essential for its activity and the generation of ATP (rumley2011characterization). Deficiencies in COX15 can lead to mitochondrial diseases, highlighting its importance in cellular energy metabolism (rumley2011characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COX15 gene are associated with several severe mitochondrial disorders due to its role in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly, a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. These mutations can lead to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, which is a frequent cause of electron transport chain defects in humans. Conditions resulting from COX15 mutations include fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Leigh syndrome, and early onset encephalopathy. These disorders predominantly affect organs and tissues with high energy demands, such as the brain, heart, and retinal tissue (Galvão2021A).

Clinical manifestations of COX15-related disorders often include lactic acidosis, hypotonia, seizures, respiratory distress, psychomotor retardation, vision loss, and central nervous system damage. In particular, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and persistent lactic acidemia are common features (Alfadhel2011Infantile; Galvão2021A). The prognosis for individuals with COX15 deficiency is generally poor, with many patients dying in the neonatal period or early childhood (Alfadhel2011Infantile).

Specific mutations, such as c.452C>G (p.Ser151Ter) and c.232G>A (p.Gly78Arg), have been identified as pathogenic, with the latter being a novel variant associated with fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy (Galvão2021A). These mutations disrupt the normal function of COX15, leading to impaired energy production and the associated clinical symptoms.

## Interactions
COX15, also known as heme a synthase, is involved in the synthesis of heme a, a critical cofactor for cytochrome c oxidase in the electron transport chain. It interacts with various proteins within mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes. COX15 forms homo-oligomeric complexes and associates with the cytochrome bc1 complex and cytochrome c oxidase. Specifically, COX15 interacts with Cor1 from the cytochrome bc1 complex and with Cox5a and Cox13 from cytochrome c oxidase. These interactions are maintained even when supercomplex formation is disrupted, indicating that COX15 can interact with these proteins independently of the supercomplexes (Herwaldt2018Cox15).

COX15's interaction with Cor1 is particularly stable, persisting even when cytochrome bc1 assembly is blocked, suggesting that the interaction does not occur within Cor1 sub-assemblies of the bc1 complex (Herwaldt2018Cox15). COX15 also associates with cytochrome c oxidase assembly intermediates during Cox1 maturation, forming complexes with assembly factors such as Coa3, Cox14, Coa1, and Shy1, as well as structural subunits like Cox1 and Cox5 (Bareth2013The). The presence of Shy1 is not required for COX15 to associate with these complexes, indicating that its association does not depend on heme o (Bareth2013The).
