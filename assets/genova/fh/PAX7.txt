# PAX7

## Overview
PAX7 is a gene that encodes the paired box 7 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the PAX family, which is characterized by a conserved paired domain and a paired-type homeodomain. These domains are crucial for its role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The PAX7 protein is primarily involved in the regulation of muscle satellite cells, which are essential for muscle regeneration and repair. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining the satellite cell population by promoting self-renewal and inhibiting premature differentiation. PAX7's function is critical for efficient skeletal muscle regeneration, and its absence can lead to significant deficits in muscle repair. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity. Mutations and alterations in PAX7 are associated with various clinical conditions, including congenital malformations and neuromuscular syndromes, highlighting its importance in both developmental and regenerative processes (Schäfer1994Molecular; ProskorovskiOhayon2017PAX7mutation; Olguin2004Pax7).

## Structure
The PAX7 protein is a transcription factor that belongs to the PAX family, characterized by a conserved paired domain involved in DNA binding. It also contains a paired-type homeodomain, which is highly similar to that of PAX3, contributing to its DNA-binding properties (Schäfer1994Molecular). The C-terminal region of PAX7 is rich in serine, proline, alanine, and glycine, suggesting the presence of a transactivation domain (Schäfer1994Molecular). An insertion of two amino acids, glycine and leucine, is found in the C-terminal part of the paired domain due to an alternative 3' splice site, which does not affect DNA binding (Schäfer1994Molecular).

The PAX7 protein is predicted to be 520 amino acids long, with its coding region interrupted by seven introns (Vorobyov1997The). The protein's structure includes a paired domain and a homeodomain, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. The PAX7 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may contribute to its functional diversity (Schäfer1994Molecular). The PAX7 protein can form dimers on palindromic DNA sequences, indicating cooperative dimerization via the homeodomain (Schäfer1994Molecular).

## Function
PAX7 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of muscle satellite cells, which are essential for muscle regeneration. In healthy human cells, PAX7 is involved in maintaining the satellite cell population by promoting their self-renewal and preventing premature differentiation. It achieves this by inhibiting the expression of myogenic regulatory factors such as MyoD and myogenin, which are crucial for muscle differentiation (Olguin2004Pax7). PAX7 is expressed in quiescent and activated satellite cells, helping them remain in a proliferative state necessary for muscle repair and regeneration (Kuang2006Distinct; von2013Pax7).

PAX7 is active in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA to regulate gene expression involved in myogenesis. This regulation is crucial for the formation and maintenance of myogenic precursor cells from satellite cells, ensuring efficient skeletal muscle regeneration (Kuang2006Distinct). The absence of PAX7 leads to a significant deficit in muscle regeneration, highlighting its essential role in maintaining the satellite cell pool and activating the myogenic program (Kuang2006Distinct). PAX7's function is not compensated by its paralog, Pax3, underscoring its unique role in satellite cell viability and muscle regeneration (Relaix2005Pax3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PAX7 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. Variants in PAX7 have been linked to non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (nsCL/P), a common congenital malformation. A specific intronic variant, rs742071, has been identified as potentially significant in this context, suggesting it may be a tag SNP for a functional PAX7 variant (Gaczkowska2019PAX7nucleotide).

PAX7 mutations are also implicated in a neuromuscular syndrome characterized by failure to thrive, hypotonia, and global neurodevelopmental delay. This condition is associated with a splicing mutation that affects isoform 3 of PAX7, leading to a frameshift and premature translation termination (ProskorovskiOhayon2017PAX7mutation).

Biallelic variants in PAX7 have been identified as a genetic cause of myopathy, characterized by muscle weakness, atrophy, and scoliosis. These variants lead to satellite cell exhaustion, impairing muscle growth and regeneration (Feichtinger2019Biallelic).

Altered expression of PAX7 is linked to poor prognosis in pediatric and adolescent acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where positive PAX7 expression is associated with shorter overall and event-free survival (Yan2020Positive).

## Interactions
PAX7 is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in muscle development and differentiation. It has a high affinity for homeodomain (hbox) motifs, which is crucial for its function in adult myogenesis. PAX7 can robustly bind to these motifs, unlike its homolog PAX3, which shows weaker binding (Soleimani2012Transcriptional). This binding ability allows PAX7 to regulate a larger set of genes involved in muscle cell growth and proliferation (Soleimani2012Transcriptional).

PAX7 also interacts with chromatin remodeling proteins, such as members of the MLL family, which are involved in histone methylation and acetylation. These interactions are important for altering chromatin structure and facilitating gene expression in skeletal muscle stem cells (Lilja2017Pax7). Additionally, PAX7 forms complexes with MyoD, a muscle regulatory factor, although direct interactions between the two proteins are not observed. Instead, they may coexist in a protein complex through indirect interactions, affecting MyoD's function in myogenic differentiation (Olguin2007Reciprocal).

PAX7 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which is essential for its role in neural crest and muscle development. This modification occurs at lysine 85 and is crucial for PAX7's transcriptional activity and function (Luan2012SUMOylation).
