# ALG10B

## Overview
ALG10B is a gene that encodes the enzyme ALG10 alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase B, which is integral to the N-linked glycosylation pathway in eukaryotic cells. This enzyme is categorized as a glucosyltransferase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the transfer of glucose molecules. ALG10B specifically catalyzes the addition of the final glucose residue to the glycan precursor within the endoplasmic reticulum, a critical step for the proper folding and function of glycoproteins. The activity of ALG10B is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein maturation, as it ensures the correct assembly of glycan structures on proteins. While mutations in the N-linked glycosylation pathway can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation, no mutations in the ALG10B gene have been reported, possibly due to gene duplication in humans, which may necessitate mutations in both copies to produce a phenotype (Probst2013A).

## Function
The ALG10B gene encodes the ALG10 alpha-1,2-glucosyltransferase B enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the N-linked glycosylation pathway, a highly conserved process across eukaryotes. This pathway is responsible for the addition of sugar molecules to proteins, which is essential for their proper folding and function. Specifically, the ALG10B protein catalyzes the addition of the last glucose molecule to the glycan tree within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This glycan tree is subsequently transferred to an asparagine residue on the target protein by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), and the glucose molecule is cleaved by glucosidase I (Probst2013A).

The function of ALG10B is vital for the normal operation of the N-linked glycosylation pathway, affecting thousands of human proteins. Proper functioning of this pathway ensures efficient protein maturation and cellular homeostasis. Mutations in this pathway can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), which are typically severe multisystem disorders. However, mutations in the human ALG10B gene have not been reported, possibly due to the gene's duplication in humans, which might require mutations in both copies to manifest a phenotype (Probst2013A).
