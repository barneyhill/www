# TIMM17A

## Overview
TIMM17A is a gene that encodes the translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 17A (TIMM17A), a transmembrane protein that is a critical component of the TIM23 complex within the mitochondria. This protein plays a pivotal role in the import and insertion of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix, which is essential for mitochondrial function and energy production (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated; Miao2024TIMM17A). TIMM17A is ubiquitously expressed across human tissues, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). The protein's expression is regulated in response to cellular stress, which can influence mitochondrial protein import and prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins, thereby maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated). Additionally, TIMM17A has been implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Miao2024TIMM17A; Xu2010Quantitative).

## Function
The TIMM17A gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM) complex, specifically the TIM23 complex. This complex is essential for the import and insertion of nuclear-encoded proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated; Miao2024TIMM17A). TIMM17A, along with other subunits like TIMM23 and TIMM50, forms a channel that facilitates the translocation of precursor proteins into the mitochondria, a process driven by ATP-dependent mitochondrial heat-shock protein 70 (mtHsp70) and the pre-sequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) (Goyal2020Mitochondrial; Paz2024Biochemical).

In healthy human cells, TIMM17A plays a role in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis by ensuring the proper import of proteins necessary for mitochondrial function. It is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial DNA maintenance and is responsive to cellular stress, where its levels can be modulated to adapt to changes in protein import requirements (Miao2024TIMM17A). The protein is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, indicating its fundamental role in cellular physiology (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated).

## Clinical Significance
TIMM17A has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In breast cancer, TIMM17A is overexpressed in tumor and metastatic cells compared to normal cells, and its expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis. High TIMM17A levels are associated with poorer disease-free survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer (Xu2010Quantitative). TIMM17A's role in breast cancer is further supported by its involvement in mitochondrial biogenesis, which is crucial for tumorigenesis (Xu2010Quantitative).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), TIMM17A is significantly upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, including reduced overall survival and progression-free intervals. Its expression is higher in patients with lymph node metastasis and escalates with advancing disease stage and tumor grade. TIMM17A is identified as an independent prognostic factor for LUAD, particularly associated with T stage, and its knockdown significantly suppresses cell proliferation, indicating its crucial role in LUAD development (Miao2024TIMM17A).

TIMM17A is also involved in mitochondrial function as part of the TIM23 complex. Alterations in its expression can affect mitochondrial protein import, potentially contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction during cellular stress (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated).

## Interactions
TIMM17A is a component of the TIM23 complex, which is essential for the translocation of preproteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Within this complex, TIMM17A interacts with other core components such as TIMM23 and TIMM50. These interactions are crucial for the import and sorting of mitochondrial proteins, maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity (Bogorodskiy2021Role; Jackson2018Mitochondrial).

TIMM17A, along with its isoform TIMM17B, forms part of the translocase channel in the TIM23 complex. While TIMM23 directly binds to precursor proteins, TIMM17A is thought to regulate channel activity and complex assembly, although its precise role remains less clear (Jackson2018Mitochondrial). The TIM23 complex can associate with the Presequence-Associated Motor (PAM) complex to facilitate protein import into the mitochondrial matrix, with mtHsp70 providing the mechanical force for translocation (Jackson2018Mitochondrial).

TIMM17A's expression is regulated under stress conditions, which affects the formation of the TIM23 complex and subsequently impacts mitochondrial protein import. This regulation helps prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins in mitochondria, which could lead to dysfunction (Heinemeyer2019Underappreciated).
