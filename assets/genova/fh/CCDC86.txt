# CCDC86

## Overview
CCDC86 is a gene that encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 86, which is involved in various cellular processes through its role in protein-protein interactions. The protein is characterized by a coiled-coil domain, a structural motif that facilitates these interactions, making it integral to cell signaling pathways. These pathways are crucial for regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis, processes that are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. CCDC86 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it is implicated in modulating immune responses, thereby playing a critical role in organismal health. The gene's expression and the protein's function are vital for ensuring proper cell function and survival, with potential implications for understanding immune-related disorders and other cellular dysfunctions (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
CCDC86, or coiled-coil domain containing 86, encodes a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. The protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for facilitating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are essential for the protein's involvement in cell signaling pathways, where it may influence cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. CCDC86 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its activity in these cellular compartments suggests a role in regulating immune responses, which is vital for organismal health. By participating in these molecular processes, CCDC86 helps ensure proper cell function and survival, impacting overall organismal outcomes.
