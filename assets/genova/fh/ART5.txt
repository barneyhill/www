# ART5

## Overview
ART5 is a gene that encodes the protein ADP-ribosyltransferase 5, which is part of the ADP-ribosyltransferase family. This family of enzymes is involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through the process of ADP-ribosylation, which can affect various cellular processes such as protein function, signaling, and DNA repair. ADP-ribosyltransferase 5 is primarily active in the extracellular space and is implicated in the regulation of immune responses. Notably, ART5 exhibits a higher NAD glycohydrolase activity compared to its ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, which is atypical for this enzyme family (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION; Okazaki1998Glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored). The gene is predominantly expressed in the testis, with additional expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues, and is characterized by a structure similar to other members of its family, although it lacks a hydrophobic signal sequence, suggesting it may be secreted rather than membrane-bound (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION; Okazaki1998Glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored).

## Structure


## Function
ART5 (ADP-ribosyltransferase 5) is an enzyme involved in the post-translational modification of proteins through ADP-ribosylation, a process that transfers ADP-ribose from NAD+ to target proteins. This modification can influence protein function, cellular signaling, and DNA repair. ART5 is primarily active in the extracellular space and is thought to play a role in immune response regulation. Unlike other ADP-ribosyltransferases, ART5 exhibits more NAD glycohydrolase activity than ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, catalyzing auto-ADP-ribosylation but showing relatively poor ADP-ribosylation of other proteins (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION; Okazaki1998Glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored).

ART5 is not solubilized by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), suggesting it may be secreted rather than glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked (Okazaki1998Glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored). Northern blot analysis indicates that ART5 is most abundant in the testis and also present in cardiac and skeletal muscle (Okazaki1999CHARACTERIZATION). The gene structure of ART5 is similar to ART1 and ART2, with separate exons encoding the amino-terminal signal peptide, catalytic site, and carboxyl-terminal signal sequence, although ART5 lacks a hydrophobic signal sequence in its carboxyl terminus, indicating it may be secreted (Okazaki1998Glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored).
