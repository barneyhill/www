# CFAP36

## Overview
CFAP36, or cilia and flagella associated protein 36, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the function and structural integrity of cilia and flagella. These hair-like structures are essential for various cellular processes, including movement and sensory functions. The CFAP36 protein is particularly significant in the auditory system, where it is localized to the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells, playing a crucial role in mechanotransduction, the process by which sound waves are converted into electrical signals (Hickox2016Global). Additionally, CFAP36 is involved in the assembly and stability of axonemes, the core structural component of cilia and flagella, and is implicated in ciliary dysfunction in the respiratory system (PaplińskaGoryca2020Cilia). The protein's interactions, particularly with ARL3, suggest its involvement in broader cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and cilia formation (Hosseiniyan2022Panels).

## Structure


## Function
CFAP36, or cilia and flagella associated protein 36, is involved in the structural integrity and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CFAP36 is localized to the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells, where it plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these sensory cells. These structures are crucial for hearing, as they are involved in the mechanotransduction process that converts sound waves into electrical signals (Hickox2016Global).

CFAP36 is also associated with the kinocilia and basal bodies of developing cochlear hair cells, suggesting its involvement in the assembly and stability of axonemes, the core structural component of cilia and flagella (Hickox2016Global). This protein's role in ciliary function extends to other systems, as it is implicated in ciliary dysfunction and epithelial remodeling in response to inflammatory stimuli in the respiratory system (PaplińskaGoryca2020Cilia). The presence of CFAP36 in these cellular structures highlights its importance in processes like fluid flow and sensory functions, impacting respiratory and auditory health.

## Clinical Significance
The CFAP36 gene, encoding cilia and flagella-associated protein 36, has been studied in the context of various diseases, particularly those involving ciliary dysfunction. Alterations in the expression levels of CFAP36 have been linked to obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In these conditions, CFAP36 levels were found to be elevated in asthma patients, suggesting its potential role as a marker of epithelial damage in the airway epithelium, which is crucial for lung protection (PaplińskaGoryca2020Cilia).

In addition to respiratory conditions, CFAP36 has been identified within a duplicated region of chromosome 2p16, associated with perisylvian polymicrogyria, a brain malformation disorder. However, the specific role of CFAP36 in this condition remains unclear, as the study primarily focuses on the broader implications of the chromosomal duplication (Amrom2019Duplication).

CFAP36 has also been noted as a top mRNA in renal cell carcinoma subtypes, specifically KIRP, where it acts as a binding partner of Arl3, a small GTPase involved in primary cilia formation and cell cycle regulation (Hosseiniyan2022Panels).

## Interactions
CFAP36 (cilia and flagella associated protein 36) is known to interact with ARL3, a small GTPase involved in ciliary function. This interaction is highlighted in studies focusing on renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes, where CFAP36 is identified as a binding partner of ARL3. ARL3 plays a role in cilia formation, cell cycle regulation, and mitosis in cancer cells, suggesting that CFAP36 may be involved in these processes through its association with ARL3 (Hosseiniyan2022Panels). 

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), CFAP36 has been identified as a bridge gene, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Zhou2020Identification). 

Additionally, CFAP36 is mentioned in a study on duplication 2p16 associated with perisylvian polymicrogyria (PMG), but again, specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not provided (Amrom2019Duplication). 

Overall, while CFAP36 is associated with ARL3 and potentially involved in ciliary functions, detailed physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain largely unexplored in the available literature.
