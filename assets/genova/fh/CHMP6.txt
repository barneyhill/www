# CHMP6

## Overview
CHMP6 is a gene that encodes the charged multivesicular body protein 6, a crucial component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-III). This protein is integral to the process of endosomal sorting and the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are essential for the degradation and recycling of membrane proteins. As a structural protein, CHMP6 interacts with other components of the ESCRT machinery, such as CHMP4b and EAP20, to facilitate the sorting of endosomal cargo and the final stages of cytokinetic abscission, the process that completes cell division (Goliand2014Inhibition; YORIKAWA2005Human). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, including N-myristoylation, which influences its subcellular localization and interaction with endosomal membranes (YORIKAWA2005Human). Through its interactions and structural roles, CHMP6 is pivotal in maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper cell division (Goliand2014Inhibition).

## Structure
CHMP6 is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, consisting of 201 amino acids. The protein features two predicted coiled-coil structures located in the N-terminal (residues 10-94) and C-terminal (residues 119-145) halves (YORIKAWA2005Human). The N-terminal region is rich in basic residues with a calculated isoelectric point (pI) of 12.08, while the C-terminal region is acidic with a pI of 3.93 (YORIKAWA2005Human). CHMP6 contains a putative N-myristoylation site at the N-terminus, where the first glycine is modified, as confirmed by metabolic labeling experiments (YORIKAWA2005Human). This post-translational modification is crucial for its function and localization (Goliand2014Inhibition).

CHMP6 interacts with other ESCRT components, such as CHMP4b and EAP20, primarily through its N-terminal region (YORIKAWA2005Human). The N-terminal region is also essential for binding to the ESCRT-II component VPS25, which is critical for its role in cytokinetic abscission (Goliand2014Inhibition). The protein's interactions suggest it may undergo conformational changes upon binding to membranes, facilitating its interaction capabilities (YORIKAWA2005Human). However, specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CHMP6 is a component of the ESCRT-III complex, which plays a crucial role in endosomal sorting and the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). It is involved in the regulation of endosomal cargo sorting by interacting with other ESCRT components, such as CHMP4b and EAP20, a component of the ESCRT-II complex. This interaction suggests that CHMP6 acts as an acceptor for ESCRT-II on endosomal membranes, facilitating the later stages of MVB formation (YORIKAWA2005Human).

In healthy human cells, CHMP6 is myristoylated, which affects its subcellular localization, particularly associating with endosome-like organelles, including MVBs. Overexpression of CHMP6 in HeLa cells leads to a punctate distribution in the cytoplasm and affects the recycling and transport of transferrin receptors and ubiquitinated proteins, indicating its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function (YORIKAWA2005Human).

CHMP6 is also involved in cytokinetic abscission, the final step of cell division. It localizes to the intercellular bridge during abscission, forming structures essential for the process. Its interaction with VPS25 is crucial for its function in this context, highlighting its role in the spatial organization and function of the ESCRT machinery during cell division (Goliand2014Inhibition).

## Interactions
CHMP6, a component of the ESCRT-III complex, is involved in various protein-protein interactions essential for its function in endosomal cargo sorting and cytokinetic abscission. CHMP6 directly interacts with the ESCRT-II component EAP20, facilitating its role as an acceptor for ESCRT-II on endosomal membranes (YORIKAWA2005Human). This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of CHMP6, which is crucial for binding to EAP20 (YORIKAWA2005Human).

CHMP6 also interacts with CHMP4b, another ESCRT-III component, through its N-terminal region. This interaction is important for the assembly and function of the ESCRT-III complex (YORIKAWA2005Human). In the context of cytokinetic abscission, CHMP6 binds to the ESCRT-II component VPS25, with the N-terminal amino acids playing a critical role in this interaction. This binding is essential for the localization of CHMP6 to the intercellular bridge and the inhibition of abscission (Goliand2014Inhibition).

Additionally, CHMP6 interacts with the Ras protein family, specifically H-Ras and N-Ras, in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the recycling of Ras to the plasma membrane, which is important for growth factor signaling (Zheng2012CHMP6).
