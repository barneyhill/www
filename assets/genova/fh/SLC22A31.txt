# SLC22A31

## Overview
SLC22A31 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 31, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family 22. This family is known for its role in the transport of small molecules across cell membranes, and SLC22A31 is categorized within the divergent OAT-related subclade. The protein is characterized by a large extracellular domain (ECD) and is a member of the major facilitator superfamily, typically featuring 12 α-helical transmembrane domains. Despite its classification, the specific function of SLC22A31 remains largely undefined, with sequence similarities suggesting potential roles in RNA binding and chromatin modification. These potential functions are inferred from its sequence identity with RNA-binding protein 42 (RBM42) and the heterochromatinization factor BAHD1, although direct functional data is lacking (Engelhart2019Reclassification; Engelhart2020Systems). Further research is necessary to elucidate the precise biological roles and mechanisms of SLC22A31.

## Structure
The human gene SLC22A31 is a member of the solute carrier family 22, specifically part of the divergent OAT-Related subclade. The protein encoded by SLC22A31 is characterized by a large extracellular domain (ECD) that shares at least 30% sequence identity with RNA-binding protein 42 (RBM42) across several species, including mouse, rat, cow, and human. Additionally, there is a 37% sequence identity between the ECD of human SLC22A31 and the human heterochromatinization factor BAHD1, suggesting potential functional or structural roles (Engelhart2019Reclassification; Engelhart2020Systems).

The SLC22 family, to which SLC22A31 belongs, is part of the major facilitator superfamily and is generally characterized by 12 α-helical transmembrane domains. These transporters typically have a large extracellular loop between the first two transmembrane domains and a smaller intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains (Engelhart2020Systems). However, specific structural details such as primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures for SLC22A31 remain uncharacterized, and no crystallization data is available to confirm these structures (Engelhart2019Reclassification; Yee2021Emerging).

## Function
The SLC22A31 gene is a member of the SLC22 family, which is known for encoding transporters involved in the movement of small molecules across cell membranes. However, the specific function of SLC22A31 in healthy human cells remains largely ambiguous due to the lack of functional data. Sequence similarity studies have suggested potential novel functions for SLC22A31, indicating roles beyond traditional transporter functions. The extracellular domain (ECD) of human SLC22A31 shares at least 30% sequence identity with RNA-binding protein 42 (RBM42) and 37% with the human heterochromatinization factor BAHD1, suggesting potential involvement in RNA binding or chromatin modification (Engelhart2019Reclassification; Engelhart2020Systems).

Despite these insights, the exact molecular processes and cellular roles of SLC22A31 remain unclear. The gene is categorized under the OAT-related subfamily, which implies potential functional similarities with other members of this group, although no direct orthologs have been identified in mice, suggesting a unique evolutionary path and possibly specialized functions in humans (Nigam2018The; Yee2021Emerging). Further research is needed to elucidate the specific activities and organismal outcomes associated with SLC22A31.

## Interactions
SLC22A31, a member of the solute carrier family 22, is noted for its ambiguous functional role and lack of direct functional data. Despite this, sequence analysis has revealed potential interactions or functional similarities with proteins involved in RNA binding and chromatin modification. The large extracellular domain (ECD) of human SLC22A31 shares at least 30% sequence identity with RNA-binding protein 42 (RBM42) across several species, including mouse, rat, cow, and human (Engelhart2019Reclassification; Engelhart2020Systems). This suggests a possible interaction or functional similarity with RNA-binding proteins, although no direct interactions have been confirmed.

Additionally, the ECD of human SLC22A31 shares a 37% sequence identity with the human heterochromatinization factor BAHD1, indicating potential involvement in chromatin modification processes (Engelhart2019Reclassification; Engelhart2020Systems). These sequence similarities imply that SLC22A31 may participate in interactions related to RNA binding and chromatin modification, although the exact nature of these interactions remains to be elucidated. The lack of crystallized structures for SLC22 family members further complicates the understanding of SLC22A31's interactions and functional mechanisms (Engelhart2020Systems).
