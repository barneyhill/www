# MAN1A2

## Overview
The MAN1A2 gene encodes the enzyme mannosidase alpha class 1A member 2, a glycoside hydrolase involved in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides within the Golgi apparatus. This enzyme plays a critical role in the maturation of N-glycans by cleaving excess mannose residues, which is essential for proper glycoprotein synthesis and cellular functions such as protein folding and quality control (Ningappa2021Mechanisms). The protein is characterized by a glycoside hydrolase domain with an (αα)7-barrel structure, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Lobsanov2002Structure). MAN1A2 is involved in various biological processes, including ciliary function and developmental pathways such as sonic hedgehog, Notch, and Wnt signaling (Ningappa2021Mechanisms). Dysregulation of MAN1A2 is associated with several diseases, including biliary atresia and ciliopathies, highlighting its clinical significance (So2020BiliaryAtresiaAssociated).

## Structure
The MAN1A2 gene encodes the enzyme mannosidase alpha class 1A member 2, which is involved in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides. The protein's structure includes a glycoside hydrolase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (IsoyamaTanaka2011Improved). This domain is characterized by an (αα)7-barrel structure, a common feature among Class 1 α1,2-mannosidases, facilitating the enzyme's function in glycan processing (Lobsanov2002Structure).

The enzyme's activity and stability are influenced by calcium ions (Ca2+), which are essential for maintaining its structural integrity and function. The presence of Ca2+ is particularly important for the stability and activity of the hManIA2 isoform, as its activity is not detected without Ca2+ (IsoyamaTanaka2011Improved). The protein also exhibits distinct substrate preferences, which are influenced by its structural configuration and the presence of specific residues that interact with substrates (IsoyamaTanaka2011Improved).

The MAN1A2 protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is typical for proteins involved in glycan processing. These modifications can affect the protein's function and interactions within the cell (IsoyamaTanaka2011Improved).

## Function
The MAN1A2 gene encodes an enzyme involved in the maturation of N-glycans by cleaving excess mannose residues, a process crucial for the proper synthesis and maturation of glycoproteins. This function is essential for maintaining cellular processes such as protein folding and quality control within the Golgi apparatus (Ningappa2021Mechanisms). In healthy human cells, MAN1A2 plays a significant role in the formation and function of cilia, which are vital for normal left-right patterning during development. The gene is part of the CPLANE network, interacting with ciliopathy-associated proteins to recruit intraflagellar transport proteins necessary for ciliary function (So2020BiliaryAtresiaAssociated).

MAN1A2 is also involved in regulating developmental pathways, including sonic hedgehog (Shh), Notch, and Wnt signaling, which are critical for organ development and morphogenesis (Ningappa2021Mechanisms). Its activity is linked to the regulation of stress response pathways and the ER/Golgi synthetic machinery, influencing oxidative stress response and lung development pathways (Ningappa2021Mechanisms). Proper function of MAN1A2 is essential for normal lung development and ciliogenesis, and its dysregulation can lead to developmental defects and diseases such as ciliopathies and biliary atresia (So2020BiliaryAtresiaAssociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MAN1A2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of biliary atresia (BA), a condition affecting the liver and bile ducts in children, MAN1A2 has been identified as a susceptibility gene. Studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MAN1A2 gene are significantly associated with BA, affecting its expression and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis. MAN1A2 is involved in biliary and ciliary morphogenesis, and its dysregulation can lead to impaired bile duct development and ciliary function, which are critical in BA (So2020BiliaryAtresiaAssociated).

In gout, MAN1A2 has been identified as an up-regulated differentially expressed gene, suggesting its involvement in the inflammatory response through protein glycosylation pathways. The circular RNA circMAN1A2, related to MAN1A2, has been proposed as a potential biomarker for gout diagnosis due to its altered expression levels in patients (Guo2023The).

Additionally, mutations in MAN1A2 have been linked to impaired lung development and ciliation, as seen in studies involving mouse models. Homozygous deletions in the gene result in lethal respiratory failure, while heterozygous mutations lead to intermediate defects in lung ciliation and survival (Ningappa2021Mechanisms).

## Interactions
The MAN1A2 gene encodes an enzyme involved in the processing of N-linked glycans in the Golgi apparatus. It participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. MAN1A2 is part of the CPLANE network, interacting with ciliopathy-associated proteins to recruit intraflagellar transport proteins, which are essential for ciliary development and function (So2020BiliaryAtresiaAssociated). This interaction is significant in the context of biliary atresia, where MAN1A2 dysregulation affects ciliary development and can lead to developmental defects.

In the context of lung development, MAN1A2 interacts with proteins involved in stress response pathways, such as the unfolded protein response and oxidative stress pathways. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of lung development and ciliation, as evidenced by studies on Man1a2 mutants (Ningappa2021Mechanisms). The protein-protein interaction network constructed using the STRING database identified 83 proteins that interact with Man1a2, highlighting its extensive involvement in various biological pathways (Ningappa2021Mechanisms).

MAN1A2 also interacts with the EGFR signaling pathway, which is important for proper intrahepatic biliary network formation. This interaction is demonstrated by the synergistic effects observed when MAN1A2 and ARF6 are co-injected in zebrafish models, leading to impaired biliary network formation (So2020BiliaryAtresiaAssociated).
