# STUB1

## Overview
The STUB1 gene encodes the STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1, commonly referred to as CHIP, which is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a pivotal role in protein quality control by facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis. CHIP is characterized by its U-box domain, which is crucial for its ubiquitin ligase activity, and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain that mediates interactions with chaperone proteins such as Hsp70 and Hsp90 (Ng2022Discovery). These interactions are essential for its function in various cellular processes, including stress response, apoptosis, and the regulation of circadian rhythms. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, and it is implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders due to mutations in the STUB1 gene (Wang2019The; Ullah2020The).

## Structure
STUB1, also known as CHIP, is a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in protein quality control. The protein is characterized by three main domains: a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, a U-box domain, and a coiled-coil domain. The TPR domain is responsible for protein-protein interactions, facilitating binding to chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90, which are crucial for its role in maintaining protein homeostasis (Ng2022Discovery). The U-box domain is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, enabling the ubiquitination of substrate proteins (Ng2022Discovery).

STUB1 can form homodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure, which is important for its function in ubiquitination processes (Ng2022Discovery). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which may regulate its activity and interactions (Ng2022Discovery).

The structure-activity relationship studies of macrocyclic peptides targeting STUB1 have revealed insights into its binding interactions, particularly with the TPR region, which is a key site for modulating its activity (Ng2022Discovery). These studies have also highlighted the importance of peptide cyclization in enhancing binding affinity to STUB1 (Ng2022Discovery).

## Function
The STUB1 gene encodes the CHIP protein, which functions as a co-chaperone and E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis in healthy human cells. CHIP is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of misfolded or damaged proteins, a process essential for preventing the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates that can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (Wang2019The). It interacts with chaperone proteins like HSC70, HSP70, and HSP90 through its N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, facilitating the proteasomal degradation of proteins (Wang2019The).

CHIP is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including stress response and apoptosis. It regulates the degradation of signaling molecules involved in bone remodeling, such as SMAD proteins and RUNX2, and inhibits NF-κB signaling by degrading TRAF family members, which is crucial for balancing osteoclast and osteoblast activity (Wang2019The). Additionally, CHIP plays a role in regulating circadian rhythms and cellular aging by promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of the core circadian regulator BMAL1, thereby attenuating cell senescence (Ullah2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the STUB1 gene are linked to several neurodegenerative disorders, primarily spinocerebellar ataxias. Autosomal recessive mutations in STUB1 cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 16 (SCAR16), characterized by early-onset symptoms such as gait disturbance, dysarthria, tremors, hyperreflexia, cognitive decline, and sometimes hypogonadism (Pakdaman2021Genetic; Roux2020Clinical). These mutations destabilize the CHIP protein structure, leading to decreased interaction with chaperones and reduced ubiquitination activity (Pakdaman2021Genetic). 

Autosomal dominant mutations in STUB1 are associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 48 (SCA48), which presents with late-onset cerebellar ataxia, cognitive-affective syndrome, and psychiatric phenotypes (Pakdaman2021Genetic; Roux2020Clinical). Both SCAR16 and SCA48 share similar biochemical defects, such as impaired ubiquitin ligase activity and altered oligomerization properties of the CHIP protein (Pakdaman2021Genetic).

STUB1 mutations are also implicated in Gordon Holmes syndrome, a multisystemic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by symptoms including ataxia, spasticity, cognitive deficits, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Hayer2017STUB1CHIP). Alterations in STUB1 expression have been linked to acute kidney injury, where its upregulation may play a protective role by attenuating apoptosis and inflammation (Shi2021NetworkBased).

## Interactions
STUB1, also known as CHIP, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with various proteins, influencing their stability and function. It preferentially interacts with the core circadian regulator BMAL1 over CLOCK, another circadian regulator. This interaction is facilitated by the U-Box domain of STUB1 and the middle domain of BMAL1. STUB1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of BMAL1, which is crucial for regulating circadian rhythms and attenuating cell senescence (Ullah2020The).

STUB1 also interacts with UHRF1, promoting K63-linked ubiquitination, which enhances UHRF1's nuclear localization and interaction with DNMT1. This interaction is significant in maintaining DNA hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, contributing to the progression of cholangiocarcinoma (Chen2024STUB1mediated).

In the context of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) latency, STUB1 interacts with the EBNA1 protein. The SUMO-interacting motif of EBNA1 targets STUB1, playing a role in maintaining EBV latency by modulating the SUMOylation status of STUB1 and associated proteins (Wang2020STUB1).

STUB1 also forms a complex with Hsc/p70 through its N-terminal TPR domain, targeting mutant keratins for degradation, which is important in conditions like epidermolysis bullosa simplex (Löffek2010The).
