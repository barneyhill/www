# EHMT2

## Overview
EHMT2, also known as G9a, is a gene that encodes the euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 protein, a key enzyme involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. This protein is categorized as a histone methyltransferase and is primarily responsible for the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), a modification associated with transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation. EHMT2 plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, and the maintenance of genomic stability. It is known to interact with other proteins and complexes, such as EHMT1, to modulate its methylation activity and is involved in DNA damage repair and transcriptional regulation. The gene's dysregulation has been linked to several diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Yang2017G9a; Shankar2013G9a; MartinezDelgado2024EHMT2).

## Structure


## Function
EHMT2, also known as G9a, is a histone methyltransferase that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression through the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9). This methylation is crucial for transcriptional repression and is involved in the silencing of alternative lineage genes during differentiation and development (MartinezDelgado2024EHMT2). EHMT2 forms heterodimers with EHMT1 to achieve maximum methylation activity, although EHMT2 is more relevant for maintaining H3K9 methylation levels (MartinezDelgado2024EHMT2).

In healthy human cells, EHMT2 is involved in maintaining cellular levels of H3K9 methylation, which is essential for the repression of pluripotency genes and the establishment of heterochromatin (Shankar2013G9a). It also plays a role in genomic imprinting and is recruited by non-coding RNAs to stimulate heterochromatin formation for monoallelic gene expression (Shankar2013G9a). EHMT2 is active in the nucleus and is involved in various cellular processes, including development, differentiation, and the maintenance of genomic stability (Chen2012G9aGLPdependent). The protein's activity is modulated by specific inhibitors like BIX-01294 and UNC0638, which block its substrate binding groove (Shankar2013G9a).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the EHMT2 gene, also known as G9a, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and neurological disorders. In gastric cancer, EHMT2 is overexpressed, leading to increased levels of H3K9me2, which is associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and lymph node metastasis. This overexpression contributes to the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes, promoting tumor growth and invasion (Chen2020Increased).

EHMT2 mutations are also linked to a Kleefstra-like syndrome, a condition with clinical features overlapping with Kleefstra syndrome, typically associated with EHMT1 mutations. A specific de novo missense variant, p.Ala1077Ser, in the EHMT2 gene affects its catalytic activity, leading to reduced histone H3 methylation and altered gene expression. This mutation results in developmental delays and craniofacial abnormalities, highlighting the gene's critical role in neurodevelopment (Barrero2024Ehmt2; MartinezDelgado2024EHMT2).

In brain tumors, particularly glioblastoma and medulloblastoma, EHMT2 is implicated in maintaining a stem cell-like phenotype and promoting tumor progression. Inhibition of EHMT2 has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Souza2021EHMT2G9a).

## Interactions
EHMT2, also known as G9a, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in DNA damage repair and transcriptional regulation. EHMT2 interacts with the replication protein A (RPA) complex, specifically with RPA70 and RPA32, to facilitate DNA damage repair. This interaction is enhanced upon DNA damage and is crucial for the recruitment of RPA and Rad51 to DNA double-strand breaks, promoting homologous recombination repair (Yang2017G9a). The phosphorylation of EHMT2 at Ser211 by CK2 is necessary for its binding to RPA70 and subsequent recruitment to chromatin (Yang2017G9a).

EHMT2 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the transcriptional coactivator CBP. It enhances p53 activity through a methylation-independent mechanism, increasing p53 binding to target gene promoters such as PUMA and p21, particularly under DNA damage conditions. EHMT2's interaction with CBP leads to increased acetylation of histone H4 at the PUMA promoter, augmenting p53-dependent transcription (Rada2016Human).

Additionally, EHMT2 forms complexes with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to suppress the transcriptional activation of certain genes, such as RRAGC, through hypermethylation of H3K9 and DNA (Hwang2020Euchromatin).
