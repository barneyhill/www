# ZKSCAN1

## Overview
ZKSCAN1 is a gene that encodes the protein zinc finger with KRAB and SCAN domains 1, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a significant role in regulating cellular metabolism and gene expression. It is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of healthy human cells, particularly in liver tissues, where it influences the expression of various metabolic genes (Yao2017ZKSCAN1). The gene is notable for producing both linear mRNA and a circular RNA form, circZKSCAN1, which have distinct roles in cellular processes. While the mRNA translates into a protein that affects cell death and metastasis, circZKSCAN1 acts as a regulatory molecule, interacting with proteins such as mTOR and influencing pathways related to cell proliferation and cancer progression (Liang2014Short; Song2023A). The gene and its circular RNA have been implicated in various cancers, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets and prognostic factors (Li2021CircZKSCAN1; Bi2019Circular).

## Function
The ZKSCAN1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the zinc finger protein family, functioning primarily as a transcription factor. In healthy human cells, particularly in normal liver tissues, the ZKSCAN1 protein is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining normal cellular metabolism (Yao2017ZKSCAN1). The protein is involved in regulating metabolic processes by influencing the expression of downstream factors such as CYP1A1, ACSL1, ALPP, and AKR1B10, which are integral to various metabolic pathways (Yao2017ZKSCAN1).

ZKSCAN1 can produce two types of RNA: ZKSCAN1 mRNA and circZKSCAN1, a circular RNA. The mRNA is translated into a protein that impacts cell death and metastasis, while circZKSCAN1 may act as a competitive inhibitor, regulating gene expression related to cell proliferation and metastasis (Yao2017ZKSCAN1). The circular RNA form is more stable than the linear mRNA and is localized exclusively to the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in the regulatory network of the cell (Liang2014Short). The gene's role in healthy cells is primarily associated with its involvement in metabolic pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yao2017ZKSCAN1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZKSCAN1 gene and its circular RNA form, circZKSCAN1, have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer (BCa), circZKSCAN1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and invasion through the miR-1178-3p/p21 axis. Its downregulation in BCa tissues is associated with poorer disease-free survival and higher recurrence rates, suggesting its potential as a prognostic factor (Bi2019Circular).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), circZKSCAN1 is significantly downregulated, correlating with poor clinical outcomes such as distant metastasis and advanced TNM stage. It suppresses HCC progression by modulating the miR-873-5p/DLC1 axis, acting as a tumor suppressor (Li2021CircZKSCAN1). Additionally, a novel polypeptide encoded by circZKSCAN1, named circZKSaa, inhibits HCC by promoting mTOR degradation, enhancing sensitivity to sorafenib treatment (Song2023A).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), circZKSCAN1 is upregulated and associated with malignant characteristics and poor prognosis. It promotes NSCLC progression by sponging miR-330-5p, which increases FAM83A expression and inhibits the MAPK signaling pathway (Wang2019CircZKSCAN1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZKSCAN1 and circZKSCAN1 in cancer progression and their potential as therapeutic targets.

## Interactions
ZKSCAN1, a gene encoding a protein with zinc finger domains, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids. The circular RNA derived from ZKSCAN1, known as circZKSCAN1, has been shown to interact with the mTOR protein, inhibiting its activation by preventing AKT activation. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence staining, demonstrating co-localization of circZKSCAN1 with mTOR (Song2023A). Additionally, circZKSCAN1 encodes a peptide, circZKSaa, which promotes the degradation of mTOR through a ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway. This process is facilitated by the interaction of circZKSaa with the FBXW7 protein, enhancing the binding of FBXW7 to mTOR and leading to its ubiquitination and degradation (Song2023A).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, ZKSCAN1 is identified as a hub gene with numerous interactions across different brain regions, although the specific proteins or nucleic acids involved in these interactions are not detailed (Mitra2024Alzheimer’s). In K562 cells, circZKSCAN1 has been found to bind with the RNA-binding protein UCHL5, and in HepG2 cells, it interacts with GRWD1, highlighting its role in RNA-protein interactions (Okholm2020Transcriptome-wide).
