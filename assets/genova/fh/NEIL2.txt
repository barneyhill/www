# NEIL2

## Overview
The NEIL2 gene encodes the nei like DNA glycosylase 2, a crucial enzyme in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing oxidative DNA damage and maintaining genomic stability. This DNA glycosylase is characterized by its unique structural features, including an N-terminal β-sandwich domain and a C-terminal domain with helix-two-turns-helix (H2TH) and zinc finger DNA-binding motifs, which facilitate its interaction with various DNA substrates and protein partners (Eckenroth2020Unique; Prakash2013Structural). NEIL2 is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, highlighting its role in preserving mitochondrial genome integrity (Mandal2012Role). Beyond its DNA repair functions, NEIL2 is involved in modulating transcription and inflammatory responses, with its activity being regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Sarker2021DNA; Myrup2023Phosphorylation). Alterations in NEIL2 expression and function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, underscoring its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Sarker2021DNA).

## Structure
The NEIL2 protein is a DNA glycosylase involved in the base excision repair pathway, characterized by unique structural features that distinguish it from other members of the Fpg/Nei family. NEIL2 has an N-terminal β-sandwich domain and a C-terminal domain containing helix-two-turns-helix (H2TH) and zinc finger DNA-binding motifs (Eckenroth2020Unique; Prakash2013Structural). The protein exhibits an unusual 'open' conformation, which is distinct from the 'closed' conformations observed in NEIL1 and NEIL3, allowing for conformational flexibility that facilitates interactions with various DNA substrates and protein partners (Eckenroth2020Unique).

NEIL2 contains a large insert within the N-terminal domain, which is rich in lysines and arginines, contributing to its interaction with DNA substrates (Eckenroth2020Unique). The protein's structure lacks two of the three void-filling residues typically found in other glycosylases, which may influence its lesion recognition mechanism (Eckenroth2020Unique). NEIL2 is also noted for its ability to undergo large-scale conformational changes without hindering its function, a feature that is not a kinetic barrier to its activity (Eckenroth2020Unique). The protein's structural dynamics are further supported by solution studies, indicating that NEIL2 can exist in multiple conformational states (Eckenroth2020Unique).

## Function
The NEIL2 gene encodes a DNA glycosylase that plays a crucial role in the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability by repairing oxidative DNA damage. NEIL2 is involved in recognizing and excising oxidized bases, such as 5-hydroxyuracil, from single-stranded and bubble-structured DNA, particularly in transcriptionally active regions (Myrup2023Phosphorylation; Das2006NEIL2initiated). This activity is vital in the brain, where high oxidative stress occurs due to high oxygen consumption (Myrup2023Phosphorylation).

NEIL2 is active in both the nucleus and mitochondria, contributing to the maintenance of mitochondrial genome integrity by repairing oxidative damage in mitochondrial DNA (Mandal2012Role). It interacts with other BER proteins, such as DNA polymerase β, XRCC1, and polynucleotide kinase, forming a repair complex that is competent for repairing oxidized bases (Das2006NEIL2initiated).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, NEIL2 is implicated in modulating transcription and inflammatory responses. It preferentially recognizes oxidized cytosine in GC-rich promoters, potentially influencing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and appears to suppress inflammation (Sarker2021DNA). NEIL2's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can affect its repair activity (Myrup2023Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the NEIL2 gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly cancers. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NEIL2, such as rs1466785 and rs804271, are associated with increased cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, and are considered cancer risk modifiers (Kakhkharova2022A). NEIL2 polymorphisms have been implicated in several cancer types, including squamous cell oral and oropharynx carcinoma, testicular germ cell tumors, gastric cancer, cervical squamous cell carcinomas, and breast cancer (Kakhkharova2022A). The rs804270 and rs8191664 SNPs are linked to increased risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III (CIN III) and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) in a Chinese population (Ye2020Cervical).

The R257L variant of NEIL2 is associated with impaired DNA repair capacity, leading to increased oxidative DNA damage and a higher risk of lung cancer, particularly in the Han Chinese population (Dey2012Increased). NEIL2 expression levels are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity, as both over- and under-expression can lead to genomic instability and tumor development (Sarker2021DNA). NEIL2's role in the base excision repair pathway is critical for preventing mutations and maintaining genomic stability, with its dysfunction contributing to various diseases, including cancer and potentially neurodegenerative disorders (Sarker2021DNA).

## Interactions
NEIL2 (nei like DNA glycosylase 2) is involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway and interacts with several proteins to facilitate DNA repair processes. NEIL2 forms a complex with XRCC1, DNA polymerase β (Pol β), polynucleotide kinase (PNK), and DNA ligase IIIα (Lig IIIα), which are critical partners in the BER machinery. This complex is competent for the repair of oxidized DNA bases, such as 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU), through an APE1-independent mechanism (Das2006NEIL2initiated).

NEIL2 also interacts with Y box-binding protein-1 (YB-1), which enhances its base excision activity, particularly during oxidative stress. YB-1 stimulates NEIL2's ability to excise oxidized bases from DNA substrates, increasing its catalytic efficiency. This interaction is crucial for NEIL2-mediated repair under oxidative stress conditions (Das2007Stimulation).

Additionally, NEIL2 interacts with the Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) protein, which stimulates NEIL2's incision activity on oxidative DNA lesions, particularly in DNA bubble structures. This suggests a role for NEIL2 in transcription-coupled repair, working alongside CSB to repair oxidative lesions during transcription (Sarker2021DNA; Aamann2014Cockayne).
