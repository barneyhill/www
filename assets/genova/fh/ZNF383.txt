# ZNF383

## Overview
ZNF383 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 383, a member of the KRAB-containing zinc finger protein family, which functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. The protein is characterized by a KRAB domain and 11 C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate its role in binding to specific DNA sequences and regulating gene expression (Cao2005ZNF383). ZNF383 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with co-repressor proteins such as KAP-1 to mediate gene silencing (Cao2005ZNF383). The protein is expressed in various human tissues, with notable expression in skeletal muscle, heart, and testicle, and plays a significant role in suppressing the MAPK signaling pathway, thereby influencing cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Cao2005ZNF383).

## Structure
The ZNF383 gene encodes a protein that is characterized by the presence of a KRAB domain and 11 C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which are conserved across various species (Cao2005ZNF383). The primary structure of ZNF383 consists of 475 amino acids, resulting in a molecular mass of approximately 54.6 kDa (Cao2005ZNF383). The KRAB domain, located at the N-terminus, is crucial for the protein's function as a transcriptional repressor, as demonstrated by the loss of repressor activity in truncated versions lacking this domain (Cao2005ZNF383). 

The zinc finger domains facilitate DNA binding, a common feature in transcription factors, and contribute to the protein's role in gene regulation (Cao2005ZNF383). ZNF383 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, supporting its function as a transcriptional regulator (Cao2005ZNF383). The KRAB domain is known to interact with co-repressor proteins like KAP-1, which mediates gene silencing (Cao2005ZNF383). While specific post-translational modifications and splice variants are not detailed in the provided context, the protein's structure and domain composition suggest a complex regulatory role in cellular processes.

## Function
ZNF383 is a KRAB-containing zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in healthy human cells. It is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences through its zinc finger domains. The protein contains a conserved C2H2 domain within a seven zinc-finger region and a KRAB domain, which is crucial for its repressor activity (Cao2005ZNF383). The KRAB domain interacts with co-repressor proteins like KAP-1, facilitating gene silencing (Cao2005ZNF383).

ZNF383 is expressed in various human tissues, with higher levels observed in skeletal muscle, heart, and testicle, both in embryonic and adult stages (Cao2005ZNF383). It is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting it may shuttle between these compartments to exert its regulatory functions (Cao2005ZNF383). Functionally, ZNF383 suppresses the MAPK signaling pathway, which is essential for cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Cao2005ZNF383). This suppression is achieved through the inhibition of transcriptional activities of factors like AP-1 and SRE, indicating its role as a negative regulator in growth factor-mediated signaling pathways (Cao2005ZNF383).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
ZNF383 is a KRAB-containing zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor. It is known to interact with the co-repressor protein KAP-1, also known as TRIM28, which is a universal mediator for KRAB-ZNF proteins. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional repression activity of ZNF383, as KAP-1 associates with heterochromatin protein HP1a, facilitating gene silencing (Cao2005ZNF383). The KRAB domain of ZNF383 is responsible for its repressor activity and is essential for its interaction with transcriptional coregulators like TIF1b (Cao2005ZNF383).

In the context of MAPK-mediated signaling pathways, ZNF383 acts as a negative regulator by inhibiting the transcriptional activities of AP-1 and SRE, which are important for various cellular processes (Cao2005ZNF383). Although specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed, the presence of an 11 C2H2 zinc finger domain suggests that ZNF383 may bind to specific DNA sequences, contributing to its role as a transcription factor (Cao2005ZNF383). The protein is expressed in various human tissues, with higher levels in skeletal muscle, heart, and testicle, indicating its potential involvement in tissue-specific regulatory networks (Cao2005ZNF383).
