# CYFIP2

## Overview
The CYFIP2 gene encodes the cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2, a critical component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell migration, membrane protrusion formation, and synaptic function, particularly in neurons where it contributes to dendritic spine morphology and synaptic transmission (Polesskaya2020Restrained; Zhang2019Neuronal). CYFIP2 is categorized as a cytoplasmic protein and is known for its interactions with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and other synaptic proteins, highlighting its importance in maintaining synaptic integrity and neuronal connectivity (Schenck2001A; Zhang2019Neuronal). Mutations in CYFIP2 have been linked to severe neurological disorders, including early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, underscoring its clinical significance in neural development and function (Biembengut2022Molecular; Nakashima2018De).

## Structure
The CYFIP2 protein is a component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which plays a crucial role in actin dynamics. The protein structure includes conserved domains such as DUF1394 and FragX_IP. Missense variants like p.(Arg87Cys) and p.(Tyr108His) are located in the DUF1394 subdomain, while others like p.(Ala455Pro), p.(Ile664Met), p.(Glu665Lys), p.(Asp724His), and p.(Gln725Arg) are in the FragX_IP subdomain. These subdomains are interlocked, with Arg87 in proximity to other variant sites, affecting the CYFIP2-WAVE1 interface (Zweier2019Spatially).

CYFIP2 interacts with the VCA domain of WAVE proteins to inhibit WRC activation. Upon binding of active RAC1 to CYFIP, the VCA domain is released, leading to Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin reorganization (Nakashima2018De). The protein is part of a heteropentameric complex composed of WAVE, CYFIP, Nck-associated protein 1 (NCKAP1), Abl interactor 2 (Abi2), and probable protein BRICK1 (PRK1) (Nakashima2018De).

Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification of CYFIP2, with specific sites identified that may affect its interaction with other proteins and the assembly of the WRC (Lee2017Phosphorylation). The protein's interaction with other components of the WRC is crucial for its function in actin dynamics and neuronal morphogenesis (Schaks2020Molecular).

## Function
CYFIP2, or cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2, is a crucial component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. This complex is essential for processes such as cell migration and the formation of membrane protrusions like lamellipodia, which are critical for cell motility (Polesskaya2020Restrained). CYFIP2 interacts with the Arp2/3 complex in a RAC1-dependent manner, influencing actin polymerization at the cell cortex (Polesskaya2020Restrained).

In neurons, CYFIP2 is involved in synaptic structures and dynamics, localizing to dendritic spines where it contributes to excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic scaffolding (Zhang2019Neuronal). It interacts with synaptic proteins such as Shank3, indicating its role in maintaining synaptic integrity and neuronal connectivity (Zhang2019Neuronal). CYFIP2 also influences dendritic branching and neurite outgrowth, which are vital for neuronal development and plasticity (Zhang2019Neuronal).

CYFIP2 is expressed in various tissues, with higher levels in the brain, kidney, and lymph nodes, and is particularly abundant in neuronal cells (Biembengut2021Cytoplasmic). Its activity is crucial for proper axon sorting and synaptic function, as evidenced by studies in animal models (Zhang2019Neuronal). The protein's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal neural function and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYFIP2 gene are associated with several severe neurological disorders, particularly early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE). Variants such as R87C, R87L, and R87P have been identified as de novo mutations in patients with EIEE, including conditions like West syndrome and Ohtahara syndrome. These mutations disrupt the interaction between CYFIP2 and the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), leading to aberrant activation of the WRC and dysregulation of actin filament polymerization. This disruption is believed to contribute to the pathology of these disorders by affecting neuronal dendritic spine structure and synaptic function (Zhang2019Neuronal; Biembengut2022Molecular; Nakashima2018De).

Alterations in CYFIP2 expression have also been linked to intellectual disability and developmental delays. The gene's role in presynaptic functions and its interactions with RNA-binding proteins suggest that changes in its expression or function could impact synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release, potentially contributing to the clinical features observed in these disorders (Lee2020Epilepsy; Kim2020Altered).

In addition to its role in epilepsy, CYFIP2 has been implicated in other neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders, although the exact mechanisms remain less clear (Kim2020Altered).

## Interactions
CYFIP2 interacts with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and its related proteins FXR1P and FXR2P. These interactions have been demonstrated through various assays, including GST pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays, indicating a strong binding affinity between CYFIP2 and these proteins (Schenck2001A). CYFIP2 is also a component of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), which is crucial for actin filament polymerization. Within the WRC, CYFIP2 interacts with proteins such as WAVE, NCKAP1, ABI2, and HSPC300, playing a significant role in actin dynamics (Zweier2019Spatially; Biembengut2022Molecular).

CYFIP2's interaction with the WRC is regulated by Rac1-GTP, which activates the complex, allowing CYFIP2 to facilitate actin polymerization through the Arp2/3 complex (Zweier2019Spatially). Additionally, CYFIP2 interacts with RNA-binding proteins, including Argonaute proteins, and is involved in stress granule formation. Mutations in CYFIP2, such as the R87C variant, can disrupt these interactions, leading to altered protein function and potential implications for neurological disorders (Lee2020Epilepsy; Biembengut2022Molecular). These interactions highlight CYFIP2's role in both cytoskeletal regulation and RNA metabolism, contributing to its involvement in neural development and function.
