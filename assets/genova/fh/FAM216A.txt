# FAM216A

## Overview
FAM216A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 216 member A. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not yet fully understood. FAM216A has been studied in the context of its genetic alterations, which have been implicated in certain diseases, including pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and schizophrenia. The gene is located on chromosome 12q24.11, and its alterations, such as gene fusions and copy number variations, have been associated with clinical outcomes in these conditions (Gao2022Optical; Chen2021Chromosomal). Further research is necessary to clarify the precise biological roles and mechanisms of the FAM216A protein in health and disease.

## Clinical Significance
The FAM216A gene has been implicated in various diseases through its involvement in genetic alterations. In pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the GPN3::FAM216A fusion gene has been identified and is associated with clinical characteristics such as age, white blood cell count, and the percentage of leukemic cells in peripheral blood at diagnosis. This fusion is significantly correlated with higher white blood cell counts, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression and clinical outcomes (Gao2022Optical).

In the context of schizophrenia, a study using chromosomal microarray analysis identified a likely pathogenic copy number variation (CNV) at 12q24.11, which includes the FAM216A gene. This CNV was a 188 kb microduplication found in a female patient, although the specific clinical significance of FAM216A in schizophrenia remains unclear. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the role of FAM216A and other genes within this CNV in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Chen2021Chromosomal).

These findings suggest that alterations in FAM216A, whether through gene fusions or CNVs, may contribute to the development and progression of certain diseases, although more research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance.
