# PID1

## Overview
PID1, or phosphotyrosine interaction domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to glucose metabolism and insulin signaling. The PID1 protein is characterized by the presence of a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which facilitates interactions with growth factor receptors and other proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways (Xu2013Molecular). This protein is predominantly expressed in adipose tissues and is implicated in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism, making it a significant factor in metabolic health (Chen2018PID1; Yin2019PID1). Additionally, PID1 has been associated with cancer, particularly brain tumors, where it may enhance chemotherapy sensitivity and influence patient survival (Xu2017PID1; ErdreichEpstein2014PID1). The dual role of PID1 in metabolic disorders and cancer underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in these conditions.

## Structure
The PID1 protein, encoded by the PID1 gene, is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 217 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 28.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.45 (Xu2013Molecular). The secondary structure of PID1 is predominantly composed of α-helices, along with some β-folds and random coils, contributing to its overall hydrophobic nature (Xu2013Molecular). 

A key feature of the PID1 protein is the presence of a phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is similar to pleckstrin homology (PH) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS1)-like PTB domains. This domain is predicted to have a 7-stranded beta-sandwich structure, with additional elements such as a short N-terminal helix and a large insertion forming a helix and loops (Xu2013Molecular). The PTB domain is involved in signal transduction by interacting with growth factor receptors (Xu2013Molecular).

The PID1 protein also contains various phosphorylation sites, including Ser154 and Ser165, which are important for its function and interactions (Monteleone2016Inhibition). These post-translational modifications play a role in the protein's involvement in cellular processes such as lipid metabolism and insulin resistance (Fischer2018The). The protein does not appear to have transmembrane domains, indicating it is not membrane-bound (Xu2013Molecular).

## Function
PID1 (phosphotyrosine interaction domain containing 1) is a cytosolic adaptor protein that plays a significant role in regulating glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, PID1 is involved in the intracellular sorting of GLUT4-storage vesicles, which are crucial for insulin-dependent glucose uptake. PID1 interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) to control the intracellular sorting and cell surface abundance of these vesicles. Under fasting conditions, PID1 retains GLUT4 in perinuclear compartments, but upon insulin stimulation, the PID1-LRP1 complex disintegrates, allowing GLUT4 to translocate to the plasma membrane and facilitate glucose uptake (Fischer2019PID1).

PID1 is highly expressed in adipose tissues, particularly in obese individuals, and negatively affects insulin sensitivity by impairing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Overexpression of PID1 in human adipocytes leads to a reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, indicating its role as a negative regulator of insulin sensitivity (Chen2018PID1). PID1 also influences lipid metabolism by modulating the AKT/PKA signaling pathway, which is crucial for the regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes (Yin2019PID1). These functions highlight PID1's role in maintaining glucose homeostasis and its potential impact on metabolic health.

## Clinical Significance
The PID1 gene, also known as NYGGF4, has been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancer and metabolic disorders. In the context of cancer, PID1 is associated with brain tumors such as medulloblastoma and glioblastoma. Studies have shown that higher levels of PID1 mRNA in these tumors correlate with longer patient survival, suggesting a tumor-inhibitory role. PID1 enhances the sensitivity of these tumors to chemotherapy by increasing apoptosis, particularly in response to drugs like cisplatin and etoposide. This effect involves the NFκB pathway and may be regulated by proteasomal degradation (Xu2017PID1; ErdreichEpstein2014PID1).

In metabolic disorders, PID1 is linked to obesity and insulin resistance. It regulates insulin-dependent glucose uptake by controlling the intracellular sorting of GLUT4-storage vesicles. Higher PID1 expression is observed in the adipose tissues of obese individuals, and its overexpression is associated with reduced glucose uptake and insulin resistance. Conversely, PID1-deficient models show improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes management (Fischer2019PID1; Chen2018PID1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PID1 in both cancer and metabolic diseases.

## Interactions
PID1, also known as phosphotyrosine interaction domain containing 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as glucose metabolism and insulin signaling. PID1 interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), a key player in lipid and glucose metabolism. This interaction occurs at the distal NPxY motif of LRP1's intracellular domain, with PID1 binding specifically to the non-phosphorylated form of this motif. This binding is crucial for the retention of LRP1 in endosomal compartments, affecting receptor-dependent endocytosis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (Fischer2018The).

In adipocytes, PID1 overexpression has been shown to impair glucose uptake and insulin signaling, similar to the effects observed with LRP1 depletion. This suggests that PID1 may compete with other proteins for binding to LRP1, thereby modulating its function (Chen2018PID1). PID1 also co-localizes with GLUT4, a glucose transporter, and its overexpression leads to decreased GLUT4 protein levels, indicating a potential role in regulating GLUT4 stability or translation (Chen2018PID1).

These interactions highlight PID1's role as a regulatory adaptor protein, influencing key metabolic pathways through its interactions with LRP1 and other proteins involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.
