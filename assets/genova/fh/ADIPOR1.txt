# ADIPOR1

## Overview
ADIPOR1 is a gene that encodes the adiponectin receptor 1, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including metabolic regulation and cellular signaling. The adiponectin receptor 1 is part of the PAQR family and is characterized by a unique seven-transmembrane domain structure, which distinguishes it from traditional G-protein-coupled receptors (Tanabe2015Crystal). This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as maintaining membrane fluidity by promoting the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into membrane phospholipids (Pilon2021Paradigm). ADIPOR1 is also implicated in the activation of key metabolic pathways, such as the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, which enhances insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis, particularly in skeletal muscle and liver cells (Tanabe2020Human; Iwabu2010Adiponectin). Additionally, ADIPOR1 has been linked to clinical conditions affecting vision and metabolic health, with mutations in the gene associated with retinal degeneration and metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes (Sluch2018ADIPOR1; Iwabu2019AdiponectinAdipoR).

## Structure
The human adiponectin receptor 1 (ADIPOR1) is a protein characterized by a seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain architecture, which is distinct from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) despite some structural similarities (Tanabe2015Crystal). The 7TM domain forms a large internal cavity that extends from the cytoplasmic surface to the middle of the outer lipid layer of the membrane (Tanabe2015Crystal). This cavity includes a zinc-binding site, coordinated by histidine residues, which contributes to the structural rigidity of the receptor (Tanabe2015Crystal).

ADIPOR1 can exist in both closed and open conformations. The closed form features a tightly bound structure with specific interactions between helices and loops, while the open form has larger openings in the internal cavity, allowing for increased mobility of certain regions (Tanabe2020Human). The transition between these forms involves significant shifts in helices IV and V (Tanabe2020Human).

The protein also exhibits intrinsic ceramidase activity, which is involved in the hydrolysis of ceramide to produce sphingosine and a free fatty acid (Vasiliauskaité-Brooks2017Structural). This enzymatic function is suggested to be linked to the receptor's structural features, including the zinc catalytic site (Vasiliauskaité-Brooks2017Structural).

## Function
ADIPOR1 encodes the adiponectin receptor 1, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell membrane composition and maintaining membrane fluidity. This protein is part of the PAQR family and acts as a sensor of membrane fluidity, promoting fatty acid desaturation and the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into membrane phospholipids to restore fluidity when membranes become rigid (Pilon2021Paradigm). ADIPOR1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and insulin sensitivity in muscle cells, mediated by the activation of AMPK and SIRT1 pathways, which are essential for energy metabolism and enhancing insulin sensitivity (Iwabu2010Adiponectin).

In addition to its role in membrane fluidity, ADIPOR1 is involved in activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways, which are significant for regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress (Tanabe2020Human). The receptor is primarily active in skeletal muscle and liver cells, where it enhances insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis (Keshvari page 5 of 24). ADIPOR1 also contributes to the regulation of desaturase expression, which is crucial for maintaining high levels of unsaturated fatty acids in membrane phospholipids, thereby preventing membrane rigidification and lipotoxicity (Ruiz2019AdipoR1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADIPOR1 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly those affecting vision and metabolic health. In the context of vision, ADIPOR1 is crucial for maintaining retinal health. Mutations in ADIPOR1 can lead to retinal degeneration, characterized by the depletion of rhodopsin and other visual system proteins, resulting in conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration (Sluch2018ADIPOR1; Gogna2022Genetic). The loss of ADIPOR1 expression in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is associated with retinal degeneration in mouse models, suggesting a similar impact in humans (Sluch2018ADIPOR1).

In metabolic health, ADIPOR1 is involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Alterations in its expression are associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The gene's expression is decreased in obesity and type 2 diabetes models, contributing to the onset of these conditions (Iwabu2019AdiponectinAdipoR). Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in ADIPOR1 have been linked to increased risks of metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases (Saleh2016Impacts). These genetic variations can lead to structural and functional changes in the ADIPOR1 protein, potentially destabilizing its function and contributing to disease (Saleh2016Impacts).

## Interactions
ADIPOR1, the adiponectin receptor 1, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in adiponectin signaling. It specifically interacts with ERp46, a thioredoxin-like protein, through the cytoplasmic N-terminal residues (1-70) of AdipoR1. This interaction is unique to AdipoR1 and does not occur with AdipoR2, suggesting a specific role in modulating adiponectin signaling pathways (Charlton2010ERp46).

AdipoR1 also forms homodimers, a process influenced by a GxxxG motif in its fifth transmembrane domain. This dimerization is inhibited by adiponectin, which affects the receptor's quaternary structure and signaling capabilities (Kosel2010Dimerization).

The receptor interacts with protein kinase CK2, specifically its β subunit, which plays a role in adiponectin signaling. This interaction occurs at the N-terminus of AdipoR1 and is involved in processes like ACC phosphorylation, highlighting CK2's role in metabolic signaling pathways (Heiker2009Protein).

RACK1 is another binding partner of AdipoR1, identified through yeast two-hybrid screening. This interaction is enhanced by adiponectin and is crucial for adiponectin-stimulated glucose uptake, indicating RACK1's significant role in the receptor's signaling transduction (Xu2009Receptor).
