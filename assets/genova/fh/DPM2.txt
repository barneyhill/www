# DPM2

## Overview
The DPM2 gene encodes the dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase subunit 2, a regulatory protein that is integral to the function of the dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM) synthase complex. This complex is crucial for glycosylation processes, which are essential for the proper posttranslational modification of proteins and lipids. The DPM2 protein is a hydrophobic component located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it plays a pivotal role in stabilizing the DPM3 protein and regulating the activity of the DPM synthase complex. It also influences the biosynthesis of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors by modulating the activity of GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) (Zhao2023Identification; Lefeber2009Deficiency). Mutations in the DPM2 gene are linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) and dystroglycanopathies, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and organismal health (Zhao2023Identification; BouchetSéraphin2015Dystroglycanopathies:).

## Function
The DPM2 gene encodes a subunit of the dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM) synthase complex, which is essential for glycosylation processes in human cells. Glycosylation is a critical cellular process involved in the posttranslational modification of proteins and lipids, influencing cell-cell interactions, protein folding, and signaling. DPM synthase catalyzes the formation of dolichol-phosphate-mannose (DPM), a key component in N-glycosylation, C-mannosylation, O-mannosylation, and the formation of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors (Zhao2023Identification).

DPM2 is a hydrophobic protein that stabilizes the DPM3 protein, ensuring the proper activity of the DPM enzyme complex. It is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and plays a regulatory role in GPI-anchor biosynthesis by influencing GPI-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GPI-GnT) activity (Lefeber2009Deficiency). The DPM2 protein does not alter its subcellular localization in the presence of certain variants, indicating its stable role in the ER (Zhao2023Identification).

Mutations in the DPM2 gene can lead to congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), which affect various systems in the body, including the nervous system, liver, heart, muscles, eyes, and immune system, underscoring its importance in normal cellular and organismal function (Zhao2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPM2 gene are associated with congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically DPM2-CDG, which is characterized by a range of clinical symptoms. These can include mild intellectual impairment, developmental delay, hypotonia, and increased serum creatine kinase levels, as observed in two Chinese siblings with a novel homozygous mutation c.197G>A (p.Gly66Glu) in the DPM2 gene (Zhao2023Identification). Other reported cases of DPM2-CDG have shown more severe symptoms such as progressive microcephaly, severe visual defects, intractable epilepsy, muscle damage, and liver involvement (Zhao2023Identification).

DPM2 mutations are also linked to dystroglycanopathies, a group of disorders resulting from abnormal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. These disorders can manifest as muscular dystrophy with varying severity, ranging from limb-girdle muscular dystrophy to congenital muscular dystrophies with brain and eye anomalies (BouchetSéraphin2015Dystroglycanopathies:; Song2021Genetic). The clinical presentations of DPM2-related conditions are highly variable, suggesting complex regulation of the metabolic pathways involved (BouchetSéraphin2015Dystroglycanopathies:).

## Interactions
DPM2 is a regulatory subunit of the dolichyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase complex, which plays a crucial role in glycosylation processes. In humans, DPM2 is part of the dolichyl phosphate mannose (DPM) synthase complex, which also includes DPM1 and DPM3. DPM2 is essential for the regulation of the DPM synthase activity and is associated with the DPM3 subunit via its N-terminus. However, it does not interact directly with the catalytic subunit DPM1 (Piłsyk2020Yil102cA). DPM2 also enhances the activity of glucosylphosphatidylinositol-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (GPI-GnT), a complex glucosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of GPI anchors for cell-surface proteins. GPI-GnT is composed of seven subunits, including DPM2, indicating its involvement in the coregulation of the DPM synthase and the GPI-GnT complex (Piłsyk2020Yil102cA).

In the context of glycosylation disorders, DPM2's role is highlighted in the regulation of GPI-anchor biosynthesis, although specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available studies (Lefeber2009Deficiency). The regulatory function of DPM2 in these complexes underscores its importance in maintaining proper glycosylation pathways.
