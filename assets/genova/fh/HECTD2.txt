# HECTD2

## Overview
HECTD2 is a gene that encodes the HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, a crucial enzyme in the ubiquitination pathway. This enzyme is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays a pivotal role in tagging proteins for degradation by the proteasome, thereby regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The HECTD2 protein is involved in modulating immune responses by targeting specific proteins, such as PIAS1, for degradation, which in turn influences NF-κB signaling and promotes proinflammatory responses (Singh2021Exploring; Coon2015The). The gene's activity is essential for balancing proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, highlighting its significance in immune function and cellular regulation (Coon2015The). Additionally, HECTD2 has been implicated in various diseases, including prion diseases and cancer, due to its role in protein ubiquitination and immune modulation (Lloyd2009HECTD2a; Ottina2021E3).

## Function
HECTD2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the ubiquitination process, which tags proteins for degradation by the proteasome, thus regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, HECTD2 plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by targeting specific proteins for degradation. It interacts with PIAS1, an anti-inflammatory protein, leading to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This process enhances NF-κB signaling, a key pathway in inflammation, thereby promoting proinflammatory responses (Singh2021Exploring; Coon2015The).

HECTD2's activity is dependent on the phosphorylation of PIAS1 by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which facilitates the binding of PIAS1 to HECTD2. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of PIAS1, highlighting HECTD2's role in regulating the stability and activity of proteins involved in immune signaling (Coon2015The).

HECTD2 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in protein quality control and signal transduction. Its function in healthy cells is essential for maintaining the balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals, which is vital for proper immune function and cellular homeostasis (Coon2015The).

## Clinical Significance
The HECTD2 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in protein ubiquitination. Alterations in HECTD2 expression or genetic variations have been associated with susceptibility to prion diseases, such as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and kuru. In particular, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs12249854, located in an intron of HECTD2, is significantly over-represented in vCJD patients, suggesting an increased risk of developing the disease (Lloyd2009HECTD2a). In Papua New Guinea, a different haplotype associated with kuru indicates potential population-specific functional polymorphisms (Lloyd2009HECTD2a).

HECTD2 is also involved in inflammatory processes. It targets the anti-inflammatory protein PIAS1 for degradation, leading to increased NF-κB signaling and proinflammatory responses. This mechanism suggests that HECTD2 could be a therapeutic target in conditions characterized by excessive inflammation, such as pneumonia and lung injury (Coon2015The).

In cancer, particularly melanoma, HECTD2 expression promotes cell proliferation and immune evasion. It is linked to poor responses to PD-1 blockade therapy, indicating its role in immune suppression and tumor progression (Ottina2021E3). These findings highlight the gene's potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in various diseases.

## Interactions
HECTD2, a human E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence inflammatory responses and cellular processes. It interacts with PIAS1, an anti-inflammatory protein, by ubiquitinating and degrading it, which enhances NF-κB signaling and promotes inflammation. This interaction is dependent on the phosphorylation of PIAS1 by GSK3β, which targets PIAS1 for HECTD2-mediated degradation (Singh2021Exploring; Coon2015The).

HECTD2 also contains a naturally occurring polymorphism at A19, which affects its localization and function. The wild-type HECTD2 can polyubiquitinate PIAS1 and decrease its protein levels, whereas the A19P variant fails to do so due to mislocalization to the cytosol, preventing interaction with PIAS1 in the nucleus (Coon2015The).

In renal cell carcinoma, HECTD2 upregulates the expression of TNFAIP1, which is involved in promoting an inflammatory response through the p38/JNK signaling pathway. This regulation is associated with the ubiquitination of EHMT2, a histone methyltransferase, suggesting a role for HECTD2 in modulating gene expression through histone modification (LV2024HECTD2/TNFAIP1).
