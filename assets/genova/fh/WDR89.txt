# WDR89

## Overview
WDR89 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 89 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that WD repeat domain 89 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. Although the specific biological functions of the WD repeat domain 89 protein are not fully elucidated, its involvement in critical pathways and disease contexts has been noted. The gene has been associated with the severity of COVID-19 and pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, indicating its potential significance in disease progression and immune response (Garg2024Canadian; Yuan2021A; Narang2024Clonal).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The WDR89 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through its altered expression or mutations. In the context of COVID-19, a study involving the whole genome sequencing of Canadians infected with SARS-CoV-2 identified a novel significant association between WDR89 and the severity of the disease. This suggests that alterations in the WDR89 gene may contribute to severe COVID-19 cases, highlighting its potential role in the disease's progression (Garg2024Canadian).

In pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), a novel fusion transcript involving WDR89, specifically MBTD1::WDR89, was identified in a relapse sample. This fusion transcript suggests a potential role in the disease progression or relapse of B-ALL, although the specific implications of WDR89 alterations in this context are not fully detailed (Narang2024Clonal).

Additionally, a study on adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) developed a WDR89-based nomogram model to predict immune classification, aiding in treatment decision-making. This model underscores the potential clinical significance of WDR89 in predicting immunotherapy responsiveness in ACP patients (Yuan2021A).
