# SCN9A

## Overview
The SCN9A gene encodes the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 9, commonly referred to as Nav1.7, which is a critical component of the voltage-gated sodium channel family. This transmembrane protein is predominantly expressed in nociceptive neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia, where it plays a pivotal role in the initiation and propagation of action potentials, particularly in the context of pain perception (Diss2008Identification). Nav1.7 is essential for amplifying small depolarizations to generate threshold currents, thereby facilitating the transmission of pain signals. Beyond its role in pain pathways, Nav1.7 is also expressed in pancreatic β-cells and aortic smooth muscle cells, contributing to sodium current regulation and potentially influencing cell migration (Zhang2014Na+; Meguro2009Function). The gene's regulation is complex, involving interactions with various proteins that affect its trafficking and function, highlighting its significance as a therapeutic target for pain management (Kanellopoulos2018Mapping; Zhou2023Uncovering).

## Structure


## Function
The SCN9A gene encodes the Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium channel, which is crucial for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons, particularly in nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and sympathetic ganglia. Nav1.7 plays a key role in amplifying small depolarizations to generate 'threshold currents' close to the resting potential, which is essential for the sensation of pain (Diss2008Identification). In healthy human cells, Nav1.7 is involved in the normal functioning of pain pathways, as it is responsible for the transmission of pain signals. Proper function of this channel is necessary for normal pain perception, and its expression is tightly regulated (Diss2008Identification).

Nav1.7 is also expressed in pancreatic β-cells, where it contributes to a substantial portion of the Na+ current, although its role in hormone secretion is limited (Zhang2014Na+). In aortic smooth muscle cells, Nav1.7 is involved in sodium current regulation and may play a role in cell migration processes (Meguro2009Function). The SCN9A gene's regulation involves a natural antisense transcript (NAT) that can downregulate Nav1.7 mRNA and protein levels, potentially influencing pain thresholds (Koenig2015Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCN9A gene, which encodes the Na v 1.7 sodium channel, are linked to several pain-related disorders. Gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A are associated with conditions such as inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD). IEM is characterized by episodic burning sensations in the extremities, while PEPD involves severe pain in proximal body regions. These mutations lead to increased neuronal excitability by altering the channel's activation and inactivation properties (Emery2015NovelSCN9AMutations; DibHajj2012The).

Conversely, loss-of-function mutations in SCN9A result in congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), where individuals cannot feel pain. These mutations often lead to truncated, nonfunctional Na v 1.7 channels, resulting in a complete lack of pain sensation (Goldberg2007Loss‐of‐function; Drenth2007Mutations). Some individuals with partial CIP have compound heterozygous mutations, indicating partial channel functionality (Staudl2011Two).

SCN9A mutations have also been implicated in certain epilepsies, suggesting that altered Na v 1.7 function can affect brain excitability, although the exact role in epilepsy remains unclear (Singh2009A). The gene's expression in sensory neurons and its involvement in pain signaling underscore its clinical significance (DibHajj2012The).

## Interactions
The SCN9A gene encodes the sodium channel Nav1.7, which is involved in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its function. Nav1.7 interacts with several proteins that influence its trafficking, localization, and function. Notable interactors include KIF11, CCT5, and TMED10, which have been validated for their roles in regulating Nav1.7 current density (Zhou2023Uncovering). TMED10 is involved in protein trafficking, suggesting it may regulate Nav1.7 trafficking (Kanellopoulos2018Mapping). 

The channel also interacts with synaptotagmin-2 (Syt2), which suggests a role in neurotransmitter release, and L-type amino acid transporter 1 (Lat1), indicating potential involvement in channel regulation (Kanellopoulos2018Mapping). Gprin1, an opioid receptor-binding protein, associates with Nav1.7, linking it to opioid signaling pathways (Kanellopoulos2018Mapping). 

Nav1.7's interaction with collapsing-response mediator protein 2 (Crmp2) is significant for its regulation by the analgesic drug lacosamide, affecting sodium current density (Kanellopoulos2018Mapping). The channel also forms complexes with the sodium channel β3 subunit, which influences its glycosylation and membrane expression (Chew2019Mining). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms of Nav1.7 and its potential as a therapeutic target for pain management.
