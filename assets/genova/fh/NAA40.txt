# NAA40

## Overview
NAA40 is a gene that encodes the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 40, NatD catalytic subunit, a specialized enzyme involved in the N-terminal acetylation of histones, specifically histones H2A and H4. This acetyltransferase is unique due to its monomeric structure and specificity for the N-terminal sequences of its histone substrates, distinguishing it from other N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) (Jonckheere2021NTerminal). The protein plays a critical role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, impacting cellular processes such as metabolism and cancer progression. NAA40's activity is linked to metabolic regulation by modulating acetyl-CoA levels, and it has been implicated in colorectal cancer, where it influences oncogene expression and chemoresistance (Demetriadou2019NAA40; Charidemou2022Histone). As a result, NAA40 is considered a potential therapeutic target for improving cancer treatment outcomes (Demetriadou2021Histone).

## Structure
The NAA40 protein, also known as NatD, is a highly selective N-terminal acetyltransferase that primarily targets the N-termini of histones H2A and H4. It is unique among N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) due to its monomeric nature, not requiring auxiliary subunits for ribosome binding (Jonckheere2021NTerminal). Structurally, NAA40 features a mixed α/β GCN5-like fold, which is common among NATs, but it possesses a unique substrate binding pocket that extends specificity beyond the second amino acid residue of its substrates. This pocket is specifically tailored to accommodate the Ser-Gly-Arg-Gly-starting N-termini of histones H4 and H2A in humans (Jonckheere2021NTerminal).

The protein includes a distinctive N-terminal segment that forms an extra helix-loop-strand secondary structural element, crucial for substrate binding and maintaining the stability of its catalytic core (Jonckheere2021NTerminal). NAA40 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as N-terminal myristoylation, which involves the addition of a 14-carbon fatty acid to the N-terminal glycine residue, catalyzed by N-myristoyltransferases (Jonckheere2021NTerminal). The human NAA40 gene produces two isoforms, hNaa40 L and hNaa40 S, through alternative splicing and translation initiation, with hNaa40 L being primarily nuclear and hNaa40 S being cytoplasmic (Jonckheere2021NTerminal).

## Function
The NAA40 gene encodes the N-alpha-acetyltransferase 40 (hNaa40p), an enzyme responsible for the N-terminal acetylation of histones H2A and H4. This acetylation is a post-translational modification crucial for chromatin structure and gene regulation. hNaa40p specifically acetylates the N-terminal amino group of these histones, distinguishing it from lysine acetyltransferases that target lysine residues (Hole2011The). The enzyme is associated with ribosomes, indicating a role in co-translational acetylation, and is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting functions in both compartments (Hole2011The).

In addition to its role in histone modification, NAA40 influences cellular metabolism by modulating acetyl-CoA levels, a key metabolic intermediate. Its activity affects lipid synthesis and insulin signaling, with knockdown studies showing increased acetyl-CoA levels and lipid droplet formation, which impair insulin signaling (Charidemou2022Histone). This suggests a link between NAA40's epigenetic functions and metabolic regulation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Charidemou2022Histone).

## Clinical Significance
NAA40 has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC) due to its role in histone acetylation, which affects gene expression and cancer cell metabolism. Elevated expression of NAA40 is frequently observed in CRC tissues compared to non-malignant specimens, suggesting its involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis (Demetriadou2019NAA40). NAA40 promotes CRC cell proliferation and survival by upregulating protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which influences the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (Demetriadou2019NAA40).

NAA40 also contributes to chemoresistance in CRC, particularly against the chemotherapeutic agent 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU). It regulates one-carbon metabolism and the expression of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), a key enzyme targeted by 5-FU. High NAA40 activity is associated with increased TYMS expression and reduced sensitivity to 5-FU, leading to treatment resistance (Demetriadou2021Histone). NAA40's acetyltransferase activity is crucial for maintaining histone methylation levels and CRC cell survival, linking it to chemoresistance mechanisms (Demetriadou2021Histone).

These findings suggest that NAA40 plays an oncogenic role in CRC and could be a potential therapeutic target to improve treatment efficacy and overcome chemoresistance (Demetriadou2019NAA40; Demetriadou2021Histone).

## Interactions
NAA40, also known as N-alpha-acetyltransferase 40, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in acetylating histones H2A and H4. The human ortholog, hNaa40p, has been shown to interact specifically with histone H4 and macro-H2A.1, as well as transcription factors BTF3 and BTF3L4. These interactions are significantly enriched in the hNaa40 L proteoform setup, suggesting a role in nuclear processes such as ribosome biogenesis and RNA-dependent ATPase activity (Jonckheere2021NTerminal; Jonckheere2021Big).

NAA40 also interacts with N-myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT1), which is implicated in its nuclear import and myristoylation, a modification important for protein localization and nuclear transport (Jonckheere2021NTerminal). The interaction with NMT1 is particularly significant for the hNaa40 L proteoform, which is associated with nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis (Jonckheere2021NTerminal).

In colorectal cancer cells, NAA40 has been shown to interact with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), influencing histone modifications and gene expression. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, highlighting NAA40's role in cancer cell growth and survival (Demetriadou2019NAA40).
