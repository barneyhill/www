# SERPINE2

## Overview
SERPINE2 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family E member 2, also known as protease nexin-1 (PN-1), which is a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily. This protein plays a critical role in regulating proteolytic activity by inhibiting serine proteases such as thrombin, trypsin, and plasminogen activators. It is primarily located in the extracellular matrix and platelets, rather than circulating in the blood, and is involved in various physiological processes including tissue repair, neuronal differentiation, and reproductive functions (Wu2024Serpin; Lee2011SERPINE2). SERPINE2's interactions with multiple signaling pathways and proteins underscore its significance in cancer progression, tissue remodeling, and potential therapeutic applications (Wu2024Serpin; Li2023Proteomewide).

## Structure
Serpin E2, also known as protease nexin-1 (PN-1), is a member of the serine protease inhibitor superfamily. The protein has a molecular weight ranging from 45 to 50 kDa and is encoded by a gene located on human chromosome 2q99-q35 (Wu2024Serpin). The primary structure of Serpin E2 consists of approximately 380 amino acid residues, which fold into a single domain (Gettins2016Inhibitory).

The secondary structure of Serpin E2 includes three β-sheets (A, B, C) and nine α-helices (hA-hI) (Wu2024Serpin). A critical feature of its structure is the reactive center loop (RCL), which is essential for its inhibitory function. The RCL is mobile and can freely enter and exit the Aβ folding conformation, allowing Serpin E2 to mediate irreversible inhibition (Gettins2016Inhibitory; Wu2024Serpin).

Serpin E2 follows the classical folding structure of the serpin family, which involves a metastable conformation that is crucial for its function as a proteinase inhibitor (Gettins2016Inhibitory). Unlike other serpins, Serpin E2 is not synthesized in the liver and does not circulate in the blood, being primarily found in the extracellular matrix and platelets (Wu2024Serpin). The helix direction in Serpin E2 is distinct from other serpins, potentially contributing to its unique functions (Wu2024Serpin).

## Function
SERPINE2, also known as protease nexin-1, is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes by modulating proteolytic activity. It primarily functions as an inhibitor of serine proteases, including thrombin, trypsin, and plasminogen activators such as urokinase-plasminogen activator (uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (Chern2011Spatiotemporal; Wu2024Serpin). This inhibition is vital for regulating extracellular matrix remodeling, which is essential for tissue repair and development (Lee2011SERPINE2).

In the nervous system, SERPINE2 is involved in neuronal differentiation and maturation, as well as in the repair of myelinated nerve fiber axonal injury (Wu2024Serpin). It also interacts with the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, inhibiting SHH-induced proliferation of cerebellar granular neuron precursors, which is important for cerebellar development (Wu2024Serpin).

In reproductive tissues, SERPINE2 is expressed in the placenta and uterus, where it influences processes such as oocyte maturation and embryo implantation by regulating extracellular matrix degradation and fibrinolysis (Wu2024Serpin). It is highly expressed in the human endometrium during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting a role in tissue remodeling necessary for implantation (Lee2011SERPINE2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SERPINE2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer, SERPINE2 is overexpressed in cells transformed by activated MEK1, oncogenic RAS, and BRAF, which are associated with abnormal ERK signaling. This overexpression contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting anchorage-independent growth, migration, and tumorigenicity of colorectal cancer cells (Bergeron2010The). In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), high SERPINE2 expression is linked to poor survival outcomes and is associated with metastasis. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cell migration and invasion, and is considered a potential therapeutic target for RCC metastasis (Chen2023Singlecell).

SERPINE2 also plays a role in the prognosis of various cancers. It acts as a protective factor in skin cutaneous melanoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, and lower-grade glioma, but is considered detrimental in mesothelioma, bladder cancer, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney chromophobe, and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (Liu2024Pancancer). Additionally, polymorphisms in the SERPINE2 gene have been associated with pulmonary emphysema, suggesting a link to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Fujimoto2010Polymorphism).

## Interactions
SERPINE2, also known as protease nexin-1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and pathways that influence cancer progression and other physiological processes. In breast cancer, SERPINE2 forms a complex with urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), which is decomposed by lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1), leading to the activation of the ERK pathway and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), both crucial for metastasis (Yang2018Expression; Wu2024Serpin). In hepatocellular carcinoma, SERPINE2 binds to BAP31, affecting the ERK1/2 and p38 pathways (Wu2024Serpin).

In non-small cell lung cancer, SERPINE2 is involved in DNA damage repair pathways, contributing to radioresistance (Wu2024Serpin). It also interacts with the Hedgehog signaling pathway in prostate cancer, where it inhibits angiogenesis (Wu2024Serpin). In osteoarthritis, SERPINE2 interacts with MMP13, inhibiting its activity and the downstream transcription factor NF-κB, potentially reducing cartilage degradation (Wu2024Serpin).

SERPINE2 is also part of a protein module involved in venous thromboembolism, interacting with proteins such as F2, F5, and F11, and is involved in complement and coagulation cascades (Li2023Proteomewide). These interactions highlight SERPINE2's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
