# OR11H2

## Overview
The OR11H2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 11 subfamily H member 2, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction. The OR11H2 protein is primarily involved in the detection of odorant molecules, contributing to the sense of smell by initiating a cascade of cellular responses upon binding specific ligands. Beyond its olfactory functions, OR11H2 is expressed in non-olfactory tissues, where it may play roles in various physiological processes, including cell proliferation and migration. The gene's expression and mutations have been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, highlighting its potential significance in both sensory and non-sensory biological pathways (Chen2016Expression; Alhazmi2024Copy; Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

## Structure
The OR11H2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of GPCRs. The primary structure of OR11H2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its function as an olfactory receptor. The secondary structure includes alpha helices, which are common in the transmembrane regions of GPCRs. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, allowing the receptor to interact with odorant molecules effectively. 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs and may occur in OR11H2, influencing its stability and function. These modifications can affect the receptor's localization, ligand binding, and signal transduction capabilities. The OR11H2 protein functions as a monomer, and thus, quaternary structure is generally not applicable. The specific molecular structure of OR11H2, including any unique domains or prominent folds, is not detailed in the available literature, but it shares common features with other olfactory receptors in the GPCR family (Chen2016Expression; Yang2024Neuroimaging).

## Function
OR11H2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR11H2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection (PietraszewskaBogiel2019Seeing).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR11H2 and other olfactory receptors are expressed in non-olfactory tissues, including the skin. In the skin, these receptors are involved in various biological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and cytokine production (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The downregulation of OR11H2 in sensitive skin suggests a potential role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis, although it remains unclear whether this downregulation is a cause or consequence of skin sensitivity (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

In the context of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), OR11H2 has been found to be upregulated, indicating a possible involvement in the differential expression of olfactory functions in PTSD cases compared to controls (Chen2016Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The OR11H2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in several conditions through alterations in its expression and mutations. In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), copy number variations (CNVs) in the chromosomal region 14q11.1-q11.2, where OR11H2 is located, have been associated with seizures, motor and cognitive delays, speech impairment, and autistic traits. These CNVs may contribute to the developmental and neurological issues observed in ASD (Alhazmi2024Copy).

In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), OR11H2 is one of the upregulated odorant receptor genes, with a significant fold-change in expression. This suggests a potential role in the pathology of PTSD, although the specific mechanisms remain unclear (Chen2016Expression).

In cervical cancer, OR11H2 has been identified as a significantly mutated driver gene. However, its exact role in tumor progression is not well understood, and further research is needed to clarify its involvement (Niyazi2023Analysis).

Overall, while OR11H2 is associated with various conditions, the precise clinical significance of its mutations or expression changes requires further investigation.
