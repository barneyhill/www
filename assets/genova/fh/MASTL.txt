# MASTL

## Overview
MASTL, or microtubule associated serine/threonine kinase-like, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase known as Greatwall kinase. This protein plays a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis, by modulating the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) through its interactions with regulatory proteins such as endosulfine (Ensa) and Arpp19. The inhibition of PP2A by MASTL is crucial for proper chromosome condensation and segregation, ensuring accurate mitotic progression and genomic stability (Cao2019Inflammatory; Hurtado2018Thrombocytopeniaassociated). MASTL's kinase activity is regulated through post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is essential for its function during cell division (Hermida2020Molecular). Beyond its role in normal cellular processes, MASTL is implicated in cancer progression, with its overexpression linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Vera2015Greatwall; ÁlvarezFernández2017Therapeutic).

## Structure
The MASTL protein, also known as Greatwall kinase, is characterized by a unique kinase domain architecture. It features a classical 'two-lobe' protein kinase domain fold, with a distinct non-conserved middle region (NCMR) that is approximately 500-550 amino acids long and located between the DFG and APE motifs (Ocasio2016A; Hermida2020Molecular). This NCMR is less conserved and is predicted to be unstructured, playing a crucial role in target discrimination and regulation of kinase activity (Hermida2020Molecular).

The kinase domain of MASTL includes an N-lobe and a C-lobe, with the N-lobe being unusually dynamic and the C-lobe showing more stability (Hermida2020Molecular). The C-terminal extension of the kinase domain contains motifs such as the C-lobe anchor (CLA) and C-lobe tether (CLT), which are essential for kinase activity through hydrophobic interactions (Ocasio2016A).

MASTL undergoes post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, which is critical for its activation and function during mitosis. Specific phosphorylation sites, such as T194 and T741, are important for its regulatory activity (Hermida2020Molecular). The protein can phosphorylate multiple substrates, including Arpp19 and ENSA, which are involved in mitotic control (Hermida2020Molecular).

## Function
MASTL, also known as microtubule associated serine/threonine kinase-like, is a crucial protein kinase involved in regulating mitosis in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in ensuring accurate chromosome condensation and mitotic progression by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). This inhibition prevents the dephosphorylation of cyclin B1-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 substrates, which is essential for facilitating mitotic exit (Cao2019Inflammatory). MASTL interacts with Alpha-endosulfine (Ensa) and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 19 (Arpp19) to inhibit PP2A, thereby ensuring proper cell cycle progression (Cao2019Inflammatory).

In healthy cells, MASTL's function is primarily associated with maintaining normal mitotic processes, similar to its role in Drosophila, as demonstrated in HeLa and U2OS cell lines (Cao2019Inflammatory). MASTL is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation and maintaining genomic stability. Its activity is vital for proper chromosome segregation and mitotic progression, contributing to the overall genomic integrity of the organism (Cao2019Inflammatory).

## Clinical Significance
MASTL, also known as Greatwall kinase, plays a significant role in cancer progression due to its involvement in cell cycle regulation and oncogenic signaling pathways. Overexpression of MASTL is frequently observed in various cancers, including breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumorigenic potential (Vera2015Greatwall; ÁlvarezFernández2017Therapeutic). In breast cancer, high levels of MASTL correlate with poor disease outcomes, particularly in hormone-positive tumors, and are linked to a higher risk of relapse (ÁlvarezFernández2017Therapeutic). MASTL overexpression leads to hyperactivation of the AKT pathway, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, which are key processes in cancer metastasis (Vera2015Greatwall).

Mutations in MASTL have been identified in various cancers, with common mutations including frameshifts and missense mutations, although these often do not affect its kinase activity (Vera2015Greatwall). MASTL's role in cancer is further supported by its ability to inactivate PP2A-B55 complexes, major tumor suppressors, thereby enhancing oncogenic signaling (ÁlvarezFernández2017Therapeutic). Given its significant impact on cancer progression, MASTL is considered a potential therapeutic target, with strategies focusing on reactivating PP2A to counteract its oncogenic effects (ÁlvarezFernández2017Therapeutic).

## Interactions
The MASTL gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. MASTL interacts with several proteins, including those in the Greatwall kinase pathway, such as endosulfine (Ensa) and Arpp19. These interactions are essential for inhibiting the PP2A-B55 phosphatase complex, which is critical for proper chromosome condensation and segregation during cell division (Hurtado2018Thrombocytopeniaassociated).

The E166D mutation in MASTL, analogous to the E167D mutation in humans, is associated with thrombocytopenia and affects actin cytoskeletal dynamics in platelets. This mutation leads to increased phosphorylation of proline-directed sequences, which are typically dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 phosphatases, indicating a potential interaction between MASTL and PP2A in regulating platelet function (Hurtado2018Thrombocytopeniaassociated).

MASTL also interacts with integrin αIIbβ3, playing a role in outside-in signaling and actin reorganization in platelets. This interaction is significant for platelet function, as it affects the phosphorylation of downstream targets like Vasp, which is crucial for platelet spreading (Hurtado2018Thrombocytopeniaassociated). These interactions highlight MASTL's role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and platelet activation.
