# GAGE10

## Overview
GAGE10 is a gene that encodes the G antigen 10 protein, which is part of the GAGE family of cancer/testis antigens. These proteins are typically expressed in a restricted manner, predominantly in the testis and various cancer cells, making them of particular interest in oncology and immunotherapy research. The G antigen 10 protein is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen, which is a class of proteins that are often used as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and as targets for cancer vaccines due to their limited expression in normal tissues outside of the testis (Seager2024Cancer). The gene's expression has been linked to several diseases, including autoimmune conditions and cancers, and it plays a role in epigenetic changes associated with aging (Chang2014Accounting; McCartney2019An).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
GAGE10, a member of the GAGE family of cancer/testis antigens, is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels. In autoimmune diseases, GAGE10 has been identified as a significant gene in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for vitiligo, showing notable associations across different datasets (Chang2014Accounting). Its expression is also relevant in the context of cancer, particularly in lung cancer, where it is part of the cancer testis antigen burden (CTAB), a novel biomarker for tumor-associated antigens. Although GAGE10 shows relatively independent expression with a mean Spearman correlation of 0.02 with other cancer testis antigens, it is still considered part of a group of CTAs with significant co-expression patterns (Seager2024Cancer).

In the realm of epigenetics, GAGE10 is associated with sex-specific chronological aging. An epigenome-wide association study identified a CpG site related to GAGE10 that exhibits the greatest aging-associated difference between males and females, with hypomethylation observed in females as they age (McCartney2019An). Despite these findings, the specific role of GAGE10 mutations or expression changes in direct disease causation remains less clear, as the context does not provide detailed information on such associations.
