# MET

## Overview
The MET gene encodes the MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling. This receptor tyrosine kinase is activated by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and is involved in critical cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and survival. The MET protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes a semaphorin domain, PSI domain, IPT repeats, and a tyrosine kinase domain, which are essential for its function and interaction with other proteins (Baldanzi2014Physiological; Miller2001Structural). MET's activity is tightly regulated, and its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, making it a significant focus of oncological research and therapeutic targeting (Guo2020METdependent; Moosavi2019HGFMET).

## Structure
The MET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in cellular processes. The primary structure of the MET protein consists of a single polypeptide chain with 1390 amino acids, although alternative splicing can produce a variant with 1408 amino acids (Baldanzi2014Physiological; Duh1997Gene). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its functional conformation.

The tertiary structure of MET forms a three-dimensional conformation with specific domains, including a semaphorin (Sema) domain, PSI domain, and IPT repeats. These domains are crucial for ligand binding and receptor activation (Baldanzi2014Physiological). The MET protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are essential for its activation and function (Baldanzi2014Physiological).

In terms of quaternary structure, MET dimerizes upon ligand binding, which is necessary for its activation and subsequent signaling pathways (Miller2001Structural). The MET receptor also contains a tyrosine kinase domain, which shares homology with other kinases like the insulin receptor and FGFR1, and is involved in signal transduction (Miller2001Structural). The protein's structure includes a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic intracellular domain, which contains the kinase domain (Park1987Sequence).

## Function
The MET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase known as Met, which is activated by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). In healthy human cells, Met plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including proliferation, migration, and survival. Upon HGF binding, Met undergoes autophosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, creating docking sites for signaling molecules and initiating multiple signal transduction pathways. Key pathways activated by Met include the Grb2-Ras-MAPK cascade, the PI3K pathway, and the STAT pathway, which are involved in cellular processes such as proliferation, motility, morphogenesis, and survival (Gentile2008The).

Met is essential during embryogenesis for processes like gastrulation, epithelial morphogenesis, and angiogenesis. It also plays a significant role in adult tissue regeneration, such as liver regeneration and skin wound healing, by promoting keratinocyte proliferation and migration (Gentile2008The; Xu2011Receptortype). The receptor's activity is regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases, such as receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTP-β), which dephosphorylates Met at tyrosine 1356, modulating its function and maintaining normal cellular functions (Xu2011Receptortype). This regulation is crucial for preventing aberrant signaling that could lead to diseases such as cancer.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MET proto-oncogene are implicated in various cancers. MET gene amplification and exon 14 skipping mutations are significant in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), leading to poor prognosis and resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) (Moosavi2019HGFMET). MET amplification results in protein overexpression and constitutive activation, contributing to cancer progression in NSCLC, breast, gastric, and renal cancers (Moosavi2019HGFMET). 

In papillary renal carcinoma, MET mutations are found in both hereditary and sporadic forms, leading to increased tyrosine kinase activity and oncogenesis (Schmidt1999Novel; Jeffers1997Activating). Specific mutations, such as D1228N and M1250T, are associated with increased kinase activity and are homologous to mutations in other tyrosine kinase receptors (GIORDANO2000Different).

MET mutations also play a role in resistance to targeted therapies. In NSCLC, MET inhibitors like crizotinib have shown clinical activity in MET exon 14-altered cases, highlighting their potential in overcoming resistance (Guo2020METdependent). The clinical significance of MET mutations extends to their use as biomarkers for prognosis and therapy selection in various cancers (Moosavi2019HGFMET).

## Interactions
The MET proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. MET is activated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which induces structural changes and activates its intracellular protein tyrosine kinase domain. This activation leads to the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as GRB2 and GAB1, which facilitate downstream signaling pathways like PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK (Zhang2018Function; Benvenuti2007The).

MET forms complexes with ERBB3, leading to persistent PI3K/Akt signaling, which is crucial for drug resistance in certain cancer cells. This interaction is particularly significant in the context of MET amplification, which can lead to gefitinib resistance in lung cancer by activating ERBB3 signaling (Engelman2007MET).

MET also interacts with other receptor tyrosine kinases such as RON, forming heterodimers that enhance signaling efficiency. This interaction allows for crosstalk between receptors, promoting diverse signaling cascades (Zhang2018Function). Additionally, MET interacts with integrins, CD44 isoforms, and plexins, which modulate its activity and contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Benvenuti2007The).
