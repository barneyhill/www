# REEP3

## Overview
REEP3, or Receptor Expression-Enhancing Protein 3, is a gene that encodes the protein receptor accessory protein 3, which is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This protein is part of the REEP family, known for its role in shaping the ER and facilitating receptor transport. REEP3 is characterized by its reticulon homology domains (RHDs), which contribute to the high curvature of the ER membrane, a critical feature during cell division. The protein's interaction with microtubules and its involvement in intracellular membrane trafficking underscore its importance in cellular architecture and function. REEP3's role extends to various cellular processes, including protein trafficking and organelle positioning, and it has been implicated in several diseases, such as cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, due to its altered expression or genetic mutations (Kumar2019REEP3; Angelotti2022Exploring; Liu2024REEP3).

## Structure
REEP3 is a protein involved in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and facilitating receptor transport. It is part of the REEP family, which is characterized by specific structural features. REEP3 contains reticulon homology domains (RHDs), which consist of paired hydrophobic hairpin structures. These hairpins are believed to stabilize high membrane curvature by acting as wedges in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER membrane and by oligomerizing into scaffolds (Kumar2019REEP3). The protein has a positively charged cytoplasmic region between the two hairpin domains, which is conserved in REEP1-4 and is involved in microtubule binding (Angelotti2022Exploring).

REEP3, like other REEP family members, is an ER resident protein with dual hairpin domains that insert into the ER membrane to induce high curvature and ER tubulization (Angelotti2022Exploring). The protein also contains phosphorylation sites for 14-3-3 protein binding, which are shared by REEP1-4 but not by REEP5-6/Yop1p (Angelotti2022Exploring). These phosphorylation sites are crucial for the protein's interaction with 14-3-3 dimers, affecting its ability to form oligomers (Angelotti2022Exploring). The role of phosphorylation in REEP3's function is not fully understood, but it is known to influence the protein's structural and functional dynamics.

## Function
REEP3, a member of the receptor expression-enhancing protein family, plays a crucial role in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during mitosis. It is involved in maintaining the high curvature of the ER, which is essential for its proper distribution and organization during cell division. REEP3, along with REEP4, promotes ER tubulation through its reticulon homology domains (RHDs), facilitating the exclusion of the ER from chromatin and the spindle area during metaphase (Kumar2019REEP3).

REEP3 is active in the ER membrane and is implicated in intracellular membrane trafficking. It shares homology with yeast Yop1p, suggesting a role in cellular vesicle trafficking between the ER and the Golgi network (Castermans2007Identification). The protein's interaction with microtubules and its involvement in ER membrane clearance from metaphase chromatin highlight its importance in mitotic ER shaping (Angelotti2022Exploring).

In addition to its structural role, REEP3 may influence cellular processes such as protein trafficking and organelle positioning, contributing to the overall cellular architecture and function during cell division (Kumar2019REEP3).

## Clinical Significance
REEP3 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its altered expression or genetic mutations. In pancreatic cancer, REEP3 is significantly upregulated, and its high expression is associated with poor overall survival and increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Liu2024REEP3). The gene's expression is also linked to immune checkpoint markers, indicating potential relevance in immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer (Liu2024REEP3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), REEP3 expression is regulated by the circFAT1/miR-30a-5p pathway. CircFAT1 acts as a sponge for miR-30a-5p, which modulates REEP3 expression, promoting HCC progression. Alterations in this pathway are associated with increased tumor growth and invasion, highlighting REEP3 as a potential therapeutic target in HCC (Wei2020CircFAT1).

REEP3 has also been identified as a candidate gene for autism due to its location near chromosomal breakpoints associated with the disorder. Disruptions in REEP3 expression, possibly due to chromosomal inversions or duplications, have been suggested to contribute to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders (Firouzabadi2016Copy; Castermans2007Identification).

## Interactions
REEP3 is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with other members of the REEP family, such as REEP1, REEP2, REEP4, REEP5, and REEP6, as well as ARL6IP5, forming a gene interaction network that has been constructed using the GeneMania database (Liu2024REEP3). REEP3 also participates in a protein-protein interaction network identified using the STRING platform, which includes 35 edges and 11 nodes, featuring interactions with REEP1, REEP2, and REEP4 (Liu2024REEP3).

In the context of mitosis, REEP3, along with REEP4, plays a role in clearing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes from metaphase chromatin, a process essential for mitosis. This function is linked to a microtubule interaction region located between the two hairpin domains of REEP3, which is conserved in REEP1-4 (Angelotti2022Exploring). REEP3 and REEP4 also contain phosphorylatable 14-3-3 binding sites within their carboxy terminus, which are involved in interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, intracellular adapter proteins that bind to phosphoproteins (Angelotti2022Exploring).

Additionally, REEP3 is implicated in the miR-30a-5p/REEP3 pathway, where miR-30a-5p can directly bind to REEP3, influencing its expression and function in cellular processes such as cancer progression (Wei2020CircFAT1).
