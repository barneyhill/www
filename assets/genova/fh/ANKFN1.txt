# ANKFN1

## Overview
ANKFN1 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat and fibronectin type III domains, which are known to facilitate protein-protein interactions and are implicated in signal transduction pathways. ANKFN1 has been identified as playing a significant role in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it functions as an oncogene by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis through specific signaling pathways (Wang2022ANKFN1). The protein's involvement in these pathways highlights its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer research (Wang2022ANKFN1).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The ANKFN1 gene has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it plays a protumorigenic and metastatic role. Overexpression of ANKFN1 is frequently observed in HCC tissues compared to noncancerous tissues and is associated with poor prognosis in patients. High ANKFN1 expression correlates with cirrhosis and elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, but not with other clinicopathological factors such as age, sex, tumor size, or hepatitis B virus infection (Wang2022ANKFN1). Mechanistically, ANKFN1 promotes HCC cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis through the activation of the cyclin D1/Cdk4/Cdk6 pathway via the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway (Wang2022ANKFN1). It also influences cell migration and invasion through the RhoA/ROCK/JNK pathway (Wang2022ANKFN1).

Knockdown of ANKFN1 in HCC cell lines results in suppressed cell growth, induced G1-S cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, suggesting its function as an oncogene in HCC tumorigenesis (Wang2022ANKFN1). The clinical significance of ANKFN1 is underscored by its impact on overall survival in HCC patients, with high expression linked to shorter survival times (Wang2022ANKFN1). These findings suggest that ANKFN1 could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in HCC.
