# KERA

## Overview
The KERA gene encodes keratocan, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) that is predominantly expressed in the corneal stroma. Keratocan plays a pivotal role in maintaining corneal transparency and structural integrity by regulating the organization of collagen fibrils within the extracellular matrix. This organization is crucial for the normal morphogenesis and transparency of the cornea, as keratocan binds to collagen fibrils, contributing to the structural integrity of the corneal matrix (Roos2015Case; Puri2020Distribution). The protein's structure, characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, is essential for its function, forming a curved solenoid structure that stabilizes the protein and facilitates its interaction with other matrix components (Roos2015Case). Mutations in the KERA gene can lead to corneal abnormalities such as cornea plana, characterized by reduced corneal curvature and transparency (Roos2015Case; Puri2020Distribution). Additionally, keratocan is involved in extracellular matrix assembly and cellular signaling, which are vital for eye development and function, and has been implicated in other conditions such as atherosclerosis (Maiwald2014Mutation).

## Structure
Keratocan, encoded by the KERA gene, is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) that plays a crucial role in maintaining corneal transparency. The primary structure of keratocan includes a core protein characterized by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are essential for its function (Matsushima2021Sequence; Roos2015Case). These LRR domains form a curved solenoid shape, a typical feature of the tertiary structure of LRR proteins, with a parallel beta-sheet on the concave side (Roos2015Case).

The LRR domains are stabilized by hydrophobic residues and a conserved asparagine ladder, which are critical for maintaining the protein's three-dimensional structure and its interaction with collagen fibrils in the corneal matrix (Roos2015Case). This interaction is vital for the structural integrity and transparency of the cornea (Roos2015Case).

Post-translational modifications of keratocan may include glycosylation, which is common among SLRPs and contributes to their functional diversity and stability (Matsushima2021Sequence). The protein's structure and function can be affected by mutations, such as the p.Ile225Thr mutation, which disrupts the hydrophobic core and potentially destabilizes the protein (Roos2015Case).

## Function
The KERA gene encodes the keratocan protein, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan primarily expressed in the corneal stroma. Keratocan plays a crucial role in maintaining corneal transparency and structure by regulating the organization of collagen fibrils within the extracellular matrix. This organization is essential for the normal morphogenesis of the cornea and its transparency, as keratocan binds to collagen fibrils, contributing to the structural integrity of the corneal matrix (Roos2015Case; Puri2020Distribution).

Keratocan is involved in extracellular matrix assembly and cellular signaling, which are vital for eye development and function. In healthy human cells, keratocan is expressed during eye development and is exclusively expressed in the cornea in adult mice, suggesting a similar expression pattern in humans (Roos2015Case). The protein's structure, characterized by leucine-rich repeats, is crucial for its function, forming a curved solenoid structure that stabilizes the protein and facilitates its interaction with other matrix components (Roos2015Case).

Mutations in the KERA gene can disrupt the protein's structure and function, leading to corneal abnormalities such as cornea plana, characterized by reduced corneal curvature and transparency (Roos2015Case; Puri2020Distribution).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KERA gene are associated with several ocular conditions, most notably cornea plana. Cornea plana is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a flattened corneal surface, leading to high hyperopia and other visual impairments. The condition can present in both autosomal recessive and dominant forms, with the recessive form being more severe. Mutations in KERA, such as the R313X mutation, have been identified in patients with autosomal recessive cornea plana, leading to atypical presentations like corneal ectasia and hydrops, which are not typically associated with the condition (Khan2006Corneal; Roos2015Case).

In addition to cornea plana, a novel mutation in the KERA gene, p.Ser307Cys, has been linked to premature atherosclerosis in a family study. This mutation was found to cosegregate with the disease, suggesting a potential role for KERA in atherosclerosis, although it did not exhibit characteristics of cornea plana in carriers (Maiwald2014Mutation).

The KERA gene encodes keratocan, a protein essential for maintaining corneal structure and transparency. Mutations affecting the leucine-rich repeat domain of keratocan can disrupt protein stability, leading to the clinical manifestations observed in cornea plana (Roos2015Case).

## Interactions
Keratocan (KERA) is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) that plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and transparency of the cornea. It interacts with other extracellular matrix components, particularly collagen, to support corneal structure. KERA is involved in collagen fibrillogenesis, a process crucial for the organization and spacing of collagen fibers, which is essential for corneal transparency (Subbannayya2020What).

KERA also participates in interactions with neuroregulatory proteins, influencing nerve migration and development in neural tissues. These interactions are important for the regulation of growth factors and morphogens, which are critical for spinal cord development and other neuroregulatory processes (Hayes2020Immunolocalization).

In the context of atherosclerosis, KERA has been found in atherosclerotic plaques, where it is associated with immune cell markers, suggesting interactions with immune components in the plaque environment. This indicates a potential role in modulating immune responses within atherosclerotic lesions (Maiwald2014Mutation).

KERA's involvement in extracellular matrix remodeling is also noted in the pathogenesis of keratoconus, where it is categorized as an ECM-related protein. This suggests that KERA may influence matrix remodeling processes, potentially through interactions with other ECM components or signaling pathways (Song2024The).
