# COQ4

## Overview
The COQ4 gene encodes a protein that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a crucial component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The COQ4 protein, although not possessing enzymatic activity itself, is integral to the formation and stability of a multisubunit complex necessary for CoQ10 production. This protein is categorized as a structural component within the mitochondrial coenzyme Q biosynthetic complex, interacting with other Coq proteins to facilitate the biosynthesis process. COQ4 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with notable expression in the liver, lung, and pancreas, and is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production. Mutations in the COQ4 gene are linked to various mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its clinical significance in human health (Chung2015Mutations; Marbois2005Coq3; Casarin2008Functional).

## Function
The COQ4 gene encodes a protein that is essential for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in human cells. CoQ10 is a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, facilitating electron transport from complexes I and II to complex III, which is crucial for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Chung2015Mutations; Casarin2008Functional). The COQ4 protein is predicted to be 265 amino acids long and contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence, indicating its localization to the mitochondria where it plays a critical role in CoQ10 biosynthesis (Chung2015Mutations; Casarin2008Functional).

Although COQ4 does not have a known enzymatic function, it is hypothesized to be a core component of a multisubunit complex necessary for CoQ10 biosynthesis, contributing to the organization and stability of this complex (Chung2015Mutations; Casarin2008Functional). The protein is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with higher expression levels in the liver, lung, and pancreas (Casarin2008Functional). Functional studies have demonstrated that human COQ4 can complement yeast COQ4 null mutants, restoring both growth and CoQ biosynthesis, which underscores its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in healthy cells (Hayashi2014Functional; Casarin2008Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COQ4 gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, primarily due to its role in coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) biosynthesis. These mutations can lead to lethal neonatal mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, characterized by symptoms such as hypotonia, encephalopathy, neonatal seizures, cerebellar atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and lactic acidosis. This condition is often fatal in the neonatal period or early infancy, with a noted prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Chung2015Mutations).

COQ4 deficiency can also manifest as childhood-onset neurodegeneration, with clinical phenotypes including developmental delay, epilepsy, and ataxia. The severity of symptoms and response to CoQ10 supplementation can vary depending on the specific genetic variants present (Xie2022Primary; Laugwitz2021Human). Some patients with COQ4 mutations experience ataxia and neurodevelopmental disorders without detectable CoQ10 deficiency in muscle or skin fibroblasts, indicating a complex relationship between COQ4 mutations and clinical presentation (Mero2021New).

Haploinsufficiency of COQ4, resulting from deletions or reduced expression, leads to CoQ10 deficiency and associated symptoms such as muscle weakness and myalgias, which may improve with CoQ10 supplementation (Salviati2012Haploinsufficiency).

## Interactions
COQ4 is a crucial component of the mitochondrial coenzyme Q biosynthetic complex, interacting with several other Coq proteins to facilitate the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q. COQ4 forms part of a high molecular mass complex with proteins such as COQ3, COQ5, COQ6, COQ7, and COQ9, which are essential for the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q in yeast mitochondria (Marbois2009The; Marbois2005Coq3). The interaction between COQ4 and COQ3 is particularly significant, as demonstrated by co-precipitation experiments that confirm their physical association within the complex (Marbois2005Coq3). 

COQ4's role extends to organizing and stabilizing the complex, as mutations in COQ4 disrupt the organization of these proteins, leading to a loss of high molecular mass complex formation (Marbois2009The). In addition, COQ4 interacts with COQ9, as evidenced by co-migration in high molecular mass complexes and co-precipitation experiments, indicating a functional interdependence in the biosynthetic pathway (Hsieh2007Saccharomyces). These interactions are crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and catalytic efficiency of the coenzyme Q biosynthetic complex, preventing the release of reactive intermediates that could form harmful radicals (Hsieh2007Saccharomyces).
