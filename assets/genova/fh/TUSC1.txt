# TUSC1

## Overview
TUSC1, or Tumor Suppressor Candidate 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival, functioning as a putative tumor suppressor. The protein product of TUSC1 is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular integrity by preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation. It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting its involvement in multiple cellular pathways, including those related to cell cycle regulation and stability (Shan2013TUSC1). TUSC1 expression is notably associated with longer survival times in patients with certain cancers, such as squamous carcinomas, underscoring its potential impact on clinical outcomes (Shan2013TUSC1). The gene's expression is often reduced in various cancers due to mechanisms such as DNA hypermethylation, which further highlights its significance as a tumor suppressor and its potential as a prognostic marker in oncology (SHIMIZU2013Identification; Kanda2014Clinical).

## Structure


## Function
The TUSC1 gene, identified as a putative tumor suppressor, plays a significant role in regulating cell growth and survival. In healthy human cells, TUSC1 is involved in molecular processes that prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation, potentially acting in pathways that inhibit tumor development (Shan2013TUSC1). The protein product of TUSC1 is active in various cellular compartments, including both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting it may function in multiple pathways depending on its subcellular localization (Shan2013TUSC1). This dual localization indicates that TUSC1 could influence cell cycle regulation and stability, contributing to the maintenance of normal cellular functions.

In normal bronchial epithelial cells, TUSC1 expression is localized in the differentiated cells of the upper cell layers, but is reduced or absent in the basal cell layers (Shan2013TUSC1). This pattern of expression suggests a role in the differentiation process and maintenance of epithelial cell integrity. The gene's expression correlates with longer survival times in patients, particularly those with squamous carcinomas, highlighting its potential impact on organismal outcomes through its tumor suppressor activity (Shan2013TUSC1). While the specific functions of TUSC1 in healthy cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in these critical cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cell function and preventing tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
The TUSC1 gene has been implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TUSC1 expression is often reduced, with intragenic hypermethylation observed in approximately 31% of cases. This hypermethylation is associated with advanced pathological stages and poorer prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker for HCC (SHIMIZU2013Identification). In gastric cancer (GC), TUSC1 is frequently downregulated due to aberrant DNA methylation, with 57% of GC tissues showing intragenic hypermethylation. This downregulation correlates with advanced tumor stage, vessel invasion, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis, indicating its clinical significance in GC (Kanda2014Clinical).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), reduced TUSC1 expression is linked to poor survival rates. Restoring TUSC1 expression in cells with homozygous deletion has been shown to reduce tumor cell growth in vitro and suppress tumor formation in vivo, highlighting its tumor-suppressive role (Shan2013TUSC1). Additionally, in esophagogastric junction cancer, TUSC1 downregulation is associated with DNA methylation in its promoter region, and its overexpression can activate the p53 signaling pathway, reducing tumor growth and metastasis (Liu2024DNA). 

TUSC1 has also been linked to male infertility, specifically azoospermia, with a significant association found between the SNP rs1462218557 in the TUSC1 gene and this condition in an Iranian population (Vahidi2023Allelic).
