# GPR35

## Overview
GPR35 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 35, a member of the Class A rhodopsin-like family of receptors. This receptor is characterized by its 7-transmembrane domain structure, which is typical of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and facilitates its role in signal transduction across the cell membrane (Mackenzie2017The; Shore2015The). GPR35 is involved in various physiological processes, including cellular metabolism, ion transport, and immune function. It interacts with several proteins, such as β-arrestin-2 and Gα13, which are crucial for its signaling pathways (Jenkins2011Agonist). The receptor is expressed in multiple tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract and immune cells, where it plays a role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and mediating chemotactic responses (Schneditz2019GPR35; MaravillasMontero2015Cutting). Alterations in GPR35 expression and function have been linked to various diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Schneditz2019GPR35; Shu2022ERRactivated).

## Structure
GPR35 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that belongs to the Class A rhodopsin-like family. It is encoded by the GPR35 gene located on chromosome 2q37.3 in humans (Mackenzie2017The; Shore2015The). The receptor is characterized by a 7-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which forms its secondary structure (Mackenzie2017The; Shore2015The). 

GPR35 exists in two alternatively spliced isoforms: GPR35a and GPR35b. GPR35a is a 309 amino acid protein, while GPR35b has an additional 31 amino acid N-terminal extension, resulting in a longer extracellular domain (Mackenzie2017The; Quon2020Therapeutic). This extension in GPR35b may facilitate protein-protein interactions and potentially form an additional disulfide bond, although this has not been directly examined (Mackenzie2017The; Quon2020Therapeutic).

The primary structure of GPR35 includes conserved motifs typical of Class A GPCRs, such as the (E)DRY motif in TMH3, and variations like the CFLP substitution for the TMH6 CWXP motif (Shore2015The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of transmembrane alpha-helices into a three-dimensional conformation that spans the cell membrane (Mackenzie2017The). The quaternary structure is not detailed, but GPCRs often function as monomers or dimers (Mackenzie2017The).

## Function
GPR35 is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in maintaining cellular metabolism and ion transport. It interacts with the sodium-potassium pump (Na/K-ATPase), promoting ion transport and Src signaling activity, which are crucial for maintaining cellular electrochemical gradients (Schneditz2019GPR35). This interaction is essential for glycolysis, proliferation, and oncogenic signaling, particularly in intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages (Schneditz2019GPR35).

GPR35 is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, which affects various signaling pathways. It promotes glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, contributing to energy metabolism in cells (Schneditz2019GPR35). The receptor also plays a role in maintaining intestinal epithelial cell turnover, which is vital for intestinal homeostasis and health (Schneditz2019GPR35).

In the context of immune function, GPR35 is expressed in immune cells and is implicated in mediating chemotactic responses and calcium signaling, particularly through its interaction with the chemokine CXCL17 (MaravillasMontero2015Cutting). This highlights its role in linking the immune system with metabolic and gut health (Kaya2021GPR35).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GPR35 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease, as well as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The T108M polymorphism in GPR35 is associated with an increased risk for these conditions and is characterized by hyperactivation of the receptor, leading to enhanced proliferation and metabolic activity in certain cells (Schneditz2019GPR35; Kaya2021GPR35). This variant also correlates with improved clinical outcomes in response to TNF blockers in IBD patients (Kaya2021GPR35).

GPR35 is implicated in cancer development, particularly in the context of inflammatory diseases. It promotes glycolysis, proliferation, and oncogenic signaling by interacting with the sodium-potassium pump, contributing to increased cell proliferation and tumor formation (Schneditz2019GPR35). High expression of GPR35 is associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer and is linked to immune infiltration and macrophage polarization (Shu2022ERRactivated). In colorectal cancer, GPR35 expression in macrophages enhances tumor growth and angiogenesis (Pagano2021Activation).

GPR35 is also involved in the response to enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, with its deficiency leading to reduced disease severity in colitis models (Boleij2021Gprotein).

## Interactions
GPR35, a G protein-coupled receptor, interacts with several proteins that influence its signaling pathways. One of the primary interactions is with β-arrestin-2, which plays a crucial role in receptor internalization and signaling. This interaction is robust and can be used to infer ligand potency, as demonstrated by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays (Jenkins2011Agonist). The receptor also engages with G proteins, particularly Gα13, which is involved in its signal transduction. This interaction has been confirmed through various assays, including those using chimeric Gaq/Ga13 proteins and calcium imaging studies (Jenkins2011Agonist).

Specific amino acid residues in GPR35's transmembrane domain III, such as arginine at position 3.36 and tyrosine at position 3.32, are critical for ligand binding and receptor activation. Mutations at these positions can significantly affect the receptor's function and its interactions with ligands like kynurenic acid and zaprinast (Jenkins2011Agonist). These interactions highlight the importance of GPR35 in various physiological processes, including immune modulation and metabolic regulation.
