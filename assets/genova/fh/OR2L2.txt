# OR2L2

## Overview
The OR2L2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily L member 2, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odorants, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. The OR2L2 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which allows it to interact with various ligands and transduce signals across the cell membrane. While primarily associated with olfactory functions, OR2L2 has also been implicated in other physiological processes and diseases, including its expression in the human retina and potential involvement in neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease (Jovancevic2017Deep).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2L2 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and mutations. In the context of oral leukoplakia (OLK) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), OR2L2 was identified as part of a gene signature that could differentiate between progressive and non-progressive dysplastic lesions. It was found to have a lower variant frequency in progressive samples, suggesting a potential role in the progression of dysplastic OLK to OSCC (Farah2019Exome).

In Sézary syndrome, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, OR2L2 was identified as one of the recurrently mutated genes in more than two patient samples. This suggests that mutations in OR2L2 may be involved in the disease's complex mutational landscape, although specific clinical implications were not detailed (Mirza2020New).

Additionally, OR2L2 is expressed in the human retina and is dysregulated in Parkinson's disease, indicating a potential role in the nervous system. However, the physiological function of OR2L2 in the nervous system remains unclear, and its specific role in the retina or other tissues has not been fully elucidated (Jovancevic2017Deep).
