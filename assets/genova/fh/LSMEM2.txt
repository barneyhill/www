# LSMEM2

## Overview
LSMEM2 is a gene that encodes the leucine-rich single-pass membrane protein 2, a transmembrane protein characterized by its single transmembrane domain and abundance of leucine residues. This protein is classified as a cell surface N-glycoprotein, indicating its involvement in cellular processes that require membrane localization and post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Berg2023Surfaceome). The leucine-rich nature of LSMEM2 suggests a role in structural stability and potential interactions with other cellular components. The protein's sensitivity to proteases during cell dissociation highlights the importance of its extracellular domains in maintaining its functional integrity (Berg2023Surfaceome). While detailed structural information is limited, the presence of alpha helices in its secondary structure is inferred, which is typical for proteins that span cellular membranes (Berg2023Surfaceome).

## Structure
The LSMEM2 protein, encoded by the human gene LSMEM2, is characterized by a single transmembrane domain and is rich in leucine residues, which is typical for proteins involved in membrane-spanning functions. The primary structure of LSMEM2 includes a sequence that is notably leucine-rich, contributing to its classification as a leucine-rich single-pass membrane protein (Berg2023Surfaceome). The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices, which are common in transmembrane regions, although specific details on the secondary structure are not provided in the available context.

The tertiary structure of LSMEM2 involves the folding of these helices, but detailed information on the quaternary structure is not documented in the provided sources. LSMEM2 is identified as a cell surface N-glycoprotein, indicating that it undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common in membrane proteins and plays a role in protein stability and function (Berg2023Surfaceome). The protein's presence is sensitive to proteases used in cell dissociation, suggesting that its extracellular domains are crucial for its function and stability (Berg2023Surfaceome). The context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms or specific domains beyond its classification as a single-pass membrane protein.
