# ABCC12

## Overview
The ABCC12 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 12 (MRP9), a protein that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. This family of proteins is known for its role in transporting various molecules across cellular membranes using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. ABCC12 is categorized within the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) subfamily, which is involved in processes such as detoxification and lipid transport. The protein is characterized by its two ATP-binding domains and two transmembrane domains, which facilitate its function as a transporter. Although the specific physiological role of ABCC12 remains unclear, it is expressed in testicular germ cells and mouse sperm, suggesting a potential role in reproductive processes. Despite its classification as a multidrug resistance-associated protein, its involvement in the transport of typical MRP substrates has not been confirmed (Ono2007Multidrug; Tammur2001Two).

## Structure
The ABCC12 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, specifically the ABCC (MRP) subfamily. The protein consists of 1359 amino acids and is predicted to be a full ABC transporter, containing two ATP-binding domains and two transmembrane domains (Tammur2001Two). The ABCC12 protein shares a 42% amino acid sequence identity with the human ABCC5 protein, indicating a close evolutionary relationship (Tammur2001Two).

The protein structure includes two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two transmembrane domains (TMDs), each with six transmembrane segments (Choudhuri2006Structure). The NBDs contain characteristic motifs, including Walker A and B motifs and an ABC signature motif, which are crucial for ATP binding and hydrolysis (Choudhuri2006Structure). Unlike some larger members of the ABCC subfamily, ABCC12 lacks the extra N-terminal domain, which is not required for transport function (Tammur2001Two).

The splicing pattern of ABCC12 is similar to that of ABCC11, particularly towards the 3' end, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship between these transporters (Tammur2001Two). The gene consists of 29 exons, with exon sizes ranging from 73 to 279 base pairs (Tammur2001Two). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ABCC12 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, which is involved in the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes. These transporters utilize ATP hydrolysis to translocate substrates, impacting processes such as detoxification and lipid transport. The ABCC12 protein, also known as multidrug resistance-associated protein 9 (MRP9), is closely related to other members of the MRP family, such as MRP5 and MRP8, and is located on chromosome 16q12.1 in humans (Ono2007Multidrug).

The specific physiological function of ABCC12 in healthy human cells remains unclear. However, it is known to be expressed in testicular germ cells and mouse sperm, suggesting a potential role in reproductive processes (Ono2007Multidrug). The protein is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum in HEK-293 cells, indicating its involvement in intracellular transport processes (Ono2007Multidrug). Despite its classification as a multidrug resistance-associated protein, studies have not confirmed its role in the transport of typical MRP substrates, such as drug conjugates and organic anions (Ono2007Multidrug). The lack of a full-length human MRP9 transcript and the presence of many alternatively spliced RNAs contribute to the uncertainty regarding its precise function (Ono2007Multidrug).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the ABCC12 gene, part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, is not fully understood, but it has been implicated in several conditions. Mutations in the ABCC12 gene have been associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). A study identified novel mutations in ABC transporter genes, including ABCC12, in patients with ICP, highlighting the Pro37Ser mutation as "probably damaging" (Liu2021Wholeexome). These mutations were absent in control samples, suggesting a potential role in the disease.

While specific diseases directly linked to ABCC12 mutations are not extensively documented, the gene is part of the ABCC subfamily, which includes other genes known for their roles in drug resistance and disease. For instance, ABCC12 is structurally similar to other ABCC genes that confer resistance to anticancer drugs, suggesting a possible involvement in cancer drug resistance mechanisms (Hlavata2012The). However, the exact impact of ABCC12 on drug resistance in cancer remains to be fully elucidated.

Overall, while ABCC12's role in specific diseases is still being investigated, its potential involvement in conditions like ICP and cancer drug resistance highlights its clinical significance.
