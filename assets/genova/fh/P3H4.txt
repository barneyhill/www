# P3H4

## Overview
P3H4 is a gene that encodes the protein prolyl 3-hydroxylase family member 4, which is categorized as an inactive member of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase family. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a significant role in the post-translational modification of collagen, specifically in the hydroxylation of proline residues. This modification is crucial for collagen stability and function, impacting tissue integrity and repair (Fang2022P3H4; Zimmerman2018Expression). Although P3H4 is primarily associated with collagen biosynthesis, it also interacts with other proteins, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), influencing processes like cancer progression (Fang2022P3H4). Additionally, P3H4 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including connective tissue disorders and certain cancers, highlighting its diverse biological significance (Wang2022Identification; Heard2016Sc65Null).

## Function
The P3H4 gene encodes a protein that is part of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase family, which is involved in the post-translational modification of collagen. This protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a crucial role in the hydroxylation of proline residues in collagen, a process essential for collagen stability and function (Fang2022P3H4; Zimmerman2018Expression). The hydroxylation of proline residues is a key step in collagen biosynthesis, impacting tissue integrity and repair. P3H4 forms a complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3 (P3H3) and lysyl hydroxylase 1, which is important for the regulation of collagen synthesis and bone metabolism (Fang2022P3H4).

In healthy cells, P3H4's function is linked to its role in collagen modification, which affects bone and skin integrity. The loss of P3H4 can lead to defective collagen lysyl hydroxylation, resulting in conditions such as low bone mass and skin fragility (Zimmerman2018Expression). While P3H4 is primarily studied in the context of its role in collagen synthesis, it is also noted as an autoantigen in interstitial cystitis, indicating its involvement in other physiological processes (Fang2022P3H4).

## Clinical Significance
The P3H4 gene, also known as prolyl 3-hydroxylase family member 4, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), P3H4 is significantly upregulated, correlating with advanced tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and poor survival outcomes. Knockdown of P3H4 in LUAD cell lines reduces cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, suggesting its role in promoting malignant progression through interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Fang2022P3H4).

In bladder cancer, P3H4 is identified as a candidate tumor-associated antigen, with higher expression levels linked to poor prognosis. Its expression is positively correlated with the abundance of macrophages and dendritic cells, indicating a potential role in immune response modulation (Wang2022Identification).

In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), P3H4 is overexpressed in certain cell lines, suggesting a possible role in the disease's pathology, although specific mutations or direct associations with leukemia are not detailed (ZapataGarcía2022Comparative).

Additionally, P3H4 is part of a complex involved in collagen synthesis, and its disruption can lead to connective tissue disorders, as evidenced by studies on SC65-null mice (Heard2016Sc65Null).

## Interactions
P3H4, also known as prolyl 3-hydroxylase family member 4, is involved in several protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular processes. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), P3H4 has been shown to interact with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This interaction is significant as it promotes malignant progression in LUAD by enhancing cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. The interaction between P3H4 and EGFR also suggests a regulatory role in metabolic pathways, which may contribute to cancer progression (Fang2022P3H4).

In the context of collagen modification, P3H4, also known as SC65, is part of an endoplasmic reticulum complex that includes prolyl 3-hydroxylase 3 (P3H3) and potentially interacts with lysyl-hydroxylase 1 (LH1) and cyclophilin B (CYPB). This complex is crucial for the regulation of collagen lysyl hydroxylation, a process important for maintaining the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix. The loss of SC65 in mice leads to instability of this complex, resulting in altered collagen lysine hydroxylation and cross-linking, which causes connective tissue defects (Heard2016Sc65Null). These interactions highlight P3H4's involvement in both cancer progression and collagen biosynthesis.
