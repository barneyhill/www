# CBX4

## Overview
CBX4 is a gene that encodes the chromobox protein homolog 4, a member of the Polycomb group proteins, which are critical regulators of gene expression through chromatin remodeling. The CBX4 protein is characterized by its chromodomain, which facilitates the binding to methylated histones, and a SUMO E3 ligase domain, which is involved in post-translational modifications. As a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), CBX4 plays a significant role in maintaining chromatin structure and regulating gene expression by recognizing specific histone marks, such as H3K27me3. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including nucleolar homeostasis, cell proliferation, and the DNA damage response. CBX4's dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, where it can act as an oncogene, influencing tumor progression and patient prognosis (Ren2019Maintenance; Jiang2020CBX4; Zeng2018CBX4).

## Structure
CBX4, a member of the Polycomb group proteins, is characterized by a chromodomain that plays a crucial role in binding methylated histones, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene expression. The chromodomain of CBX4 is located at the N-terminus and is involved in recognizing specific histone marks, such as H3K27me3, through an aromatic cage structure that facilitates these interactions (Dahiya2019Investigating; Kaustov2011Recognition).

The protein also contains a SUMO E3 ligase domain, which is responsible for promoting the SUMOylation of target proteins, including DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a. This post-translational modification links DNA methylation with histone modification and transcriptional repression (Dahiya2019Investigating).

CBX4 is part of the Pc homologs within the CBX family, which includes CBX2, CBX6, CBX7, and CBX8. These proteins are known to associate with Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), modulating its activity and contributing to chromatin regulation (Dahiya2019Investigating). The structural dynamics of CBX4, including its interaction with histone marks, are influenced by specific mutations, such as W32 and E43, which are critical for the formation of the aromatic cage and interaction surfaces (Dahiya2019Investigating). However, detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of CBX4 is not provided in the available context.

## Function
CBX4, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), plays a crucial role in maintaining nucleolar homeostasis in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). It is involved in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin, specifically recognizing the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), which recruits PRC1 to target gene regions (Ren2019Maintenance). CBX4 maintains nucleolar heterochromatin and limits ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis, which is essential for counteracting cellular senescence (Ren2019Maintenance). In young hMSCs, CBX4 interacts with nucleolar proteins such as fibrillarin (FBL) and KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP1) to maintain nucleolar architecture and function, repressing rDNA transcription (Ren2019Maintenance).

CBX4 also plays a role in regulating cell proliferation by binding to the promoter regions of numerous genes, although its regulation of hMSC aging involves nonconventional mechanisms (Ren2019Maintenance). In the context of epidermal stem cells, CBX4 is crucial for maintaining these cells in a slow-cycling, undifferentiated state while protecting them from senescence. This function is linked to the repression of the Cdkn2a/p16 locus (Luis2011Regulation). CBX4's SUMO E3-ligase activity is necessary for its antiproliferative and antidifferentiation functions (Luis2011Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
CBX4 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in gene expression regulation. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CBX4 is upregulated and acts as an oncogene by suppressing the tumor suppressor gene KLF6 through interaction with HDAC1. This suppression is associated with poor patient outcomes, including worse overall and disease-free survival, higher Fuhrman grade, and increased tumor metastasis (Jiang2020CBX4).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CBX4 promotes angiogenesis and metastasis by sumoylating hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, correlating with tumor progression and response to treatment. High CBX4 expression is linked to better outcomes with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) (Jiao2015Prognostic).

CBX4 also plays a role in breast cancer by enhancing tumor growth and cell viability through the Notch1 signaling pathway. Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased tumor aggressiveness (Zeng2018CBX4).

In osteosarcoma, CBX4 promotes metastasis by upregulating Runx2, with its expression being modulated by CK1α. Targeting the CK1α/CBX4 axis has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy (Wang2020Targeting).

## Interactions
CBX4, a member of the Polycomb group proteins, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. CBX4 interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to repress the transcription of the tumor suppressor gene KLF6 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). This interaction is crucial for CBX4's oncogenic activities, as HDAC1 is required for the CBX4-mediated suppression of KLF6 (Jiang2020CBX4).

CBX4 also forms oligomers and interacts with other proteins within the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). It associates with PRC1 components such as BMI1, PCGF2, PCGF6, PHC2, RING1, and RNF2, indicating its role in the assembly and function of the PRC1 complex (Vandamme2011Interaction). The interaction with 14-3-3 proteins influences the recruitment or stability of BMI1/PCGF proteins within the CBX4-PRC1 complex, although it does not affect CBX4's binding to RNF2 (Vandamme2011Interaction).

CBX4 is also involved in the DNA damage response, where it is recruited to sites of DNA damage. This recruitment is facilitated by its interaction with poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) polymers, which serve as a scaffold for CBX4 at DNA damage sites (Ismail2012CBX4mediated). These interactions highlight CBX4's multifaceted role in cellular processes related to gene silencing and DNA repair.
