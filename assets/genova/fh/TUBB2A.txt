# TUBB2A

## Overview
The TUBB2A gene encodes the tubulin beta 2A class IIa protein, a neuronal-specific isotype of beta-tubulin that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of microtubules. These microtubules are integral components of the cytoskeleton, essential for maintaining cell structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and enabling cell division. The protein encoded by TUBB2A is particularly significant in the brain, where it is highly expressed and contributes to neuronal development and function. It forms heterodimeric polymers with alpha-tubulins, which are necessary for cytoskeleton dynamics, including cell division and migration. The dynamic properties of these polymers are regulated by GTP hydrolysis and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins, as well as post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation (Brock2020Defining; Abbaali2023The). Mutations in TUBB2A are linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental processes (Romaniello2015Mutations).

## Structure
The TUBB2A gene encodes a beta-tubulin protein, which is a component of microtubules. The protein's structure includes primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary elements. The primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain. The secondary structure is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, with many variants located in the random coils between these secondary structures (Brock2020Defining). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which is crucial for its function and interaction with other proteins. Variants in TUBB2A are predicted to cluster at the protein surface, potentially impacting its 3D structure and lateral interactions (Brock2020Defining).

The quaternary structure of TUBB2A involves its assembly into microtubules, which are essential for cytoskeleton dynamics during cell division, migration, and intracellular transport (Brock2020Defining). The protein includes a c-terminal MAP-binding domain, which is significant for its interaction with microtubule-associated proteins (Brock2020Defining). Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation can occur, influencing microtubule stability and dynamics (Abbaali2023The). These modifications and structural features are critical for the protein's role in neurodevelopment and cellular functions.

## Function
The TUBB2A gene encodes a neuronal-specific isotype of beta-tubulin, which is a critical component of microtubules. These microtubules are essential for various cellular processes, including maintaining cell structure, facilitating intracellular transport, and enabling cell division. In healthy human cells, TUBB2A is involved in forming the cytoskeleton, which is crucial for mitosis and supporting neuronal development and function (Leandro‐García2010Tumoral; Brock2020Defining).

TUBB2A is highly expressed in the brain, where it constitutes a significant portion of the beta-tubulin isotypes, indicating its important role in neuronal functions. It is also present in other tissues, such as the pancreas, liver, and kidney, though at lower levels compared to the brain (Leandro‐García2010Tumoral). The protein encoded by TUBB2A forms heterodimeric polymers with alpha-tubulins, which serve as scaffolds for cytoskeleton dynamics necessary for cell division, migration, and intracellular transport. The assembly and dynamic properties of these polymers depend on GTP hydrolysis (Brock2020Defining).

TUBB2A's function is influenced by interactions with microtubule-associated proteins and post-translational modifications, which affect its role in maintaining proper cell division and neuronal development (Brock2020Defining).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBB2A gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, collectively known as tubulinopathies. These include simplified gyral patterning, infantile-onset epilepsy, and various brain malformations such as lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, and schizencephaly. These conditions are primarily due to disruptions in neuronal migration and axonal guidance, which are critical processes in brain development (Romaniello2015Mutations; Cushion2014De). Specific mutations, such as p.Asn247Lys and p.Ala248Val, have been linked to these disorders, with the p.Ala248Val mutation being a potential hotspot for pathogenicity (Cushion2014De; Cai2020De).

Altered expression of TUBB2A is also clinically significant. In pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), high expression of TUBB2A is correlated with poor clinical outcomes, including shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival rates. This increased expression is associated with high white blood cell counts at diagnosis, which is linked to worse survival and a higher risk of central nervous system involvement (Khodzhaev2020High). The altered expression of TUBB2A may affect microtubule stability and sensitivity to tubulin-binding agents, influencing treatment outcomes in various cancers (Khodzhaev2020High).

## Interactions
TUBB2A, a beta-tubulin protein, is involved in several critical interactions within the cell. It interacts with the kinesin motor protein KIF1A, which is essential for the proper assembly of spindle poles during mitosis. Variants such as p.(Asp417Asn) in TUBB2A can disrupt this interaction, leading to mitotic cells with abnormal spindle figures (Brock2020Defining). TUBB2A is also a substrate for the TRiC chaperonin complex, which assists in its folding. Within the TRiC complex, TUBB2A interacts primarily with the CCT3 and CCT6 subunits, and to a lesser extent with CCT8 and CCT1, facilitating its proper folding and preventing aggregation (Kelly2021Snapshots).

The TRiC complex, in conjunction with the prefoldin (PFD) complex, plays a crucial role in maintaining the solubility and proper folding of TUBB2A. This interaction is mediated by a conserved electrostatic interface, which is essential for aligning the substrate-binding chambers of TRiC and PFD, enhancing the folding efficiency of TUBB2A (Gestaut2019The). Disruption of the TRiC-PFD interaction can lead to protein aggregation, highlighting the importance of these interactions in cellular proteostasis (Gestaut2019The).
