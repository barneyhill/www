# FUT3

## Overview
The FUT3 gene encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 3, which is a glycosyltransferase involved in the synthesis of Lewis antigens. These antigens are fucosylated oligosaccharides that play a critical role in cell-cell recognition and adhesion processes. The enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the addition of fucose to precursor molecules, forming Lewis antigens that are essential for various biological processes, including immune response and tissue differentiation (Nascimento2015Fut3; Serpa2006Expression). Fucosyltransferase 3 is particularly significant in mediating interactions between cells and the vascular endothelium, facilitating processes such as leukocyte migration and tumor metastasis (Nascimento2015Fut3; do2019The). Alterations in the FUT3 gene can lead to clinical conditions, including a Lewis-negative blood phenotype and increased susceptibility to certain diseases, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Ørntoft1996Influence; Grahn2001Determination).

## Function
The FUT3 gene encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 3, which is involved in the synthesis of Lewis antigens. These antigens, such as Le^a, Le^b, sialyl-Le^a (SLe^a), and sialyl-Le^x (SLe^x), are associated with glycoproteins and glycolipids on cell surfaces and play crucial roles in cell-cell recognition and adhesion processes (Nascimento2015Fut3; Serpa2006Expression). In healthy human cells, particularly in epithelial tissues, mucin glycoproteins are the primary carriers of Lewis antigens. In the bloodstream, fucosylated glycosphingolipids synthesized by exocrine epithelial cells are adsorbed onto erythrocyte membranes, contributing to the Lewis blood phenotype (Serpa2006Expression).

FUT3 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it catalyzes the addition of fucose to precursor molecules, forming the Lewis antigens. These antigens are involved in various biological processes, including implantation, embryogenesis, tissue differentiation, and immune response (Serpa2006Expression). The enzyme's activity is significant in normal cell adhesion and immune response processes, facilitating interactions such as leukocyte rolling and migration to inflammatory sites through the interaction of fucosylated glycans with E-selectins on the vascular endothelium (Nascimento2015Fut3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FUT3 gene have significant clinical implications. FUT3 is involved in the synthesis of fucosylated glycans, which are crucial for cell adhesion and tumor progression. In breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), the absence of FUT3 expression is associated with larger tumors and HER2-negative status, indicating a potential role in tumor aggressiveness and chemoresistance (Nascimento2015Fut3). 

Mutations in the FUT3 gene can lead to a Lewis-negative phenotype, characterized by the absence of Lewis antigens on erythrocytes. This phenotype is linked to various conditions, including an increased risk of certain cancers and coronary heart disease (Ørntoft1996Influence; Grahn2001Determination). Specific mutations, such as those at nucleotide positions 59, 202, 314, and 1067, are associated with reduced or abolished enzyme activity, affecting the clinical use of tumor markers like sialyl-Lewis a (Ørntoft1996Influence).

FUT3 polymorphisms have also been studied in relation to inflammatory bowel diseases. While no significant differences were found in overall FUT3 polymorphisms between Crohn's disease patients and controls, certain mutations were linked to lesion locations, suggesting a role in disease manifestation (Hu2014Associations). These findings underscore the importance of FUT3 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
FUT3, or fucosyltransferase 3, is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cancer and reproductive biology. In cancer, FUT3 plays a role in the fucosylation of TGFβR1, which is crucial for TGFβ signaling. Knockdown of FUT3 has been shown to inhibit this fucosylation, leading to attenuated Smad2 signaling and reduced migration and invasion in colorectal cancer cells (Keeley2019The). FUT3 is also involved in the synthesis of sialyl Lewis antigens, which mediate interactions between tumor cells and endothelial selectins, facilitating metastasis (do2019The).

In reproductive biology, FUT3 interacts with glycodelin-A on human sperm plasma membranes. This interaction is glycosylation-dependent, as deglycosylated glycodelin-A does not co-precipitate with FUT3. The binding of glycodelin-A to sperm FUTs, including FUT3, is inhibited by the presence of solubilized zona pellucida, indicating a role in spermatozoa-zona pellucida binding (Chiu2007GlycodelinA). These interactions highlight the diverse roles of FUT3 in both pathological and physiological processes.
