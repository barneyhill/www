# CD24

## Overview
CD24 is a gene that encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein, known as the CD24 molecule, which is involved in a variety of cellular processes. The CD24 protein is characterized by its small size and extensive glycosylation, which contributes to its functional versatility and lack of a defined secondary or tertiary structure (Ayre2016Analysis). Functionally, CD24 plays a critical role in cell signaling, immune response modulation, and the maintenance of epithelial integrity. It acts as a costimulatory molecule in T lymphocyte responses and interacts with Siglec-10 on macrophages to inhibit phagocytosis, a mechanism exploited by tumor cells to evade immune detection (Altevogt2020Novel; Chen2009CD24). CD24 is also implicated in cancer progression and autoimmune diseases, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2007A; Yang2023Targeting).

## Structure
The CD24 protein is a small, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface receptor with a core peptide of approximately 27 to 32 amino acids in humans (Ayre2016Analysis). The protein is heavily glycosylated, which contributes to its lack of a defined secondary or tertiary structure (Ayre2016Analysis). The primary structure includes a signal peptide, a mature core peptide, and a GPI-anchor peptide, with the signal and GPI-anchor peptides being cleaved before the protein is expressed on the cell surface (Ayre2016Analysis).

The secondary structure prediction identified two alpha-helical regions: one in the N-terminal region and another in the C-terminal domain, corresponding to the signal sequence and a portion of the GPI-anchor signal sequence, respectively (Ayre2016Analysis). However, no secondary structure was predicted for the mature peptide region, which is highly disordered (Ayre2016Analysis).

Post-translational modifications of CD24 include extensive N- and O-linked glycosylations, which are critical for its biological activity and influence its interactions with various ligands (Ayre2016Analysis). These glycosylations contribute significantly to the protein's molecular mass and are conserved across species, playing a role in ligand specificity and function (Ayre2016Analysis).

## Function
CD24 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily localized at the plasma membrane and is involved in cell signaling despite lacking an intracellular domain (Muoio2021Induction). CD24 is expressed in several stem cell types and is associated with regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in human adipose stem cells (hASCs) (Muoio2021Induction). In the immune system, CD24 functions as a costimulatory molecule for T lymphocyte responses and is involved in the regulation of autoimmunity (Altevogt2020Novel). It acts as a phagocytic inhibitor by interacting with Siglec-10 on macrophages, a mechanism that tumor cells exploit to evade immune detection (Altevogt2020Novel).

In epithelial cells, CD24 is crucial for maintaining the expression of tight junction proteins, which are essential for the integrity and barrier function of epithelial monolayers (Ye2009CD24). The suppression of CD24 leads to decreased expression of these proteins, resulting in increased permeability of the epithelial monolayer (Ye2009CD24). CD24's role in maintaining tight junctions suggests its involvement in the microbial barrier function of the oro-gastro-intestinal tract (Ye2009CD24).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD24 gene are associated with various cancers and autoimmune diseases. In cancer, CD24 is overexpressed in several types, including ovarian, breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, and B-cell lymphomas, where it is linked to tumor initiation, metastasis, recurrence, and resistance to treatment (Freile2022CD24; Yang2023Targeting). In ovarian cancer, increased CD24 expression is associated with tumor progression and chemoresistance (Yang2023Targeting). In breast cancer, CD24 is linked to increased metastatic potential and poor outcomes, particularly in triple-negative subtypes (Yang2023Targeting). In prostate cancer, CD24 overexpression correlates with aggressive tumors and worse survival outcomes (Tolkach2021DNA).

CD24 also plays a role in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A dinucleotide deletion in the 3' UTR of CD24 mRNA is associated with a reduced risk and delayed progression of MS and SLE, due to decreased mRNA stability and lower expression levels of CD24 (Wang2007A).

CD24's interaction with Siglec-10 on macrophages inhibits phagocytosis, allowing cancer cells to evade immune clearance, which contributes to tumor survival and progression (Yang2023Targeting). This interaction highlights CD24's potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Yang2023Targeting).

## Interactions
CD24 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing immune responses and cellular processes. It interacts with Siglec-10, forming a complex with high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and heat shock proteins (HSPs), which modulates immune responses to tissue damage by distinguishing between damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (Chen2009CD24; Liu2023CD24Siglec). This interaction is sialylation-dependent and involves the recruitment of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)1/2, potentially suppressing NFkB activation (Liu2023CD24Siglec).

CD24 also interacts with L1CAM, a neural adhesion molecule, affecting neurite outgrowth. This interaction is mediated by sialic acid residues on CD24 and can either promote or inhibit neurite outgrowth depending on the neuronal context (Kleene2001The). In cancer cells, CD24 interacts with P-selectin, facilitating cell adhesion and migration, and is involved in the regulation of oncogenic signaling pathways, including Src/STAT3 and PI3K-Akt (Altevogt2020Novel; Panagiotou2022CD24:). These interactions highlight CD24's role in modulating immune responses and influencing cell signaling and adhesion.
