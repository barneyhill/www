# ACP6

## Overview
ACP6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acid phosphatase 6, lysophosphatidic, which is a member of the histidine acid phosphatase superfamily. This enzyme functions as a lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase, primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a critical role in lipid metabolism and cell signaling by hydrolyzing lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to produce monoacylglycerol (MAG) and inorganic phosphate. The protein is characterized by a unique substrate-binding pocket that accommodates the long acylglyceroyl group of LPA, facilitating its hydrolysis (Li2013Crystal). ACP6 is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with particularly high levels in the kidney, heart, small intestine, muscle, and liver, underscoring its importance in diverse physiological processes (Li2013Crystal). The enzyme's activity is essential for regulating mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial functions and energy metabolism (Li2013Crystal).

## Structure
The ACP6 protein has a distinctive garlic flake-shaped structure with dimensions of 71 Å × 52 Å × 41 Å. It is composed of two main domains: a Rossmann-fold-like body domain and an α-helices-only cap domain. The body domain resembles the classic α/β core domain found in the histidine acid phosphatase superfamily, featuring a seven-stranded β-sheet flanked by α-helices, with β6 being antiparallel (Li2013Crystal). The cap domain includes a loop between β1 and β2, α1 and its following loop, and a helix bundle (α4-α8) inserted between β4 and α9, forming a cap over the body domain (Li2013Crystal).

The active site of ACP6 is characterized by six conserved residues: Arg58, His59, Arg62, Arg168, His334, and Asp335, which form a positively charged area suitable for binding the negatively charged phosphate group of the substrate (Li2013Crystal). A water-supplying channel, composed of residues from α6, α8, and the loop between α10 and β6, is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic function (Li2013Crystal). ACP6 is active as a monomer, with a triangular structure formed by residues 77-116 preventing dimerization (Li2013Crystal). The enzyme is localized in mitochondria and is involved in mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis (Li2013Crystal).

## Function
ACP6 (acid phosphatase 6, lysophosphatidic) is an enzyme that functions as a lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase, primarily active in the mitochondria of human cells. It hydrolyzes lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to produce monoacylglycerol (MAG) and inorganic phosphate, playing a crucial role in lipid metabolism and cell signaling (Li2013Crystal). ACP6 is part of the histidine acid phosphatase superfamily and is characterized by a unique substrate-binding pocket that accommodates the long acylglyceroyl group of LPA, facilitating its hydrolysis (Li2013Crystal).

The enzyme is ubiquitously expressed across various tissues, with particularly high levels in the kidney, heart, small intestine, muscle, and liver, indicating its importance in diverse physiological processes (Li2013Crystal). ACP6's activity is essential for regulating mitochondrial lipid biosynthesis, which is vital for maintaining mitochondrial functions and energy metabolism (Li2013Crystal). The enzyme's activity is influenced by the length of the acyl chain of LPA, with longer chains enhancing substrate binding and enzymatic activity (Li2013Crystal). Through its role in modulating lipid composition, ACP6 contributes to the regulation of cellular processes such as membrane dynamics and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACP6 gene have been implicated in various cancers, affecting tumor progression and patient prognosis. In ovarian cancer, particularly high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), mutations in the TP53 gene lead to the downregulation of ACP6. This downregulation results in increased lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signaling, which is associated with enhanced cancer cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion. Low ACP6 expression correlates with poor overall survival in ovarian cancer patients, suggesting its role in aggressive cancer phenotypes (Chryplewicz2019Mutant).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ACP6 is significantly overexpressed compared to non-cancerous liver tissues. This overexpression is linked to clinical features such as higher histologic grade and poor prognosis. Knocking down ACP6 in HCC cells reduces proliferation and migration, indicating its role in cancer progression. The overexpression of ACP6 in HCC may be due to genetic alterations like amplification (Gao2022The).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ACP6 expression is significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal esophageal mucosa. This reduced expression is associated with more aggressive tumor characteristics and shorter survival times, making ACP6 a potential prognostic marker for ESCC (Ando2006Expression).
