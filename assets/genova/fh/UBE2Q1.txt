# UBE2Q1

## Overview
UBE2Q1 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 Q1, a member of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) involved in protein degradation and regulation. This enzyme functions as an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. UBE2Q1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, playing a significant role in cellular processes by ensuring the timely degradation of proteins. Dysregulation of UBE2Q1 has been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, where it influences oncogenic signaling pathways and interacts with key proteins such as p53. The gene's expression and epigenetic modifications, such as promoter hypomethylation, have been associated with cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Hu2017Hypomethylated; Zhang2017Upregulation; Shafiee2015UBE2Q1).

## Function
UBE2Q1 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a critical role in the ubiquitination process, which is essential for protein degradation and regulation within cells. This enzyme is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is responsible for degrading approximately 80-90% of intracellular proteins. The process involves the transfer of ubiquitin from an E1 enzyme to an E3 enzyme and other substrates, facilitated by UBE2Q1 as an E2 enzyme, thereby regulating the degradation and function of substrate proteins (Hu2017Hypomethylated).

UBE2Q1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes such as protein homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair. Its proper function is crucial for maintaining normal cellular processes, as it ensures the timely degradation of proteins, which is vital for cell cycle progression and the prevention of abnormal cell growth (Hu2017Hypomethylated).

While the specific function of UBE2Q1 in healthy human cells is not extensively detailed, its role in the ubiquitination pathway suggests it is involved in normal protein regulation processes, contributing to cellular health and stability (Chang2014Upregulated).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2Q1 is implicated in several cancers due to its dysregulated expression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), UBE2Q1 is frequently upregulated, often due to gene copy number gain, and is associated with poor prognosis. This upregulation promotes cancer progression through the β-catenin-EGFR-PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, enhancing cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis (Zhang2017Upregulation). Knockdown of UBE2Q1 in HCC cell lines results in reduced tumor growth and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role as an oncogene (Zhang2017Upregulation; Chang2014Upregulated).

In breast cancer, UBE2Q1 can bind and suppress p53, leading to resistance to apoptosis and contributing to cancer cell survival (Hosseini2019E2). In colorectal cancer, UBE2Q1 is overexpressed in a significant portion of tumor tissues, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Shafiee2013UBE2Q1).

Epigenetic alterations, such as hypomethylation of the UBE2Q1 promoter, have been observed in HCC, particularly in patients with hepatitis B virus-related HCC. This hypomethylation is associated with advanced tumor stages and may serve as a biomarker for disease progression (Hu2017Hypomethylated). These findings underscore the clinical significance of UBE2Q1 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
UBE2Q1, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to its ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction results in decreased p53 levels, suggesting a regulatory role of UBE2Q1 in modulating p53 activity, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Shafiee2015UBE2Q1). UBE2Q1 can bind to both wild-type and mutant forms of p53, as demonstrated in breast carcinoma cell lines (Shafiee2015UBE2Q1).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), UBE2Q1 is implicated in the β-catenin-EGFR-PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Its overexpression promotes cancer progression, while its knockdown leads to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in oncogenic signaling pathways (Zhang2017Upregulation). UBE2Q1 also interacts with SKP2, a component involved in cell cycle progression, further highlighting its role in cancer cell proliferation (Chang2014Upregulated).

These interactions underscore UBE2Q1's involvement in critical cellular processes, including protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
