# DYNLT2B

## Overview
DYNLT2B is a gene that encodes the protein dynein light chain Tctex-type 2B, which is a component of the dynein motor protein complex. This protein is categorized as a dynein light chain and plays a significant role in intracellular transport processes. Dynein light chain Tctex-type 2B is involved in the assembly and function of the dynein-2 complex, which is crucial for retrograde intraflagellar transport within cilia. The protein's interactions with various components of both cytoplasmic and axonemal dyneins, such as WDR34, WDR60, and DYNLT1, highlight its importance in cellular transport and structural organization, particularly in the context of sperm flagellum formation (Harima2024TCTEX1D2; Vuolo2020Cytoplasmic).

## Interactions
DYNLT2B, also known as TCTEX1D2, is a dynein light chain involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in intracellular transport. In the context of sperm flagellum formation in mice, DYNLT2B interacts with components of both cytoplasmic dynein 2 and axonemal dynein. It binds with cytoplasmic dynein 2 component proteins such as WDR34, WDR60, and DYNLT1 in the testes, indicating its role in the assembly of this motor complex (Harima2024TCTEX1D2). DYNLT2B also interacts with WDR63 and WDR78, which are part of the inner dynein arm, suggesting its involvement in organizing the axonemal structure necessary for proper flagellar function (Harima2024TCTEX1D2).

In the dynein-2 complex, DYNLT2B forms a putative heterodimer with a dynein light-chain Tctex-type protein, which interacts with WDR60, highlighting its specific role in dynein-2 (Vuolo2020Cytoplasmic). These interactions are essential for the stability and function of the dynein-2 complex, which is involved in retrograde intraflagellar transport within cilia (Vuolo2020Cytoplasmic). The interactions of DYNLT2B with these proteins underscore its critical role in cellular transport mechanisms.
