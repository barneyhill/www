# PLEC

## Overview
The PLEC gene encodes plectin, a large and versatile cytolinker protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular integrity and structural stability. Plectin is categorized as a cytoskeletal linker protein, facilitating the interaction between intermediate filaments and other cytoskeletal components such as actin filaments and microtubules. This protein is essential for the mechanical strength of cells, particularly in tissues subjected to mechanical stress, including skin, muscle, and cardiac tissues. Plectin's complex structure, featuring a central α-helical coiled-coil rod flanked by globular domains, allows it to function as a scaffolding platform for various proteins involved in cellular signaling and structural organization. The protein's ability to form dimeric and tetrameric structures further underscores its role in cellular architecture. Mutations in the PLEC gene are linked to several disorders, collectively known as plectinopathies, which manifest in tissues under mechanical stress, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Winter2012The; Andrä1997Targeted; Zrelski2021MuscleRelated).

## Structure
Plectin, encoded by the PLEC gene, is a large cytolinker protein with a complex molecular structure. It consists of an NH2-terminal globular domain, a long rod-like central domain, and a COOH-terminal globular domain. The COOH-terminal domain contains six highly homologous repeat regions, which are crucial for its association with intermediate filaments (IFs) (Wiche1993Expression). Plectin's rod domain is likely a double-stranded coiled coil alpha-helix, similar to other rod-like proteins, contributing to its elongated shape (Wiche1989Plectin:).

The protein exhibits a secondary structure composed of 30% alpha-helix, 9% beta-structure, and 62% aperiodic structure, with most of the secondary structure recovering after denaturation in urea (Wiche1989Plectin:). Plectin forms dimeric and tetrameric structures, with dimers being kinetically favored. The tetrameric structure consists of four polypeptide chains, with two chains in closer contact, suggesting a specific arrangement (Wiche1989Plectin:).

Plectin is a phosphoprotein, phosphorylated primarily on serine residues, and serves as a target for various kinases (Wiche1989Plectin:). It has several isoforms with distinct N-termini, specific tissue expression, and subcellular distribution (Bouameur2014Interaction).

## Function
The PLEC gene encodes plectin, a multifunctional cytoskeletal linker protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of cells and tissues. Plectin is involved in linking intermediate filaments to other cytoskeletal components, such as actin filaments and microtubules, and anchoring them to the plasma membrane and various cellular structures (Winter2012The; Andrä1997Targeted). This interaction is essential for providing mechanical strength and stability to cells, particularly in tissues exposed to mechanical stress, such as skin, muscle, and heart (Winter2012The; Andrä1997Targeted).

Plectin's structure includes a central α-helical coiled-coil rod flanked by globular domains, with binding sites for actin and intermediate filaments, allowing it to act as a scaffolding platform for proteins involved in signaling and structural organization (Winter2012The; Andrä1997Targeted). It is strategically localized at cytoskeletal junctional complexes, such as hemidesmosomes and desmosomes, and is involved in the stabilization of these structures (Winter2012The; Andrä1997Targeted).

In muscle tissue, plectin is crucial for maintaining the cytoarchitecture of the desmin intermediate filament network, ensuring proper alignment of sarcomeres and positioning of mitochondria (Winter2012The). Its absence or dysfunction can lead to structural weaknesses and degeneration in tissues, highlighting its essential role in maintaining cellular architecture (Winter2012The; Andrä1997Targeted).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLEC gene, which encodes the cytoskeletal protein plectin, are associated with a group of disorders known as plectinopathies. These conditions primarily affect tissues under mechanical stress, such as skin and muscle. The most common disorder linked to PLEC mutations is epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy (EBS-MD), an autosomal recessive condition characterized by skin blistering and progressive muscle weakness. Patients with EBS-MD may also experience cardiac issues, nail deformation, tooth decay, and respiratory complications (Winter2012The; Zrelski2021MuscleRelated).

Other conditions associated with PLEC mutations include EBS-MD with a myasthenic syndrome (EBS-MD-MyS), EBS with pyloric atresia (EBS-PA), and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type R17 (LGMDR17). These disorders exhibit a range of symptoms, such as limb-girdle weakness, myasthenic features, and elevated serum CK levels (Mroczek2020Four; Zrelski2021MuscleRelated). Autosomal dominant mutations can lead to EBS-Ogna, characterized by generalized skin blistering without muscular symptoms (Zrelski2021MuscleRelated).

Plectinopathies often involve severe disruptions in muscle structure, including myofibrillar changes, mitochondrial abnormalities, and protein aggregates, contributing to the progressive nature of these diseases (Zrelski2021MuscleRelated).

## Interactions
Plectin, encoded by the PLEC gene, is a versatile cytolinker protein that interacts with a wide array of proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular integrity and stability. In muscle tissues, plectin interacts with α-actinin, bridging Z-disks to desmin intermediate filaments (IFs), which is essential for the organization and mechanical stability of muscle fibers (Winter2023ZDiskAssociated). Plectin also binds to dystrophin and β-dystroglycan, key components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), linking intermediate filaments to the extracellular matrix (Rezniczek2007Plectin).

Plectin's interactions are isoform-specific. The P1d isoform is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, targeting Z-disks and playing a role in tension-induced proteolysis (Winter2023ZDiskAssociated). Plectin 1f, another isoform, is associated with the sarcolemma and interacts with β-dystroglycan, particularly in dystrophic muscle fibers (Rezniczek2007Plectin).

Plectin also interacts with various cytoskeletal components, including actin, microtubule-associated proteins, and transmembrane receptors. It binds to intermediate filament proteins such as desmin and vimentin, involving sequences within the 1A-2A segment of their rod domains (Favre2011Plectin). These interactions highlight plectin's role as a mechanical reinforcement and scaffold for signaling molecules within cells (Castañón2013Plectin–intermediate).
