# FUT11

## Overview
FUT11 is a gene that encodes the enzyme fucosyltransferase 11, which is a member of the fucosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the process of fucosylation, where it facilitates the transfer of fucose, a hexose sugar, to glycoproteins and glycolipids. Fucosyltransferase 11 is categorized as a glycosyltransferase and is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in modifying proteins and lipids, thereby influencing various cellular functions and developmental processes. The enzyme is implicated in the biosynthesis of specific glycan structures, such as sialyl-Lewis x and 6-sulfo-sialyl-Lewis x, which are important for cell-cell communication and immune responses (GrouxDegroote2008IL6). The expression and activity of FUT11 are regulated by factors such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia-inducible factors, highlighting its involvement in inflammatory responses and cancer progression (GrouxDegroote2008IL6; Cao2021HypoxiaRelated). Additionally, FUT11 has been associated with the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this disease (Zodro2013FUT11).

## Function
FUT11 is a fucosyltransferase enzyme involved in the transfer of fucose to glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process known as fucosylation. This enzyme is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in modifying proteins and lipids, influencing cellular functions and development. Although the specific enzymatic activity of FUT11 in healthy human cells is not fully understood, it is suggested to be involved in the biosynthesis of sialyl-Lewis x (sLe x) and/or 6-sulfo-sialyl-Lewis x epitopes, which are important in cell-cell communication and immune responses (GrouxDegroote2008IL6).

FUT11 is up-regulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 in human bronchial mucosa, indicating a potential role in inflammatory responses (GrouxDegroote2008IL6). In vertebrate development, FUT11 is expressed in various tissues and is crucial for normal development, as evidenced by developmental abnormalities observed in zebrafish with reduced FUT11 expression (Patnaik2007Characterization). The enzyme's activity includes enhancing the hydrolysis of GDP-fucose, a sugar donor, suggesting a conserved function across species (Patnaik2007Characterization). Despite these insights, the precise function of FUT11 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The FUT11 gene has been implicated in the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Altered expression of FUT11 is observed in ccRCC, where it is significantly upregulated in tumor samples compared to healthy tissue. This upregulation is associated with disease progression, as indicated by logistic regression analysis, and suggests that FUT11 may serve as a biomarker for ccRCC progression (Zodro2013FUT11). The expression of FUT11 is correlated with key genes involved in ccRCC, such as VHL, HIF1A, and EPAS1, indicating its potential dependence on these genes (Zodro2013FUT11).

Despite its upregulation, the study found an inverse correlation between FUT11 expression and a symptomatic disease course post-nephrectomy, although this was not statistically significant in Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (Zodro2013FUT11). The gene is involved in pathways related to immune response, angiogenesis, and apoptosis, which are critical in cancer progression (Zodro2013FUT11). While specific mutations in FUT11 were not detailed, its altered expression and involvement in cancer-related pathways underscore its clinical significance in ccRCC (Zodro2013FUT11).

## Interactions
FUT11, a fucosyltransferase, is known to interact with a variety of proteins, with a total of 700 interactions identified through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis. Among these, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) is a significant interacting partner, especially in the context of pancreatic cancer. FUT11 directly binds to and co-localizes with PDK1, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the stability of PDK1, as FUT11 inhibits its ubiquitination, thereby protecting PDK1 from degradation. The suppression of FUT11 leads to increased degradation and ubiquitination of PDK1, indicating that FUT11 stabilizes PDK1 under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Cao2021HypoxiaRelated).

FUT11 is also regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1a), which binds to a hypoxia-responsive element in the promoter region of FUT11, influencing its expression. This regulatory mechanism was confirmed through luciferase reporter assays and ChIP assays, which demonstrated the binding of HIF1a to the FUT11 promoter. The co-expression of FUT11 and HIF1a in pancreatic cancer tissues supports the regulatory relationship between these proteins (Cao2021HypoxiaRelated).
