three members of the Tribbles family. The Tribbles members share a Trb domain, which is homologous to protein serine-threonine kinases, but lacks the active site lysine and probably lacks a catalytic function. The Tribbles proteins interact and modulate the activity of signal transduction pathways in a number of physiological and pathological processes. This Tribbles member induces apoptosis of cells mainly of the hematopoietic origin. It has been identified as a protein up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli in myeloid (THP-1) cells, and also as an oncogene that inactivates the transcription factor C/EBPalpha (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha) and causes acute myelogenous leukemia. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.
