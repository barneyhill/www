# WDR41

## Overview
WDR41 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 41 protein, which is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, particularly within the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The protein is categorized as a scaffolding protein due to its structure, which includes six WD40-repeat domains that facilitate diverse protein-protein interactions. WDR41 is a component of the C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex, which plays a critical role in autophagy initiation and membrane trafficking. This complex acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab8a and Rab11a, influencing processes such as ciliogenesis and axon growth. Additionally, WDR41 is implicated in regulating endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is essential for immune responses. Alterations in WDR41 expression and function have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and inflammatory conditions, highlighting its significance in cellular homeostasis and disease pathogenesis (McAlpine2018Excessive; Tang2020CryoEM; Sullivan2016The).

## Structure
WDR41 is characterized by an eight-blade β-propeller structure, which is a common feature of proteins with WD repeats. This structure is stabilized by a 'Velcro' closure formed by the N-terminal first strand and the C-terminal last three strands, creating the first propeller (Tang2020CryoEM). The protein contains six WD40-repeat domains, which are known for their scaffolding capabilities and are involved in mediating diverse protein-protein interactions (Wang2020Aberrant).

In terms of its interaction with other proteins, WDR41 binds to the SMCR8 protein via its C-terminal helix and N-terminal β-strand. The C-terminal helix of WDR41 interacts with a groove on the SMCR8 DENN domain, while the N-terminal β-strand forms an antiparallel β-sheet with SMCR8 (Tang2020CryoEM). Specific residues in the C-terminal helix, such as L445, F446, and L449, are critical for this interaction, and mutations in these residues can disrupt binding (Tang2020CryoEM).

WDR41 does not directly interact with C9ORF72 but is part of the C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex, which is involved in regulating autophagy and membrane trafficking (Tang2020CryoEM). The protein's role in this complex may involve localizing it to specific cellular locations, such as the lysosome (Tang2020The).

## Function
WDR41 is a protein that plays a significant role in the autophagy-lysosome pathway, a critical cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. It forms a complex with C9orf72 and SMCR8, which is involved in autophagy initiation by interacting with the FIP200/Ulk1/ATG13/ATG101 complex (Sullivan2016The). WDR41 is enriched at the Golgi apparatus, suggesting its involvement in autophagosome biogenesis, as the Golgi is a key membrane source for this process (Sullivan2016The).

Structurally, WDR41 is part of a dimeric assembly with C9orf72 and SMCR8, forming a complex that acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rab8a and Rab11a, which are important for membrane trafficking and cellular processes like ciliogenesis and axon growth (Tang2020CryoEM). WDR41 binds to the SMCR8 DENN domain via its C-terminal helix, stabilizing the complex's structure (Tang2020CryoEM).

In addition to its role in autophagy, the WDR41-containing complex is implicated in regulating endosomal TLR signaling, which is crucial for immune responses. Deficiencies in this complex can lead to exaggerated TLR signaling and inflammatory diseases (McAlpine2018Excessive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the WDR41 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and inflammatory conditions. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), WDR41 is expressed at low levels, and its promoter region is often hypermethylated, leading to reduced expression. This down-regulation is associated with increased tumor characteristics such as cell viability, migration, and cell cycle progression. Conversely, overexpression of WDR41 suppresses these tumor-promoting features, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor in TNBC (Wang2020Aberrant). The hypermethylation of WDR41 contributes to tumorigenesis by modulating the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in TNBC (Wang2020Aberrant).

In the context of inflammatory diseases, mutations in WDR41 can lead to excessive endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, resulting in heightened inflammatory responses. Mice with mutations in WDR41 exhibit increased susceptibility to colitis and show signs of autoimmunity, such as elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and hyperresponsive macrophages. These findings suggest that WDR41 plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and maintaining intestinal homeostasis (McAlpine2018Excessive). The dysfunction of the SMCR8-WDR41-C9ORF72 complex, which is involved in autophagy and lysosomal function, further implicates WDR41 in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions (Sullivan2016The).

## Interactions
WDR41 is a protein that participates in the C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex, a multiprotein assembly involved in various cellular processes. Within this complex, WDR41 primarily interacts with the SMCR8 protein. The interaction is mediated through the C-terminal helix (CTH) and the N-terminal β-strand (βN) of WDR41, which bind to specific regions on SMCR8, including a groove formed by α-helices and an antiparallel β-sheet (Tang2020CryoEM). This interaction is crucial for the stability of the complex, as mutations in key residues of WDR41 can disrupt binding (Tang2020CryoEM).

WDR41 does not directly interact with C9orf72, but it forms a ternary complex with C9orf72 and SMCR8 when co-expressed (Sullivan2016The). The C9orf72-SMCR8-WDR41 complex is involved in the autophagy-lysosome pathway and interacts with the FIP200/Ulk1 complex, which is essential for autophagy initiation (Sullivan2016The). WDR41 is also associated with the Golgi membrane, suggesting a role in autophagosome biogenesis (Sullivan2016The). The complex exhibits GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for Rab8a and Rab11a, with WDR41 contributing to the localization of the complex to the lysosome (Tang2020CryoEM).
