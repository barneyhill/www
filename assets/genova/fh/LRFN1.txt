# LRFN1

## Overview
LRFN1, or leucine rich repeat and fibronectin type III domain containing 1, is a gene that encodes a synaptic adhesion protein known as SALM2. This protein is integral to the development and function of neuronal synapses, playing a pivotal role in synapse formation, maturation, and plasticity. SALM2 is characterized by its extracellular leucine-rich repeats, an immunoglobulin domain, and a fibronectin type III domain, which are followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region containing a PDZ domain-binding motif. These structural features enable SALM2 to interact with key synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95, and to recruit neurotransmitter receptors like NMDARs and AMPARs to the synapse, thereby influencing neural connectivity and plasticity (Lie2018SALMLrfn; Liu2019Synaptic). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in both neurological functions and pathological conditions, including various cancers and neurological disorders (Xu2022Deciphering; Pan2022Expression).

## Function
LRFN1, also known as SALM2, is a synaptic adhesion molecule involved in the regulation of neuronal and synapse development. It is part of the SALM/LRFN family, which plays a crucial role in synapse formation, maturation, and plasticity. LRFN1 is characterized by its domain structure, which includes leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an immunoglobulin domain, and a fibronectin type III domain in the extracellular region, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic region with a PDZ domain-binding motif (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

In healthy human cells, LRFN1 is primarily active in the neuronal cell membrane, where it influences neural connectivity and plasticity. It interacts with excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95 and is involved in recruiting NMDARs and AMPARs to the synapse, thereby contributing to synaptic development and function (Lie2018SALMLrfn). These interactions are essential for regulating neurite outgrowth and branching, as well as synapse development and function, which are critical for proper neural circuit formation and maintenance (Lie2018SALMLrfn; Liu2019Synaptic).

LRFN1's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining synaptic integrity and function, which is crucial for normal cognitive and neurological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LRFN1 gene have been implicated in the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). High expression levels of LRFN1 are associated with poor prognosis, increased tumor growth, and enhanced immune infiltration, including elevated CD8+ T cell activity and PD-L1 expression. This suggests that LRFN1 may play a role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment and promoting tumor progression in ccRCC (Xu2022Deciphering). The interaction between miR-187-3p and LRFN1 is also significant, as miR-187-3p can suppress LRFN1 expression, affecting cell proliferation and invasion in ccRCC (Xu2022Deciphering).

In prostate cancer (PCa), LRFN1 is upregulated and associated with shorter disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The LRFN1 gene is involved in immune regulation, as evidenced by increased M2 macrophage infiltration and enhanced CD8+ T cell activity in the tumor microenvironment (Pan2022Expression).

Beyond cancer, LRFN1, also known as SALM2, is part of the SALM/LRFN family of synaptic adhesion molecules, which are implicated in neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders due to their role in synaptic connectivity and signaling pathways (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

## Interactions
LRFN1, also known as SALM2, is a synaptic adhesion molecule involved in neuronal and synapse development. It is characterized by extracellular leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, and a fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain. LRFN1 contains a PDZ domain-binding motif, which allows it to interact with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95. This interaction is crucial for regulating neurite outgrowth and synapse development, as it facilitates the association with glutamate receptors (Lie2018SALMLrfn).

LRFN1 is also involved in interactions with presynaptic LAR family receptor tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), which play a role in neurodevelopment. These interactions are significant for synaptic organization and function (Lie2018SALMLrfn). Additionally, LRFN1 has been shown to interact with Sorting nexin-27 (SNX27) through its PDZ-binding motif. This interaction is important for the membrane trafficking of LRFN1, preventing its lysosomal degradation and promoting its recycling to the cell surface (McMillan2020Sorting).

In the context of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), LRFN1 is targeted by miR-187-3p, which binds to its 3'-UTR, negatively regulating its expression. This interaction affects cell proliferation and invasion, highlighting LRFN1's role in tumor progression (Xu2022Deciphering).
