# SPAAR

## Overview
SPAAR is a gene that encodes the small regulatory polypeptide of amino acid response, a microprotein involved in critical biological processes such as muscle regeneration and angiogenesis. The SPAAR protein is characterized by a conserved structure across mammalian species, featuring a transmembrane domain and a disordered region, which are essential for its function. In humans, SPAAR exists in two isoforms, with the longer isoform being less expressed and primarily found in primates. Functionally, the SPAAR micropeptide plays a significant role in endothelial cell function, promoting angiogenesis and influencing cytoskeletal dynamics through interactions with actin-binding proteins like SYNE1. It is particularly responsive to hypoxic conditions, underscoring its importance in cardiovascular biology and its potential impact on cardiovascular health and disease (Spencer2020The; Spiroski2021The; Lee2021Evolutionary).

## Structure
The SPAAR protein, encoded by the human gene SPAAR, is a microprotein involved in muscle regeneration and angiogenesis. It features a conserved structure across mammals, despite low amino acid identity between species such as monotremes, marsupials, and humans. The primary structure of SPAAR includes a 23-amino-acid transmembrane domain near the N-terminus, followed by an 18-19-amino-acid disordered region. This structural conservation is maintained throughout the mammalian lineage (Lee2021Evolutionary).

In humans, SPAAR exists in both a long and a short isoform. The short isoform is 75 amino acids long, while the long isoform is 90 amino acids long. The long isoform is less expressed and has a weaker impact on mTORC1 inhibition. It is primarily found in the primate lineage, with New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, and apes having a 90 amino acid sequence orthologous to the human long SPAAR. Predictions for the long ORF sequences indicate consistent transmembrane and disordered regions similar to the short isoform, but with an additional N-terminal disordered region in primates, suggesting an elongation event in the primate lineage (Lee2021Evolutionary).

## Function
SPAAR (small regulatory polypeptide of amino acid response) is a micropeptide encoded by the LINC00961 locus, playing a significant role in endothelial cell function and angiogenesis. In endothelial cells, SPAAR is pro-angiogenic, promoting network formation and reducing endothelial barrier integrity, which is crucial for new blood vessel formation (Spencer2020The). SPAAR interacts with actin-binding proteins, such as SYNE1, suggesting its involvement in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular maintenance (Spencer2020The; Spiroski2021The). This interaction indicates that SPAAR's pro-angiogenic effects might be mediated through the actin cytoskeleton (Spencer2020The).

SPAAR is expressed in various human cardiac cell types, particularly endothelial cells, and is responsive to hypoxic conditions, highlighting its role in cardiovascular biology (Spiroski2021The). The SPAAR micropeptide is involved in the regulation of endothelial cells and fibroblasts, particularly in response to environmental stress, such as hypoxia (Spiroski2021The). Overall, SPAAR contributes to the regulation of endothelial function, angiogenesis, and vascular network development, impacting cardiovascular health and disease (Spencer2020The; Spiroski2021The).

## Interactions
The SPAAR micropeptide, encoded by the LINC00961 locus, is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. One of the primary interactions of SPAAR is with SYNE1 (also known as NESPRIN-1), an actin-binding protein. This interaction suggests that SPAAR may play a role in modulating endothelial cell morphology and movement by influencing the actin cytoskeleton (Spencer2020The). SYNE1 is involved in the cellular organization of organelles and is essential for maintaining the characteristic peripherally located nuclei in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells (Spencer2020The).

In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), SPAAR has been shown to bind to SYNE1, which is a regulator of endothelial cell shape and migration. This interaction is significant as SYNE1 siRNA knockdown in HUVECs reduces tubule formation and decreases migration, effects similar to those observed with knockdown of the LINC00961/SPAAR locus (Spencer2020The).

SPAAR has also been reported to bind the v-ATPase complex in HEK293 cells, although this interaction was not observed in HUVECs, indicating a possible different function for SPAAR in endothelial cells (Spencer2020The).
