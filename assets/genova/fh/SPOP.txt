# SPOP

## Overview
The SPOP gene encodes the speckle-type BTB/POZ protein, a crucial component of the CUL3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein functions primarily as a substrate adaptor, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of various target proteins. SPOP is characterized by its distinct domain architecture, including an N-terminal MATH domain for substrate recognition and a central BTB domain that mediates dimerization and interaction with the cullin-3 protein. The protein plays a significant role in regulating cellular processes such as DNA damage response, genomic stability, and transcriptional regulation, acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting oncogenic signaling pathways (Maekawa2020The; Li2011Tumorsuppressor). Mutations in the SPOP gene have been implicated in several cancers, including prostate, endometrial, and kidney cancers, where they disrupt normal protein degradation pathways, contributing to tumorigenesis (Boysen2015SPOP; Maekawa2020The).

## Structure
The SPOP protein is characterized by its distinct domain architecture, which includes an N-terminal MATH domain, a central BTB domain, and a C-terminal region with a nuclear localization signal. The MATH domain (residues 28-166) is responsible for substrate recognition and binds to specific substrate-binding consensus (SBC) motifs through a shallow groove, involving hydrophobic and polar interactions (Zhuang2009Structures). The BTB domain (residues 177-296) facilitates dimerization and interaction with the cullin-3 (Cul3) E3 ligase, forming a 2:2 complex with the Cul3 N-terminal domain (Zhuang2009Structures).

The C-terminal region of SPOP includes an α-helical segment and a basic nuclear localization signal (residues 365-374), contributing to its dynamic high-order oligomerization (van2013Structural). The BTB domain forms domain-swapped dimers, while the C-terminal domain (CTD) facilitates further oligomerization through a novel dimerization interface (van2013Structural). This oligomerization is crucial for enhancing substrate ubiquitination by the Cul3 E3 ligase complexes (van2013Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate SPOP's interactions with substrates, affecting its ubiquitination activity (Zhuang2009Structures). The protein's structural flexibility allows it to engage multiple SBCs within a single substrate, promoting efficient ubiquitination (Zhuang2009Structures).

## Function
The SPOP gene encodes a protein that functions as a substrate adaptor for the CUL3-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of target proteins. In healthy human cells, SPOP is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including DNA damage response, DNA replication, and maintaining genomic stability (Maekawa2020The). It is particularly important in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks through homology-directed repair, an error-free mechanism active during the S or G2 phase of the cell cycle (Maekawa2020The).

SPOP is active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the transcription of key DNA repair genes such as ATR, BRCA2, ChK1, and Rad51, promoting effective DNA damage response (Maekawa2020The). It also regulates the degradation of oncogenic co-activator SRC-3/AIB1, thereby inhibiting oncogenic signaling pathways and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Li2011Tumorsuppressor). SPOP's role in targeting proteins like DAXX for degradation further highlights its function in modulating transcriptional activity and apoptosis (Kwon2006BTB). Through these activities, SPOP acts as a tumor suppressor, preventing uncontrolled cell growth and contributing to cellular homeostasis (Li2011Tumorsuppressor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPOP gene are implicated in several cancers, notably prostate, endometrial, and kidney cancers. In prostate cancer, SPOP mutations occur in approximately 10-15% of cases and are primarily found in the substrate-binding MATH domain. These mutations impair the degradation of oncogenic proteins such as the androgen receptor (AR), leading to genomic instability and tumor progression (Maekawa2020The; Boysen2015SPOP). SPOP mutations in prostate cancer are associated with impaired DNA repair mechanisms, particularly affecting homology-directed repair, which contributes to increased genomic instability and sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (Boysen2015SPOP).

In endometrial cancer, SPOP mutations are present in about 5% of patients and are located outside the substrate-interacting cleft. These mutations can lead to increased polyubiquitination of certain substrates, suggesting a gain-of-function effect (Maekawa2020The). In kidney cancer, specifically renal cell carcinoma, SPOP is overexpressed and acts as an oncoprotein, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis (Wang2020The).

SPOP mutations also play a role in other cancers, such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma, where they lead to aberrant ubiquitination and stabilization of oncogenic proteins, contributing to malignancy (Yan2022Aberrant). These findings highlight the diverse roles of SPOP mutations in cancer pathogenesis.

## Interactions
SPOP (speckle-type BTB/POZ protein) is a substrate adaptor for the CUL3-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of various protein substrates. It interacts with proteins through its MATH and BTB domains. The MATH domain is responsible for substrate recognition, binding to specific substrate-binding consensus sequences (SBCs) in target proteins such as the phosphatase Puc, the transcriptional regulator Ci, and the chromatin component MacroH2A (Zhuang2009Structures). The BTB domain facilitates dimerization and binding to the Cul3 protein, forming a 2:2 complex with the Cul3 N-terminal adaptor-binding domain (Zhuang2009Structures).

SPOP is involved in multivalent interactions with substrates containing multiple SB motifs, which can lead to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) at high concentrations. This phase separation results in the formation of dense, liquid-like droplets, enhancing SPOP's function by increasing its affinity for substrates and facilitating polyubiquitination (Cuneo2019The). SPOP also interacts with proteins involved in DNA damage repair, such as HIPK2 and 53BP1, and can be recruited to DNA double-strand break foci, where it colocalizes with γ-H2AX foci (Yang2022SPOP). These interactions are crucial for SPOP's role in maintaining genome stability and regulating protein degradation.
