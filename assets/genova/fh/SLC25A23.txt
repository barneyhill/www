# SLC25A23

## Overview
SLC25A23 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 23, a mitochondrial carrier protein involved in the transport of adenine nucleotides and calcium ions (Ca2+) across the mitochondrial membrane. This protein is characterized by its multitransmembrane structure and the presence of EF-hand motifs, which are crucial for its role in Ca2+ binding and sensing. As part of the solute carrier family 25, SLC25A23 plays a significant role in mitochondrial bioenergetics by facilitating the exchange of ATP, ADP, and other substrates in response to Ca2+ levels, thereby influencing cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis (Hoffman2014SLC25A23; Palmieri2013The). The protein's interactions with components of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex, such as MCU and MICU1, are essential for regulating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, which is linked to various cellular processes, including oxidative stress responses and apoptosis (Hoffman2014SLC25A23). SLC25A23 is expressed in several tissues, including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, and its dysregulation has been associated with pathological conditions such as major depressive disorder and cancer (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological; Wang2016Transcriptional).

## Structure
The SLC25A23 protein is a mitochondrial carrier characterized by a multitransmembrane structure with six transmembrane alpha-helices, forming a funnel-shaped cavity open towards the cytosol (Palmieri2013The; Pasquadibisceglie2021Computational). It contains three EF-hand motifs in its N-terminal domain, of which two are functional Ca2+-binding sites, essential for its role in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (Hoffman2014SLC25A23; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). The C-terminal domain includes common mitochondrial carrier family sequence features, facilitating the transport of adenine nucleotides and other substrates (Palmieri2013The).

The protein's structure is supported by a tripartite organization, with each domain containing two hydrophobic stretches that span the membrane as alpha-helices (Palmieri2013The). These domains are involved in the reversible electroneutral counter-exchange of substrates, such as ATP-Mg, Pi, ATP, ADP, and AMP, with proton movement compensating for charge imbalances (Palmieri2013The). SLC25A23's EF-hand domains are crucial for its Ca2+-sensing properties, influencing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and bioenergetics (Hoffman2014SLC25A23). The protein is also implicated in the regulation of metabolic pathways and is highly expressed in various tumors, promoting cancer cell survival (Palmieri2013The).

## Function
SLC25A23 is a mitochondrial carrier protein that plays a crucial role in calcium (Ca2+) uptake within mitochondria, which is essential for maintaining cellular energy metabolism and homeostasis. It is part of the solute carrier family 25 and is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which are involved in Ca2+ binding. This protein facilitates the transport of adenine nucleotides, such as ATP and ADP, in response to Ca2+ levels, thereby influencing mitochondrial bioenergetics and cell survival (Hoffman2014SLC25A23; Palmieri2013The).

SLC25A23 interacts with components of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex, specifically MCU and MICU1, to regulate Ca2+ influx into the mitochondrial matrix. This interaction is vital for Ca2+ homeostasis and is linked to oxidative stress-mediated cell death, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses (Hoffman2014SLC25A23). The protein is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, where it contributes to the regulation of metabolic pathways and protection against cell death (Hoffman2014SLC25A23; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

Through its function in Ca2+ uptake and adenine nucleotide transport, SLC25A23 is integral to mitochondrial function, impacting processes like ATP production and apoptosis regulation, which are crucial for cellular energy homeostasis and organismal health (Palmieri2013The; Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC25A23 gene have been implicated in several pathological conditions. In major depressive disorder (MDD), SLC25A23 expression is significantly increased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting a potential link to the disorder's pathophysiology (Wang2016Transcriptional). This upregulation may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a feature of MDD (Wang2016Transcriptional).

SLC25A23 is also involved in mitochondrial calcium uptake, and its overexpression is observed in cancer cells, where it may help these cells evade death by facilitating mitochondrial permeability transition pore closure (Gutiérrez-Aguilar2013Physiological). This suggests that SLC25A23 could play a role in cancer cell survival and proliferation.

In the context of oxidative stress, SLC25A23 enhances mitochondrial calcium uptake, which can lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress-mediated cell death (Hoffman2014SLC25A23). Knockdown of SLC25A23 has been shown to reduce mitochondrial ROS and protect against oxidative stress-induced cell death, indicating its involvement in cell death pathways (Hoffman2014SLC25A23).

Overall, the altered expression and function of SLC25A23 are associated with various diseases, including mood disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance.

## Interactions
SLC25A23 is a mitochondrial protein that plays a significant role in calcium (Ca2+) uptake and interacts with several key proteins within the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex. It physically interacts with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and MICU1, which are crucial components of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake machinery. These interactions have been demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that SLC25A23 is part of a larger protein complex that regulates mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics (Hoffman2014SLC25A23).

The interaction between SLC25A23 and MCU is thought to involve hydrophobic interactions within their transmembrane regions, while SLC25A23 may interact with MICU1 indirectly through MCU (Hoffman2014SLC25A23). These interactions are essential for modulating the activity of the MCU, as knockdown of SLC25A23 has been shown to reduce Ca2+ currents in mitoplasts, highlighting its role in enhancing MCU activity (Hoffman2014SLC25A23).

SLC25A23 is also involved in the transport of adenine nucleotides in response to Ca2+, and its EF-hand motifs are crucial for its Ca2+-sensing properties, which further influence its interactions and function within the mitochondrial matrix (Hoffman2014SLC25A23).
