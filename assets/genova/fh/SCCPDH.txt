# SCCPDH

## Overview
The SCCPDH gene encodes a putative saccharopine dehydrogenase, an enzyme categorized as an oxidoreductase, which plays a crucial role in lysine metabolism. This enzyme is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it is involved in the conversion of saccharopine to lysine and α-ketoglutarate, a vital step in the lysine degradation pathway (Burton2023DNA). The gene's expression is influenced by its chromatin environment, and it has been implicated in various medical conditions, including preeclampsia and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as potential links to neurological disorders (Shah2023An; Hua2019Gene; Du2014A; Zheng2023Identification). Despite its involvement in metabolic pathways, SCCPDH has not been directly associated with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, although changes in its DNA methylation have been observed in relation to insulin signaling pathways (Burton2023DNA).

## Function
The SCCPDH gene encodes a putative saccharopine dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in lysine metabolism. This enzyme is localized to the mitochondria, where it is predicted to facilitate the conversion of saccharopine to lysine and α-ketoglutarate, a key step in the lysine degradation pathway (Burton2023DNA). Proper lysine metabolism is essential for maintaining cellular energy production and nitrogen balance, which are critical for overall metabolic homeostasis.

In the context of cellular function, SCCPDH is associated with oxidoreductase activity, which plays a role in glycolipid biosynthetic processes (Burton2023DNA). Despite its involvement in these metabolic pathways, SCCPDH has not been directly linked to insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, although changes in its DNA methylation have been observed in relation to insulin signaling pathways in older adults (Burton2023DNA).

The gene's expression and regulation may also be influenced by its chromatin environment. For instance, in cardiac myocytes, SCCPDH expression increases despite higher LB1 occupancy, suggesting that its regulatory elements may not transition to a repressive chromatin state, allowing for continued or enhanced expression (Shah2023An).

## Clinical Significance
The SCCPDH gene has been implicated in several medical conditions through its altered expression and potential mutations. In the context of preeclampsia (PE), SCCPDH has been identified as a potential diagnostic marker. Its expression is upregulated in PE patients, suggesting a role in the condition's pathophysiology. The gene's involvement in lysine metabolism and response to elevated platelet cytosolic Ca2+ may contribute to the regulation of chronic stress, which is linked to anxiety and depression, common in women with PE (Zheng2023Identification).

In cancer research, SCCPDH has been associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Its expression is negatively correlated with survival rates in a Rictor-deficient T-ALL mouse model, indicating that SCCPDH could serve as a potential marker for T-ALL treatment (Hua2019Gene).

Additionally, a genomic copy number variant analysis identified a deletion in the 1q44 region, which includes SCCPDH, in a child with infantile spasms (IS). Although the study primarily focuses on the HNRNPU gene, the presence of SCCPDH in this deletion suggests a possible link to neurological disorders (Du2014A). However, specific diseases directly caused by mutations in SCCPDH are not detailed in the available literature.
