# IQCK

## Overview
The IQCK gene encodes the protein IQ motif containing K, which is a member of the IQ motif-containing family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by the presence of IQ motifs, which are short sequences that typically bind to calmodulin and other EF-hand calcium-binding proteins. The IQCK protein is implicated in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Research suggests that it may play a role in intracellular signaling pathways and cellular regulation, potentially influencing processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their potential involvement in certain pathological conditions, although detailed insights into their clinical significance are still emerging (Qiu2020aarFDC).
