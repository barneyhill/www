# SUCO

## Overview
The SUCO gene encodes the SUN domain-containing ossification factor, a protein that plays a crucial role in bone formation and ossification. This protein is categorized as a structural component involved in the regulation of bone density and skeletal integrity. The SUN domain-containing ossification factor is implicated in various skeletal disorders, including skeletal dysplasia, osteopenia, and osteogenesis imperfecta, due to its involvement in bone development and maintenance (del2024High). Research has highlighted the gene's significance in the context of atypical femoral fractures, where it has been identified as having a notable variant accumulation, suggesting its contribution to fracture susceptibility (del2024High). Understanding the function and interactions of the SUCO gene and its encoded protein is essential for developing potential therapeutic strategies for bone-related pathologies.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SUCO gene, which encodes the SUN domain-containing ossification factor, have been associated with various skeletal disorders. The gene is implicated in conditions such as skeletal dysplasia, osteopenia, and osteogenesis imperfecta, which are characterized by abnormalities in bone density and structure (del2024High). In the context of atypical femoral fractures (AFFs), SUCO has been identified as one of the genes with significant variant accumulation, suggesting its role in increasing the risk of these fractures. This indicates a polygenic nature of AFFs, where multiple genetic factors, including SUCO, contribute to susceptibility (del2024High).

The study of genetic variants in AFF patients revealed that SUCO had a higher alternative allele frequency in these patients compared to osteoporotic controls, highlighting its potential involvement in bone-related pathologies (del2024High). While the specific mechanisms by which SUCO mutations lead to these conditions are not fully understood, the gene's involvement in bone formation and ossification suggests that disruptions in its normal function or expression could significantly impact bone health and integrity. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise role of SUCO in these skeletal disorders and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
