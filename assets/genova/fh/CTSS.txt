# CTSS

## Overview
CTSS is a gene that encodes the protein cathepsin S, a member of the cysteine protease family. Cathepsin S is primarily known for its role in the immune system, where it is involved in the proteolytic processing of antigens for presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, a critical step in the activation of CD4+ T cells (Brown2020Cathepsin; Memmert2017Role). Unlike many other cathepsins, cathepsin S remains active at a neutral pH, allowing it to function in various cellular environments beyond the acidic lysosomal compartments (Doherty2019Protein). In addition to its immunological functions, cathepsin S is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, influencing processes such as tissue repair and tumor invasion (Brown2020Cathepsin; McDowell2020Leading). The gene's expression and mutations have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer, where they can affect tumor progression and response to therapy (Liang2023Prognostic; Dheilly2020Cathepsin).

## Structure
Cathepsin S (CTSS) is a cysteine protease enzyme characterized by a specific molecular structure that facilitates its role in protein degradation and immune response. The primary structure of CTSS consists of a polypeptide chain that includes a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity. The secondary structure of CTSS is composed of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. 

In terms of tertiary structure, CTSS adopts a papain-like fold, a common feature among cysteine proteases, which is crucial for its proteolytic function. This fold allows the enzyme to interact with substrates and inhibitors effectively. The quaternary structure of CTSS may involve dimerization, although this is not a universal feature for all cysteine proteases.

CTSS undergoes common post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its activity, stability, and localization within the cell. These modifications are important for the regulation of CTSS function in various physiological and pathological processes. The structural features of CTSS, including its catalytic triad and papain-like fold, are integral to its role in the immune system and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Function
Cathepsin S (CTSS) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays a significant role in various cellular and molecular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the proteolytic cleavage of proteins, which is crucial for antigen processing and presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. This process is essential for the activation of CD4+ T cells and the regulation of immune responses (Brown2020Cathepsin; Memmert2017Role).

CTSS is active in the lysosomal and endosomal compartments of antigen-presenting cells, such as B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and neutrophils (Brown2020Cathepsin). It is unique among cathepsins for its ability to remain active at a neutral pH, allowing it to function in various cellular environments (Doherty2019Protein).

In addition to its role in immune function, CTSS contributes to extracellular matrix remodeling by degrading structural components such as collagen and elastin, which is vital for tissue maintenance and repair (Brown2020Cathepsin). CTSS also regulates toll-like receptor 9 signaling and can cleave non-matrix proteins, including cytokines and chemokines, influencing inflammation and cellular homeostasis (Brown2020Cathepsin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CTSS gene, which encodes cathepsin S, have significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly in cancers. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), especially follicular lymphoma (FL), CTSS is overexpressed and frequently mutated, with the Y132D mutation being notable for increasing the protease activity of CTSS. This mutation enhances antigen processing and communication with CD4+ T follicular helper cells, contributing to immune evasion by tumors (Dheilly2020Cathepsin). CTSS overexpression in FL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is associated with increased proteolytic activity, although it does not affect gene expression levels (Dheilly2020Cathepsin).

In the context of cancer prognosis, CTSS expression varies across different cancer types. High CTSS expression correlates with better survival outcomes in bladder urothelial carcinoma and skin cutaneous melanoma, but with poorer outcomes in brain lower grade glioma and uveal melanoma (Liang2023Prognostic). CTSS is also linked to tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability, influencing responses to immunotherapy (Liang2023Prognostic). In FL, CTSS expression is associated with the immune microenvironment, correlating with PDCD1 expression and affecting the response to anti-PD1 therapy (Liang2023Prognostic; Dheilly2020Cathepsin).

## Interactions
Cathepsin S (CTSS) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily within the immune system and extracellular matrix. It plays a crucial role in the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway by cleaving the invariant chain (CD74), which is essential for antigen loading onto MHC class II molecules. This interaction is significant in antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages (Turk2012Cysteine; Wilkinson2015Cathepsin).

CTSS is also regulated by endogenous inhibitors, with cystatin C being the most potent. Cystatin C physically blocks the active site of CTSS, preventing substrate binding and maintaining a balance between protease and antiprotease activities (Brown2020Cathepsin). The CTSS:cystatin C ratio is particularly important in conditions like COPD, where an imbalance can lead to disease progression (Brown2020Cathepsin).

In the tumor microenvironment, CTSS interacts with extracellular matrix components, contributing to ECM remodeling by degrading proteins such as collagen and elastin. This activity is crucial for processes like angiogenesis and tumor invasion (McDowell2020Leading). CTSS also interacts with glycosaminoglycans, which can modulate its activity and stability (Brown2020Cathepsin).
