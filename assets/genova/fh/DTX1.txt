# DTX1

## Overview
DTX1 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the protein deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 1, a member of the Deltex family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by its role in the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. Deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 1 is involved in several cellular processes, including the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cell differentiation and immune function (Wang2021Functions). The protein's structure includes a WWE domain, a proline-rich region, and a RING-H2 domain, which are integral to its function as an E3 ligase (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The). DTX1's interactions with various proteins, such as NOTCH1 and c-FLIP, underscore its multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation, with implications in cancer biology and immune responses (Hsu2018cFLIP; Scalia2023The).

## Structure
The DTX1 protein is characterized by a conserved three-domain structural organization, which includes an N-terminal WWE domain, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal RING-H2 domain (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The). The WWE domain is involved in binding to the ankyrin repeats of the Notch receptor, playing a role in Notch signaling regulation (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The). The proline-rich region contributes to Notch regulation and is a constitutive component of the DTX domain-II (Scalia2023The). The RING-H2 domain, a classical RING domain, is crucial for the E3 ligase activity of DTX1, facilitating ubiquitination processes (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The).

DTX1 also contains an SH3 motif, which may facilitate binding to signaling adaptors like GRB2, indicating potential differences in physical interactions and cellular functions (Scalia2023The). The protein is predominantly found in the nucleus, where it interacts with co-activator p300, suggesting a role as a transcriptional regulator (Scalia2023The). DTX1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which regulates its function and stability (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The).

## Function
DTX1, located on chromosome 12, encodes a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in cell differentiation and immune function. It is involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for the development of thymocytes and other cell types, regulating the differentiation of B cells, T cells, and smooth muscle cells (Wang2021Functions). DTX1 interacts with proteins such as HES1 and AIP4 to modulate its activity and stability, influencing the differentiation of neural and glial cells and regulating T-cell anergy, a state of immune unresponsiveness (Wang2021Functions).

In regulatory T cells (Tregs), DTX1 antagonizes hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) to sustain the stability of the Foxp3 protein, which is crucial for Treg function. This process involves promoting the degradation of HIF-1α, thereby preventing Foxp3 degradation and maintaining Treg stability and function (Hsiao2015Deltex1). DTX1's role in T cell anergy involves the ubiquitination and degradation of signaling molecules like protein kinase C theta (PKCθ), which is essential for maintaining peripheral T cell tolerance (Hsu2014Deltex1). Through these mechanisms, DTX1 contributes to normal cell differentiation and immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DTX1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), DTX1 mutations are found in approximately 12% of cases, particularly affecting the WWE1 domain, which is crucial for protein interactions. These mutations impair DTX1's ability to repress Notch1-induced transcription, potentially contributing to oncogenesis by affecting Notch signaling pathways (de2014Exome). In glioblastoma, DTX1 overexpression is associated with increased tumor cell aggressiveness, invasiveness, and poor patient prognosis. It influences signaling pathways such as PI3K/PKB/mTOR and MAPK/ERK, which are linked to cell proliferation and survival (Huber2013Deltex1).

In gastric cancer, DTX1 plays a tumor-suppressive role by promoting the degradation of c-FLIP, enhancing TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Lower DTX1 expression in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues suggests its involvement in tumor progression (Hsu2018cFLIP). In lung cancer, DTX1 mutations have contrasting effects; they are associated with better survival in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but correlate with a worse response to chemotherapy in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Wang2021Functions). These findings highlight the complex role of DTX1 in cancer, where its effects can vary significantly depending on the cancer type and context.

## Interactions
DTX1, a member of the Deltex family of E3 ubiquitin ligases, engages in several significant protein interactions. It binds to NOTCH1 through its WWE-domain-containing N-terminal region, facilitating the deubiquitination and activation of NOTCH1, which is crucial for NOTCH nuclear translocation (Scalia2023The). DTX1 also interacts with eIF3f, playing a role in the DTX1-NOTCH signaling axis, and with the signaling adaptor Grb2 via its SH3 motif, indicating regulation by receptor tyrosine kinase-generated signals (Scalia2023The).

DTX1 forms heterodimers with DTX3L, enhancing its ubiquitin ligase activity (Scalia2023The). It interacts with the co-activator p300, competing for transcriptional activation of various genes, and is involved in transcriptional regulation both in a NOTCH-dependent and independent manner (Scalia2023The). DTX1 also binds to PAR (poly(ADP-ribose)), which is essential for its function in DNA damage response pathways, such as homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (Kang2022Proteomewide).

In cancer contexts, DTX1 interacts with c-FLIP, promoting its degradation through the endosome-lysosomal pathway, which enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells (Hsu2018cFLIP). These interactions highlight DTX1's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation.
