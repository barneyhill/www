# PANK4

## Overview
PANK4 is a gene that encodes the protein pantothenate kinase 4, which is classified as a pseudo-pantothenate kinase due to its lack of catalytic activity. Despite its inability to function as a kinase, PANK4 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of apoptosis and glucose metabolism. The protein contains an amino-terminal Type II pantothenate kinase domain and a carboxy-terminal phosphatase domain, but it lacks the active site residues necessary for kinase activity, distinguishing it from other active PANK proteins (Yao2019Human). PANK4 interacts with several proteins, such as Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2), influencing processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and energy metabolism (Li2005High; Li2022Pantothenate). Clinically, mutations in the PANK4 gene have been associated with autosomal dominant congenital posterior cataract, highlighting its potential role in disease pathogenesis through regulatory functions rather than enzymatic activity (Sun2019A; Yao2019Human).

## Structure
The human PANK4 gene encodes a protein that is classified as a pseudo-pantothenate kinase due to its lack of catalytic activity. The molecular structure of PANK4 includes an amino-terminal Type II pantothenate kinase domain and a carboxy-terminal phosphatase domain. However, it lacks the active site residues necessary for kinase activity, specifically due to the substitutions of Glu138 with Val and Arg207 with Trp, which are crucial for catalysis in active PANK proteins (Yao2019Human).

The primary structure of PANK4 is characterized by these key amino acid substitutions that render it inactive. The secondary and tertiary structures are not detailed in the available context, but the protein is predicted to have regions that interact with ATP, similar to other PANKs, although these interactions are disrupted by the substitutions (Yao2019Human).

PANK4 is involved in various intracellular pathways despite its lack of enzymatic activity, suggesting it may have structural roles or interact with other proteins. The protein's expression levels are associated with certain congenital diseases, indicating its potential involvement in cellular processes beyond CoA biosynthesis (Yao2019Human).

## Function
PANK4, or pantothenate kinase 4, is classified as a pseudo-pantothenate kinase due to specific amino acid substitutions that render it catalytically inactive. Despite lacking kinase activity, PANK4 is involved in several cellular processes. It is implicated in the regulation of apoptosis, particularly in insulin-secreting cells and human lens epithelial cells (LECs), where its expression is crucial for cell survival. In LECs, PANK4 helps prevent apoptosis, and its dysfunction is associated with cataract formation (Sun2019A; Yao2019Human).

PANK4 is also involved in glucose metabolism. It is upregulated by high glucose levels and interacts with m2-type pyruvate kinase (Pkm2), suggesting a role in modulating glucose metabolism. This interaction occurs in the cytoplasm, where both proteins are co-localized, indicating a potential regulatory mechanism in energy metabolism (Li2005High).

Although PANK4 does not contribute to Coenzyme A biosynthesis due to its lack of kinase activity, it may have alternative functions related to its phosphatase domain. These functions remain to be fully elucidated, but PANK4's role in cellular pathways suggests it may have regulatory functions rather than enzymatic activity (Yao2019Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PANK4 gene have been linked to autosomal dominant congenital posterior cataract. A specific heterozygous C→T transition at intron 4 of PANK4 has been identified as a likely cause of this condition. This mutation was found in affected family members but not in unaffected members or control chromosomes, suggesting a strong association with the disease (Sun2019A). The mutation leads to significantly reduced PANK4 protein and mRNA expression levels in cataract patients, which may contribute to the development of cataracts by affecting lens epithelial cell function and crystallin gene expression (Sun2019A).

In Pank4-mutant mice, the absence of PANK4 expression results in increased apoptosis of lens epithelial cells and changes in lens cell morphology, further supporting the role of PANK4 in cataract formation (Sun2019A). Although PANK4 is classified as a pseudoenzyme due to specific mutations that render it catalytically inactive, its regulatory functions, possibly through protein-protein interactions or gene expression modulation, may still play a role in disease processes (Yao2019Human).

## Interactions
Pantothenate kinase 4 (PANK4) is known to interact with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. A significant interaction is with Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2), where PANK4 negatively regulates PKM2 in lens epithelial cells. This interaction is crucial for processes such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis in the lens epithelium. In Pank4 knockout mice, elevated levels of PKM2 were observed, indicating that PANK4 suppresses PKM2 expression (Li2022Pantothenate). The interaction between PANK4 and PKM2 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrated a binding relationship between these proteins (Li2005High).

PANK4 also interacts with PKM2 in the context of glucose metabolism. High glucose conditions upregulate PANK4 expression, which in turn affects PKM2 activity. This interaction was validated through various assays, including GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation, showing that PANK4 and PKM2 co-localize in the cytoplasm of cells (Li2005High).

Additionally, PANK4 has been identified as a pseudoenzyme, meaning it lacks catalytic activity but still participates in protein interactions. It interacts with several other proteins, including LDHA, LDHB, and HSP90AB1, which may contribute to its cellular functions despite its lack of enzymatic activity (Yao2019Human).
