# WWP2

## Overview
WWP2, or WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Nedd4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by its domain structure, which includes a C2 domain, multiple WW domains, and a HECT domain, each contributing to its function in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (Jiang2015Expression; Gong2015Structure). The WWP2 protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription factors and signaling pathways, by tagging specific proteins for degradation. It is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, such as stem cell pluripotency, cartilage homeostasis, and palatogenesis (Xu2009WWP2; Nakamura2011Wwp2; Mokuda2019Wwp2). Additionally, WWP2 has clinical significance in diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disorders, and diabetes, where its expression and function can influence disease progression and therapeutic outcomes (Jung2014Notch3; Zhang2020WWP2; You2023Downregulation).

## Structure
WWP2, or WW domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2, is a protein characterized by its domain architecture, which includes a C2 domain at the N-terminus, multiple WW domains, and a C-terminal HECT domain. The C2 domain is involved in membrane targeting, while the WW domains facilitate protein-protein interactions, crucial for substrate recognition and binding (Jiang2015Expression). The HECT domain is responsible for the ubiquitin ligase activity, catalyzing the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins (Gong2015Structure).

The HECT domain of WWP2 has been crystallized and exhibits an inverted T-shape, showing a high degree of structural conservation with other members of the Nedd4 family (Gong2015Structure). The crystallographic analysis revealed that the HECT domain structure is refined to a resolution of 2.50 Å, highlighting the importance of the C-terminal region for catalytic activity, particularly the terminal acidic residue (Gong2015Structure).

WWP2 is known to interact with various binding partners, such as GST-PTEN and GST-E2 (UBcH7), through its WW and HECT domains, despite structural differences from its homologues (Jiang2015Expression). The protein's molecular weight is approximately 42.2 kDa for the HECT domain alone (Gong2015Structure).

## Function
The WWP2 gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes by tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In human embryonic stem cells, WWP2 regulates the levels of the transcription factor OCT4, which is crucial for maintaining pluripotency. WWP2 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of OCT4, thereby controlling its protein levels and ensuring proper stem cell function (Xu2009WWP2).

In cartilage, WWP2 is involved in maintaining homeostasis by regulating the Runx2-Adamts5 signaling pathway. It acts as a protective factor against cartilage degradation, particularly in the context of osteoarthritis. WWP2 achieves this by promoting the poly-ubiquitination and degradation of Runx2, a transcription factor that can upregulate Adamts5, an enzyme linked to cartilage destruction (Mokuda2019Wwp2).

WWP2 also plays a role in palatogenesis through its interaction with Sox9, a transcription factor essential for chondrogenesis. WWP2 enhances Sox9's transcriptional activity by facilitating its nuclear localization and forming a transcriptional complex with Sox9 and Med25, which is crucial for the development of cartilage and the palate (Nakamura2011Wwp2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the WWP2 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In ovarian cancer, WWP2 acts as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating Notch3 signaling. Down-regulation or genetic deletion of WWP2 is observed in many ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas, leading to enhanced Notch3 signaling, which promotes cancer stem cell maintenance and platinum resistance. Overexpression of WWP2 can suppress tumor development and induce cell cycle arrest in these cancer cells (Jung2014Notch3).

In the context of cardiovascular diseases, WWP2 is involved in hypertensive angiopathy by regulating SIRT1-STAT3 acetylation and phosphorylation. Alterations in WWP2 expression can lead to increased vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, contributing to vascular remodeling and hypertension (Zhang2020WWP2). WWP2 also plays a role in cardiac fibrosis, where its interaction with SMAD2 signaling promotes fibrotic responses. Loss of WWP2 function can reduce cardiac fibrosis and improve cardiac function, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for heart diseases (Chen2019WWP2).

In type 2 diabetes mellitus, down-regulation of WWP2 exacerbates vascular endothelial injury, highlighting its role in diabetic vascular complications (You2023Downregulation).

## Interactions
WWP2, a WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2, where WWP2 binds to the PPxY motifs at both the amino-terminus and carboxyl-terminus of ADAR2. This interaction leads to the poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ADAR2, regulating its protein levels (Marcucci2011Pin1).

WWP2 also forms a heterodimer with WWP1, another E3 ligase, to regulate the ubiquitination and degradation of the ΔNp73 isoform, maintaining the balance between p73 and ΔNp73 levels in cells. This interaction is crucial for apoptosis regulation and is independent of WWP2's catalytic function (Chaudhary2014WWP2WWP1).

In the context of TGFβ signaling, WWP2 interacts with Smad7, particularly through its WW4 domain. This interaction is enhanced by phosphorylation of Smad7, which increases the binding affinity and promotes Smad7 degradation (Wahl2019Smad7).

WWP2 also negatively regulates Notch3 signaling in ovarian cancer by interacting with the intracellular domain of Notch3, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation, which suppresses Notch3-mediated cancer phenotypes (Jung2014Notch3).
