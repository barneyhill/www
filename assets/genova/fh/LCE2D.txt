# LCE2D

## Overview
LCE2D (late cornified envelope 2D) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a crucial component of the epidermal barrier. The protein encoded by LCE2D is part of the late cornified envelope protein family, which plays a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the epidermis. This differentiation process is essential for the development of a robust and protective outer skin layer, which is vital for maintaining skin integrity and preventing dehydration and pathogen entry (Danielsson2014Genes). LCE2D is located within the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1q21, a region rich in genes essential for skin barrier formation and maintenance (Tomimatsu2020Locusspecific). The expression of LCE2D is tightly regulated by transcription factors and chromatin structure, ensuring its specific expression in the epidermis and its contribution to skin differentiation and barrier function (Smirnov2023Epigenetic).

## Function
LCE2D (late cornified envelope 2D) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical component of the epidermal barrier. This protein plays a significant role in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis. During this process, keratinocytes undergo a series of changes that culminate in the formation of a tough, protective layer that helps maintain skin integrity and prevent dehydration and pathogen entry (Danielsson2014Genes).

The expression of LCE2D is associated with the late stages of keratinocyte differentiation, where it contributes to the development of the skin's outermost layer (Smirnov2023Epigenetic). The gene is part of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) located on chromosome 1q21, which is enriched with genes involved in skin barrier formation and maintenance (Tomimatsu2020Locusspecific). LCE2D expression is regulated by specific transcription factors and enhancers, such as those involving p63 and CTCF, which help establish the chromatin structure necessary for its expression in a tissue-specific manner (Smirnov2023Epigenetic). This regulation ensures that LCE2D is expressed primarily in the epidermis, contributing to its specialized function in skin differentiation and barrier formation.

## Clinical Significance
LCE2D, a gene within the late cornified envelope family, has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), LCE2D is identified as a significant node in the protein-protein interaction network related to alpha linolenic acid metabolism. The study suggests that the downregulation of this metabolic pathway, including LCE2D, may contribute to the distinct metabolic status observed in NPC tumor tissues compared to normal tissues (Fang2022Identification).

In bladder cancer, LCE2D is associated with poor overall survival. The gene is among the top 20 genes linked to adverse outcomes, with its mRNA levels upregulated in a significant percentage of cases. This upregulation suggests a potential role in promoting bladder cancer progression, particularly through involvement in cell division and the cell cycle (Yu2019DNA).

LCE2D is also noted for its high expression in human skin, being part of the late cornified envelope proteins that contribute to skin barrier function. While specific diseases directly linked to LCE2D mutations are not detailed, its role in skin barrier formation suggests potential implications in skin disorders like psoriasis, where barrier function is compromised (Edqvist2014Expression).
