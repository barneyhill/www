# ITIH4

## Overview
Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 (ITIH4) is a gene that encodes a secretory glycoprotein, which is a member of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family. The ITIH4 protein is primarily synthesized in the liver and plays a crucial role in stabilizing the extracellular matrix by binding to hyaluronic acid, thereby maintaining tissue integrity and facilitating repair processes (Hamm2008Frequent; Chang2021Pancancer). It is characterized by specific structural domains, including a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain and EF-hand motifs, which suggest its involvement in calcium-binding and interactions with various extracellular components (Cai1998Identification). Functionally, ITIH4 is implicated in modulating inflammatory responses and cholesterol metabolism, acting as an anti-inflammatory agent and influencing plasma cholesterol levels (Fujita2003Hypercholesterolemia; Chen2021Alveolar). Clinically, alterations in ITIH4 expression are associated with several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, lung adenocarcinoma, and prostate cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhai2021Construction; Lima2021Bioinformatic).

## Structure
The ITIH4 protein is a secretory protein with a full-length sequence of 930 amino acids, resulting in a molecular weight of 103,357.4 Da and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.51 (Khakha2019Insilico). It is synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide, 28 amino acids long, which is cleaved during biosynthesis to target the protein to the extracellular matrix (Khakha2019Insilico). The protein is classified as unstable with an instability index of 44.51 and has an aliphatic index of 84.49, indicating a hydrophobic composition (Khakha2019Insilico).

ITIH4 contains specific domains, including a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA) domain near the amino terminus, which is crucial for interactions with platelet membrane receptors and is involved in ligand binding (Cai1998Identification). This domain is associated with interactions with integrins, collagen, proteoglycans, and heparin, suggesting a role in extracellular matrix interactions (Cai1998Identification). The protein also contains two EF-hand helix-loop-helix motifs, indicative of a potential calcium-binding function (Cai1998Identification).

Post-translational modifications of ITIH4 include glycosylation, with 28 possible O-linked glycosylation sites, phosphorylation at 31 serine, 13 threonine, and 8 tyrosine residues, and ubiquitination at five lysine residues (Khakha2019Insilico). These modifications are important for its attachment to bikunin and its function as a serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor (Khakha2019Insilico).

## Function
The ITIH4 gene encodes a glycoprotein that is part of the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor family, primarily expressed in liver tissue. ITIH4 plays a significant role in stabilizing the extracellular matrix by binding to hyaluronic acid, which is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and repair (Hamm2008Frequent; Chang2021Pancancer). This stabilization function is important in various physiological processes, including development and inflammation, where ITIH4 acts as an anti-apoptotic and matrix-stabilizing molecule (Fujita2003Hypercholesterolemia; Chen2021Alveolar).

In healthy human cells, ITIH4 is involved in modulating inflammatory responses. It functions as an anti-inflammatory protein, with its levels decreasing in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) (Chen2021Alveolar). ITIH4 also plays a role in the immune response, as evidenced by its involvement in acute ischemic stroke, where it acts as an anti-inflammatory marker (Chang2021Pancancer).

Additionally, ITIH4 has been implicated in cholesterol metabolism, with genetic variations in the ITIH4 locus influencing plasma cholesterol levels, suggesting a role in lipid regulation (Fujita2003Hypercholesterolemia). Overall, ITIH4 contributes to maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis through its involvement in extracellular matrix stabilization and modulation of inflammatory processes.

## Clinical Significance
The ITIH4 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In rheumatoid arthritis, ITIH4 is an IL-6-dependent acute phase protein with increased expression during acute phase inflammation, suggesting its role in T cell-mediated inflammation in the synovial region (Khakha2019Insilico). In lung adenocarcinoma, high ITIH4 expression is associated with poor overall survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhai2021Construction). Similarly, in gallbladder carcinoma, ITIH4 is highly expressed and linked to poor prognosis, highlighting its involvement in the tumor microenvironment (Yang2021Mining).

In prostate cancer, ITIH4 is consistently downregulated in both high-grade and low-grade tumors compared to normal tissue, and its decreased abundance in urine suggests its potential as a urinary biomarker (Lima2021Bioinformatic). Additionally, genetic polymorphisms in ITIH4, such as rs2535633, have been associated with infant rapid weight gain and increased BMI in adults, indicating its role in obesity-related traits (Zhang2021Associations). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ITIH4 in various diseases, making it a potential target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
ITIH4 (inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in biological processes. ITIH4 interacts with hyaluronan, a component of the extracellular matrix, contributing to tissue stabilization and repair. This interaction is crucial in the context of rheumatoid arthritis, where ITIH4 is implicated in modulating inflammation and matrix reconstruction (Khakha2019Insilico).

The protein also interacts with several immune-related proteins, including CD4 and IL-2, suggesting its involvement in immune modulatory pathways. These interactions may influence inflammation caused by T cell activation, highlighting ITIH4's role in immune response regulation (Khakha2019Insilico).

In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, citrullinated ITIH4 (cit-ITIH4) has been shown to interact with components of the complement system, such as C5a, affecting neutrophil migration. Native ITIH4 decreases C5a concentration, potentially inhibiting the complement cascade, while cit-ITIH4 activates it, promoting neutrophil migration and contributing to arthritis pathogenesis (Osada2020Citrullinated).

These interactions underscore ITIH4's multifaceted role in inflammation and immune regulation, particularly in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.
