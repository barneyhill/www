# TYK2

## Overview
TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2) is a gene that encodes a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, which is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. The protein product of TYK2 plays a pivotal role in the signaling pathways of various cytokines, including type I interferons and interleukins, which are essential for immune system function. As a kinase, TYK2 is involved in the phosphorylation of cytokine receptors and signal transducers, facilitating the activation of downstream signaling cascades that regulate gene expression. The structural complexity of TYK2, characterized by its multiple functional domains, allows it to interact with cytokine receptors and other proteins, modulating immune responses. Mutations in the TYK2 gene have been linked to immune system disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in both protective and pathogenic contexts (Gorman2019The; Minegishi2006Human; Lupardus2014Structure).

## Structure
TYK2 (tyrosine kinase 2) is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several functional domains. The primary structure of TYK2 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming distinct domains such as the FERM, SH2-like, pseudokinase, and kinase domains. The pseudokinase domain, although lacking key catalytic residues, plays a crucial regulatory role by interacting with the kinase domain to maintain the protein in an inactive state until activation is triggered by receptor dimerization (Lupardus2014Structure).

The secondary structure of TYK2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the formation of a bilobate protein kinase fold in the kinase domain, which is a common feature among kinases (Lupardus2014Structure). The pseudokinase domain also adopts a bilobate fold, showing high structural similarity to other JAK family members like JAK1 and JAK2 (Lupardus2014Structure).

In terms of tertiary structure, the interaction between the pseudokinase and kinase domains forms an autoinhibitory interface, crucial for regulating TYK2 activity. This interface is characterized by a hydrophobic core and several polar contacts, with specific residues such as Phe672 playing a key role (Lupardus2014Structure).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, are essential for TYK2 activation, as mutations that disrupt the pseudokinase-kinase interface can lead to increased kinase activity and are associated with certain malignancies (Lupardus2014Structure).

## Function
The TYK2 gene encodes a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, playing a crucial role in cytokine signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, TYK2 is involved in the signaling of multiple cytokines, including type I interferons (IFNs), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-23, which are essential for both innate and acquired immunity (Strobl2011Tyrosine; Minegishi2006Human). TYK2 functions by associating with cytokine receptors on the cell surface, where it becomes activated upon cytokine binding. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of cytokine receptors and neighboring JAKs, creating docking sites for signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Phosphorylated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene expression (Minegishi2006Human).

TYK2 is essential for the high-affinity binding of IFN-α to its receptor complex, which includes the subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. It plays a role in the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in response to IFN-α, which is crucial for the transcription of IFN-inducible genes (Minegishi2006Human; Yeh2000A). TYK2 also stabilizes the surface expression of IFNAR1, preventing its degradation and endocytosis, which is vital for effective cytokine signaling (Ragimbeau2003The). Overall, TYK2 is indispensable for proper immune signaling and function in healthy human cells (Minegishi2006Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TYK2 gene are associated with a range of immune system disorders, including primary immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases. The TYK2 P1104A variant is linked to protection against autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS) by reducing signaling activity in pathways involving IL-12, IL-23, and IFN I, which are crucial for T cell differentiation (Gorman2019The). However, this variant also increases susceptibility to severe mycobacterial diseases, including tuberculosis, due to impaired IL-23-dependent IFN-γ immunity (BoissonDupuis2018Tuberculosis).

Complete TYK2 deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, results in increased susceptibility to intracellular bacterial and viral infections due to impaired cytokine signaling, particularly in the IL-12/IFN-γ pathway (Sarrafzadeh2019A). Compound heterozygous mutations in TYK2 can lead to primary immunodeficiency with T-cell lymphopenia, affecting cytokine signaling pathways and contributing to clinical manifestations of immunodeficiency (Nemoto2018Compound). These mutations can result in diverse clinical phenotypes, including disruptions in T and B cell populations and altered cytokine responses, complicating the clinical diagnosis and understanding of TYK2's role in immune regulation (Lv2021Novel).

## Interactions
TYK2, a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cytokine signaling. TYK2 interacts with the alpha interferon receptor 1 subunit (IFNaR1), where it binds to a specific 33-amino-acid domain within IFNaR1, spanning residues 479 to 511. This interaction is crucial for the tyrosine phosphorylation of TYK2, a key step in the IFNα signaling pathway (Yan1996Molecular). The binding domain of TYK2 on IFNaR1 is essential for the activation of the signaling pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of STAT proteins and subsequent gene transcription (Yan1998Definition).

TYK2 also plays a role in regulating the cell surface expression of the IFNAR1 chain of the type I IFN receptor. It enhances the surface expression of IFNAR1, which is necessary for effective signaling (Ragimbeau2003The). The interaction between TYK2 and IFNaR1 involves a reciprocal effect on the conformation and catalytic performance of TYK2, potentially preventing endocytosis of IFNAR1 by masking endocytic motifs (Ragimbeau2003The).

These interactions highlight TYK2's role in modulating immune responses through its association with cytokine receptors and its involvement in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.
