# SSPN

## Overview
The SSPN gene encodes sarcospan, a 25-kDa transmembrane protein that is integral to the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in muscle cells. Sarcospan is characterized by its four α-helical transmembrane regions and is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cell membranes by linking the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (Peter2017Nanospan; Mokhonova2024The). It plays a crucial role in muscle function by stabilizing the sarcolemma during contraction and facilitating protein-protein interactions that are essential for cell adhesion and signaling (Mokhonova2024The). The protein is also implicated in signal transduction pathways that promote muscle repair and regeneration, and its absence is associated with muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (Mokhonova2024The; Shu2019Development). Sarcospan's interactions with other proteins, including integrins and sarcoglycans, underscore its importance in maintaining muscle integrity and function (Marshall2013Sarcospan:; Mokhonova2024The).

## Structure
Sarcospan (SSPN) is a 25-kDa transmembrane protein that is a core component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in muscle cells. It is characterized by four α-helical transmembrane regions (TM1-TM4), two extracellular loops (EL1 and EL2), and three cytoplasmic regions, including the N-terminus, C-terminus, and a short loop connecting TM2 and TM3 (Peter2017Nanospan; Mokhonova2024The). The EL2 region is crucial for SSPN's targeting to the sarcolemma and its oligomerization, as well as for interactions with other proteins, such as sarcoglycans (Mokhonova2024The). SSPN forms homo-oligomers at the cell surface, enhancing cell adhesion and signaling (Mokhonova2024The).

SSPN undergoes alternative splicing to generate different isoforms, including microspan (μSPN) and nanospan (nSPN). μSPN is a 14-kDa protein with two transmembrane domains, while nSPN is a 10.5-kDa protein with a single transmembrane domain (Peter2017Nanospan). These isoforms are localized to the sarcoplasmic reticulum rather than the sarcolemma, suggesting distinct functions from SSPN, potentially related to Ca2+ regulation within the SR (Peter2017Nanospan). SSPN is also associated with integrin α7β1, the predominant integrin in skeletal muscle, and plays a role in linking the intracellular actin cytoskeleton with the extracellular matrix (Mokhonova2024The).

## Function
Sarcospan (SSPN) is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells. It is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and the utrophin-glycoprotein complex (UGC), which are essential for linking the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in muscle tissues. This connection is crucial for stabilizing the sarcolemma, the cell membrane of muscle cells, during contraction and preventing damage (Mokhonova2024The; Shu2019Development).

SSPN interacts with sarcoglycans to form a subcomplex that stabilizes α-dystroglycan at the sarcolemma, contributing to the structural stability of muscle cell membranes (Gibbs2021Loss). It also associates with integrin α7β1, enhancing cell adhesion and mechanotransduction (Mokhonova2024The). SSPN's role extends to facilitating protein-protein interactions at the cell membrane, acting as a scaffold for assembling multimeric transmembrane protein complexes (Mokhonova2024The).

In addition to its structural roles, SSPN is involved in signal transduction processes that are important for muscle repair and regeneration, such as the activation of the pro-regenerative Akt/p70s6K signaling pathway (Shu2019Development). Its expression is crucial for maintaining muscle integrity, and its absence is linked to muscular dystrophies like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) (Mokhonova2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SSPN gene, which encodes the sarcospan protein, have significant clinical implications, particularly in muscular dystrophies. SSPN is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), crucial for maintaining muscle cell membrane integrity. Its absence or reduced expression is linked to Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), where it is often absent in muscle biopsies from patients (Marshall2013Sarcospan:; Mokhonova2024The). Overexpression of SSPN in mdx mice, a model for DMD, has been shown to ameliorate muscle pathology by stabilizing the sarcolemma and enhancing membrane stability, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Marshall2013Sarcospan:; Gibbs2016High).

SSPN also interacts with integrins and affects the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, which is essential for muscle cell adhesion. Its deficiency can lead to impaired muscle regeneration and increased susceptibility to damage (Marshall2013Sarcospan:). While SSPN mutations have not been directly linked to congenital heart disease, its interaction with cardiac transcription factors like Nkx2-5 suggests a role in cardiac development, particularly in the formation of the muscular ventricular septum (Panzer2017Nkx25).

## Interactions
Sarcospan (SSPN) is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which is crucial for muscle cell membrane stability. SSPN interacts with several proteins, forming a subcomplex with sarcoglycans (SGs), which are single-pass transmembrane glycoproteins. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the sarcolemma, the outer membrane of muscle cells (Marshall2013Sarcospan:).

SSPN is also associated with integrin α7β1, the predominant integrin in skeletal muscle, and functions as a scaffold for protein-protein interactions at the cell membrane. It enhances cell adhesion, signaling, and mechanotransduction by interacting with multimeric transmembrane protein complexes, including the DGC, utrophin-glycoprotein complex (UGC), and α7β1-integrin complex (Mokhonova2024The).

SSPN's interaction with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex is crucial for its localization to the sarcolemma and its oligomerization, which is important for interactions with sarcoglycans. These interactions help maintain membrane integrity and are vital for muscle function and extracellular matrix attachment (Marshall2013Sarcospan:; Mokhonova2024The). SSPN also affects the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, enhancing its laminin-binding activity, which is crucial for muscle integrity (Marshall2013Sarcospan:).
