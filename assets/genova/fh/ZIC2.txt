# ZIC2

## Overview
ZIC2 is a gene that encodes the Zic family member 2 protein, a zinc finger transcription factor involved in various developmental processes. The ZIC2 protein is characterized by its C2H2-type zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. It plays a pivotal role in early embryonic development, particularly in neural and cardiac differentiation, by influencing pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog signaling (Aruga2004The; Chan2011Zic2). Mutations in the ZIC2 gene are notably associated with holoprosencephaly, a severe congenital disorder affecting forebrain development, and have implications in certain cancers due to its regulatory functions in cell proliferation (Solomon2009Mutations; Brown2001Holoprosencephaly). The protein's interactions with other molecular complexes underscore its significance in transcriptional activation and developmental regulation (Ishiguro2007ZIC2dependent).

## Structure
The ZIC2 protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding capability. It contains five tandemly repeated C2H2-type zinc finger domains, designated as ZF1 through ZF5, with higher sequence conservation observed in ZF2-ZF5 compared to ZF1 (Aruga2018Comparative). The zinc finger domain of ZIC2 corresponds to amino acids 243-434 (Mizugishi2001Molecular). These domains are involved in transcriptional regulation and are similar to those found in Gli proteins, which are part of the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway (Mizugishi2001Molecular).

The ZIC2 protein also features a ZOC domain at the amino-terminal end, which is necessary for transcriptional activation and interacts with proteins such as I-mfa, affecting its nuclear localization (Aruga2006A; Ishiguro2004Molecular). The ZF-NC domain, located immediately amino-terminal to the zinc finger domains, is conserved across various animal phyla (Aruga2018Comparative).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, influencing the protein's function and interactions. Alternative splicing can result in different isoforms of ZIC2, potentially affecting its functional properties and interactions with other proteins (Aruga2004The). The structural integrity and function of ZIC2 are also dependent on the spacing between its zinc fingers and the poly-Alanine tract (Roessler2009The).

## Function
ZIC2 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in early embryonic development, particularly in the formation of cardiac progenitors and neural structures. In the context of human cardiogenesis, ZIC2 is essential for the differentiation of early mesodermal precursors into cardiac progenitors. It influences the cell fate decision through the APLNR-related signaling pathway, ensuring the proper formation of cardiac mesodermal precursors marked by genes such as MESP1, TBX6, and EOMES (Xu2020Genomewide). ZIC2 mutations in human embryonic stem cells result in a significant reduction in cardiomyocyte differentiation capabilities, indicating its crucial role in cardiac commitment and differentiation (Xu2020Genomewide).

In neural development, ZIC2 is involved in cerebellar patterning and the determination of the uncrossed retinal axon pathway. It is expressed in the cerebellar midline and is necessary for the proper projection of retinal ganglion cells at the optic chiasm, which is essential for binocular vision (Aruga2004The). ZIC2 also functions as a transcriptional regulator, modulating the activity of transcription factors like TCF4 in pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin signaling, acting as a cofactor in transcriptional repression complexes (Pourebrahim2011Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZIC2 gene are a significant cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE), a congenital malformation characterized by the failure of the forebrain to properly divide into two hemispheres. ZIC2 mutations account for approximately 3-4% of HPE cases and are one of the most common single-gene causes of non-syndromic HPE (Solomon2009Mutations; Brown2001Holoprosencephaly). These mutations often result in loss-of-function, leading to midline developmental failures in the forebrain (Roessler2009The). The mutations can include frameshifts, missense mutations, and expansions of the poly-Alanine tract, which interfere with DNA binding and transcriptional activation (Brown2004In; Roessler2009The).

ZIC2 mutations are associated with a distinct facial phenotype, often lacking the facial dysmorphisms typically seen in other forms of HPE, which can lead to underdiagnosis (Solomon2009Mutations). The gene's role in neurological development is crucial, as evidenced by similar malformations in mice with diminished Zic2 expression (Brown2001Holoprosencephaly). Altered expression of ZIC2 has also been linked to various cancers, including medulloblastoma and glioblastoma, due to its role in cell proliferation and differentiation.

## Interactions
ZIC2, a zinc finger transcription factor, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in transcriptional regulation. It forms high molecular weight complexes, notably Complex I and Complex II. Complex I includes DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), Ku70/80, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), while Complex II comprises Ku70/80 and RNA helicase A (RHA). These complexes are essential for ZIC2's transcriptional activation functions, with DNA-PKcs phosphorylating ZIC2 to facilitate the transition between these complexes (Ishiguro2007ZIC2dependent).

ZIC2 also interacts with the myogenic repressor I-mfa, which binds to its amino terminal domain, inhibiting ZIC2's nuclear import and transcriptional activation. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in vertebrate development (Mizugishi2004Myogenic).

In the context of signaling pathways, ZIC2 interacts with TCF4, inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling by binding to TCF4's HMG domain, although it does not directly bind β-catenin (Pourebrahim2011Transcription). Additionally, ZIC2 enhances Hedgehog signaling by interacting with Gli1, retaining it in the nucleus, which is crucial for activating transcriptional activity in cervical cancer cells (Chan2011Zic2).
