# RDH12

## Overview
RDH12 is a gene that encodes the enzyme retinol dehydrogenase 12, which is a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the visual cycle, particularly in the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol within photoreceptor cells, a process essential for the regeneration of the visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal (Lee2008Effect; Sarkar2019Retinol). Retinol dehydrogenase 12 is predominantly expressed in the inner segments of rod and cone photoreceptors, where it contributes to retinoid homeostasis and offers protection against oxidative stress (Sahu2016Retinol; Lee2008Effect). Beyond its role in the visual cycle, the enzyme is involved in detoxifying lipid peroxidation products, thereby preventing photoreceptor cell death under conditions of high oxidative stress (Lee2008Effect; Sarkar2019Retinol). Mutations in the RDH12 gene are linked to various retinal dystrophies, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining retinal health (Sarkar2019Retinol; Zou2019PHENOTYPIC).

## Function
Retinol dehydrogenase 12 (RDH12) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the visual cycle by catalyzing the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol in photoreceptor cells. This conversion is essential for the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, a visual chromophore necessary for vision (Lee2008Effect; Sarkar2019Retinol). RDH12 is primarily expressed in the inner segments of rod and cone photoreceptors, where it helps maintain retinoid homeostasis and protect against oxidative stress (Sahu2016Retinol; Lee2008Effect).

In addition to its role in the visual cycle, RDH12 is involved in the detoxification of lipid peroxidation products, such as medium-chain aldehydes, which can be cytotoxic (Lee2008Effect; Sarkar2019Retinol). This protective function is crucial for preventing the accumulation of toxic substances that can lead to photoreceptor cell death (Lee2008Effect). RDH12's activity is particularly important under conditions of high light intensity, where it helps clear all-trans-retinal and protect photoreceptors from damage (Sarkar2019Retinol). The enzyme's function is vital for maintaining retinal health and function, especially in environments with high oxidative stress (Lee2008Effect).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RDH12 gene are primarily associated with a range of retinal dystrophies, including Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (EOSRD), autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP), and cone-rod dystrophy (CORD) (Sarkar2019Retinol; Zou2019PHENOTYPIC). LCA, linked to RDH12 mutations, is characterized by severe early-onset retinal degeneration, often presenting in early childhood and accounting for about 10% of all LCA cases (Sarkar2019Retinol; Sarkar2021Involvement). Patients with RDH12 mutations typically experience early macular atrophy, night blindness, and progressive vision loss, with significant impairment often occurring before the age of 30 (Zou2019PHENOTYPIC; Fahim2019Natural).

The phenotypic variability of RDH12-associated retinal dystrophies is notable, with clinical presentations ranging from severe early-onset conditions to milder forms of retinitis pigmentosa (Zou2019PHENOTYPIC; Scott2020Expanding). Common mutations include p.Val146Asp, p.Arg62Ter, and p.Thr49Met, which lead to diminished enzyme activity and progressive retinal degeneration (Zou2019PHENOTYPIC). The severity of the disease is often linked to the specific mutations present, with both missense and null mutations contributing to the condition's progression (Aleman2018RDH12Mutations). Understanding the natural history and genotype-phenotype correlations of RDH12-associated retinal degeneration is crucial for developing targeted therapies (Fahim2019Detailed).
