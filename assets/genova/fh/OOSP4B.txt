# OOSP4B

## Overview
OOSP4B is a gene that encodes the protein oocyte secreted protein family member 4B, which is part of a family of proteins known for their roles in reproductive biology. The protein encoded by OOSP4B is involved in various cellular processes related to oocyte development and maturation. As a member of the oocyte secreted protein family, it is implicated in the regulation of oocyte and follicular development, although the specific mechanisms and pathways remain to be fully elucidated. The study of OOSP4B and its encoded protein is significant for understanding fertility and reproductive health, as alterations in its expression or function may have implications for reproductive disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
