# HAUS5

## Overview
The HAUS5 gene encodes the HAUS augmin-like complex subunit 5, a protein that is integral to the function of the augmin complex, which is essential for microtubule organization during cell division. This protein is categorized as a structural component of the augmin complex, contributing to the assembly and stability of the mitotic spindle by facilitating the recruitment of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) to spindle microtubules. HAUS5, through its interactions with other HAUS proteins, plays a pivotal role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining centrosome integrity during mitosis (Schweizer2021Subcentrosomal; Huang2022HAUS5). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various cancers, where it is often overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Zhang2023Comprehensive; Huang2022HAUS5).

## Structure
The HAUS5 protein is a subunit of the augmin complex, which plays a crucial role in microtubule organization during cell division. The molecular structure of HAUS5 is characterized by its involvement in forming coiled-coil segments, particularly in the TIII tetramer of the augmin complex. HAUS5 interacts closely with HAUS3, forming stable dimers that contribute to the structural integrity of the complex. These interactions are part of the H3/H5-arm, which is an antiparallel 4-helix coiled-coil bundle formed by the central segments of HAUS3 and HAUS5 (Zupa2022The).

The N-terminal segments of HAUS5, along with other HAUS proteins, are located in a central 'bulge' region of the tetramer, while the C-terminal segments contribute to the 4H-arm, which includes all four HAUS proteins (Zupa2022The). The very N-termini of HAUS3 and HAUS5 form a small globular α-helical bundle, known as the H3/H5 N-bundle, positioned on the surface of the central bulge region (Zupa2022The).

Despite these insights, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of HAUS5, as well as its domains, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature (Zupa2022The).

## Function
The HAUS5 gene encodes a subunit of the augmin complex, which is crucial for spindle assembly and centrosome integrity during cell division. In healthy human cells, HAUS5 plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity of the centrosome and ensuring proper spindle assembly, which are essential for accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis (Huang2022HAUS5). HAUS5 is involved in the nucleation and stabilization of microtubules, processes that are vital for the organization of the mitotic spindle. This activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm during mitosis, where it contributes to the proper alignment and segregation of chromosomes (Huang2022HAUS5).

The augmin complex, which includes HAUS5, is necessary for the recruitment of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γTuRC) to the centriole lumen, a process that is crucial for centriole stabilization and spindle microtubule nucleation (Schweizer2021Subcentrosomal). Depletion of HAUS5 results in the absence of luminal γ-tubulin, indicating its essential role in the luminal localization of γTuRC and, consequently, in maintaining centriole stability (Schweizer2021Subcentrosomal). These functions are critical for the proper progression of the cell cycle and the prevention of chromosomal instability.

## Clinical Significance
The HAUS5 gene is implicated in several cancers, notably liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer. In HCC, HAUS5 is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. It plays a crucial role in regulating DNA replication and the cell cycle, particularly through the p53 signaling pathway. High HAUS5 expression is linked to TP53 mutations, which are associated with a downregulated immune response and shorter overall survival in HCC patients (Zhang2023Comprehensive). HAUS5 expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration and PD1/PDL1 expression, contributing to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (Zhang2023Comprehensive).

In breast cancer, HAUS5 is overexpressed and associated with poor clinicopathological characteristics. It is linked to pathways involved in mitotic prometaphase and DNA replication. The gene's expression correlates with tumor mutation burden, affecting the tumor microenvironment and potentially influencing cancer progression and response to immunotherapy (Huang2022HAUS5). HAUS5's interaction with other genes involved in cell division and immune response highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Huang2022HAUS5). In low-grade glioma, HAUS5 expression is associated with tumor progression and immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role in glioma prognosis (Wang2023A).

## Interactions
HAUS5 is a component of the augmin complex, which plays a crucial role in microtubule organization during mitosis. It is part of the Tetramer III structure within the augmin complex, where it interacts with other HAUS proteins, including HAUS1, HAUS3, and HAUS4, to bind the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) via the adaptor protein NEDD1. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of γ-TuRC to spindle microtubules, facilitating the nucleation of branched microtubules (Zupa2022The).

HAUS5 forms a stable dimer with HAUS3, characterized by extensive coiled-coil segments, which are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the augmin TIII tetramer. This dimerization is maintained even in the absence of other HAUS subunits, highlighting the strong interaction between HAUS5 and HAUS3 (Zupa2022The).

The HAUS complex, including HAUS5, is involved in microtubule binding, and its interaction is regulated by importins and Ran-GTP. The presence of importins reduces the binding of the HAUS complex to microtubules, but this inhibition can be reversed by Ran-GTP, indicating a regulatory mechanism for HAUS5's interaction with microtubules (Ustinova2023Microtubule).
