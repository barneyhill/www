# CDH17

## Overview
CDH17 is a gene that encodes the protein cadherin 17, a member of the cadherin superfamily, which is characterized by its role in calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. Cadherin 17, also known as liver-intestine cadherin or LI-cadherin, is a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the small and large intestines. It is involved in maintaining tissue integrity and epithelial cell polarity by facilitating cell clustering and micro-aggregate formation. Structurally, cadherin 17 is distinguished by its seven extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail, which contribute to its unique adhesive properties that differ from classical cadherins (Casal2019Beyond; Gray2021Crystal). The gene is evolutionarily conserved across mammals and plays a significant role in intestinal development, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation (Casal2019Beyond). Additionally, CDH17 has been implicated in cancer progression, particularly in gastrointestinal cancers, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential (Zhu2010HNF1α; Liu2009Targeting).

## Structure
Cadherin-17 (CDH17) is a member of the cadherin superfamily, characterized by its unique structural features. The primary structure of CDH17 includes seven extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The secondary structure of the EC1 and EC2 domains forms typical seven-strand Greek-key motifs, with EC1 having an additional N-terminal β-strand and EC2 containing an extra α-helix (Gray2021Crystal). The tertiary structure of CDH17 is defined by the presence of three calcium ions bound in the canonical EC1-2 linker region, although the EC2-3 linker lacks the sequence motifs necessary for calcium binding (Gray2021Crystal).

CDH17 does not engage in the classical strand-swapping interactions typical of other cadherins. Instead, its N-terminus interacts with its own EC1, and a unique two-turn alpha-helix is located in the EC2 domain (Gray2021Crystal). The quaternary structure involves the formation of homophilic trans and cis complexes in a calcium-dependent manner, and potential heterophilic trans interactions with classical cadherin CDH1 (Gray2021Crystal). CDH17 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can interfere with its interaction interfaces (Gray2021Crystal).

## Function
Cadherin 17 (CDH17), also known as liver-intestine cadherin or LI-cadherin, is a member of the 7D cadherin family, characterized by seven extracellular domains. It is primarily expressed in the small and large intestines and is located on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes, enterocytes, and goblet cells. CDH17 functions as a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion protein, facilitating cell clustering and micro-aggregate formation, which is crucial for maintaining tissue integrity and epithelial cell polarity (Casal2019Beyond; Gray2021Crystal).

CDH17 is involved in regulating water transport across epithelial cells by maintaining the width of the interstitial cleft between cells, a process dependent on calcium concentration (Casal2019Beyond; Gray2021Crystal). It forms homophilic trans and cis complexes and can also interact heterophilically with classical cadherin CDH1, although it does not use the strand-swap mechanism typical of classical cadherins, indicating a distinct adhesive mechanism (Gray2021Crystal).

The gene is well conserved across mammals and plays a role in intestinal development, contributing to the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium (Casal2019Beyond).

## Clinical Significance
CDH17 (cadherin 17) is significantly implicated in various cancers, particularly those of gastrointestinal origin. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CDH17 is overexpressed in over 80% of cases, correlating with poor clinical outcomes, high metastatic potential, and tumor venous invasion, which are strong risk factors for cancer metastasis (Zhu2010HNF1α; Liu2009Targeting). In gastric cancer, CDH17 is associated with advanced disease stages, poor prognosis, and lymph node metastasis, acting through the activation of the NFκB signaling pathway (Wang2013Cadherin17). 

In colorectal cancer, CDH17 expression is linked to increased cell adhesion and proliferation, particularly through its interaction with integrins via an RGD motif, which is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (Bartolomé2014An). CDH17 is also overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, where it promotes adhesion and proliferation, further indicating its role in cancer progression (Bartolomé2014An). 

Overall, CDH17's aberrant expression and interactions contribute to tumorigenesis and metastasis in several cancers, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Lee2010Role; Casal2019Beyond).

## Interactions
Cadherin 17 (CDH17) is involved in several protein interactions that are significant in the context of cancer progression and metastasis. A key interaction is with the α2β1 integrin, mediated by the RGD motif present in CDH17. This interaction is crucial for integrin activation, promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and tumor growth, particularly in colorectal cancer cells (Bartolomé2014An). The RGD motif in CDH17 induces a conformational change in the β1 integrin subunit, enhancing its affinity and activating signaling pathways such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and ERK1/2, which are important for tumor proliferation and metastasis (Bartolomé2014An).

CDH17 also interacts with β-catenin and p120-catenin, despite its short cytoplasmic domain, which was initially thought to preclude such interactions. The association with p120-catenin may involve dileucine motifs, similar to those used by E-cadherin (Casal2019Beyond). CDH17 is part of a protein complex that includes other proteins like CD44, EPCAM, and galectin 3, which are involved in signaling pathways relevant to cancer, such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Casal2019Beyond). These interactions highlight CDH17's role in cellular adhesion and signaling, contributing to its function in cancer progression.
