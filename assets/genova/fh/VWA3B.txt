# VWA3B

## Overview
The VWA3B gene encodes the von Willebrand factor A domain containing 3B protein, which is an intracellular protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a multifunctional protein due to its roles in transcription, DNA repair, and membrane transport. These functions are critical for maintaining cellular integrity and ensuring proper cellular responses to DNA damage, thereby preventing chromosome instability (Zhang2019Copy). The VWA3B protein is thought to have functional similarities to MACROD2, a protein known for its involvement in DNA repair and sensitivity to DNA damage, suggesting a role in genomic stability (Zhang2019Copy). Located on chromosome 2q12, alterations in the VWA3B gene have been linked to cancer, underscoring its potential significance in carcinogenesis and its importance in maintaining normal cellular function (Zhang2019Copy).

## Structure


## Function
The VWA3B gene encodes an intracellular protein that is involved in several critical cellular processes, including transcription, DNA repair, and membrane transport. These functions are essential for maintaining cellular integrity and responding to DNA damage, which can lead to chromosome instability if not properly managed (Zhang2019Copy). The protein encoded by VWA3B is thought to play a role similar to MACROD2, which is known to influence DNA repair and sensitivity to DNA damage. This suggests that VWA3B may be involved in safeguarding genomic stability by participating in the repair of damaged DNA (Zhang2019Copy).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, VWA3B is implicated in transcriptional regulation, which is crucial for controlling gene expression and ensuring that cellular processes are carried out correctly. The gene is located in the 2q12 region, where alterations in copy number have been associated with certain cancers, indicating its potential role in carcinogenesis (Zhang2019Copy). The protein's involvement in these fundamental processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and preventing disease.
