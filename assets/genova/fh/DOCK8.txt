# DOCK8

## Overview
DOCK8, or dedicator of cytokinesis 8, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the DOCK180-related family of atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The DOCK8 protein is integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a pivotal role in immune cell function, particularly in lymphocyte migration, polarization, and survival. It is characterized by the presence of two conserved domains, DHR-1 and DHR-2, which are essential for its localization to the plasma membrane and its catalytic activity, respectively (Su2010Dedicator; Engelhardt2009Large). The protein's function is crucial for T cell receptor signaling and the maintenance of memory cell populations, underscoring its importance in effective immune responses (Pillay2021Somatic). Mutations in the DOCK8 gene are linked to immunodeficiency disorders, such as autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome, and can also result in neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its significance in both immune and cognitive functions (Krgovic2018Rare; Engelhardt2009Large).

## Structure
The DOCK8 protein is a member of the DOCK family, characterized by the presence of two conserved domains: Dock homology region 1 (DHR-1) and DHR-2. The DHR-1 domain is involved in binding phospholipids, which aids in localizing the protein to the plasma membrane, while the DHR-2 domain contains the catalytic site for guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity, specifically activating small Rho GTPases such as CDC42 and RAC1 (Su2010Dedicator; Engelhardt2009Large). The full-length DOCK8 protein is composed of 2,099 amino acids (Takahashi2006Homozygous).

DOCK8 is expressed in various tissues, with multiple splice variants identified. These variants can differ in specific amino acid residues, such as the absence of residues 859-890 or 959-972, and one variant includes an additional 68 amino acids at the N-terminal (Griggs2008Dedicator). The protein is approximately 2031 amino acids in length in some variants (Griggs2008Dedicator).

The DOCK8 protein forms complexes with other proteins, such as WASp and WIP, which are crucial for linking T cell receptors to the actin cytoskeleton, highlighting its role in immune cell function (Janssen2016A). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of DOCK8 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The DOCK8 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the DOCK180-related family of atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which are crucial for the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein plays a significant role in immune cell function, particularly in lymphocyte migration, polarization, and survival (Su2010Dedicator). DOCK8 is involved in activating Rho GTPases, such as CDC42 and RAC1, by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is essential for cytoskeletal reorganization and cell movement (Su2010Dedicator). 

In healthy human cells, DOCK8 is critical for proper T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, which is necessary for T cell activation and function. It supports the differentiation and function of T and B cells, contributing to effective immune responses (Pillay2021Somatic). DOCK8 is active in the cytoplasm and is enriched in memory compartments of lymphocytes, indicating its role in maintaining memory cell populations (Pillay2021Somatic). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance and diversity of T cell populations, particularly in skewing towards memory cells, which is important for effective immune responses (Pillay2021Somatic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DOCK8 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably the autosomal recessive form of hyper-IgE syndrome (AR-HIES). This immunodeficiency disorder is characterized by elevated serum IgE levels, recurrent infections, eczema, and severe atopic dermatitis. Patients with DOCK8 mutations often experience recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, skin abscesses, and a heightened susceptibility to viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and molluscum contagiosum (Engelhardt2009Large; Akkoc2013Th17). Neurological complications, including central nervous system vasculitis and brain infarction, have also been reported (Engelhardt2009Large).

DOCK8 mutations can also lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and developmental delay. These conditions are linked to both deletions and duplications in the DOCK8 gene, which may result in cognitive and communication abnormalities, aggressive behavior, and mood swings (Krgovic2018Rare; Griggs2008Dedicator). In some cases, DOCK8 mutations have been associated with mental retardation and developmental disabilities, suggesting a role in cognitive function (Griggs2008Dedicator).

The gene's role in immune cell function is critical, as DOCK8 deficiency leads to impaired T-cell activation and memory T-cell persistence, affecting both cellular and humoral immunity (Le2014Molecular).

## Interactions
DOCK8 is involved in several critical interactions within immune cells, particularly T cells. It forms a complex with WASp (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) and WIP (WASp-interacting protein), which is essential for linking T cell receptors (TCRs) to the actin cytoskeleton. This complex facilitates TCR-driven actin polymerization, immune synapse formation, and T cell migration (Janssen2016A). DOCK8 directly binds to WIP, and this interaction is independent of WASp, with WIP acting as a bridge between DOCK8 and WASp (Janssen2016A). The DOCK8-WIP-WASp complex is crucial for TCR-driven WASp activation and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, with DOCK8's guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity playing a vital role in these processes (Janssen2016A).

DOCK8 also interacts with CDC42, a protein involved in actin reorganization and WASp activation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and facilitating TCR-driven actin polymerization (Janssen2016A). In equine lymphocytes, DOCK8 has been identified as a novel interaction partner of septin 7, which is involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and immune cell trafficking (Schauer2018Interaction). These interactions highlight DOCK8's role in immune cell function and actin cytoskeleton dynamics.
