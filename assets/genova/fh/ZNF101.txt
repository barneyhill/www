# ZNF101

## Overview
ZNF101 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 101, a member of the KRAB-zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZNF) family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein plays a significant role in gene expression modulation, particularly in the context of lipoprotein regulation and pluripotency. ZNF101 is involved in the degradation of its mRNA through interactions with microRNA-541-3p, impacting apoB mRNA and protein levels, which are crucial for lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerosis (Ansari2023MicroRNA5413p). Additionally, ZNF101 is implicated in the transcriptional enhancement of the APOB promoter, especially in hepatic cells, and is associated with maintaining pluripotency in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Ansari2023MicroRNA5413p; Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28). The protein's interactions with TRIM28, a known partner of various KRAB-ZNFs, suggest a broader regulatory role, although specific functional details remain to be elucidated (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).

## Interactions
ZNF101 is involved in interactions with microRNA-541-3p, which targets the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of ZNF101 mRNA, leading to its degradation. This interaction results in decreased levels of apoB mRNA and protein, impacting lipoprotein regulation and atherosclerosis (Ansari2023MicroRNA5413p). ZNF101 also interacts with the APOB promoter to enhance transcription, particularly in liver cells, indicating its role in regulating apoB production (Ansari2023MicroRNA5413p).

In the context of pluripotent stem cells, ZNF101 is identified as one of the KRAB-zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZNFs) that exhibit increased expression in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) compared to primary human dermal fibroblasts (PHDFs). This suggests a role in maintaining pluripotency, although specific protein interactions of ZNF101 in this context are not detailed (Oleksiewicz2017TRIM28).

ZNF101 is also associated with TRIM28, a protein that interacts with various KRAB-ZNFs. However, specific interactions or functional roles of ZNF101 with TRIM28 are not detailed in the available excerpts (Chang2023AcetylationMimic).
