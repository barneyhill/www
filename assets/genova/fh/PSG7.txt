# PSG7

## Overview
PSG7 is a gene that encodes the protein pregnancy-specific beta-1-glycoprotein 7, a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) family, which is part of the larger immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is primarily expressed in the placenta and is involved in immune modulation during pregnancy, contributing to maternal-fetal tolerance and placental development (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). PSG7 is characterized by immunoglobulin-like domains and may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Thompson1990The). Notably, PSG7 does not bind to the latency-associated peptide of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), distinguishing its function from other PSGs (Warren2018Activation). Additionally, a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PSG7 introduces a stop codon, potentially leading to a truncated protein or non-coding transcript, suggesting alternative roles such as functioning as a long non-coding RNA (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). PSG7 has clinical significance in conditions like papillary thyroid carcinoma and pregnancy-related disorders, where its expression levels and genetic variations may influence disease progression and outcomes (Tian2022PSG7; Moore2022Pregnancy-specific).

## Structure
PSG7, a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein family, is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and shares structural features with carcinoembryonic antigens. The protein is characterized by immunoglobulin-like domains, which are typical of the PSG family (Thompson1990The). PSG7 is annotated as a protein-encoding gene, but a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) introduces a stop codon, potentially leading to a truncated protein or non-coding transcript (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). This suggests that PSG7 may have alternative splicing or translation initiation sites, although specific details on the molecular structure are not provided (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific).

PSG7 is noted for its unblocked N-terminus, which may indicate unique biological functions compared to other PSGs (Tian2022PSG7). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is common among PSG proteins, although specific modifications for PSG7 are not detailed in the available context. PSG proteins, including PSG7, often form homodimers, suggesting a quaternary structure, but specific structural details for PSG7 are not provided in the context (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific).

## Function
PSG7, a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) family, is primarily expressed in the placenta and plays a significant role in immune modulation during pregnancy. It contributes to maternal-fetal tolerance by influencing immune cell interactions and signaling processes. PSG7 is involved in cell adhesion, which is crucial for placental development and function (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific).

The PSG family, including PSG7, is known for its role in activating transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), a cytokine involved in immune regulation and cellular processes. However, PSG7 specifically does not show binding to the latency-associated peptide of TGF-β1, suggesting a unique function compared to other PSGs (Warren2018Activation). PSG7's expression is associated with changes in immune cell infiltration, such as decreased CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cells, indicating its potential impact on the immune microenvironment (Tian2022PSG7).

PSG7 may also function as a long non-coding RNA due to a major allele introducing a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. This suggests alternative splicing or translation initiation mechanisms might produce shorter viable proteins, although specific data on these possibilities is lacking (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific).

## Clinical Significance
PSG7 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). High expression levels of PSG7 in PTC are associated with a worse prognosis, including shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and correlations with advanced pathological stages (Tian2022PSG7). PSG7 expression is linked to changes in the tumor immune microenvironment, such as decreased CD8+ T cells and increased regulatory T cells (Tregs), which may facilitate tumor progression (Tian2022PSG7). This suggests that PSG7 could serve as a prognostic marker and potentially guide individualized treatment strategies for PTC patients (Tian2022PSG7).

In addition to its role in cancer, PSG7 is associated with pregnancy-related disorders. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in PSG7 introduces a stop codon, potentially leading to a truncated protein or nonsense-mediated decay, which affects its expression levels in the placenta (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). This genetic variation may have implications for conditions such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation, although the clinical significance of PSG7 in these contexts requires further investigation (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific). The potential role of PSG7 in these disorders highlights the need for more research to understand its impact on reproductive health and cancer.

## Interactions
PSG7, a member of the pregnancy-specific glycoprotein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are significant during pregnancy. Notably, PSG7 has been identified to bind with DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma) and DSCAM (Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule), which are expressed in the human placenta. These interactions suggest potential roles in pregnancy-related processes such as immunoregulation and angiogenesis (Wojtowicz2020A).

Despite its involvement in these interactions, PSG7 does not bind to the latency-associated peptide (LAP) of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), unlike other PSGs. This lack of interaction with LAP indicates that PSG7 may not participate in the activation of latent TGF-β1, a function observed in other PSG family members (Warren2018Activation).

Additionally, PSG7 is noted for its potential role as a non-coding RNA due to a common SNP that introduces a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein or non-coding transcript. This suggests that PSG7 might have functions beyond protein interactions, possibly acting as a sink for microRNAs or as a long non-coding RNA (Moore2022Pregnancy-specific).
