# TAF1C

## Overview
TAF1C is a gene that encodes the TATA-box binding protein associated factor, RNA polymerase I subunit C, a crucial component of the transcription machinery involved in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. This protein is a part of the selectivity factor 1 (SL1) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase I. The SL1 complex, including TAF1C, plays a pivotal role in ribosome biogenesis by facilitating the assembly of the pre-initiation complex at rRNA gene promoters and recruiting RNA polymerase I to the transcription start site. TAF1C's function is vital for normal cellular processes, as it supports the production of rRNA, which is necessary for protein synthesis and cell growth (Knuutinen2020Homozygous; Abdulwahab2019Association).

## Function
The TAF1C gene encodes a subunit of the RNA polymerase I transcription machinery, specifically involved in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in healthy human cells. TAF1C is a component of the selectivity factor 1 (SL1) complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase I. This complex includes the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and other TBP-associated factors, and it functions by directing RNA polymerase I to the rRNA gene promoter (Knuutinen2020Homozygous; Abdulwahab2019Association).

TAF1C plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis, as the synthesis of precursor rRNA is the first and rate-limiting step in this process. It is involved in the assembly of the pre-initiation complex at rRNA gene promoters, stabilizing the binding of the upstream binding factor (UBF) to the rDNA promoter, and recruiting RNA polymerase I to the transcription start site (Abdulwahab2019Association; Russell2006The). TAF1C is active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to ribosome biogenesis, impacting protein synthesis and cell growth (Abdulwahab2019Association). Proper function of TAF1C is crucial for normal cellular function, as it supports the production of rRNA, which is essential for protein synthesis and overall cell growth (Knuutinen2020Homozygous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAF1C gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. Homozygous variants in TAF1C are linked to a novel childhood-onset neurological phenotype. Patients with these variants exhibit symptoms such as developmental delays, epileptic spasms, and spastic paraplegia. The specific missense variant c.1165C>T p.Arg389Cys, found in a highly conserved region, is predicted to be deleterious and results in reduced TAF1C mRNA and protein expression (Knuutinen2020Homozygous).

TAF1C has also been implicated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Studies have shown that TAF1C levels are significantly altered in T2DM patients, with some analyses indicating increased levels associated with the disease. This suggests that TAF1C could serve as a biomarker for T2DM, potentially linked to metabolic disturbances and dyslipidemia observed in the condition (Abdulwahab2019Association).

In cancer research, TAF1C has been identified as a gene associated with gastric cancer. High expression levels of TAF1C are correlated with increased risk and worse prognosis in gastric cancer patients, indicating its role in tumorigenesis and potential as a prognostic marker (Xu2024Singlecell).

## Interactions
TAF1C is a component of the SL1 complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase I. This complex includes the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and other TBP-associated factors, forming a general transcription initiation factor known as human selectivity factor SL1 (Abdulwahab2019Association). TAF1C interacts with TBP and other subunits within the SL1 complex to facilitate the assembly of the transcription machinery at the rDNA promoter (Abdulwahab2019Association).

TAF1C is also involved in interactions with the pSER domain, which recruits TAF1C and TBP to the promoter, crucial for transcription initiation (Okuda2015AF4). The SDE motif of AF4 family proteins is necessary for binding to the SL1 complex, which includes TAF1C, and is involved in recruiting these components to the promoter (Okuda2015AF4). This interaction is critical for MLL-AEP fusion-dependent leukemic transformation, indicating TAF1C's role in transcriptional regulation beyond ribosomal RNA synthesis (Okuda2015AF4).

Additionally, TAF1C has been implicated in the regulation of transcription during the cell cycle. Phosphorylation on TAF1C by cdk1/cyclin B is suggested to play a role in the mitotic inhibition of transcription (Pijnappel2009Quantitative).
