# BTNL3

## Overview
BTNL3 (butyrophilin-like 3) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the butyrophilin-like family, which is involved in immune regulation. The BTNL3 protein is a transmembrane protein expressed primarily by intestinal epithelial cells and plays a significant role in the regulation of γδ T cells, particularly in the human gut. It functions by interacting with the Vγ4+ T cell receptor (TCR) through its immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain, facilitating the selection and activation of these T cells. This interaction is crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis and protecting against infection and inflammation. BTNL3 often forms a heterodimer with BTNL8, known as BTNL3.8, which further modulates immune responses by influencing specific γδ T cell subsets. Alterations in BTNL3 expression have been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease, highlighting its importance in immune system regulation and disease progression (Dart2023Conserved; Willcox2019Butyrophilinlike).

## Structure


## Function
BTNL3 (butyrophilin-like 3) is a protein involved in the regulation of γδ T cells, particularly in the human gut. It plays a crucial role in the selection and activation of these T cells by directly interacting with the Vγ4+ T cell receptor (TCR) through its immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain. This interaction is distinct from clonally-restricted antigen recognition, as it relies on germline-encoded regions of the TCR, similar to superantigen binding (Willcox2019Butyrophilinlike).

BTNL3, often in conjunction with BTNL8, is expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and is involved in maintaining a subset of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) that are important for tissue homeostasis. This interaction is significant for tissue maintenance and protection from infection, inflammation, and dysregulation (Vantourout2018Heteromeric; Dart2023Conserved). The BTNL3 protein can trigger TCR signaling, leading to TCR downregulation and CD69 upregulation in Vγ4+ T cells, which is important for modulating immune responses (Willcox2019Butyrophilinlike).

BTNL3's role in immune regulation is further highlighted by its involvement in the tonic engagement and selection of γδ T cells, potentially preceding antigenic engagement in response to tissue dysregulation (Willcox2019Butyrophilinlike). This function is crucial for maintaining a healthy immune response and preventing diseases such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Jandke2020Butyrophilinlike; Dart2023Conserved).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BTNL3 gene have been implicated in the progression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly Crohn's disease (CD). BTNL3, along with BTNL8, plays a crucial role in the selection and maintenance of γδ T cells in the gut. A hypomorphic allele resulting from a deletion that fuses BTNL8 and BTNL3 leads to reduced expression of these proteins, which is associated with dysregulation of Vγ4+ T cells. This dysregulation is linked to more severe forms of CD, characterized by penetrating disease and the formation of intra-abdominal abscesses or fistulae (Dart2023Conserved).

The BTNL3 and BTNL8 proteins are also involved in the modulation of immune responses in the gut, and their reduced expression has been observed in IBD and celiac disease tissues. This reduction may contribute to the altered phenotypes and depletion of CD103+ Vγ4+ T cells, which are crucial for maintaining gut homeostasis (Dart2023Conserved). Although BTNL3 is not identified as a susceptibility gene in genome-wide association studies for IBD, its role as a disease modifier suggests that it may influence disease progression and treatment response (Dart2023Conserved).

## Interactions
BTNL3 interacts directly with human Vγ4+ T cell receptors (TCRs) through its immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain. This interaction is specific and occurs in a superantigen-like manner, focusing on germline-encoded regions of the TCR, particularly the HV4 and CDR2 loops, rather than the clonally-restricted antigen binding typically mediated by the CDR3 region (Willcox2019Butyrophilinlike). The binding is enthalpically driven and marginally entropically unfavorable, as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments (Willcox2019Butyrophilinlike).

BTNL3 forms a heterodimer with BTNL8, known as BTNL3.8, which also interacts with Vγ4 TCRs. This heterodimer likely adopts a V-shaped configuration, allowing the V region of BTNL3 to directly bind the CDR2-HV4 face of Vγ4 (Willcox2019Butyrophilinlike). The interaction does not require the CDR3 regions, suggesting a more rigid body interaction mode (Willcox2019Butyrophilinlike). BTNL3 is expressed by intestinal epithelial cells and may act as a non-clonal selecting element for γδ T cell compartments, influencing tissue-specific γδ T cell subsets and contributing to immune regulation (Dart2023Conserved; Willcox2019Butyrophilinlike).
