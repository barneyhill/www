# GARNL3

## Overview
GARNL3, or GTPase activating Rap/RanGAP domain like 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by GARNL3 is categorized as a GTPase-activating protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze GTP to GDP. This regulation is essential for various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle control. GARNL3 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, such as glioblastoma and intellectual disabilities, due to its influence on cellular signaling and gene expression (Ling2024GARNL3; Ehret2015Microdeletions). The gene's expression and function are of significant interest in understanding its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in these diseases (Ling2024GARNL3).

## Clinical Significance
GARNL3 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In glioblastoma (GBM), particularly in cases with the EGFRvIII mutation, GARNL3 is associated with temozolomide (TMZ) resistance. Lower expression of GARNL3 correlates with shorter overall survival in GBM patients treated with TMZ, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker for treatment efficacy (Ling2024GARNL3). The gene's expression is regulated by transcription factors such as EREG, and its downregulation is linked to increased TMZ resistance in EGFRvIII-positive GBM cells (Ling2024GARNL3).

In the context of intellectual disability (ID), microdeletions in the 9q33.3-q34.11 region, which include GARNL3, have been studied. Although no direct causative mutations in GARNL3 were identified, its reduced expression in patients with these microdeletions suggests a potential role in the clinical phenotypes observed, such as ID, developmental delay, and seizures (Ehret2015Microdeletions). GARNL3 has also been identified as a novel candidate gene for autosomal recessive intellectual disability disorders, with its expression patterns in the brain suggesting a role in the etiology of ID and microcephaly (SantosCortez2018Novel).
