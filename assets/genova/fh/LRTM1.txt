# LRTM1

## Overview
LRTM1, or leucine rich repeats and transmembrane domains 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various biological processes, particularly in muscle differentiation and neural function. The protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, and its transmembrane domains, which anchor it within cellular membranes. In the context of muscle biology, LRTM1 plays a crucial role in the differentiation of myoblast cells by modulating the FGFR1 signaling pathway, thereby influencing skeletal muscle development and regeneration (Li2020LRTM1). In the nervous system, LRTM1 is implicated in synaptic organization and may act as an auxiliary protein for potassium channels, affecting their voltage dependence (Ham2024Single-nuclei). The gene's involvement in neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Tourette Syndrome underscores its clinical significance, as alterations in LRTM1 expression or function can impact synaptic connectivity and brain development (Clarke2012Pathogenetic; Siddiqui2010LRRTMs).

## Function
LRTM1 is involved in the differentiation of myoblast cells by negatively regulating the FGFR1 signaling pathway. It inhibits FGFR1-induced ERK activation, which is crucial for skeletal muscle differentiation, by preventing the recruitment of the adaptor protein p52Shc to FGFR1. This inhibition relieves the repression of MyoD transcriptional activity, a master regulatory factor of skeletal muscle differentiation (Li2020LRTM1). LRTM1 is dynamically expressed during myoblast differentiation and skeletal muscle regeneration after injury, indicating its role in muscle repair processes (Li2020LRTM1).

In the nervous system, LRTM1 is a transmembrane protein that may act as an auxiliary protein for potassium channels, potentially influencing their voltage dependence (Ham2024Single-nuclei). Although its role in neuromuscular junction maintenance is not significant, as neither overexpression nor knockout of LRTM1 affected muscle function or NMJ morphology, it may be compensated by other similar proteins (Ham2024Single-nuclei). LRTM1's involvement in these molecular processes suggests its importance in both muscle differentiation and neural function.

## Clinical Significance
LRTM1 has been implicated in several neurological disorders and developmental abnormalities. Alterations in LRTM1 expression or mutations can contribute to conditions such as schizophrenia and Tourette Syndrome (TS). In schizophrenia, LRTM1 is linked through maternal imprinting and paternal linkage, suggesting that differential regulation of this gene may influence the disorder (Siddiqui2010LRRTMs). In TS, LRTM1 is associated with critical linkage regions and translocation breakpoints, indicating its potential role in the pathogenesis of TS and related neurodevelopmental disorders (Clarke2012Pathogenetic).

LRTM1 is also involved in synaptic organization, particularly in the regulation of glutamatergic synapses. It competes with neuroligins for neurexin binding, which is crucial for synaptic dynamics. Disruptions in these interactions can lead to imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, potentially affecting brain function and behavior (Clarke2012Pathogenetic). Additionally, LRTM1 null mice exhibit altered distribution of the excitatory presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT1, suggesting a role in excitatory synapse distribution and function, which may be relevant to TS pathology (Clarke2012Pathogenetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of LRTM1 in neurological disorders and its potential impact on synaptic connectivity and brain development.

## Interactions
LRTM1 interacts with the FGFR1 signaling pathway, specifically inhibiting the recruitment of the adaptor protein p52Shc to FGFR1. This interaction reduces ERK activation, which is crucial for myoblast differentiation. LRTM1 does not interact with other FGFR1-associated proteins such as SHP2, Grb2, or FRS2, indicating a selective interaction with p52Shc (Li2020LRTM1).

In the context of midbrain dopaminergic progenitors, LRTM1 serves as a cell surface marker and is involved in synapse formation. It is part of the extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily, which suggests potential interactions with synaptic proteins. LRTM1 has a predicted PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1 domain-binding sequence at its C terminus, indicating a synaptic location and possible interactions with synaptic adhesion molecules (Samata2016Purification).

While specific protein interactions in the nervous system are not detailed, LRTM1's role as a marker for midbrain dopaminergic progenitors and its structural features suggest it may participate in interactions critical for neuronal differentiation and function (Samata2016Purification).
