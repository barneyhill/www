# ARF4

## Overview
ARF4 (ADP ribosylation factor 4) is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in vesicular trafficking. The ARF4 protein is categorized as a small GTPase, which plays a pivotal role in the secretory pathway, facilitating the transport of cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, as well as within Golgi compartments. It is essential for recruiting coat proteins, activating lipid-modifying enzymes, and regulating cytoskeleton dynamics. ARF4 is also involved in specific protein-protein interactions, such as those with Rab11, FIP3, and ASAP1, which are crucial for its function in rhodopsin trafficking and other cellular processes (Mazelova2009Ciliary; Donaldson2011ARF). The protein's activity is regulated by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, a process that is critical for its role in membrane trafficking and cellular signaling pathways (Reiling2013A). ARF4's involvement in cellular responses to stress and its potential implications in various diseases highlight its significance in both normal cellular function and pathology (Reiling2013A).

## Structure
ARF4 (ADP ribosylation factor 4) is a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking, characterized by a GTP-binding domain. The primary structure of ARF4 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, but specific details on this sequence are not provided in the available context. The secondary structure likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of GTPases, although specific details are not mentioned.

The tertiary structure of ARF4 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its function in membrane trafficking. ARF4 contains an N-terminal amphipathic helix, which is myristoylated, a post-translational modification essential for membrane association and biological activity (Donaldson2011ARF). This myristoylation allows the N-terminal helix to insert into the membrane upon GTP binding, facilitating a conformational change that positions ARF4 close to the membrane surface (Donaldson2011ARF).

ARF4 is involved in forming complexes with other proteins, suggesting a quaternary structure through interactions with partners like Rab11, FIP3, and ASAP1, particularly in the context of rhodopsin trafficking (Mazelova2009Ciliary). The α3 helix of ARF4 is implicated in binding to membrane receptors, such as rhodopsin, indicating its role in specific protein-protein interactions (Donaldson2011ARF).

## Function
ARF4 (ADP ribosylation factor 4) is a small GTPase that plays a critical role in the secretory pathway, particularly in the transport of cargo between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus, as well as between different Golgi cisternae (Reiling2013A). It is involved in recruiting coat proteins, activating lipid-modifying enzymes, and regulating cytoskeleton dynamics, primarily localized at the ER-Golgi interface, specifically at the early Golgi and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Reiling2013A). ARF4 acts redundantly with ARF1 during transport in the early secretory pathway and is crucial for organizing trafficking between the ERGIC and the cis-Golgi (Donaldson2011ARF).

In retinal cells, ARF4 specifically recognizes the VXPX cytosolic targeting motif in retinal rhodopsin to facilitate its transport into the rod outer segment, a specialized cilium (Donaldson2011ARF). ARF4 also binds to CAPS, a calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion, which regulates exocytosis of dense core vesicles from nerve terminals (Donaldson2011ARF). The GDP-bound form of ARF4 binds to the PH domains of CAPS proteins, and knockdown of CAPS, ARF4, or ARF5 causes retention of chromogranin in the Golgi, suggesting that ARF4 and ARF5, together with CAPS, regulate the release of dense core vesicles from the Golgi (Donaldson2011ARF).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ARF4 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. ARF4 plays a significant role in the cellular response to Golgi stress, which is a feature observed in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) (Reiling2013A). Golgi fragmentation, a result of Golgi stress, is also noted in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease (Reiling2013A).

ARF4 is involved in intracellular trafficking pathways that are crucial for the growth and survival of certain pathogens. Loss of ARF4 function has been shown to confer resistance to infections by pathogens such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Shigella flexneri, which induce Golgi fragmentation upon infection (Reiling2013A). This suggests that ARF4 could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions against infections by these bacteria, particularly in the context of antibiotic-resistant strains (Reiling2013A).

In the context of pancreatic health, the loss of ARF4 leads to severe degeneration of the exocrine pancreas, characterized by the loss of acinar cells and replacement by adipocytes and fibrotic material, a condition known as pancreatic steatosis or lipomatosis (Pearring2017Loss). This condition is significant in human pathology, particularly in obesity-associated diseases (Pearring2017Loss).

## Interactions
ARF4 (ADP ribosylation factor 4) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with other ARF proteins, such as ARF1, ARF3, and ARF5, particularly in the context of maintaining Golgi integrity and function. These interactions are significant in cellular resistance to Brefeldin A (BFA), a compound that disrupts Golgi function. In ARF4 knockdown cells, compensatory upregulation of ARF1, ARF3, and ARF5 is observed, suggesting that these proteins may compensate for the loss of ARF4 (Reiling2013A).

ARF4 also interacts with GBF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which is essential for ARF protein activity regulation. Co-depletion of ARF4 with ARF1 or ARF5 reverses BFA resistance, indicating that ARF1 and ARF5 play critical roles in maintaining Golgi function in the absence of ARF4 (Reiling2013A). Additionally, ARF4 is part of a signaling pathway involving CREB3, which is activated under Golgi stress conditions, highlighting its role in cellular responses to stress and pathogen susceptibility (Reiling2013A). These interactions underscore ARF4's involvement in the secretory pathway and its regulatory influence on Golgi-associated processes.
