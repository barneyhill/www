# TMPRSS11F

## Overview
TMPRSS11F is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane serine protease 11F, a member of the transmembrane serine protease family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to cleave peptide bonds, playing significant roles in various physiological processes, particularly within epithelial tissues. The protein encoded by TMPRSS11F is involved in maintaining epithelial barrier function and facilitating cell signaling and tissue remodeling, which are crucial for the integrity and function of epithelial layers. These functions suggest a role in modulating immune responses, as epithelial tissues are often the first line of defense against pathogens. The gene is also implicated in the pathology of acute myeloid leukemia, where its ectopic expression is associated with poor prognostic outcomes (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored; Yan2019Ectopic). Despite its recognized importance, the precise molecular mechanisms and substrates of TMPRSS11F remain to be fully elucidated (Escalante2021Structural).

## Structure
TMPRSS11F is a member of the transmembrane serine protease family, characterized by a serine protease domain. The primary structure of TMPRSS11F includes a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a serine protease domain. The secondary structure of TMPRSS11F, like other members of the TMPRSS family, is likely to include conserved alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details for TMPRSS11F are not provided. The tertiary structure of TMPRSS11F is expected to be similar to other TMPRSS proteins, with a conserved catalytic triad of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine located within the trypsin-like protease domain (Escalante2021Structural).

The study of TMPRSS11F through homology modeling has revealed potential binding sites and structural characteristics, although specific quaternary structure details are not mentioned. The models were refined using molecular dynamics simulations, which provided insights into the protein's stability and potential drug interaction sites (Escalante2021Structural). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, as is common with transmembrane serine proteases, but specific modifications for TMPRSS11F are not detailed in the available context. The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific isoforms are not described.

## Function
TMPRSS11F is a member of the transmembrane serine protease family, which are enzymes that cleave peptide bonds in proteins, playing crucial roles in various physiological processes. This protease is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, where it is believed to contribute to maintaining epithelial barrier function. By processing proteins involved in cellular communication, TMPRSS11F may facilitate cell signaling and tissue remodeling, which are essential for maintaining the integrity and function of epithelial layers. These processes are vital for the proper functioning of epithelial tissues, which serve as protective barriers and are involved in absorption, secretion, and sensation. The activity of TMPRSS11F in these tissues suggests its involvement in the immune response, potentially by modulating the interaction between epithelial cells and immune cells. This modulation could be crucial for the body's defense mechanisms, as epithelial tissues are often the first line of defense against pathogens. The precise molecular mechanisms and substrates of TMPRSS11F remain to be fully elucidated, but its role in epithelial biology underscores its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The human gene TMPRSS11F encodes the transmembrane serine protease known as human airway trypsin-like protease 4 (HAT-L4). This protease is notably implicated in the development and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In AML patients, ectopic expression of HAT-L4 has been observed in neutrophils and monocytes, but not in other types of leukemia such as chronic myeloid leukemia or acute lymphocytic leukemia. Persistent expression of HAT-L4 in AML is associated with minimal residual disease and poor prognostic outcomes. Functional studies have demonstrated that silencing HAT-L4 in AML-derived cells inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation, reducing cancer cell invasion and tumor growth. This suggests that HAT-L4 plays a significant role in promoting AML cell invasion and tumor growth, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention. HAT-L4 may also serve as a cell surface marker for detecting AML blasts (Yan2019Ectopic).

While TMPRSS11F is part of a gene cluster on chromosome 4q, the specific clinical significance of mutations or alterations in its expression outside of AML is not detailed in the available context (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored).
