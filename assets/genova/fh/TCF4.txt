# TCF4

## Overview
TCF4 is a gene that encodes the transcription factor 4, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression. This transcription factor is involved in various cellular processes, including neurodevelopment and immune system function, by binding to E-box DNA sequences and modulating the transcription of target genes (Sepp2011Functional; Forrest2014The). TCF4 is highly expressed in the brain, where it influences the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and is also crucial for the development and maintenance of specific immune cells (Forrest2014The). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as β-catenin and Math1, underscore its involvement in key signaling pathways and cellular differentiation processes (Flora2007The; Huang2013Targeting). Mutations in the TCF4 gene are linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome, autism, and schizophrenia, highlighting its clinical significance (Peippo2011PittHopkins; Sweatt2013Pitt–Hopkins).

## Structure
The TCF4 gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor involved in gene regulation. The primary structure of TCF4 includes sequences that form the bHLH domain, essential for DNA binding and dimerization (Schoof2020The; Sepp2011Functional). The secondary structure of TCF4 features alpha helices within the bHLH domain, which are crucial for its function (Schoof2020The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices, allowing the protein to interact with DNA and other proteins effectively (Sepp2011Functional).

TCF4 can form homo- or heterodimers, which is a key aspect of its quaternary structure, enabling it to regulate gene expression by binding to E-box DNA sequences (Schoof2020The; Sepp2011Functional). The protein contains two transactivation domains, AD1 and AD2, which contribute to its ability to activate transcription (Sepp2011Functional). TCF4 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct N-terminal sequences and functional properties (Sepp2011Functional). These isoforms exhibit different intracellular localizations and transcriptional activities, influenced by the presence of nuclear localization signals and the transactivation domains (Sepp2011Functional).

## Function
TCF4, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in healthy human cells. It binds to E-box DNA sequences, modulating the transcription of target genes involved in various cellular processes (Sepp2011Functional). TCF4 is highly expressed in the brain and is essential for neurodevelopment, influencing the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells into mature neurons and glia (Forrest2014The). It is involved in the development of specific neuronal subpopulations and regulates critical neurodevelopmental genes, such as CNTNAP2 and NRXN1, which are important for neuronal adhesion (Forrest2014The).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, TCF4 is involved in the development and function of the immune system, particularly in lymphoid development and the maintenance of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (Forrest2014The). TCF4's activity is regulated by interactions with various proteins, including calmodulin and other Ca2+-binding proteins, which can inhibit DNA binding of E-protein homodimers (Forrest2014The). The transcription factor is also implicated in regulating apoptosis and cell survival pathways, as evidenced by its influence on the TGF-β signaling pathway and the expression of apoptosis-related genes (Forrest2013Knockdown).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TCF4 gene are primarily associated with Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and breathing abnormalities. These mutations include deletions, stop, splice-site, and missense mutations, often occurring de novo, leading to haploinsufficiency of the TCF4 gene (Peippo2011PittHopkins; Sweatt2013Pitt–Hopkins). The gene's dysfunction is linked to a range of phenotypes, from severe PTHS to milder conditions, and has been implicated in schizophrenia (Peippo2011PittHopkins).

Alterations in TCF4 expression are also associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia. The gene's variants are linked to intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders, with specific alleles influencing cognitive functions (Forrest2014The). TCF4 is involved in the regulation of genes like NRXN1 and CNTNAP2, which are associated with autism and schizophrenia, suggesting a broader impact of TCF4 alterations (Forrest2014The; Sweatt2013Pitt–Hopkins).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, TCF4 variants are implicated in Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), where specific alleles significantly increase the risk of developing this condition (Forrest2014The).

## Interactions
TCF4, a transcription factor, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. TCF4 interacts with β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. The binding occurs at specific sites on β-catenin, such as the G13ANDE17 sequence, which is critical for the β-catenin/TCF4 interaction (Yan2017Discovery; Huang2013Targeting). 

TCF4 also forms heterodimers with Math1, a proneural protein, to regulate neuronal progenitor differentiation. This interaction is essential for the development of specific neuronal subsets, particularly in the pontine nucleus of the mouse hindbrain (Flora2007The). 

Additionally, TCF4's interaction with plakoglobin is modulated by phosphorylation. Protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates TCF4, inhibiting its association with plakoglobin, which may influence its role in the Wnt signaling pathway (Miravet2002The). These interactions highlight TCF4's involvement in diverse cellular functions and its potential impact on developmental and signaling pathways.
