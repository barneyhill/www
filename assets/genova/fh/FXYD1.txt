# FXYD1

## Overview
FXYD1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as phospholemman, which is a member of the FXYD family of small transmembrane proteins. Phospholemman functions as an ion transport regulator, primarily modulating the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump, a critical component in maintaining ion homeostasis in muscle cells (Geering2005Function). This protein is characterized by its single transmembrane domain and its ability to form alpha-helical tetramers, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds (dhayan2014analysis). Phospholemman is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its regulatory role in ion transport and muscle contractility (Geering2005Function). The protein's interactions and modifications are particularly significant in excitable tissues like the heart and skeletal muscle, where they contribute to the regulation of cellular excitability and muscle function (Clausen2017The).

## Structure
The FXYD1 gene encodes the protein phospholemman, which is a 72-residue long, single-span transmembrane protein. Its primary structure includes a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a C-terminal extracellular domain (dhayan2014analysis). The secondary structure of phospholemman involves the formation of alpha-helical tetramers, both in vitro and in vivo, particularly within lipid bilayers (dhayan2014analysis). The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are common in FXYD proteins (Geering2005Function).

Phospholemman can form quaternary structures by associating with the Na+/K+-ATPase, acting as a regulatory subunit that modulates the pump's affinity for sodium and potassium ions (Geering2005Function). This interaction is crucial for its role in muscle contractility and ion transport regulation. Phospholemman undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by protein kinase A and C, which influence its regulatory functions and the balance between its monomeric and tetrameric forms (dhayan2014analysis; Geering2005Function). These structural features and modifications make phospholemman a key physiological regulator in cardiomyocytes and a potential target for cardiac therapeutics (dhayan2014analysis).

## Function
FXYD1, also known as phospholemman, is a small transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) pump in skeletal muscle cells. This protein modulates ion transport by inhibiting NKA activity, primarily by reducing its affinity for sodium ions (Na+). The inhibition of NKA by FXYD1 can be reversed through phosphorylation at specific serine residues, notably Ser 63 and Ser 68, which enhances the pump's activity and is essential for maintaining ion homeostasis during muscle contractions (Jan2021Effect).

In cultured human skeletal muscle cells, FXYD1 expression is significantly upregulated during differentiation into myotubes, particularly under low serum conditions. This upregulation is associated with increased NKA activity, which is vital for ion transport during muscle contractions (Jan2021Effect). The protein is more prominently expressed in CD56- cells compared to CD56+ cells, and its phosphorylated form is notably higher in co-cultures with neural cells, suggesting a role in modulating muscle cell response to innervation (Jan2021Effect).

FXYD1's regulation of NKA activity is critical for muscle function, influencing muscle contractility and cellular excitability, which are essential for normal muscle physiology (Jan2021Effect).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FXYD1 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), FXYD1 is significantly downregulated in both aganglionic and ganglionic segments of the colon in affected patients. This downregulation may contribute to persistent symptoms such as dysmotility and enterocolitis, even after surgical intervention, suggesting that abnormalities in the SIP syncytium, which includes cells expressing FXYD1, might influence the functional outcomes in HSCR patients (O’Donnell2018Abnormal).

In the realm of psychiatric disorders, missense variants in the FXYD1 gene have been associated with childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS). These variants are part of a novel association with the FXYD gene family, which modulates the function of the Na,K-ATPase complex, crucial for neuronal excitability. The presence of these variants in COS cases suggests a potential role in the pathophysiology of this disorder (Chaumette2018Missense).

These findings highlight the importance of FXYD1 in maintaining normal physiological functions and its potential involvement in various diseases when its expression or function is altered.

## Interactions
FXYD1, also known as phospholemman, is involved in several protein interactions that modulate its function and the activity of associated proteins. FXYD1 is known to colocalize with the Na/Ca exchanger, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggest a direct interaction between FXYD1 and the Na/Ca exchanger, leading to its inhibition (Geering2005Function). It also associates stably with six different Na,K-ATPase isozymes after coexpression in Xenopus oocytes, and with α1-β and to a lesser extent with α2-β complexes in heart and skeletal muscles. This association results in a small increase in the apparent affinity of Na,K-ATPase for external K+ and a twofold increase in the affinity for internal Na+ (Geering2005Function).

FXYD1 can be phosphorylated by protein kinases A and C, which decreases its inhibitory effect on Na,K-ATPase, particularly in the heart (Clausen2017The). The phosphorylation state of FXYD1 is significant as it modulates the activity of Na,K-ATPase, influencing muscle contractility and ion transport across cell membranes (Clausen2017The). These interactions are particularly relevant in excitable tissues such as heart and skeletal muscle, where they may help extrude increased intracellular Na+ during action potentials (Geering2005Function).
