# SCN7A

## Overview
The SCN7A gene encodes the sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 7, commonly referred to as the Na x channel. This protein is an atypical member of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) family, distinguished by its loss of voltage-gated properties and its primary function as a sensor of extracellular sodium ions. Unlike traditional VGSCs, the Na x channel does not participate in action potential generation but instead plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by sensing sodium concentration changes and facilitating intercellular communication. It is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and skin, where it contributes to processes such as glucose uptake, lactate production, and wound healing. The Na x channel's interactions with other proteins, such as the Na+/K+-ATPase, further underscore its importance in physiological regulation and its involvement in several signaling pathways (Dolivo2021The).

## Structure
The SCN7A gene encodes the Na x channel, which is part of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) family. Unlike typical VGSCs, Na x has lost its voltage-gated properties and functions primarily as a sensor of extracellular sodium ions (Dolivo2021The). The Na x channel is structurally distinct from other VGSCs, lacking certain basic residues in domains III and IV that are critical for standard VGSC function. It also features a methionine to isoleucine substitution in a motif crucial for sodium channel inactivation, indicating a divergence from typical VGSC activity (Dolivo2021The).

The Na x channel is selective for monovalent ions of alkali metals, with a preference for sodium and lithium ions. It interacts with Na + /K + -ATPase, particularly in response to environmental sodium levels (Dolivo2021The). The channel is expressed in various tissues, including cardiac, skeletal muscle, uterine, brain, lung, and Schwann cells (Dolivo2021The). Despite its atypical function, Na x shares structural homology with other VGSC α subunits, but specific details on its molecular structure are not extensively documented in the provided context (Dolivo2021The).

## Function
The SCN7A gene encodes the Na x channel, an atypical member of the voltage-gated sodium channel family, which functions as a concentration-dependent sensor of extracellular sodium ions rather than a traditional voltage-gated channel. In healthy human cells, Na x plays a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by sensing changes in sodium concentration and acting as a signal transducer. It is involved in regulating sodium ion concentrations in cells, particularly in epithelial tissues, where it is co-expressed with epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) (Dolivo2021The).

Na x is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, lung, and skin, where it contributes to sodium sensing and regulation. In the brain, Na x is involved in the uptake of glucose and production of lactate in glial cells, which then mediates signaling to neurons, influencing neuronal activity and water intake behavior (Dolivo2021The). In the skin, Na x is implicated in processes such as wound healing, where its upregulation during the re-epithelialization phase suggests a role in skin repair (Dolivo2021The).

Overall, the Na x channel, encoded by SCN7A, is essential for sensing sodium levels and mediating communication between cells to maintain physiological balance (Dolivo2021The).

## Clinical Significance
The SCN7A gene, encoding the Na x channel, is implicated in various pathological conditions due to alterations in its expression. In cardiac tissue, SCN7A expression is upregulated in patients with Brugada Syndrome, a condition associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. This upregulation may act as a compensatory mechanism for the downregulation of SCN5A, another sodium channel gene often mutated in Brugada Syndrome (Dolivo2021The). In skin repair, SCN7A is upregulated during re-epithelialization, and its absence in knockout mice leads to delayed wound healing due to reduced keratinocyte proliferation and migration, indicating its role in skin repair processes (Dolivo2021The).

SCN7A is also associated with fibrosis and inflammation. Its expression is linked to dermal and renal fibrosis, with increased levels observed in conditions like acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease-induced fibrosis (Dolivo2021The). In liver and pulmonary tissues, SCN7A expression is upregulated in response to tissue damage, potentially contributing to inflammation and fibrosis (Dolivo2021The). In hepatocellular carcinoma, higher SCN7A expression is associated with better survival outcomes, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic biomarker (Yan2022Comprehensive).

## Interactions
The SCN7A gene encodes the Na x channel, which is involved in several interactions with other proteins. Na x interacts directly with the Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit, which plays a role in sensitizing glial cells to sodium-induced glucose uptake. This interaction is crucial for enhanced glucose uptake and lactate production, which acts as a signaling molecule in neuronal activity (Dolivo2021The). Na x also co-localizes with the α1 subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase in rat neurons, and its activity is influenced by Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors, suggesting a functional coupling between these proteins (Dolivo2021The).

In addition to its interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase, Na x is involved in endothelin signaling pathways. It is regulated by endothelin signaling through the endothelin B receptor (ET B R) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways, affecting glucose metabolism and lactate release (Dolivo2021The). Na x colocalizes with ET-3 and ET B R in glial cells, and ET-3 can induce sodium influx in a Na x-dependent manner, indicating a complex interaction network involving Na x, Na+/K+-ATPase, endothelin receptors, and PKC (Dolivo2021The).
