# FAM86B1

## Overview
FAM86B1 is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 86, member B1. This protein is part of a larger family characterized by conserved sequence motifs, although its specific biological role remains to be fully elucidated. The FAM86B1 protein is not currently categorized under well-known protein classes such as kinases, receptors, or transmembrane proteins, suggesting it may have a unique or specialized function within the cell. Research into the FAM86B1 gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies focusing on its potential involvement in various cellular pathways and its implications in human health and disease.
