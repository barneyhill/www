# NELL2

## Overview
NELL2 (neural EGFL like 2) is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in neural development and function. The protein, also referred to as NELL2, is characterized by its complex structure, which includes thrombospondin-1-like modules, von Willebrand factor C domains, and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, categorizing it as a multi-domain glycoprotein involved in cell signaling and synaptic plasticity (Kim2010Identification; Kuroda1999Biochemical). NELL2 plays a critical role in the differentiation and development of motor and sensory neurons, particularly within the central nervous system (CNS) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Nelson2004NELL2). It interacts with various proteins, including protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and the Robo3 receptor, to mediate axon guidance and neural signaling (Pak2020NELL2Robo3; Kuroda1999Involvement). Additionally, NELL2 has been implicated in the progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through the FTO/E2F1/NELL2 axis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2021m6A).

## Structure
The NELL2 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It contains a secretion signal peptide, an NH2-terminal thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)-like module, five von Willebrand factor C domains, and six epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (Kim2010Identification; Kuroda1999Biochemical). The EGF-like domains are crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly in axon guidance, where they interact with the Robo3 receptor (Pak2020NELL2Robo3). 

NELL2 is a glycoprotein, with glycosylation occurring at multiple sites, which influences its stability and function (Kim2010Identification). The protein is capable of forming homotrimers, a quaternary structure that is essential for its biological activity, particularly in axon repulsion (Pak2020NELL2Robo3). 

A notable splice variant of NELL2, known as NELL2-Tsp, results from alternative splicing and includes the TSP-N domain but lacks the full set of EGF-like domains. This truncated isoform acts as a negative regulator of NELL2 by reducing its secretion and inhibiting neurite outgrowth (Kim2010Identification). The NELL2 gene is mapped to human chromosomal band 12q13.11-q13.12, with expression primarily in neural tissues (Watanabe1996Cloning).

## Function
NELL2 (neural EGFL like 2) is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in neural development and function. In healthy human cells, NELL2 plays a crucial role in the differentiation of motor and sensory neurons. It is secreted from the spinal cord and forms a homotrimer in solution, promoting the differentiation of central nervous system (CNS) progenitor cells and influencing the localization and differentiation of migrating neural crest cells into sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Nelson2004NELL2). NELL2 also stimulates mitogenesis in adjacent cells within the nascent DRG through paracrine signaling (Nelson2004NELL2).

NELL2 is highly expressed in the brain, where it functions as both a secreting neuropeptide and an intracellular neuromodulator. It interacts with protein kinase C (PKC) within neurons, influencing downstream target gene activation and synaptic remodeling (Lee2022Positioningdependent). The protein contains multiple functional domains, including von Willebrand factor C and EGF-like repeats, which contribute to its role in cell signaling and synaptic plasticity (Lee2022Positioningdependent). NELL2's expression is tightly regulated during development, with maximal expression during neurogenesis and differentiation of spinal cord motor neurons and sensory neurons within the DRG (Nelson2004NELL2).

## Clinical Significance
NELL2 (neural EGFL like 2) has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The FTO/E2F1/NELL2 axis plays a significant role in NSCLC, where the transcription factor E2F1, upregulated in NSCLC tissues, enhances cell viability, migration, and invasion by activating NELL2 expression. FTO, an m6A demethylase, modulates this process by inhibiting the m6A modification of E2F1, leading to increased NELL2 expression and promoting NSCLC cell behaviors and tumor growth (Wang2021m6A). This axis suggests potential therapeutic targets for NSCLC treatment, as alterations in NELL2 expression are associated with cancer progression (Wang2021m6A).

Outside of cancer, NELL2's role in other diseases is less clear from the provided context. However, it is known that NELL2 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system and has been implicated in the regulation of cell behavior in other cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer (Wang2021m6A). The context does not provide specific information on NELL2 mutations or expression alterations in neurological disorders, although such associations are noted in broader literature.

## Interactions
NELL2, a neural epidermal growth factor-like protein, engages in several significant protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its function in neural development and axon guidance. One of the primary interactions of NELL2 is with protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. NELL2 specifically associates with PKCβI, PKCε, and PKCζ, and this interaction leads to the phosphorylation of NELL2 in the presence of PKC activators. The EGF-like domains of NELL2 are essential for this interaction, which is potentially calcium-dependent (Kuroda1999Involvement).

NELL2 also interacts with the Robo3 receptor, a member of the Roundabout family, playing a critical role in axon guidance. The interaction between NELL2 and Robo3 involves the EGF domains of NELL2 binding to the FN domains of Robo3, which is crucial for axon repulsion activity. This interaction is particularly significant for the Robo3.1 isoform, which mediates axon repulsion in commissural neurons (Jaworski2015Operational; Pak2020NELL2Robo3). NELL2 can also bind to Robo2, although this interaction is less prominent and involves a cryptic binding site in the FNIII domain of Robo2 (Yamamoto2019Robo2). These interactions highlight NELL2's role in neural signaling and development.
