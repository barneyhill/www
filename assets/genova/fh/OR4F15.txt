# OR4F15

## Overview
OR4F15 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily F member 15, which belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a critical role in the olfactory system by initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. Beyond its olfactory functions, the OR4F15 protein is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including the skin, where it participates in cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and regeneration, contributing to skin homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The gene has also been implicated in several clinical contexts, including cancer progression and genetic conditions, highlighting its potential significance in both sensory and broader physiological functions (Park2023Comprehensive; Fan2023Contribution).

## Function
OR4F15 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily known for their role in detecting odor molecules in the olfactory epithelium, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. In addition to their role in olfaction, olfactory receptors like OR4F15 are expressed in other tissues, including the skin, where they are involved in various cellular processes. These processes include epidermal and keratinocyte proliferation, migration, regeneration, and cytokine production, which are crucial for maintaining skin homeostasis (Uehara2021Non‐invasive).

The expression of OR4F15 and other olfactory receptor genes in the skin suggests a broader functional role beyond olfaction, potentially influencing skin sensitivity and response to environmental stimuli. The downregulation of OR4F15 in individuals with sensitive skin indicates that it may play a role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis, although it remains unclear whether this downregulation is a cause or consequence of skin sensitivity (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The involvement of OR4F15 in these processes highlights its significance in both sensory perception and broader physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
The OR4F15 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its specific clinical significance remains somewhat unclear. In the context of cancer, OR4F15 is considered crucial for cancer cell growth and progression, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it promotes invasiveness and metastasis. It is also involved in apoptosis and reducing cell migration and proliferation, making it a potential target for anticancer strategies (Park2023Comprehensive).

In genetic studies, OR4F15 has been associated with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in an Asian population. A specific variant, p.S20L, showed a significant association with PCV, suggesting that rare variants in OR4F15 may contribute to the genetic architecture of this condition (Fan2023Contribution).

Additionally, OR4F15 has been mentioned in the context of intellectual disability and other phenotypic features such as psychomotor retardation and spatial disorientation, although specific clinical significance in these areas is not detailed (Montagne2018CoDEseq). It is also part of a larger CNV region associated with growth and developmental issues, but its direct role in these conditions is not specified (Wit2014Copy).
