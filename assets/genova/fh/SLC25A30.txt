# SLC25A30

## Overview
The SLC25A30 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 25 member 30, also known as uncoupling protein 6 (UCP6), which is a member of the mitochondrial carrier family. This family is characterized by its role in transporting various substrates across the mitochondrial membrane, contributing to mitochondrial bioenergetics and cellular metabolism. UCP6 is primarily expressed in the kidney cortex and is involved in the transport of inorganic anions and dicarboxylates, playing a significant role in the export of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) degradation products. The protein's structure includes six transmembrane alpha-helices and a signature sequence motif that facilitates substrate transport through the formation of salt bridges (Palmieri2013The; Gorgoglione2019The). UCP6 shares a high degree of structural similarity with UCP5, although it exhibits distinct transport affinities and physiological roles (Gorgoglione2019The).

## Structure
The SLC25A30 gene encodes the human uncoupling protein 6 (UCP6), which is part of the mitochondrial carrier family (SLC25). This family is characterized by a tripartite structure consisting of three tandemly repeated domains, each approximately 100 amino acids in length. Each domain contains two hydrophobic segments that span the mitochondrial membrane as alpha-helices, forming a total of six transmembrane alpha-helices (Palmieri2013The). These helices create a funnel-shaped structure with a central cavity, which is crucial for the transport function of the protein (Palmieri2013The).

The protein structure includes a signature sequence motif, PX[D/E]XX[K/R]X[K/R], which is involved in forming salt bridges that stabilize the protein and facilitate substrate transport (Palmieri2013The). UCP6 shares 81% identity with UCP5, indicating a high degree of structural similarity, although UCP5 is more active in transport functions (Gorgoglione2019The). The protein is primarily expressed in the kidney cortex, where it plays a role in exporting H2S degradation products (Gorgoglione2019The). The study of UCP6 has not detailed specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The SLC25A30 gene encodes the human uncoupling protein 6 (UCP6), which is part of the mitochondrial carrier family. UCP6 is primarily expressed in the kidney and is involved in the transport of inorganic anions such as sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, and phosphate, as well as dicarboxylates like malonate and malate across the mitochondrial membrane (Gorgoglione2019The). This protein facilitates a fast counter-exchange of substrates, with higher transport affinities for sulfate and thiosulfate, suggesting a physiological role in exporting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) degradation products from the mitochondria. This function is important for modulating the levels of H2S, a signaling molecule (Gorgoglione2019The).

UCP6, along with UCP5, catalyzes the exchange of sulfur oxyanions, phosphate, and dicarboxylates, contributing to mitochondrial bioenergetics by facilitating the transport of these anions across the mitochondrial membrane (Gorgoglione2019The). The transport activities of UCP6 are influenced by pH and are inhibited by several mitochondrial carrier inhibitors, indicating its role in mitochondrial transport processes (Gorgoglione2019The). UCP6 shares structural homology with UCP5, with 72% identical amino acids, and is localized to the mitochondria, specifically in the proximal and distal tubules of the kidney cortex (Gorgoglione2019The).
