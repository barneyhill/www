# FDFT1

## Overview
FDFT1, or farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1, is a gene that encodes the enzyme squalene synthase, a key player in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is categorized as a prenyltransferase and is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate into squalene, marking the first committed step in the production of cholesterol (Ha2020Roles). Squalene synthase is a membrane-associated enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis and is involved in various cellular functions, including mitochondrial electron transport and protein prenylation (Ha2020Roles). The regulation of FDFT1 is influenced by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, particularly SREBP2, which modulate its expression in response to cholesterol levels and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Ha2020Roles). Given its central role in cholesterol metabolism and its interactions with proteins involved in cancer and other cellular processes, FDFT1 is considered a potential therapeutic target (Ha2020Roles; Nakae2021Ubiquitin).

## Structure
The FDFT1 gene encodes the enzyme squalene synthase, which plays a crucial role in cholesterol biosynthesis. The primary structure of the FDFT1 protein consists of 416 amino acids, resulting in a molecular weight of approximately 47 kDa (Ha2020Roles; Hobbs2012Exclusion). The enzyme functions as a homodimer, indicating its quaternary structure (Ha2020Roles). 

FDFT1 contains a prenyltransferase domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity in catalyzing the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate into squalene (Ha2020Roles). The enzyme requires a divalent cation, preferably Mg2+, for its activity, highlighting the importance of metal ions in its function (Ha2020Roles). 

Although specific details on the secondary and tertiary structures are not provided in the context, the protein is known to interact with various proteins, suggesting a complex structural conformation that facilitates these interactions (Ha2020Roles). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may occur, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context (Ha2020Roles).

## Function
FDFT1, also known as farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1, encodes the enzyme squalene synthase, which is crucial in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) into squalene, marking the first committed step in cholesterol production (Ha2020Roles). Squalene synthase is a membrane-associated enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a vital role in maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Ha2020Roles).

Cholesterol, synthesized through the action of FDFT1, is essential for various cellular functions, including maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes and forming lipid rafts. These microdomains are involved in signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and cell adhesion (Ha2020Roles). The enzyme's activity is also necessary for mitochondrial electron transport, glycoprotein synthesis, and protein prenylation, which are critical for cell growth and signaling (Ha2020Roles).

FDFT1's regulation is influenced by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), particularly SREBP2, which modulate its expression in response to cholesterol levels and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Ha2020Roles). This regulation ensures that cholesterol synthesis aligns with cellular needs, contributing to overall lipid metabolism and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FDFT1 gene, which encodes squalene synthase, can lead to significant clinical manifestations due to its crucial role in cholesterol biosynthesis. Deficiencies in squalene synthase caused by FDFT1 mutations result in a cholesterol biosynthesis defect, which is associated with a range of clinical features. These include profound developmental delay, brain abnormalities, syndactyly of the toes, facial dysmorphisms, dry skin with photosensitivity, seizures, structural brain malformations, visual impairment, and genital malformations in males. These symptoms resemble those of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, a known cholesterol biosynthesis disorder (Coman2018Squalene).

Alterations in FDFT1 expression levels are also implicated in various cancers. High expression of FDFT1 is observed in several cancers, including liver, lung, prostate, and breast cancers, and is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastasis, particularly in lung cancer (Ha2020Roles; Ershov2021Enzymes). Conversely, in colorectal cancer, FDFT1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its downregulation linked to malignant progression and poor prognosis (Ershov2021Enzymes). The gene's involvement in cholesterol biosynthesis and its interactions with proteins related to cancer hallmarks suggest its potential as a therapeutic target (Ha2020Roles).

## Interactions
Farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) interacts with a variety of proteins involved in cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer and cholesterol biosynthesis. FDFT1 is known to interact with proteins such as HERC2, NR2C2, RUVBL1, and WWOX, which are involved in DNA repair and genomic stability (Ha2020Roles). It also interacts with CD74 and UNC93B1, which play roles in immune evasion and neuronal development (Ha2020Roles). 

FDFT1 is part of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and interacts with proteins like epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), and estrogen receptor 2 (ERβ), which are crucial for cell proliferation and apoptosis (Ha2020Roles). The enzyme is also stabilized by USP32, a deubiquitinating enzyme, which enhances its role in the mevalonate pathway and contributes to cancer progression (Nakae2021Ubiquitin).

In the context of ferroptosis, FDFT1 interacts with FIN56, a ferroptosis inducer, suggesting a regulatory role in lipid peroxidation and cell death (Picón2023Unveiling). These interactions highlight FDFT1's involvement in various cellular pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target.
