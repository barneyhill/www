# GRM6

## Overview
The GRM6 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), a G-protein coupled receptor predominantly expressed in the retina. This receptor plays a pivotal role in the visual signal transduction pathway, particularly in the transmission of signals from photoreceptors to ON bipolar cells, which is crucial for night vision. Structurally, mGluR6 is characterized by seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of G-protein coupled receptors, and features a large extracellular domain and an intracellular C-terminal tail. Functionally, mGluR6 modulates neurotransmitter release by inhibiting the cyclic AMP cascade in response to glutamate binding, thereby contributing to the dichotomy between ON and OFF bipolar cells in the retina. Mutations in the GRM6 gene can lead to congenital stationary night blindness, highlighting the gene's clinical significance in maintaining proper visual function (Zeitz2005Mutations; Nakajima1993Molecular; Zeitz2007Night).

## Structure
The GRM6 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), a G-protein coupled receptor primarily expressed in the retina. The primary structure of mGluR6 consists of 871 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 95,084 Da (Nakajima1993Molecular). The receptor features a large extracellular domain, seven transmembrane domains, and an intracellular C-terminal tail (Nakajima1993Molecular; Enz2012Metabotropic). 

The secondary structure includes seven transmembrane helices, which are characteristic of G-protein coupled receptors (Pin1995The). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to form a functional receptor capable of binding glutamate in a cleft between two globular domains, similar to bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (Pin1995The). 

Post-translational modifications of mGluR6 include potential N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular regions and phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic regions, which may play roles in receptor regulation and function (Nakajima1993Molecular). 

Mutations in GRM6 can lead to congenital stationary night blindness, affecting the receptor's trafficking and localization, which underscores the importance of its structural integrity for proper function (Zeitz2007Night).

## Function
The GRM6 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), which is primarily expressed in the dendrites of ON bipolar cells in the retina. This receptor plays a critical role in the transmission of visual signals from photoreceptors to ON bipolar cells, which are essential for night vision and the proper functioning of the rod pathway (Zeitz2005Mutations; Dryja2005Night). In healthy human cells, mGluR6 is involved in the detection of glutamate released by photoreceptors. In darkness, photoreceptor cells release glutamate, which interacts with mGluR6 receptors, causing ON bipolar cells to hyperpolarize by closing a non-selective cation channel. In light, the decrease in glutamate release leads to the opening of the transduction channel, resulting in depolarization of ON bipolar cells (Nakajima2009Isolation; Dryja2005Night).

The mGluR6 receptor is part of a group of G-protein-coupled receptors that inhibit the cyclic AMP cascade, which is crucial for the modulation of neurotransmitter release in response to glutamate (Zeitz2005Mutations). This mechanism is fundamental to the dichotomy between ON and OFF bipolar cells in the retina, contributing to the visual processing of light stimuli (Nakajima2009Isolation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRM6 gene, which encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), are associated with congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB), a non-progressive retinal disorder characterized by impaired night vision. These mutations disrupt the normal signal transmission from photoreceptors to ON-bipolar cells in the retina, leading to the CSNB phenotype (Zeitz2005Mutations; Zeitz2015Congenital). Various types of mutations, including nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations, have been identified in GRM6. These mutations often result in a loss of function due to mechanisms like nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or the production of non-functional receptors (Zeitz2015Congenital; Zeitz2007Night).

Missense mutations in GRM6 can lead to trafficking defects, preventing the receptor from reaching the cell surface, which is essential for proper glutamate binding and signal transmission (Zeitz2015Congenital; Zeitz2007Night). This mislocalization results in the CSNB phenotype, as the glutamate cannot effectively bind to the receptor on the ON-bipolar cell surface, disrupting the signaling cascade (Zeitz2015Congenital). The condition is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, although pseudodominant inheritance has been observed in some families due to the presence of multiple deleterious variants (Liu2019Pseudodominant).

## Interactions
The GRM6 gene encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), which is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in the retina. mGluR6 interacts with G-proteins, specifically coupling with the Gαi subunit via its second intracellular loop and with Gβγ subunits through a conserved sequence in its C-terminal domain (CTD) (Rai2020Involvement). These interactions are essential for the receptor's role in modulating intracellular signaling pathways.

The CTD of mGluR6 is also implicated in interactions with scaffold proteins containing PDZ domains, which are important for the receptor's surface localization and intracellular trafficking (Rai2020Involvement). This domain acts as a regulatory element, influencing the receptor's localization and function by potentially interacting with other proteins involved in intracellular trafficking (Rai2020Involvement).

Mutations in the GRM6 gene can disrupt these interactions, leading to conditions such as congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). These mutations often result in the retention of mGluR6 in the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing proper trafficking to the cell surface and impairing its function in synaptic transmission (Zeitz2007Night).
