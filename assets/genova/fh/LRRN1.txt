# LRRN1

## Overview
LRRN1, or leucine-rich repeat neuronal 1, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is integral to neuronal development and function. The LRRN1 protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions crucial for cell signaling and neuronal differentiation. As a single-pass transmembrane protein, LRRN1 is involved in synaptic plasticity and neural connectivity, playing a significant role in cognitive processes. Structurally, it includes 12 extracellular LRRs, an immunoglobulin domain, and a fibronectin type III domain, suggesting its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. These features are essential for establishing compartment boundaries during neural development. LRRN1 is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly in gastric cancer, where it may promote tumor cell survival by modulating apoptotic signaling pathways. Clinically, genetic variants in LRRN1 have been associated with stroke risk, especially in individuals with type 1 diabetes, highlighting its potential significance in both neurological and systemic diseases (Antikainen2024Wholegenome; Andreae2007Analysis; Liu2019Leucine‐rich).

## Structure
The LRRN1 protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which are integral to its structure and function. The primary structure of LRRN1 consists of 716 amino acids, with a high degree of sequence identity to its human and mouse orthologues (Andreae2007Analysis). The protein includes 12 extracellular LRRs, which are flanked by amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains, contributing to its secondary structure (Andreae2007Analysis). These LRRs typically form a horseshoe-shaped solenoidal structure, which is common among proteins in the extracellular LRR superfamily (Dolan2007The).

LRRN1 also contains a single immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and a fibronectin type III (FnIII) domain, which are part of the FIGLER protein group, indicating a complex tertiary structure (Winther2013Neural). The protein is a single-pass transmembrane protein, with a cytoplasmic tail that includes motifs for regulated clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Winther2013Neural). Post-translational modifications such as N-linked glycosylation are present, with eight potential sites identified, which are important for protein conformation and stability (Andreae2007Analysis). The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, as LRRN1 is part of a network of receptor-ligand pairs involved in neural development (Söllner2009A).

## Function
The LRRN1 gene encodes a protein involved in neuronal development and function, characterized by leucine-rich repeats that facilitate protein-protein interactions. In healthy human cells, LRRN1 is primarily active in the nervous system, where it plays a significant role in cell signaling and neuronal differentiation. The protein is involved in synaptic plasticity, contributing to cognitive processes and neural connectivity (Andreae2007Analysis).

LRRN1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein with 12 extracellular leucine-rich repeats, an immunoglobulin domain, and a membrane-proximal fibronectin type III domain. These structural features suggest its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, which are crucial for establishing compartment boundaries during neural development (Andreae2007Analysis). The protein is localized to the plasma membrane and is internalized into early endosomes, indicating a role in endocytic regulation of cell adhesion or signaling (Andreae2007Analysis).

The expression of LRRN1 is dynamic during development, initially localized to the ventricular layer and downregulated at neuromeric boundaries, suggesting its involvement in boundary formation and maintenance in the central nervous system (Andreae2007Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
The LRRN1 gene has been implicated in stroke, particularly in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Research has identified rare and low-frequency protein-altering variants (PAVs) in LRRN1 that are associated with stroke risk in T1D patients. These variants showed a significant association with stroke, with a p-value of 3.49 × 10^-6, and were suggestively associated with ischemic stroke (Antikainen2024Wholegenome). In the general population, LRRN1 was associated with stroke through an aggregate of ultra-rare loss-of-function and deleterious missense variants, although not specifically for ischemic stroke (Antikainen2024Wholegenome).

The study highlighted the challenges of replicating rare variant findings due to imputation uncertainty in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), suggesting that increasing the allele frequency threshold might be necessary for successful replication (Antikainen2024Wholegenome). Despite these challenges, the potential role of LRRN1 in stroke, particularly ischemic stroke, was emphasized when considering low-frequency variants (Antikainen2024Wholegenome). The findings suggest that genetic variants in LRRN1 may contribute to stroke susceptibility, highlighting its clinical significance in the context of T1D and potentially in the broader population (Antikainen2024Wholegenome).

## Interactions
LRRN1, a leucine-rich repeat neuronal protein, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in neural development and cancer biology. In zebrafish, LRRN1 has been shown to interact with members of the Netrin-G1 ligand/Lrrc4 subfamily, indicating its role in extracellular interactions within the neural receptor network (Söllner2009A). These interactions suggest that LRRN1 may participate in complex signaling pathways that are essential for neural development.

In the context of gastric cancer, LRRN1 is implicated in suppressing apoptosis by inhibiting the Fas/FasL pathway. This interaction is significant as it highlights LRRN1's role in promoting tumor cell survival and proliferation, potentially through the modulation of apoptotic signaling pathways (Liu2019Leucine‐rich). The protein's involvement in these pathways suggests that it may form part of a multiprotein complex or interact transiently with other signaling molecules to exert its effects.

Additionally, LRRN1's expression and localization studies in chick neural development suggest its involvement in cell adhesion or signaling processes, possibly through interactions within the endosomal pathway (Andreae2007Analysis). These interactions are crucial for understanding LRRN1's role in neural development and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
