# LRRC19

## Overview
LRRC19 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat containing 19, which functions as a transmembrane receptor involved in immune responses. This protein is predominantly expressed in kidney tubular epithelial cells, where it plays a critical role in the innate immune defense against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infections. As a pathogen-recognition receptor, LRRC19 activates key signaling pathways, including NF-kB and MAPK, through interactions with TRAF2 and TRAF6, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These responses are essential for recruiting immune cells to the site of infection, thereby aiding in bacterial clearance (Su2014LRRC19). Additionally, LRRC19 has been implicated in modulating inflammatory responses in the gut and is associated with various diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, highlighting its significance in both immune regulation and disease pathology (Zhang2020LRRC19—A; Xie2024Desulfovibrio).

## Function
LRRC19 is a transmembrane receptor predominantly expressed in kidney tubular epithelial cells, where it plays a crucial role in the innate immune response against uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infections. It functions as a pathogen-recognition receptor, activating NF-kB and MAPK signaling pathways through interactions with TRAF2 and TRAF6. This activation leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial substances, which are essential for recruiting inflammatory cells such as monocytes and neutrophils to the kidney tissue, aiding in the elimination of bacterial infections (Su2014LRRC19).

LRRC19 modulates the stability and activity of TRAF2 and TRAF6 by affecting their ubiquitination. It inhibits the degradation of TRAF2 by decreasing its ubiquitination and increases K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6, promoting inflammatory responses independent of the TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathway (Su2014LRRC19). LRRC19 is not expressed in the bladder, which may explain the differences in infection and inflammation observed in bladder tissues compared to kidney tissues (Su2014LRRC19). The gene's role in immune defense mechanisms highlights its importance in maintaining kidney health and preventing bacterial infections.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LRRC19 gene have been linked to several diseases, particularly inflammatory and cancerous conditions. In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, such as colitis, LRRC19 interacts with Desulfovibrio vulgaris, exacerbating the condition by activating pro-inflammatory pathways. This interaction leads to the upregulation of inflammatory genes and the activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, resulting in increased expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. The study suggests that targeting the interaction between LRRC19 and Desulfovibrio vulgaris could be a potential therapeutic strategy for managing colitis (Xie2024Desulfovibrio).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), LRRC19 expression is significantly decreased, particularly in advanced stages of the disease. Low expression levels of LRRC19 are associated with a lower risk of overall survival and disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The gene's expression is also linked to metabolic processes and signal transduction pathways, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression (Zhang2020LRRC19—A).

LRRC19 also plays a crucial role in preventing infections by uropathogenic bacteria in the kidney. Its deficiency leads to increased susceptibility to infections, highlighting its importance in renal immune defense (Su2014LRRC19).

## Interactions
LRRC19 interacts with TRAF2 and TRAF6, two key proteins involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. These interactions are crucial for modulating immune responses. LRRC19 binds to the intracellular regions of TRAF2 and TRAF6, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation analyses and confocal observations. This binding affects the ubiquitination and degradation of these TRAF proteins. Specifically, LRRC19 inhibits the degradation of TRAF2 by reducing its ubiquitination, which is essential for promoting inflammatory responses in renal tubular epithelial cells exposed to uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) (Su2014LRRC19). In the case of TRAF6, LRRC19 increases K63-linked ubiquitination, which is associated with activating downstream signaling pathways, while inhibiting K48-linked ubiquitination, which typically targets proteins for degradation (Su2014LRRC19).

LRRC19 also interacts with Desulfovibrio vulgaris flagellin (DVF) in the gut, exacerbating colitis by activating the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways through TRAF6-mediated mechanisms. This interaction promotes the recruitment of pro-inflammatory immune cells and is dependent on LRRC19 signaling, as demonstrated by the lack of colitis exacerbation in LRRC19 knockout mice (Xie2024Desulfovibrio). The interaction between DVF and LRRC19 was confirmed through molecular docking, SPR, and MST assays (Xie2024Desulfovibrio).
