# TMPRSS9

## Overview
TMPRSS9 is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane serine protease 9, a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family. This protein is characterized by its unique structure, which includes three serine protease domains, two of which are catalytically active. The protein is anchored to the plasma membrane, facilitating its role in various cellular processes. TMPRSS9 is involved in proteolytic activities and has been studied for its potential interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of viral infections and neurological conditions. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that are expressed in various tissues, contributing to its diverse functional roles (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored; Cao2021The).

## Structure
TMPRSS9, also known as polyserase, is a type II transmembrane serine protease characterized by its unique structure, which includes three serine protease domains. Of these, two display catalytic activity, while the third is non-catalytic (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). The protein is anchored to the plasma membrane via a transmembrane domain, positioning the protease with a cytoplasmic amino-terminal domain and a catalytic serine protease domain at the carboxy-terminus (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored).

The primary structure of TMPRSS9 includes a conserved catalytic triad composed of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Escalante2021Structural). The secondary structure of TMPRSS9 shows a high degree of conservation in the alpha-helices and beta-sheets, although there is notable dissimilarity in the loop region between residues 50-70 (Escalante2021Structural).

TMPRSS9 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms. The shorter splice variant, serase-1B, contains only the first of the three serine protease domains and is expressed in various tissues, including the liver and small intestine (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored). Recombinant serase-1B exhibits proteolytic activity and can be inhibited by serpins such as aprotinin and PAI-1 (Antalis2011MembraneAnchored).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMPRSS9 gene have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurological conditions. A study identified compound heterozygous nonsense mutations in TMPRSS9 in a female patient with ASD, who experienced developmental regression, including loss of language and social skills, and exhibited multiple neurological problems (Chen2020Combination). These mutations were inherited from both parents and were located in different functional domains of the gene, suggesting a potential link between TMPRSS9 mutations and neurological and developmental disorders (Chen2020Combination).

Animal modeling studies using Tmprss9 knockout mice have shown that the loss of TMPRSS9 function can lead to decreased social interest and recognition, behaviors relevant to ASD. However, these mice did not exhibit severe intellectual disability or developmental regression, which were observed in the human patient, indicating that the mouse model does not fully replicate the human condition (Chen2020Combination). The prevalence of individuals with both loss-of-function alleles in TMPRSS9 is estimated to be about 1 in 2 million, highlighting the rarity of these mutations (Chen2020Combination). Further research is needed to establish a stronger gene-disease link and to explore the clinical significance of TMPRSS9 mutations in ASD.

## Interactions
TMPRSS9, a member of the transmembrane serine protease family, has been studied for its potential interactions with other proteins, although specific interactions are not extensively detailed. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, TMPRSS9 has been noted for its high expression in the lungs, particularly at the neonatal stage, and shows a significant correlation with ACE2 expression (r = 0.81, p < 0.001), suggesting a potential role in the viral infection process (Cao2021The). Despite this correlation, TMPRSS9 is described as a poor activator of substrates with polybasic sequences, indicating it may not be a major player in the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (FuentesPrior2021Priming).

In earthworms, TMPRSS9 is identified as lumbrokinase, which exhibits both kinase activity and serine-type endopeptidase activity, contributing to the prevention of blood coagulation. However, in the study of arsenite exposure, TMPRSS9 was found to be downregulated and showed no significant interactions with other proteins in the protein-protein interaction analysis (Wang2022Effect). These findings suggest that while TMPRSS9 may have potential roles in various biological processes, its specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain to be fully elucidated.
