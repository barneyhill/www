# SCO2

## Overview
The SCO2 gene encodes a protein that is integral to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, specifically in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a critical enzyme for aerobic energy production. The SCO2 protein functions as a thiol-disulphide oxidoreductase and metallochaperone, facilitating the delivery of copper to cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CO II), which is essential for the enzyme's electron transfer activity (Leary2009Human). This protein is characterized by a conserved CxxxC copper-binding motif and a thioredoxin fold, which are crucial for its role in copper delivery and CO II maturation (Ekim2021The; Leary2009Human). Mutations in the SCO2 gene can lead to COX deficiency, resulting in severe mitochondrial disorders such as fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy, highlighting the gene's importance in cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Papadopoulou1999Fatal; Leary2009Human).

## Structure
The SCO2 protein is an integral membrane protein involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CO II). It contains a conserved CxxxC copper-binding motif in its C-terminal region, which protrudes into the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Leary2009Human). This motif is crucial for its function as a thiol-disulphide oxidoreductase, facilitating the oxidation of cysteine thiols in SCO1 and the direct transfer of copper to CO II (Leary2009Human). The protein also features a thioredoxin fold, which is associated with its oxidoreductase activity (Ekim2021The; Leary2009Human).

SCO2 undergoes significant conformational changes between its apo- and copper-loaded forms, which are important for its dynamic role in copper delivery and CO II maturation (Leary2009Human). Pathogenic mutations, such as E140K, affect its copper-binding ability and stability, impacting its function in CO II synthesis (Leary2009Human). The interaction with COA6 is essential for SCO2's role in copper incorporation into COX2, highlighting its involvement in forming a ternary complex with COX2 (PacheuGrau2015Cooperation). The structural details of SCO2, including specific domains and post-translational modifications, are not extensively detailed in the available literature.

## Function
The SCO2 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. SCO2 is essential for the synthesis and maturation of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CO II) by acting as a thiol-disulphide oxidoreductase. It regulates the redox state of cysteines in SCO1, which is necessary for CO II maturation and the proper assembly of the COX holoenzyme (Leary2009Human).

SCO2 functions as a metallochaperone, facilitating the delivery of copper to the Cu A site of CO II. This process is crucial for the electron transfer activity of COX, which is vital for aerobic ATP production in mitochondria (Leary2004Human; Leary2009Human). The protein is active in the mitochondria, where it interacts with other COX assembly factors, such as COX17, to ensure efficient copper loading and CO II synthesis (Leary2009Human).

Mutations in SCO2, such as the E140K missense mutation, can lead to COX deficiency and are associated with severe clinical outcomes, underscoring the gene's importance in cellular respiration and energy metabolism (Leary2004Human; Leary2009Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCO2 gene are associated with several severe mitochondrial disorders, primarily characterized by cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. One of the most notable conditions linked to SCO2 mutations is fatal infantile cardioencephalomyopathy, which presents with symptoms such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, encephalopathy, and myopathy. This condition often leads to early death due to cardiac or respiratory failure (Sambuughin2013Exome; Papadopoulou1999Fatal). The E140K mutation is particularly common and is associated with a delayed onset of symptoms and a more prolonged disease course compared to other mutations (Yang2009Analysis; LEARY2006A).

SCO2 mutations have also been implicated in other conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy type I (SMA-1) phenotype and early-onset axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, both of which are linked to cellular copper deficiency and COX dysfunction (Tarnopolsky2003Novel; Rebelo2018SCO2). These mutations often affect the copper-binding regions of the SCO2 protein, disrupting its normal function in copper insertion into COX, which is crucial for its activity (Papadopoulou1999Fatal; Stiburek2005Tissuespecific). The clinical manifestations of SCO2 mutations vary, but they consistently involve severe metabolic and neurological impairments.

## Interactions
SCO2 is involved in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and interacts with several proteins crucial for this process. SCO2 interacts with SCO1, facilitating the maturation of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (CO II) by catalyzing the oxidation of cysteine thiols in SCO1, which is essential for copper delivery to CO II (Leary2009Human). SCO2 also forms a complex with COA6 and COX2, which is necessary for COX2 stability and proper mitochondrial function. This interaction is disrupted by pathogenic mutations, such as the W59C variant in COA6, which affects mitochondrial localization and function (PacheuGrau2015Cooperation).

SCO2's interaction with COX17 is significant for copper delivery to COX. COX17 can partially rescue COX deficiency in SCO2 patient cells, indicating a specific interaction between these proteins (Leary2004Human). SCO2 and SCO1 function cooperatively but independently in copper delivery, with SCO2 acting upstream of SCO1 in the copper delivery pathway (Leary2004Human). These interactions highlight the critical role of SCO2 in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase, with mutations leading to severe mitochondrial disorders.
