# DNAJC15

## Overview
DNAJC15 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C15, also known as the methylation-controlled J protein (MCJ). This protein is a mitochondrial co-chaperone that plays a critical role in regulating the mitochondrial respiratory chain by inhibiting complex I activity, thereby influencing mitochondrial respiration and energy production (Hatle2013MCJDnaJC15; Navasa2015Ikaros). DNAJC15 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the modulation of mitochondrial supercomplex formation, which includes complexes I, III, and IV (Navasa2015Ikaros). The protein's interactions with other mitochondrial components and transcription factors underscore its importance in cellular energy metabolism and stress responses. Alterations in DNAJC15 expression and genetic variations have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer, where it may influence chemoresistance and disease progression (Jackson2018Mitochondrial; FernandezMuñoz2024Mutational).

## Function
DNAJC15, also known as MCJ, is a mitochondrial protein that functions as a negative regulator of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, specifically inhibiting complex I activity. This regulation is crucial for controlling mitochondrial respiration and energy production in healthy human cells (Hatle2013MCJDnaJC15; Navasa2015Ikaros). DNAJC15 is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and interacts with complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC), interfering with the formation of supercomplexes composed of complexes I, III, and IV (Navasa2015Ikaros). 

The absence of DNAJC15 leads to increased mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative respiration, and ATP production, without a corresponding increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Hatle2013MCJDnaJC15). This suggests that DNAJC15 plays a role in modulating mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, particularly under altered metabolic states (Hatle2013MCJDnaJC15). 

In terms of cellular outcomes, DNAJC15 deficiency prevents the pathological accumulation of lipids in the liver during starvation or a high-cholesterol diet, indicating its role in lipid metabolism and energy conservation during metabolic stress (Navasa2015Ikaros). DNAJC15 is highly expressed in tissues such as the heart, liver, and kidney, and within the immune system, particularly in CD8+ T cells and macrophages (Navasa2015Ikaros).

## Clinical Significance
DNAJC15, a member of the Hsp40 family, is implicated in various clinical conditions due to alterations in its expression and genetic variations. In breast cancer, DNAJC15 is frequently subject to copy number variations (CNVs), particularly deletions, which are shared between Luminal A and Basal subtypes. These CNVs are associated with down-regulation of DNAJC15 expression, potentially impacting clinical outcomes and survival rates in breast cancer patients (FernandezMuñoz2024Mutational). The study of CNVs in DNAJC15 and other HSP genes suggests that these genetic alterations could serve as phenotypic markers of cancer, although their direct role in cancer progression remains to be fully elucidated (FernandezMuñoz2024Mutational).

While DNAJC15 is not directly associated with specific diseases in the provided context, its involvement in mitochondrial functions, such as regulation of respiratory chain supercomplex assembly and mitochondrial outer membrane permeability during apoptosis, suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to mitochondrial dysfunctions and related pathologies (Jackson2018Mitochondrial). The gene's role in these processes highlights its potential impact on cancer development and chemoresistance, particularly in ovarian and breast cancers. However, specific diseases directly linked to DNAJC15 mutations are not detailed in the available context.

## Interactions
DNAJC15, also known as the methylation-controlled J protein (MCJ), participates in several significant protein interactions. It physically interacts with the transcription factor c-Jun, promoting its degradation. This interaction is crucial in preventing the accumulation of c-Jun, which would otherwise lead to the expression of the ABCB1 transporter associated with multidrug resistance in cancer cells. The interaction between DNAJC15 and c-Jun was confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation analysis, particularly when proteasome function was inhibited, allowing c-Jun accumulation (Hatle2007MethylationControlled).

DNAJC15 also interacts with components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It associates with complex I, specifically interacting with the subunit NDUFv1, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation analysis using heart mitochondrial extracts. This interaction suggests that DNAJC15 inhibits complex I, leading to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production (Hatle2013MCJDnaJC15). DNAJC15 is also involved in the regulation of mitochondrial supercomplex formation, which includes complexes I, III, and IV, thereby acting as a negative regulator of complex I activity (Hatle2013MCJDnaJC15; Navasa2015Ikaros). These interactions highlight DNAJC15's role in modulating both transcriptional activity and mitochondrial function.
