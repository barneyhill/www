# OR4D10

## Overview
OR4D10 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily D member 10, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein functions as a transmembrane receptor involved in the detection and transduction of odorant signals within the olfactory system. As part of the extensive olfactory receptor family, OR4D10 contributes to the molecular diversity necessary for the recognition of a wide array of odor molecules, facilitating the perception of smell. The gene is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a critical role in the initial stages of olfactory signal transduction by binding specific odorants and activating associated G-proteins, which in turn initiate a cascade of intracellular signaling events (Yin2020Functional; Yoshikawa2022Diverse). While its primary function is linked to olfaction, the broader physiological roles of OR4D10 remain to be fully elucidated (Yu2012GenomeWide).

## Structure


## Function
OR4D10 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in olfactory transduction, the process by which odorant signals are converted into neuronal responses. OR4D10 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, contributing to the diversity of olfactory detection and the perception of smell (Yin2020Functional).

The function of OR4D10 in healthy human cells is primarily associated with its role in the olfactory system. It is involved in the initial stages of odor detection, where it interacts with odorant molecules and initiates a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. This process involves the activation of G-proteins, which subsequently trigger a cascade of intracellular events leading to neuronal activation and the transmission of olfactory information to the brain (Yoshikawa2022Diverse).

While OR4D10 is primarily known for its role in olfaction, its specific function in other tissues or its involvement in broader physiological processes in healthy human cells has not been extensively detailed in the available literature (Yu2012GenomeWide).
