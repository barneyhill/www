# PPP1R14A

## Overview
PPP1R14A is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory inhibitor subunit 14A, commonly referred to as CPI-17. This protein is a serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor that plays a critical role in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction by inhibiting myosin phosphatase activity. CPI-17 is activated through phosphorylation, which enhances its ability to inhibit the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain, thereby promoting muscle contraction. The gene is predominantly expressed in smooth muscle tissues and the central nervous system, where it is involved in various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton dynamics and neuronal signal transduction. Alterations in PPP1R14A expression have been linked to several cancers, making it a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2022Prognostic; Lang2020The; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

## Function
PPP1R14A encodes the protein CPI-17, a potent inhibitor of myosin phosphatase (MP), which plays a crucial role in regulating smooth muscle contraction. CPI-17 achieves this by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of the myosin light chain (Mlc2), thereby promoting actomyosin contraction. This regulation is essential for maintaining vascular tone and blood pressure (Lang2020The; Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein). 

CPI-17 is activated through phosphorylation at a specific threonine residue (Thr-38), primarily by protein kinase C (PKC), Rho-dependent kinases, or integrin-linked kinase (ILK). This phosphorylation induces a conformational change that enhances its inhibitory capacity, acting as a molecular switch for smooth muscle contraction regulation (Casamayor2020Controlling; Eto2009Regulation). 

In healthy human cells, PPP1R14A is involved in various cellular processes, including actin cytoskeleton dynamics, glycogen metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and neuronal signal transduction. It is expressed predominantly in smooth muscle tissues, such as the aorta and bladder, and is also enriched in the central nervous system, where it contributes to synaptic depression (Wang2022Prognostic; Lang2020The). CPI-17's activity is crucial for cellular homeostasis and maintaining normal physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the PPP1R14A gene, which encodes a serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, have been implicated in various cancers. The gene's expression is often dysregulated across multiple cancer types, with low expression observed in cancers such as bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast cancer (BRCA), and colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), while higher expression is noted in cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) (Lu2021A; Wang2022Prognostic). High expression of PPP1R14A is associated with poor prognosis in certain cancers, including BLCA, COAD, and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), suggesting a complex role in cancer progression (Lu2021A; Wang2022Prognostic).

Genetic alterations in PPP1R14A, such as mutations and copy number alterations, are linked to worse survival outcomes, particularly in uterine carcinosarcoma, where the alteration frequency is notably high (Lu2021A; Wang2022Prognostic). The gene's promoter methylation status is also significant, with increased methylation often correlating with downregulation of expression, impacting prognosis in several cancers (Lu2021A; Wang2022Prognostic). These findings highlight PPP1R14A's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology.

## Interactions
PPP1R14A, also known as CPI-17, is a protein that interacts with several other proteins to regulate cellular processes. It is a potent inhibitor of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP) when phosphorylated at Thr 38, forming a stable complex with MLCP and specifically inhibiting the PP1 associated with MYPT1 (Eto2009Regulation). This interaction is crucial for regulating smooth muscle contraction and cell migration (Korrodi-Gregório2014Protein).

In cancer research, PPP1R14A has been shown to interact with proteins such as TAGLN and PPP1R12B, which have a putative physical binding relationship with it. These interactions are part of a broader network of protein-protein interactions identified using the STRING database, which includes 51 nodes and 119 edges (Lu2021A; Wang2022Prognostic). The functional enrichment of PPP1R14A-related genes is associated with various signaling pathways, including calcium-mediated signaling and regulation of phosphatase activity (Wang2022Prognostic).

The PPP1R14 family, including PPP1R14A, contains a central PP1 inhibitory domain (PHIN domain) with a phosphorylatable Thr residue, which is crucial for their function as myosin light chain phosphatase inhibitors (Casamayor2020Controlling). These interactions highlight the role of PPP1R14A in modulating PP1 activity and influencing cellular processes.
