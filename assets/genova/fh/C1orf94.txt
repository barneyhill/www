# C1orf94

## Overview
C1orf94 is a gene located on chromosome 1 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 1 open reading frame 94. This protein is currently categorized as uncharacterized, meaning its specific biological functions and roles within cellular processes remain largely undefined. Despite its unclear function, C1orf94 has been identified to interact with other proteins, such as C1orf109, suggesting it may play a role in protein-protein interaction networks (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The gene is primarily expressed at the transcript level, indicating that the protein may be a 'missing' protein, which is a term used to describe proteins that are predicted to exist based on genomic data but have not been observed experimentally (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The absence of detailed structural data further complicates the characterization of C1orf94, highlighting the need for additional research to elucidate its potential functions and interactions within the cell (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

## Structure


## Interactions
C1orf94, a protein encoded by the C1orf94 gene, has been identified to have a binary interaction with the protein C1orf109. This interaction is part of a broader study that identified 4317 unique protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among 177 open reading frame (ORF) proteins, with eight PPIs occurring between the ORF proteins themselves (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The study of these interactions is based on the concept of 'subinteractomes,' which refers to the set of all known protein partners that physically interact with a target protein. The analysis assumes that each protein partner has an equal probability of directly interacting with a target ORF protein (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).

Despite the identification of this interaction, C1orf94 is primarily expressed at the transcript level, suggesting it may be a 'missing' protein, with no specific information provided about its physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond the interaction with C1orf109 (Ershov2023Uncharacterized). The lack of 3D structural data for C1orf94 limits the understanding of its interactions and functions (Ershov2023Uncharacterized).
