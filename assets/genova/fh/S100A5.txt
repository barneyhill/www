# S100A5

## Overview
S100A5 is a gene that encodes the S100 calcium-binding protein A5, a member of the S100 protein family known for its role in calcium ion binding. The protein is characterized by its EF-hand motifs, which facilitate calcium binding and are integral to its function in signal transduction. S100A5 is unique among S100 proteins due to its ability to bind both calcium (Ca2+) and copper (Cu2+) ions independently, suggesting a multifunctional role in cellular processes. The protein primarily exists as a homodimer and can form higher-order oligomers, such as dodecamers, in the presence of metal ions. This structural versatility is crucial for its interactions with target proteins and potential involvement in olfactory signaling, where it may act as a Cu2+ buffer or chaperone (Wheeler2017Human).

## Structure
The S100A5 protein is a member of the S100 protein family, characterized by its ability to bind calcium ions through EF-hand motifs. The primary structure of S100A5 includes a unique amino acid sequence that distinguishes it from other S100 proteins. Its secondary structure is predominantly composed of alpha helices, typical of EF-hand proteins, which undergo conformational changes upon calcium binding (Wheeler2017Human). 

The tertiary structure of S100A5 involves the folding of these helices to form a compact calcium-binding domain. This structural arrangement is crucial for its function in signal transduction, as calcium binding induces a conformational change that exposes a hydrophobic surface (Wheeler2017Human). 

In terms of quaternary structure, S100A5 primarily exists as a homodimer, a common feature among S100 proteins, facilitating its interaction with target proteins (Wheeler2017Human). The protein can also form higher-order oligomers, such as dodecamers, particularly in the presence of metal ions like Cu2+ and Ca2+ (Wheeler2017Human). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence the protein's function and interactions, although specific modifications for S100A5 are not detailed in the available context. The protein's ability to bind both Ca2+ and Cu2+ independently suggests distinct binding sites for these ions, contributing to its multifunctional role (Wheeler2017Human).

## Interactions
S100A5, a member of the S100 protein family, is known for its ability to bind calcium (Ca2+) and copper (Cu2+) ions independently and simultaneously, which is a unique feature compared to other S100 proteins (Wheeler2017Human). The protein's interactions with these metal ions can induce changes in its secondary structure, increasing its α-helical content, which may suggest potential biological roles related to these metal bindings (Wheeler2017Human).

Despite its ability to bind metal ions, S100A5 is not well-characterized in terms of specific protein interactions. Preliminary studies have identified aldolase A as a potential target for several S100 proteins, including S100A5, although detailed interactions remain to be fully elucidated (Zimmer2003Molecular). The protein's interactions are influenced by its oligomerization state, which is driven by cysteine residues in the wildtype form, leading to oligomerization and aggregation in the presence of metal ions (Wheeler2017Human).

The distinct Cu2+ binding site in S100A5, which does not involve cysteine residues or the canonical transition metal site, suggests that S100A5 may act as a Cu2+ buffer or chaperone in olfactory sensory neurons, potentially playing a role in olfactory signaling (Wheeler2017Human).
