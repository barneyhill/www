# SPTLC3

## Overview
SPTLC3 is a gene that encodes the protein serine palmitoyltransferase long chain base subunit 3, which is a component of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex. This protein is categorized as an enzyme subunit and plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids, essential components of cell membranes involved in cell signaling and recognition. The SPTLC3 subunit is particularly significant in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis by influencing the substrate specificity of the SPT complex. It can substitute for another subunit, SPTLC2, in certain tissues, suggesting a specialized function in sphingolipid biosynthesis in specific contexts, such as the placenta and endocrine glands (Parthibane2021SSSPTA; Mohassel2024Serine). The activity of SPT, including the SPTLC3 subunit, is modulated by ORMDL proteins, which are crucial for maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis (Mohassel2024Serine).

## Function
SPTLC3 encodes a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of sphingolipids. SPT catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway, converting serine and palmitoyl-CoA into 3-ketodihydrosphingosine. This reaction is essential for the production of sphingolipids, which are vital components of cell membranes and play significant roles in cell signaling and recognition (Parthibane2021SSSPTA; Mohassel2024Serine).

SPTLC3, as a part of the SPT complex, is active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it influences lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis. It can substitute for SPTLC2 in the SPT complex, conferring distinct acyl-CoA substrate preferences, which suggests a specialized role in sphingolipid biosynthesis in certain tissues, such as the placenta and some endocrine glands (Mohassel2024Serine).

The activity of SPT, including the SPTLC3 subunit, is regulated by ORMDL proteins, which have distinct inhibitory effects on the enzyme. This regulation is crucial for maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis, which is important for normal cellular function and development (Mohassel2024Serine).

## Interactions
SPTLC3 is a subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) enzyme complex, which is crucial for sphingolipid biosynthesis. In mammals, SPT is a heterodimer composed of SPTLC1 and either SPTLC2 or SPTLC3. The catalytic activity of the enzyme occurs at the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) binding site in SPTLC2 or SPTLC3, while SPTLC1 stabilizes the complex (Dingjan2021The). SPTLC3 has a distinct tissue expression profile and is highly expressed in skin and cardiac muscle, where it contributes to the production of C16 sphingoid bases. These bases are important for skin barrier functions and can promote cardiomyocyte cell death (Dingjan2021The).

The SPT complex is regulated by small peptides, such as SPTssa or SPTssb, and ORMDL proteins, which influence its activity and substrate selectivity (Dingjan2021The). ORMDL proteins, including ORMDL3, provide feedback on SPT activity, which is regulated by ceramide plasma levels (Rochat2024Functional). These interactions highlight the role of SPTLC3 in the broader regulatory network of sphingolipid metabolism, although specific interactions involving SPTLC3 beyond its role in the SPT complex are not detailed in the provided context.
