# TAS2R14

## Overview
TAS2R14 is a gene that encodes the protein taste 2 receptor member 14, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is primarily involved in the perception of bitter taste, functioning as a chemosensory receptor that detects a wide range of bitter compounds. TAS2R14 is characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a hallmark of GPCRs, and features multiple ligand-binding pockets that facilitate its interaction with diverse ligands (Behrens2020StructureFunction; Hu2024Unlocking). Beyond its role in gustation, TAS2R14 is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, respiratory system, and certain cancer cells, where it participates in non-gustatory processes such as cellular signaling and immune responses (Ho2021Functionally; Singh2020Chemosensory). The receptor's interaction with G proteins and its modulation by cholesterol underscore its complex regulatory mechanisms and potential as a therapeutic target in conditions like cancer, respiratory diseases, and chronic rhinosinusitis (Waterloo2022The; Shaik2019Cholesterol).

## Structure
The TAS2R14 protein is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in bitter taste perception. It is characterized by seven transmembrane alpha-helices, a common feature of GPCRs (Behrens2020StructureFunction). The receptor has a unique molecular structure with three distinct ligand-binding pockets. Pocket-1, located extracellularly, overlaps with the canonical orthosteric binding pocket found in most class A GPCRs and is anchored by a conserved tryptophan residue (Hu2024Unlocking). Pocket-2 is situated in the intracellular core and is crucial for ligand-induced activation, accommodating diverse ligands due to unique residues G104 and G229 (Hu2024Unlocking). Pocket-3 is involved in specific ligand-bound structures, facilitated by the outward rotation of M205 (Hu2024Unlocking).

The receptor's transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) is notably flexible, acting as a 'zipper' during activation and playing a role in coordinating ligand binding and receptor activation (Hu2024Unlocking). TAS2R14 also features a proline hinge in TM7, which allows for ligand accommodation at the extracellular site while maintaining intracellular interactions (Peri2024Intracellular). The receptor's structure is further modulated by cholesterol, which binds in the orthosteric pocket, suggesting an allosteric modulatory function (Hu2024Unlocking).

## Function
TAS2R14, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is primarily known for its role in detecting bitter compounds. It is expressed in various tissues beyond the tongue, indicating its involvement in non-gustatory processes. In human epidermal keratinocytes, TAS2R14 functions as a chemosensory receptor, detecting bitter substances and mediating intracellular calcium signaling, which is crucial for processes like keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal barrier formation (Ho2021Functionally).

In airway cells, TAS2R14 is involved in respiratory defense mechanisms. It is modulated by membrane cholesterol, which affects its signaling efficacy without altering its expression levels. Cholesterol directly interacts with TAS2R14 through specific motifs, influencing receptor function and cellular responses (Shaik2019Cholesterol).

TAS2R14 is also expressed in breast cancer cells, where its activation leads to anti-proliferative and anti-migratory effects, suggesting a potential role in cancer biology (Singh2020Chemosensory). The receptor's broad expression and ability to produce bactericidal levels of nitric oxide upon stimulation highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in various pathological conditions (Waterloo2022The).

## Clinical Significance
TAS2R14, a bitter taste receptor gene, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In cancer, TAS2R14 expression is associated with survival outcomes in several types. Higher expression of TAS2R14 correlates with improved survival in melanoma distant metastases, while in adrenocortical carcinoma, it is linked to worse survival outcomes (Carey2022Impact). In breast cancer, TAS2R14 is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a role in cancer cell proliferation and migration (Singh2020Chemosensory). Activation of TAS2R14 in breast cancer cells has been shown to induce anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic responses, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Singh2020Chemosensory).

In respiratory diseases, TAS2R14 is expressed in airway smooth muscle cells and its activation can lead to bronchodilation, suggesting a potential therapeutic application for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Waterloo2022The). TAS2R14 is also involved in sinonasal immune responses, where its activation by flavones can enhance mucociliary clearance, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for chronic rhinosinusitis (Hariri2017Flavones). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TAS2R14 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
The TAS2R14 receptor, a member of the bitter taste receptor family, interacts with various proteins, primarily through its coupling with G proteins. It forms complexes with gustducin and Gi proteins, which are crucial for its signal transduction capabilities. The receptor's interaction with these G proteins involves distinct binding modes, primarily through intracellular regions, and includes hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Hu2024Unlocking). The ICL2 region of TAS2R14 plays a significant role in coupling with different G protein subtypes, highlighting its unique activation mechanisms compared to other class A GPCRs (Hu2024Unlocking).

TAS2R14's interaction with G proteins is further elucidated through cryo-electron microscopy studies, which reveal the structural basis of these interactions. The receptor is stabilized in complex with G proteins using a Nanobit tethering strategy, facilitating the visualization of TAS2R14-G protein complexes (Tao2024Bitter). These interactions are essential for understanding the receptor's role in bitter taste perception and its potential physiological functions in extraoral tissues, such as the heart and airway smooth muscle, where Gi proteins may contribute to signal transduction (Hu2024Unlocking).
