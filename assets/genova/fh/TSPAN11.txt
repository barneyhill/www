# TSPAN11

## Overview
TSPAN11 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 11, a member of the tetraspanin family of integral membrane proteins. Tetraspanin 11 is characterized by its four transmembrane domains, which contribute to the formation of the 'tetraspanin web,' a complex network of protein-protein interactions that facilitate various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration (Deng2021Tetraspanins:). The protein is particularly noted for its role in osteoblast function, where it influences the organization of the bone matrix and cell alignment on nanogrooved surfaces (Nakanishi2019Unique). TSPAN11's involvement in focal adhesion dynamics and integrin clustering underscores its importance in cellular responses to environmental cues (Nakanishi2019Unique). Clinically, TSPAN11 has been implicated in cancer prognosis and immune response, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma, where its expression levels correlate with patient outcomes and treatment efficacy (Zhu2023A; Li2023Tetraspanins). Additionally, its potential role in cardiovascular conditions has been suggested, although further research is needed to elucidate its clinical significance in this context (Sun2021A).

## Structure
TSPAN11, or tetraspanin 11, is a member of the tetraspanin protein family, characterized by four hydrophobic transmembrane domains. These domains are integral to the formation of the 'tetraspanin web,' a network of protein-protein interactions that facilitate various cellular processes (Deng2021Tetraspanins:). The protein structure includes a small intracellular loop, short intracellular amino and carboxyl tails, and two extracellular loops: a small extracellular loop (ECL1) and a larger extracellular loop (ECL2) (Deng2021Tetraspanins:). The ECL2 is divided into a conserved region, which is responsible for homodimerization, and a variable region that interacts with other proteins (Deng2021Tetraspanins:).

Tetraspanins, including TSPAN11, undergo post-translational modifications such as palmitoylation, which is crucial for the assembly of the tetraspanin web (Orinska2020Tetraspanins). The C-terminal tail of TSPAN11 links to cytoskeletal or signaling proteins, playing a role in cellular signaling pathways (Deng2021Tetraspanins:). While specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures of TSPAN11 are not provided, the general structural features and modifications are consistent with those observed in the tetraspanin family.

## Function
TSPAN11, or tetraspanin 11, is a member of the tetraspanin family, which are integral membrane proteins involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and migration. In the context of osteoblasts, TSPAN11 plays a crucial role in the organization of the bone matrix. It is particularly significant in the alignment of osteoblasts on nanogrooved surfaces, where it facilitates the orthogonal organization of the bone matrix relative to cell orientation. This process is mediated by the assembly of mature fibrillar focal adhesions (FAs), which are influenced by integrin clustering, a process regulated by TSPAN11 (Nakanishi2019Unique).

The knockdown of TSPAN11 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) disrupts osteoblast alignment and the orientation of the collagen matrix, indicating its essential role in maintaining proper cell alignment and matrix formation. This suggests that TSPAN11 is involved in focal adhesion assembly and cell alignment, which are critical for the unique arrangement of the bone matrix orthogonal to osteoblast alignment (Nakanishi2019Unique). The protein's activity is particularly noted in response to nanoscale surface topography, highlighting its importance in cellular responses to environmental cues (Nakanishi2019Unique).

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN11 has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and potential mutations. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), TSPAN11 is part of a prognostic gene signature that can predict patient outcomes. Its expression is negatively associated with risk scores, suggesting a protective role in LUAD prognosis. This gene is considered a potential therapeutic target, as it may influence tumor immunity and response to chemotherapy drugs like paclitaxel and docetaxel (Zhu2023A).

In glioblastoma (GBM), TSPAN11 is associated with immune cell infiltration and the tumor microenvironment, affecting the response to immunotherapies. High expression of TSPAN11 is linked to poor response to combined anti-CTLA4 and PD1 treatments, indicating its role in influencing immunotherapy effectiveness (Li2023Tetraspanins). Additionally, TSPAN11 expression correlates with glioma severity and heterogeneity, serving as a potential biomarker for tumor recurrence and prognosis (Li2023Tetraspanins).

In cardiovascular research, TSPAN11 has been associated with heart weight in mice, although its specific clinical significance in cardiovascular diseases remains unclear (Sun2021A). These findings suggest that TSPAN11 may play a significant role in cancer progression and cardiovascular conditions.

## Interactions
TSPAN11, a member of the tetraspanin family, is involved in the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics in osteoblasts. It interacts with integrins to mediate the clustering necessary for the maturation of fibrillar focal adhesions. This interaction is crucial for the unique orthogonal arrangement of the bone matrix relative to osteoblast alignment on nanogrooved surfaces (Nakanishi2019Unique). The presence of TSPAN11 facilitates the formation of highly elongated focal adhesions aligned with the direction of nanogrooves, which in turn influences the orientation of the bone matrix (Nakanishi2019Unique). The knockdown of TSPAN11 disrupts these processes, leading to altered cell alignment and matrix organization, highlighting its role in cell-matrix interactions (Nakanishi2019Unique). While the specific molecular partners of TSPAN11 in these processes are not detailed, its interaction with integrins suggests a role in the broader network of proteins involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways. The study underscores the importance of TSPAN11 in the structural organization of bone tissue, particularly through its influence on focal adhesion assembly and integrin-mediated signaling (Nakanishi2019Unique).
