# PRKDC

## Overview
The PRKDC gene encodes the protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a pivotal serine/threonine kinase involved in the DNA damage response, particularly in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (LeesMiller2021Uncovering; Woodbine2013PRKDC). DNA-PKcs is a large protein that forms a complex with the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, facilitating the repair of DSBs by recruiting and interacting with various proteins essential for DNA repair and V(D)J recombination, a process critical for immune system diversity (Björkman2015DNAPKcs; Mathieu2015PRKDC). Beyond its role in DNA repair, DNA-PKcs is involved in regulating immune responses and maintaining genomic stability, with its activity being crucial for proper neuronal development and immune homeostasis (Woodbine2013PRKDC; Sun2020DNAPK). Mutations in PRKDC can lead to severe immunodeficiency disorders and increased radiosensitivity, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (van2008A; Mathieu2015PRKDC).

## Structure
The PRKDC gene encodes the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a large serine/threonine protein kinase involved in DNA repair. DNA-PKcs is composed of 4128 amino acids and is approximately 469 kDa in size (LeesMiller2021Uncovering). The primary structure of DNA-PKcs includes several key domains: the N-terminal HEAT domain, the middle HEAT domain, the FAT domain, the kinase domain, and the FATC domain (LeesMiller2021Uncovering). These domains are characterized by specific motifs, such as the glycine-aspartic acid-arginine-histidine-X-X-asparagine (GDRHXXN) motif in the kinase domain (LeesMiller2021Uncovering).

The secondary structure of DNA-PKcs features α-solenoid rings formed by the N and M-HEAT domains, which are crucial for its function in DNA repair (Chen2021Structurala). The tertiary structure includes a head or crown formed by the FAT-kinase and FATC domains (Chen2021Structurala). DNA-PKcs forms a quaternary structure as part of the DNA-PK complex with the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer, creating a DNA-binding tunnel essential for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in DNA repair (Yin2017CryoEM).

Post-translational modifications, such as autophosphorylation, are critical for DNA-PKcs function, affecting its kinase activity and interactions with other proteins (LeesMiller2021Uncovering; Chen2021Structurala). These structural features and modifications are vital for the protein's role in DNA repair mechanisms.

## Function
The PRKDC gene encodes the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a crucial component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is essential for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in healthy human cells (LeesMiller2021Uncovering; Woodbine2013PRKDC). DNA-PKcs is activated by interaction with the Ku70/80 heterodimer and the ends of double-stranded DNA, facilitating the repair process by recruiting and interacting with other proteins such as Artemis, Cernunnos, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV (LeesMiller2021Uncovering; Björkman2015DNAPKcs).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, DNA-PKcs is involved in V(D)J recombination, a process critical for generating antibody diversity in the adaptive immune system (LeesMiller2021Uncovering). This recombination is essential for the development of T and B lymphocytes, which are key components of the immune system (Mathieu2015PRKDC). DNA-PKcs also plays a role in regulating the cGAS enzyme, which is responsible for detecting cytosolic double-stranded DNA and initiating innate immune responses. By phosphorylating cGAS, DNA-PKcs suppresses its activity, maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Sun2020DNAPK).

DNA-PKcs is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences cell cycle regulation and maintains genomic stability (LeesMiller2021Uncovering). Its activity is crucial for proper neuronal development and maintenance, particularly in humans, where it prevents homologous recombination-mediated repair in hyper-recombinogenic genomic regions (Woodbine2013PRKDC).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRKDC gene, which encodes the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), are associated with several immunodeficiency disorders. These mutations can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), characterized by a profound reduction in T and B cells, making individuals highly susceptible to infections (Woodbine2013PRKDC; Mathieu2015PRKDC). Patients with PRKDC mutations may exhibit combined immunodeficiency (CID) with features such as granuloma and autoimmunity, including conditions like ANA-positive oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and sarcoidosis (Mathieu2015PRKDC). 

PRKDC mutations can also result in radiosensitive SCID (RS-SCID), where patients show increased sensitivity to radiation due to defective DNA repair mechanisms (van2008A). In some cases, these mutations are linked to neurological abnormalities, such as microcephaly and seizures, indicating a critical role for DNA-PKcs in human neuronal development (Woodbine2013PRKDC). 

Alterations in PRKDC can impair the function of the autoimmune regulator (AIRE), potentially leading to organ-specific autoimmunity due to defective interactions between mutated DNA-PKcs and AIRE in the thymus (Mathieu2015PRKDC). These findings underscore the gene's importance in maintaining genomic stability and immune system function.

## Interactions
PRKDC, also known as DNA-PKcs, is a critical component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase complex involved in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. It interacts with the Ku70/80 heterodimer, which binds to the ends of double-stranded DNA, recruiting PRKDC to DSBs and forming the DNA-PK complex essential for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (Jette2015The). PRKDC also interacts with Artemis, a nuclease involved in V(D)J recombination, facilitating DNA end processing (LeesMiller2021Uncovering).

PRKDC is involved in the regulation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transcription by interacting with RNA polymerase II subunits POLR2A and POLR2B. This interaction enhances the binding of RNA polymerase II to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), promoting HBV transcription (Fan2022PRKDC). PRKDC also phosphorylates ATM, another key player in the DNA damage response, inhibiting its kinase activity and influencing the choice between NHEJ and homologous recombination repair pathways (Zhou2017Regulation).

Additionally, PRKDC interacts with the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) complex, phosphorylating the PRKAG1 subunit, which is crucial for AMPK activation under certain conditions (Puustinen2020DNAdependent). These interactions highlight PRKDC's multifaceted role in DNA repair, transcription regulation, and cellular signaling pathways.
