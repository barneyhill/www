# ACTR2

## Overview
ACTR2 is a gene that encodes the actin-related protein 2, a critical component of the Arp2/3 complex, which is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and plays a pivotal role in actin filament nucleation and branching, processes essential for various cellular functions such as motility, shape maintenance, and intracellular transport (Welch2002Cellular; Svitkina1999Arp2/3). The Arp2/3 complex, including ACTR2, is activated by nucleation-promoting factors, facilitating the formation of branched actin networks that are crucial for dynamic cellular activities (Zhang2005Activation). ACTR2's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in both normal cellular function and in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, where its dysregulation can lead to significant clinical implications (Mageed2024Analysis; Fonseca2015The).

## Function
ACTR2, a component of the Arp2/3 complex, plays a critical role in actin filament nucleation, a fundamental process in the dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton. This complex is essential for the formation of new actin filaments from monomers, primarily at the barbed ends, and is involved in creating branched actin networks within cells (Welch2002Cellular; Svitkina1999Arp2/3). The Arp2/3 complex, including ACTR2, is activated by nucleation-promoting factors such as WASP and N-WASP, which facilitate the formation of a ternary complex with G-actin, leading to actin filament nucleation (Welch2002Cellular; Zhang2005Activation).

In healthy human cells, ACTR2 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, phagocytosis, and the maintenance of cell shape. It is particularly active in the cytoplasm at sites of active actin polymerization, such as the leading edge of lamellipodia, where it contributes to the formation of Y-branched actin networks essential for cell movement (Mullins1998The; Svitkina1999Arp2/3). The Arp2/3 complex's role in actin nucleation and organization is crucial for cellular functions like endocytosis and the formation of contractile structures (Welch2002Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
ACTR2, a component of the ARP2/3 complex, plays a significant role in actin filament nucleation and branching, which are crucial for maintaining cellular structure and motility. Alterations in ACTR2 expression or function have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), downregulation of ACTR2 is associated with disrupted actin filament dynamics, which may contribute to cancer progression and metastasis by affecting cellular morphology and motility (Mageed2024Analysis).

ACTR2 has also been linked to sensorineural hearing loss in patients with 2p14 microdeletions, suggesting the presence of a deafness-causing gene in this region (Mathieu2017Clinical). Additionally, ACTR2 is considered a candidate gene for intellectual impairment observed in 2p14p15 microdeletion syndrome, as it is one of the genes deleted in this chromosomal region (Fonseca2015The).

While ACTR2 is involved in actin filament formation, its specific role in antisynthetase syndrome, a form of inflammatory myopathy, is not well-defined, although it is mentioned in studies examining actin aggregation in muscle biopsies (Stenzel2015Nuclear).

## Interactions
ACTR2, a component of the ARP2/3 complex, is involved in various protein interactions essential for actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It interacts with ACTR3 to facilitate actin nucleation and branching, which is crucial for forming complex actin networks necessary for cellular processes such as cell migration and intracellular transport (Mageed2024Analysis). The ARP2/3 complex, including ACTR2, binds to the sides of actin filaments, particularly at the leading edges of mobile cells, playing a critical role in regulating actin filament dynamics (Mageed2024Analysis).

ACTR2 is also identified as a specific interaction partner of human protein kinase D2 (PKD2) in both cytosolic and Golgi fractions. This interaction suggests a role for ACTR2 in PKD2-dependent cellular processes, potentially involving phosphorylation to induce ARP2/3 activity (Häupl2016Protein). The interaction between PKD2 and the ARP2/3 complex, including ACTR2, is supported by chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry studies, highlighting the complex's involvement in actin remodeling and vesicle formation (Häupl2016Protein). These interactions underscore ACTR2's role in actin cytoskeleton regulation and its potential involvement in cellular signaling pathways.
