# ACO1

## Overview
ACO1 is a gene that encodes the protein aconitase 1, a bifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in both the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and iron homeostasis. As a member of the aconitase family, aconitase 1 functions as a cytosolic enzyme catalyzing the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate, a key step in the TCA cycle, which is essential for energy production and metabolic processes (Chen2005Aconitase). Additionally, aconitase 1 serves as an iron regulatory protein (IRP1) under low iron conditions, binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) on mRNAs to regulate the expression of genes involved in iron metabolism (Zhu2022ACO1). This dual functionality underscores its importance in cellular metabolism and iron regulation. The protein's structure, characterized by an iron-sulfur cluster, is crucial for its enzymatic activity and regulatory functions (BenMenachem2011The). ACO1's involvement in various physiological processes and its implications in diseases such as anemia and cancer highlight its significance in both health and disease contexts (Oskarsson2020Predicted; GonzalezSanchez2019Exploiting).

## Structure
The ACO1 gene encodes the aconitase 1 protein, which is involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and iron regulation. The protein consists of 778 amino acids and is structured into four domains. The first three domains from the N-terminus are tightly associated, forming a shallow depression where the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster is ligated to three cysteine residues in the third domain (BenMenachem2011The). This Fe-S cluster is crucial for the protein's enzymatic activity, with the fourth iron atom coordinated with the substrate, citrate (Chen2005Aconitase).

The larger C-terminal fourth domain is connected to the first three by an extended polypeptide chain and is essential for dual targeting and posttranslational import into mitochondria (BenMenachem2011The). This domain, spanning amino acids 517-778, acts as an independent signal for dual localization, allowing the protein to exist in both mitochondrial and cytosolic forms (BenMenachem2011The). The C-terminal domain also has an intrinsic affinity for nucleic acids, suggesting potential interactions with cytosolic factors (BenMenachem2011The). The protein's distribution involves a reverse translocation mechanism, where the mitochondrial targeting sequence is cleaved, and a subpopulation of the protein moves back into the cytosol (BenMenachem2011The).

## Function
ACO1, also known as aconitase 1, is a bifunctional enzyme that plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and iron homeostasis. In its enzymatic form, ACO1 functions as a cytosolic aconitase, catalyzing the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the citric acid cycle. This activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of NADPH and acetyl coenzyme A, which are essential for fatty acid synthesis and energy production in tissues such as brown fat, liver, and kidney (Rouault2006The).

ACO1 also acts as an iron regulatory protein (IRP1) when cellular iron levels are low. In this form, it binds to iron-responsive elements (IREs) on mRNAs, regulating the translation of genes involved in iron metabolism, such as ferritin and the transferrin receptor. This regulation helps maintain cellular iron homeostasis by modulating iron uptake, storage, and export (Wang2011Regulation; Zhu2022ACO1).

In adipose tissue, ACO1 is involved in adipocyte differentiation and function. Its activity is linked to the expression of adipogenic, lipogenic, and lipolytic genes, supporting adipogenesis by maintaining intracellular NADPH levels necessary for lipid biosynthesis (Moreno2014Cytosolic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACO1 gene have been linked to various hematological conditions, particularly affecting hemoglobin concentration. The Cys506Ser variant is associated with a significant decrease in hemoglobin concentration, leading to a high risk of persistent anemia. This mutation results in a constitutively active RNA-binding state of ACO1, disrupting erythropoiesis and lowering ferritin levels (Oskarsson2020Predicted). Conversely, the Lys334Ter variant is linked to increased hemoglobin concentration and a risk of polycythemia, likely due to a loss of RNA-binding capacity (Oskarsson2020Predicted).

ACO1 is also implicated in cancer, particularly in T-cell lymphoblastic neoplasia. Deletions in the 9p21 locus, which include ACO1, are common in these neoplasms. Reduced ACO1 levels make certain cancer cell lines more vulnerable to the cytotoxic effects of fluorocitrate, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy by exploiting ACO1 deficiency (GonzalezSanchez2019Exploiting).

In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), downregulation of ACO1 is associated with poor prognosis and correlates with autophagy-related ferroptosis and immune infiltration, indicating its role in cancer progression and potential as a prognostic marker (Zhu2022ACO1).

## Interactions
ACO1, also known as aconitase 1 or iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), participates in several interactions with nucleic acids and proteins. In its oxidized form, ACO1 functions as IRP1, binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) on mRNAs. This interaction regulates the translation of proteins involved in iron homeostasis, such as the transferrin receptor and ferritin, by recognizing and binding to specific IRE sequences on their mRNAs (Mirhadi2022Mitochondrial; Lushchak2013Aconitase).

In yeast, the aconitase protein Aco1p, which is analogous to human ACO1, has been shown to bind mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), playing a crucial role in its maintenance and stability. Aco1p interacts with DNA through a cleft between its domains, and mutations in this region can impair its DNA-binding ability, leading to mtDNA instability (Chen2007Yeast). Although this specific DNA-binding activity has not been directly observed in human ACO1, the yeast model suggests a potential for similar interactions.

The protein's activity is also modulated by post-translational modifications, which can affect its interactions with other cellular components. These modifications include oxidation, nitrosylation, and thiolation of cysteine residues, as well as nitration of tyrosine residues, which can lead to changes in its function and interactions (Lushchak2013Aconitase).
