# LGALS9B

## Overview
LGALS9B is a gene that encodes the protein galectin 9B, which is a member of the galectin family of proteins. Galectins are characterized by their ability to bind Î²-galactoside sugars and are involved in various cellular processes, including cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix interactions, and immune response modulation. Galectin 9B, in particular, is known for its role in immune regulation and has been implicated in the modulation of T-cell apoptosis and the regulation of inflammatory responses. The protein's function is critical in maintaining immune homeostasis and has potential implications in autoimmune diseases and cancer (Qiu2020aarFDC).
