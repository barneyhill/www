# CROCC

## Overview
The CROCC gene encodes the protein rootletin, a coiled-coil structural protein that plays a crucial role in the formation and function of the ciliary rootlet, a cytoskeletal structure that provides mechanical support to cilia and centrosomes. Rootletin is essential for maintaining cilia stability, which is vital for various cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cell division, and sensory perception. The protein is involved in key signaling pathways, such as the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is important for skeletal development and bone formation (Tong2022Implication). Rootletin's interactions with other proteins, such as PCM1, are critical for cilia assembly and centriolar satellite organization (Ryu2024The). Mutations and alterations in the CROCC gene have been linked to various pathologies, including skeletal malformations and rhabdoid colorectal carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Tong2022Implication; Remo2023Loss).

## Structure
Rootletin, encoded by the CROCC gene, is a coiled-coil protein that serves as a structural component of the ciliary rootlet. The protein is characterized by a rod domain that facilitates homotypic binding, allowing the formation of homodimers and higher-order polymers (Yang2002Rootletin). The rod domain is crucial for polymer formation, while the globular head domain is not necessary for this process but may play a role in targeting rootletin to centrioles or basal bodies (Yang2002Rootletin). Rootletin forms parallel in-register homodimers and elongated higher-order polymers mediated by the tail domain (Yang2002Rootletin).

The protein is predicted to form extended dimeric coiled coils in its COOH-terminal three-quarters, while the NH2-terminal quarter likely assumes a globular structure (Yang2002Rootletin). Rootletin is resistant to detergent extraction but can be solubilized in high salt solutions, indicating that ionic interactions are important for its polymer formation (Yang2002Rootletin). The R234 domain of Rootletin is responsible for forming filamentous structures that contribute to second harmonic generation (SHG) properties, which are linked to the density of these filaments (Akiyama2017SHGspecificity). The protein's function in mediating ciliary chemo- and mechano-sensing is conserved across species (Akiyama2017SHGspecificity).

## Function
The CROCC gene encodes the protein rootletin, which is essential for the structural integrity and function of cilia in human cells. Rootletin forms the ciliary rootlet, a cytoskeletal structure that provides mechanical support to cilia and centrosomes. This support is crucial for maintaining cilia stability, which is important for various cellular processes, including intracellular transport and cell division (Tong2022Implication).

Rootletin plays a significant role in the hedgehog signaling pathway, which is vital for ciliary function. The proper functioning of this pathway is necessary for skeletal development and bone formation, as cilia act as chemo-sensors and mechano-sensors in these processes (Tong2022Implication). Mutations in the CROCC gene can disrupt this pathway, leading to skeletal malformations such as assimilation of atlas (AOA) (Tong2022Implication).

In healthy cells, rootletin's involvement in the hedgehog signaling pathway underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions. The protein's role in cilia stability and signaling pathways highlights its contribution to sensory perception and cell signaling, impacting overall cellular health and development (Tong2022Implication).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CROCC gene, also known as rootletin, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rhabdoid colorectal carcinoma (RCT), a rare and aggressive form of cancer. In a study involving 21 cases of RCT, it was found that a significant majority of these tumors exhibited a loss of CROCC expression, as evidenced by the absence of CROCC staining in 90% of cases (Remo2023Loss). This loss of expression is associated with mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the CROCC gene, observed in 23.8% and 57% of cases, respectively (Remo2023Loss). These genetic alterations are thought to contribute to the abnormal ciliary structure and function, as indicated by the presence of abnormal cilia in tumor tissues (Remo2023Loss).

The study also suggests that the loss of primary cilia, due to CROCC alterations, may potentiate the activation of the BRAF/MAPK pathway, which is frequently aberrantly activated in RCTs (Remo2023Loss). This pathway activation is linked to the aggressive nature of the tumors and may serve as a potential therapeutic target (Remo2023Loss). The findings highlight the clinical significance of CROCC gene alterations in the progression and aggressiveness of rhabdoid colorectal carcinoma.

## Interactions
The CROCC protein, also known as rootletin, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of cilia assembly and centriolar satellite organization. CROCC physically interacts with PCM1, a key scaffold protein of centriolar satellites. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of centriolar satellites near centrosomes and basal bodies, facilitating cilia assembly (Ryu2024The). Coimmunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated that PCM1 and CEP131 coimmunoprecipitate with FLAG-CROCC, indicating a physical interaction, while CEP290 and OFD1 do not. PCM1 is crucial for the interaction between CROCC and CEP131, suggesting that CEP131 may be indirectly associated with CROCC through PCM1 (Ryu2024The).

The interaction between CROCC and PCM1 is independent of the microtubule network, as shown by experiments using nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting agent. A specific region within PCM1 is critical for its interaction with CROCC, necessary for centrosome localization and cilia assembly (Ryu2024The). Disruption of the CROCC-PCM1 interaction leads to the dispersal of centriolar satellites and reduced cilia formation rates, highlighting the importance of this interaction for ciliary function (Ryu2024The).
