# CT83

## Overview
The CT83 gene encodes the cancer/testis antigen 83, also known as KK-LC-1, a protein predominantly expressed in cancerous tissues and mature sperm. This protein is categorized as a cancer/testis antigen due to its restricted expression pattern, which is typically limited to germ cells and various tumor types, including triple-negative breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (Laisné2024A; Zhu2023Targeting). The CT83 gene is notable for its role in oncogenesis, where its expression is often driven by epigenetic modifications such as hypomethylation, rather than genetic mutations or copy number variations (Chen2021Multiomics; Laisné2024A). The protein's interaction with presenilin-1, a component of the γ-secretase complex, highlights its involvement in critical signaling pathways that promote cancer progression (Chen2019Hypomethylation‐mediated). Due to its limited expression in normal tissues and significant presence in tumors, CT83 is considered a promising target for cancer immunotherapy (Marcinkowski2019Cancer).

## Structure
The KK-LC-1 protein, encoded by the CT83 gene, has a predicted structure that includes two α-helices located at residues 1-29 and 53-105. These predictions were made using AlphaFold 2 and are considered reliable due to high pLDDT scores. The remaining residues of the protein do not exhibit a fixed secondary structure, suggesting the presence of unstructured regions (Zhu2023Targeting). Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to optimize these structural predictions, providing further insights into the protein's conformation (Zhu2023Targeting).

The CT83 protein is composed of 113 amino acids, but its precise function remains unknown (Laisné2024A). The protein is expressed in mature sperm and various cancer types, including triple-negative breast cancer, where it is associated with aggressive tumor behavior (Laisné2024A; Zhu2023Targeting). Despite its expression in cancerous tissues, there is no detailed information available on the tertiary or quaternary structures of the CT83 protein, nor on any specific domains, prominent folds, or post-translational modifications.

## Clinical Significance
The CT83 gene, also known as cancer/testis antigen 83, is implicated in various cancers due to its abnormal expression patterns. It is highly specific to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and is characterized by hypomethylation, which is considered oncogenic in breast cancer (Chen2021Multiomics). CT83 expression is associated with poor overall survival in breast cancer and other cancers such as kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma (Chen2021Multiomics). In gastric cancer, CT83 expression is linked to Helicobacter pylori infection and serves as a potential predictor of cancer (Chen2021Multiomics).

The gene's expression is not due to copy number variation or mutations, as these are rare in cancer tissues. Instead, epigenetic alterations, such as promoter demethylation, are associated with its expression (Laisné2024A). CT83's overexpression is linked to the activation of cell cycle pathways, which may promote tumorigenesis (Chen2021Multiomics). The gene is also considered a promising target for cancer immunotherapy due to its restricted expression in normal tissues and prevalent expression in various cancers (Marcinkowski2019Cancer).

## Interactions
The CT83 gene, encoding the cancer/testis antigen KK-LC-1, is involved in significant protein interactions that influence cancer progression. One notable interaction is with presenilin-1, a catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase complex. This interaction is crucial as presenilin-1 is involved in the activation of the Notch1 signaling pathway, which plays a vital role in tissue development and is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. The binding of KK-LC-1 to presenilin-1 affects downstream Notch signaling, promoting HCC progression (Chen2019Hypomethylation‐mediated).

The study by Chen et al. demonstrated that the hypomethylation of CpG islands leads to the upregulation of KK-LC-1, which is associated with enhanced malignant phenotypes in HCC, such as increased proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The research used various assays to show that presenilin-1 knockdown could mitigate the malignant effects induced by KK-LC-1 overexpression (Chen2019Hypomethylation‐mediated).

While the interaction with presenilin-1 is well-documented, the context does not provide specific information on interactions of CT83 with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond this pathway. Therefore, further research is needed to elucidate additional interactions involving CT83.
