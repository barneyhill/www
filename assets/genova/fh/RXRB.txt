# RXRB

## Overview
The RXRB gene encodes the retinoid X receptor beta, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that functions as a transcription factor. This receptor is integral to the regulation of gene expression, primarily through its ability to form heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (Keller1993Fatty; Martin2019Regulation). The RXRB protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain, enabling it to interact with specific DNA sequences and regulate diverse biological processes, including lipid metabolism, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (Sołtys2023Phase; Osz2020Structural). RXRB's role in cellular homeostasis and its involvement in various diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and thyroid neoplasms, underscore its clinical significance (Hoftijzer2009Retinoic; Goodman2003Evidence).

## Structure
The RXRB protein, a member of the retinoid X receptor family, exhibits a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of RXRB consists of a sequence of amino acids that form various functional regions, including the AB region, DNA binding domain (DBD), and ligand binding domain (LBD) (Sołtys2023Phase). The AB region of RXRB is particularly notable for being intrinsically disordered, with a significant portion of its sequence lacking a fixed structure. This region can adopt more ordered conformations under specific conditions, such as the presence of osmolytes or increased temperature, and is involved in transcriptional activation (Sołtys2023Phase).

The secondary structure of the AB region includes unordered sequences, β-strands, α-helices, and turns, with circular dichroism spectroscopy revealing that 54.5% of the sequence is unordered (Sołtys2023Phase). The tertiary structure of RXRB involves the formation of a ligand-binding domain and a DNA-binding domain, which are crucial for its function as a nuclear receptor. RXRB can form heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, representing its quaternary structure (Osz2020Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in RXRB, and the protein has several splice variant isoforms that may influence its function and interactions (Sołtys2023Phase). The AB region's unique amino acid composition, particularly its high proline content, contributes to its phase separation propensity, which may affect the transcriptional activation of target genes (Sołtys2023Phase).

## Function
RXRB (retinoid X receptor beta) is a nuclear receptor that plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by forming heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and retinoic acid receptors (RARs) (Keller1993Fatty; Martin2019Regulation). These heterodimers bind to specific DNA sequences known as response elements, influencing various cellular processes, including lipid metabolism, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (Keller1993Fatty; Martin2019Regulation).

RXRB is active in the nucleus, where it can act as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of a ligand. Upon ligand binding, RXRB dissociates from corepressors and recruits coactivators, leading to the activation of gene expression (Martin2019Regulation). This receptor is involved in the regulation of cellular senescence through calcium signaling pathways. Knockdown of RXRB has been shown to induce the expression of genes associated with calcium signaling and senescence, such as ITPR1 and ITPR2, leading to premature senescence in fibroblasts (Martin2019Regulation).

RXRB's ability to form heterodimers with various nuclear receptors allows it to participate in diverse biological processes, making it a crucial component in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing diseases like cancer and metabolic disorders (MenéndezGutiérrez2017The).

## Clinical Significance
The RXRB gene, encoding the retinoid X receptor beta, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in gene regulation. Alterations in RXRB expression have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies suggest that decreased mRNA levels of RXRB in aged mice may contribute to the misregulation of AD-related genes, potentially impacting retinoic acid availability and signaling pathways (Goodman2003Evidence; Goodman2006Retinoid).

In the context of schizophrenia, the RXRB gene has been investigated for its potential role, although no significant association was found between RXRB mutations and the disease. A Val95Ala polymorphism was identified, but its frequency did not differ significantly between schizophrenic patients and controls, suggesting limited impact on the condition (Ishiguro2002Mutation).

RXRB is also implicated in Wegener's Granulomatosis (WG), where a significant SNP near the RXRB gene was associated with the disease, indicating a possible linkage with the HLA-DPB1 region. This suggests that RXRB may play a role in the etiology of WG, potentially affecting apoptosis regulation (Jagiello2004New; Szyld2006On).

In thyroid neoplasms, RXRB expression patterns have diagnostic value. Altered expression of RXRB subtypes, particularly cytoplasmic and membranous RXRB, can help differentiate between benign and malignant thyroid tissues, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic marker (Hoftijzer2009Retinoic).

## Interactions
RXRB (retinoid X receptor beta) is a nuclear receptor that forms heterodimers with various other nuclear receptors, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression. RXRB interacts specifically with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) to form heterodimers that bind to the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) of the acyl-CoA oxidase gene, which is essential for fatty acid metabolism (Keller1993Fatty). This interaction is significant for the transcriptional activation of genes involved in lipid metabolism, with polyunsaturated fatty acids acting as potent activators of PPARα (Keller1993Fatty).

RXRB also forms heterodimers with retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), and vitamin D receptors (VDRs), among others, to mediate the transcriptional effects of retinoids and other ligands (Mey2017RARRXR‐Mediated). These heterodimers can bind to specific DNA sequences, such as retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), influencing gene transcription (Mey2017RARRXR‐Mediated). The RXR-RAR heterodimer, for instance, has been structurally characterized in its interaction with DNA, revealing specific protein-DNA interactions that are crucial for its function (Osz2020Structural). RXRB's interactions with these nuclear receptors highlight its versatile role in various biological processes.
