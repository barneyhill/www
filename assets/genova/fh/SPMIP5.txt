# SPMIP5

## Overview
SPMIP5 is a gene that encodes the sperm microtubule inner protein 5, which is a crucial component of the microtubule structure within sperm cells. This protein plays a significant role in the stability and function of the sperm's cytoskeleton, which is essential for proper sperm motility and fertility. As a structural protein, sperm microtubule inner protein 5 is involved in the organization and maintenance of microtubules, which are critical for the movement and structural integrity of spermatozoa. Mutations or dysregulation of the SPMIP5 gene can potentially lead to defects in sperm function, contributing to male infertility (Qiu2020aarFDC).
