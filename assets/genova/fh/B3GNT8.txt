# B3GNT8

## Overview
B3GNT8 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 8, which is involved in the glycosylation process. This enzyme is categorized as a glycosyltransferase and plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures by transferring N-acetylglucosamine to galactose residues. The activity of this enzyme is essential for various cellular functions, including protein folding, trafficking, and intracellular signaling, as well as maintaining cellular homeostasis within the Golgi apparatus (Kippe2015Abnormal; Mkhikian2016Golgi). By contributing to the stability of glycoproteins and glycolipids, B3GNT8 supports cellular adhesion and immune responses, highlighting its importance in maintaining the integrity of the glycome (Mkhikian2016Golgi).

## Function
B3GNT8 is an enzyme involved in the glycosylation process, specifically catalyzing the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to galactose residues, forming poly-N-acetyllactosamine structures. This glycosylation is a critical post-translational modification that influences protein folding, trafficking, localization, and recycling, which are essential for proper protein handling and cellular functions such as intracellular signaling and cytoskeleton formation (Kippe2015Abnormal). 

In healthy human cells, B3GNT8 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is part of a self-correcting mechanism that ensures the preservation of LacNAc content within N-glycans, which is crucial for maintaining the galectin-glycoprotein lattice and preventing T cell hyperactivity (Mkhikian2016Golgi). This enzyme's activity helps maintain the integrity of the glycome and supports cellular adhesion and immune response by ensuring the stability of glycoproteins and glycolipids (Mkhikian2016Golgi). 

B3GNT8's glycosylation activity may also protect proteins from proteolytic degradation, indicating its role in maintaining protein stability and function in healthy cells (Kippe2015Abnormal).
