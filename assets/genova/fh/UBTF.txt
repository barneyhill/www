# UBTF

## Overview
UBTF, or upstream binding transcription factor, is a gene that encodes a nucleolar protein essential for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and ribosome biogenesis. The protein, also referred to as UBTF, is characterized by its multiple high-mobility group (HMG) box domains, which facilitate DNA binding and bending, crucial for the transcriptional activation of rRNA genes. As a transcription factor, UBTF plays a pivotal role in the formation of preinitiation complexes by interacting with the Selectivity Factor 1 (SL1) complex, thereby promoting the recruitment of RNA polymerase I to rDNA promoters. This function is vital for maintaining nucleolar integrity and ensuring efficient ribosome production, which is essential for cell growth and proliferation. The gene exists in two splice variants, UBTF1 and UBTF2, with UBTF1 being particularly significant for SL1 recruitment and transcription initiation. Mutations in UBTF have been linked to various clinical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders and certain types of leukemia, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease (Georgi2023UBTF; Tremblay2022Ribosomal; Braden2024An).

## Structure
UBTF, or upstream binding transcription factor, is a protein involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis. It contains multiple high-mobility group (HMG) box domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding and bending capabilities. The protein functions as a dimer, forming a 360-degree loop structure that allows it to replace nucleosomes in the epigenetic remodeling of rDNA chromatin (Braden2024An). UBTF exists in two splice variants, UBTF1 and UBTF2, which differ in their structural composition. UBTF1 includes six HMG-box domains, enabling it to bend the promoter and facilitate the recruitment of Selectivity Factor 1 (SL1) to form a stable preinitiation complex (PIC). In contrast, UBTF2 lacks the necessary HMG-box structure for recognizing bent DNA and does not participate in PIC formation (Tremblay2022Ribosomal; Braden2024An).

The wildtype UBTF protein contains atypical residues in the central hydrophobic core of HMG-box 2, making this box less aromatic and unstable. A notable variant, E210K, involves a change from glutamic acid to lysine, resulting in a highly positively charged stretch in the HMG-box 2 region. This variant destabilizes HMG-box 2, affecting its ability to induce the proper topology for SL1 binding and altering rRNA synthesis (Braden2024An).

## Function
The UBTF gene encodes the Upstream Binding Transcription Factor, a nucleolar protein essential for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and nucleolar integrity in healthy human cells. UBTF is involved in the formation of preinitiation complexes necessary for rDNA transcription, a critical step in ribosome biogenesis. It contains high-mobility group (HMG) boxes that facilitate DNA bending, which is crucial for the recruitment of RNA polymerase I to rDNA promoters (Tremblay2022Ribosomal; Braden2024An).

UBTF plays a pivotal role in maintaining nucleosome-free regions (NFR) across rDNA, allowing the Selectivity Factor 1 (SL1) complex to access the promoters. This interaction is vital for efficient transcription initiation and is a significant determinant of total nuclear RNA synthesis (Tremblay2022Ribosomal). The protein's activity is regulated by its phosphorylation state, which influences its interaction with SL1 and its transcriptional activity (Tuan1999Recruitment).

UBTF1, a splice variant of UBTF, is particularly important for SL1 recruitment and is crucial for the transcription process. It induces specific conformational changes in the rDNA promoter, facilitating SL1 binding and the formation of a stable preinitiation complex (Tremblay2022Ribosomal). This function is critical for cell growth and proliferation, as it influences the protein synthesis capacity of the cell (Sanij2008UBF).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UBTF gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. UBTF Neuroregression Syndrome (UNS), also known as Childhood-Onset Neurodegeneration with Brain Atrophy (CONDBA), is caused by a recurrent de novo dominant mutation in the UBTF gene, specifically the E210K variant. This mutation leads to developmental regression, motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and other neurological symptoms due to its impact on ribosomal RNA synthesis and chromatin structure (Tremblay2022Ribosomal; Braden2024An). The E210K mutation results in increased Na+ currents and hyperexcitability in cortical neurons, contributing to seizure activity in some patients (Braden2024An).

UBTF mutations are also implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). UBTF tandem duplications (UBTF-TDs) are recurrent genetic alterations in pediatric and adult AML, associated with poor prognosis and myelodysplastic features. These duplications affect the HMG-box 4 of the UBTF gene, suggesting a gain or shift of function (Georgi2023UBTF; Umeda2022Integrated). Additionally, the UBTF::ATXN7L3 gene fusion defines a novel subtype of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), characterized by poor minimal residual disease response and the need for intensified treatment (Bastian2022UBTF::ATXN7L3).

## Interactions
UBTF, also known as the upstream binding transcription factor, is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that facilitate ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. UBTF interacts with the SL1 complex, which includes the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and associated factors, to mediate transcriptional activation by RNA polymerase I. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of SL1 to the rDNA promoter, a process significantly influenced by the phosphorylation state of UBTF (Tuan1999Recruitment).

UBTF contains multiple high mobility group (HMG) boxes that contribute to its DNA-binding specificity and efficiency. HMG box 1 is necessary for DNA sequence specificity, while HMG boxes 2, 3, and 4, along with the acidic carboxyl terminus, are involved in protein-protein interactions with the SL1 complex (Jantzen1992Multiple). The carboxy-terminal domain of UBTF is essential for its interaction with SL1, and phosphorylation enhances this interaction, promoting the formation of a stable preinitiation complex (Tuan1999Recruitment).

UBTF also interacts directly with the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), facilitating the cooperative binding of UBTF and SL1 on the rRNA promoter (Kwon1994The). These interactions are vital for the transcriptional activation of rRNA genes and the regulation of ribosomal DNA promoter recognition (Tremblay2022Ribosomal).
