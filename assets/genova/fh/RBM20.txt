# RBM20

## Overview
RBM20 is a gene located on chromosome 10 that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 20, a member of the serine-arginine-rich family of splicing factors. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of RNA splicing, particularly in cardiac muscle cells, where it influences the splicing of the titin (Ttn) gene, crucial for cardiac muscle elasticity and function (Maatz2014RNAbinding; Gregorich2024Mechanisms). The RBM20 protein contains several functional domains, including an RNA recognition motif (RRM), zinc finger domains, and an arginine-serine-rich (RS) domain, which are essential for its splicing activity and nuclear localization (Lennermann2020New; Gregorich2024Mechanisms). Mutations in the RBM20 gene are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health (Brauch2009Mutations; Kornienko2023Mislocalization).

## Structure
The RBM20 protein is encoded by the RBM20 gene located on chromosome 10 and consists of 1,227 amino acids. It is a member of the serine-arginine-rich family of splicing factors and contains several key domains that contribute to its function in RNA splicing regulation. The protein includes an RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which is crucial for binding to the UCUU RNA motif, a common element in pre-mRNA targeted by RBM20 (Upadhyay2019Structural). The RRM domain interacts specifically with the UCUU motif, with a C-terminal helix playing a critical role in RNA binding (Upadhyay2019Structural).

RBM20 also contains two zinc finger domains, which are involved in RNA binding, although their precise role is less clear (Gregorich2024Mechanisms). The arginine-serine (RS) domain is essential for nuclear localization and protein-protein interactions, containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and being a hotspot for mutations linked to dilated cardiomyopathy (Watanabe2018Alternative; Gregorich2024Mechanisms). The protein also has regions rich in leucine, proline, and glutamate, with the glutamate-rich region contributing to protein stability (Gregorich2024Mechanisms). Phosphorylation of serine and arginine residues in the RS domain is necessary for nuclear localization (Lennermann2020New).

## Function
RBM20 is a crucial regulator of RNA splicing in cardiac muscle cells, primarily influencing the splicing of the titin (Ttn) gene, which is essential for cardiac muscle elasticity and function (Maatz2014RNAbinding; Gregorich2024Mechanisms). The protein is localized in the nucleus of heart cells, where it forms part of cardiac-specific transinteracting chromatin domains, known as splicing factories (Gregorich2024Mechanisms). RBM20 acts predominantly as a splicing repressor, binding to intron sequences downstream of exons subject to alternative splicing, thereby regulating the inclusion or exclusion of these exons in the final mRNA transcript (Maatz2014RNAbinding; Gregorich2024Mechanisms).

RBM20 contains several functional domains, including an RNA recognition motif (RRM), an arginine-serine-rich (RS) domain, and zinc finger domains, which are essential for its splicing activity and nuclear localization (Lennermann2020New; Gregorich2024Mechanisms). The RS domain is particularly important for nuclear localization, as its phosphorylation is necessary for RBM20 to function properly within the nucleus (Lennermann2020New). RBM20 also interacts with components of the spliceosome, such as U1 and U2 snRNPs, suggesting its involvement in early spliceosome assembly stages (Maatz2014RNAbinding). Through these molecular activities, RBM20 plays a vital role in maintaining proper cardiac function and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RBM20 gene are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a condition characterized by the enlargement and weakening of the heart's ventricles, leading to heart failure and arrhythmias. These mutations are often found in the arginine/serine-rich domain of the gene, which is crucial for its role in RNA splicing (Brauch2009Mutations; Kornienko2023Mislocalization). RBM20 mutations are present in approximately 2-3% of familial DCM cases and are linked to severe disease progression, including early onset and high mortality rates (Lennermann2020New; Refaat2012Genetic).

The pathogenic variants in RBM20 can lead to mislocalization of the protein, disrupting its normal interactions and causing the formation of cytoplasmic granules, which contribute to the cardiomyopathy phenotype (Kornienko2023Mislocalization). These mutations also result in the missplicing of key cardiac genes, such as titin (TTN) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II delta (CAMK2D), affecting cardiac muscle function and calcium handling, which are critical for maintaining normal heart rhythm (van2018RBM20; Fochi2020The).

RBM20-related cardiomyopathy is often more severe in male patients, with a higher incidence of adverse events such as heart transplantation and sudden cardiac death (Koelemen2021RBM20Related). The clinical complexity of RBM20 cardiomyopathy necessitates careful risk stratification and consideration of preventive measures, such as implantable cardiac defibrillators (Gregorich2024Mechanisms).

## Interactions
RBM20 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cardiac-specific alternative splicing. It binds to UCUU motifs at splice sites and interacts with U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleic particles (snRNPs), as well as U2-related proteins such as U2AF65 and U2AF35, which are essential for spliceosome assembly (Fochi2020The; Maatz2014RNAbinding). RBM20 also forms interactions with PTBP1 and RBM24, which are involved in regulating splicing events in cardiac tissues (Fochi2020The; Upadhyay2019Structural).

The RS domain of RBM20 is critical for its interaction with Transportin-3 (TNPO3), a nuclear importer. Mutations in this domain can lead to mislocalization of RBM20, affecting its splicing function (Kornienko2023Mislocalization). The interaction with TNPO3 is essential for the nuclear import of RBM20, and enhancing this interaction can restore its proper localization and function (Kornienko2023Mislocalization).

RBM20's interactions are not limited to proteins; it also binds to specific RNA elements, such as the UCUU motifs in the titin (TTN) gene, influencing exon inclusion and exclusion during splicing (Maatz2014RNAbinding). These interactions highlight RBM20's role in maintaining cardiac function through precise splicing regulation.
