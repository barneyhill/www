# NCLN

## Overview
NCLN is a gene that encodes the protein nicalin, which is a transmembrane protein involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. Nicalin plays a significant role in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is vital for processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is a component of a multiprotein complex that modulates the maturation and trafficking of Notch receptors, primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Additionally, nicalin is involved in antagonizing Nodal signaling, which is crucial for the specification of human embryonic stem cells into neuroectoderm, including neural crest cells. This function is particularly important for the development of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and has implications in conditions such as Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) due to its role in neuronal development (Gui2017Whole).

## Structure


## Function
NCLN (nicalin) is a protein involved in the regulation of the Notch signaling pathway, which is essential for cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Nicalin is a component of a multiprotein complex that modulates the maturation and trafficking of Notch receptors, primarily functioning within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This complex influences cellular communication and development by ensuring the proper processing and transport of Notch receptors to the cell surface, where they can engage in signaling interactions (Gui2017Whole).

In addition to its role in Notch signaling, NCLN is involved in antagonizing Nodal signaling, which is crucial for the specification of human embryonic stem cells into neuroectoderm, including neural crest cells. This function is significant for the development of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and is implicated in conditions such as Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) due to its role in neuronal development (Gui2017Whole). NCLN's expression patterns in zebrafish embryos, particularly in the brain and gut, further support its involvement in ENS and central nervous system development (Gui2017Whole).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NCLN (nicalin) gene have been implicated in Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of enteric neurons in the distal gut. Studies have identified de novo mutations in NCLN that are associated with HSCR, suggesting that these mutations may disrupt the development of the enteric nervous system (ENS) (Gui2017Whole). Functional analyses using zebrafish models have demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations in NCLN can lead to HSCR-like phenotypes, characterized by the absence of enteric neurons, indicating the gene's crucial role in ENS development (Gui2017Whole).

NCLN is also involved in the regulation of Nodal signaling, which is essential for the specification of neural crest cells that contribute to the ENS. Disruption of this signaling pathway due to NCLN mutations may lead to HSCR by affecting neural crest cell function (Gui2017Whole). The gene's involvement in both central nervous system and ENS development underscores its potential clinical significance in HSCR and possibly other neurodevelopmental disorders (Tam2019Genetics; Gui2017Whole). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which NCLN mutations contribute to these conditions.
