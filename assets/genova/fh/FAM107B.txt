# FAM107B

## Overview
FAM107B is a gene located on chromosome 10p13 that encodes the protein known as heat-shock-inducible tumor small protein (HITS). This protein is a member of the Family with sequence similarity 107 (FAM107) and is characterized by a conserved N-terminal domain of unknown function and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. FAM107B is primarily involved in regulating gene transcription through its interaction with transcriptional adaptor proteins within the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, suggesting a role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). The protein is expressed in various tissues and is notable for its nuclear localization, which is indicative of its involvement in nuclear functions (Nakajima2010Induction). FAM107B is distinctively upregulated by heat-shock or hyperthermia, which enhances its expression and suggests a potential tumor-suppressive role, as it has been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation in vitro (NAKAJIMA2012Loss).

## Function
The FAM107B gene encodes a protein known as heat-shock-inducible tumor small protein (HITS), which is an 18 kDa nuclear protein expressed in a wide range of tissues, including the stomach, colon, lung, and lymphoid organs (Nakajima2010Induction; NAKAJIMA2012Loss). FAM107B is part of the Family with sequence similarity 107 (FAM107) proteins, which possess a conserved N-terminal domain of unknown function (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). The protein is involved in regulating gene transcription by interacting with transcriptional adaptor proteins that are part of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, suggesting a role in modulating chromatin structure and gene transcription (NAKAJIMA2012Loss).

In healthy cells, FAM107B is expressed widely and is characterized by a nuclear localization signal, indicating its presence in the nucleus and potential role in nuclear functions (Nakajima2010Induction). The gene carries a promoter region with heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) binding sites, and its transcription is amplified by heat-shock or hyperthermia treatment (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). This feature distinguishes it from other heat shock proteins, which are often associated with oncogenic activities (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). The protein's expression is amplified by heat-shock stimulation, and it has been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation in vitro (NAKAJIMA2012Loss).

## Clinical Significance
The FAM107B gene, also known as HITS, has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. Studies have shown that FAM107B expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues in several cancers, including those of the breast, thyroid, colon, and uterine cervix (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). In breast cancer, particularly invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas, decreased FAM107B expression is observed, and its expression is inversely correlated with tumor size, suggesting a potential role as a tumor suppressor (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). The gene's expression is also reduced in the progression from cervical intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive squamous cell carcinoma in uterine cervical tissues (NAKAJIMA2012Loss).

In thyroid cancers, FAM107B expression is significantly lower in carcinoma compared to normal or benign conditions, indicating its potential involvement in cancer progression (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). The gene's expression is also associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes, as it correlates with molecular markers like HER2 and Ki-67 in breast cancer (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). These findings suggest that FAM107B could serve as a biomarker for tumor diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic effects, particularly in hyperthermia treatments due to its unique transcriptional induction by heat-shock stimulation (NAKAJIMA2012Loss).

## Interactions
FAM107B, also known as heat-shock-inducible tumor small protein (HITS), is a protein encoded by a gene located on chromosome 10p13. It is part of the FAM107 family, which includes proteins characterized by a common N-terminal domain of unknown function and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. This structural composition suggests a potential role in regulating gene transcription (NAKAJIMA2012Loss).

FAM107B interacts with transcriptional adaptor proteins Tada2α and Tada3α, which are components of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex. This interaction implies that FAM107B may influence the structure and function of HAT complexes, which are crucial for chromatin modification and gene transcription (NAKAJIMA2012Loss). The protein's involvement with the HAT complex suggests a role in modulating chromatin structure and potentially affecting gene expression.

Despite these insights, specific details on the physical interactions of FAM107B with other proteins or nucleic acids remain limited. The current understanding is primarily based on its interaction with the HAT complex, and further research is needed to elucidate additional interactions and functional roles of FAM107B in cellular processes (Alam2022Bioinformatic; Nakajima2010Induction).
