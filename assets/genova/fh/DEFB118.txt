# DEFB118

## Overview
DEFB118 is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 118, a member of the beta-defensin family known for its role in the innate immune system. This protein is characterized by a conserved structural motif, including an N-terminal alpha helical domain and a beta sheet, stabilized by disulfide bridges. Defensin beta 118 is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues and plays a significant role in antimicrobial defense by disrupting microbial membranes. It exhibits notable antifungal activity, particularly against Candida albicans, and is involved in mucosal host defenses. Additionally, DEFB118 is implicated in reproductive functions, being located on the sperm surface, and has immunomodulatory activities, such as reducing inflammation and enhancing intestinal barrier integrity (Fu2022βdefensin; Sakuma2022Expression; hall2007characterization).

## Structure
The DEFB118 protein, also known as beta-defensin 118, is part of the beta-defensin family, which is characterized by a conserved structural motif. This motif typically includes an N-terminal alpha helical domain connected by a disulfide bond to a beta sheet, which can be either two-stranded or three-stranded. The structure is further stabilized by additional disulfide bridges, forming a 6-cysteine domain rich in positively charged amino acids (hall2007characterization). 

The molecular weight of DEFB118 is approximately 30 kDa, which is larger than that of simple beta-defensins, typically ranging from 5-10 kDa. This increased size is attributed to long N-terminal or C-terminal extensions, although the specific function of these extensions is not well understood (Fu2022βdefensin; hall2007characterization). 

DEFB118 is expressed and purified in E. coli, and its purification process involves Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, resulting in a single clear band on SDS-PAGE, indicating successful purification (Fu2022βdefensin). The protein's role in immune response includes enhancing cell viability and reducing inflammation, although its exact structural contributions to these functions are not fully detailed in the available literature (Fu2022βdefensin).

## Function
DEFB118, or defensin beta 118, is a member of the beta-defensin family, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing antimicrobial protection. In healthy human cells, DEFB118 is primarily active in epithelial tissues, where it contributes to the protection of mucosal surfaces. It is involved in disrupting microbial membranes, thereby exhibiting antimicrobial activity (hall2007characterization).

DEFB118 has been shown to have significant antifungal activity, particularly against Candida albicans, suggesting its role in the innate immune response in oral tissues. It is constitutively expressed in oral fibroblasts and keratinocytes, and its expression is significantly increased in response to fungal components, indicating its involvement in mucosal host defenses (Sakuma2022Expression).

In the male reproductive tract, DEFB118 is located on the sperm surface, suggesting a role in reproductive functions. However, its highly anionic C-terminus is not thought to contribute to antibacterial action, which typically relies on cationic amino acids (hall2007characterization).

DEFB118 also exhibits immunomodulatory activities, such as reducing inflammation and apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells challenged by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. It enhances the expression of tight junction proteins, thereby maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier (Fu2022βdefensin).
