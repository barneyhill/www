# TXNDC8

## Overview
TXNDC8 is a gene that encodes the thioredoxin domain-containing protein 8, a testis-specific enzyme involved in redox regulation and protein folding. This protein is characterized by its thioredoxin domain, which is homologous to Trx1, and is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in post-translational modifications essential for germ-cell specific functions (Hanschmann2013Thioredoxins). The protein is involved in catalyzing redox reactions, particularly in the male reproductive system, where it contributes to spermatogenesis by regulating the redox state and ensuring proper protein folding and disulfide bond stabilization (Ahlering2020Sperm; Gellert2019Substrate). The structural integrity and functional conservation of TXNDC8 across species underscore its significance in reproductive biology and cellular oxidative stress responses (Sommer2022Structureguided; Hanschmann2013Thioredoxins).

## Structure
The thioredoxin domain-containing protein 8 (TXNDC8) is a testis-specific enzyme involved in redox reactions, characterized by a thioredoxin domain homologous to Trx1 (Hanschmann2013Thioredoxins). The protein is located in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in post-translational modifications crucial for germ-cell specific functions (Hanschmann2013Thioredoxins). 

Structurally, TXNDC8 has several isoforms with distinct features. The MANE transcript isoform exhibits significant structural alterations, including a truncated α2 helix, missing β3 and β5 sheets, and a rotated α4 helix, resulting in a low pLDDT score of 56.7, indicating a poorly folded structure (Sommer2022Structureguided; Sommer2022Highly). In contrast, an alternate isoform identified through the CHESS project, CHS.56446.alt1, has a higher pLDDT score of 96.9, suggesting a well-folded structure. This isoform recovers the canonical α2, α3, and α4 helices, as well as the β3 and β5 sheets, and aligns closely with the primary TXNDC8 isoform in Bos taurus, with an RMSD of 0.8 Å (Sommer2022Structureguided; Sommer2022Highly).

The protein's active site is characterized by the CGPC motif, which is essential for its role in spermatogenesis (Gellert2019Substrate). The structural conservation across species and the presence of specific domains highlight the functional importance of TXNDC8 in redox biology.

## Function
TXNDC8, also known as thioredoxin domain-containing protein 8, is a testis-specific enzyme involved in redox regulation and protein folding within cells. It catalyzes redox reactions by oxidizing cysteine residues from dithiol to disulfide forms, a process crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress responses (Sommer2022Structureguided). TXNDC8 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus and cytosol, where it regulates proteins through post-translational modifications, controlling germ-cell-specific functions (Hanschmann2013Thioredoxins; Gellert2019Substrate).

In the male reproductive system, TXNDC8 is expressed in the seminiferous tubules of the testis and is involved in spermatogenesis, particularly in the later stages of spermiogenesis or in mature spermatozoa (Hanschmann2013Thioredoxins). It plays a role in the regulation of the redox state of cells, contributing to proper protein folding and disulfide bond stabilization during spermatogenesis (Ahlering2020Sperm). Although its precise function in healthy human cells remains unclear, TXNDC8's involvement in these molecular processes suggests its importance in reproductive biology and cellular responses to oxidative stress (Ahlering2020Sperm; Hanschmann2013Thioredoxins).
