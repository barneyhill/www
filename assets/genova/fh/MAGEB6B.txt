# MAGEB6B

## Overview
MAGEB6B is a gene that encodes the protein MAGE family member B6B, which is part of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family. This family is known for its role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and immune response modulation. MAGE family proteins are often characterized by their expression in a wide range of tissues and their involvement in cancer biology, particularly in tumor progression and immune evasion. The specific functions and interactions of MAGEB6B remain under investigation, but it is hypothesized to play a role in the regulation of cellular pathways that are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and response to stress (Qiu2020aarFDC).
