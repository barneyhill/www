# CYP2B6

## Overview
CYP2B6 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily B member 6, a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the oxidative metabolism of a diverse array of substances, including pharmaceuticals, xenobiotics, and endogenous compounds. As a monooxygenase, CYP2B6 plays a significant role in drug metabolism, contributing to both detoxification and bioactivation processes. The enzyme is predominantly expressed in the liver but is also found in other tissues such as the kidney and intestine. CYP2B6 is known for its ability to metabolize approximately 3% of drugs in clinical use, and its activity is modulated by various factors, including genetic polymorphisms and interactions with nuclear receptors like the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) (Pascussi2003The; LEWIS1999Molecular; EKINS1999THE). Understanding the function and regulation of CYP2B6 is essential for optimizing drug therapy and minimizing adverse drug reactions.

## Structure
The CYP2B6 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, characterized by its role in drug metabolism. The primary structure of CYP2B6 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a compact, globular shape with a heme-binding domain, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Gay2010Structural). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function (LEWIS1999Molecular). 

The tertiary structure of CYP2B6 is described as a closed, compact structure, similar to the CYP2B4-4-CPI complex, with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.65 Å (Gay2010Structural). The active site of CYP2B6 is larger than that of CYP2B4, with a cavity volume of 582 Å³, allowing for the accommodation of various substrates (Gay2010Structural). The active site includes key residues such as Phe206, Thr205, Ser294, and Leu363, which are involved in substrate binding and catalysis (LEWIS1999Molecular).

CYP2B6 can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and substrate specificity (LEWIS1999Molecular). The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence its activity and stability (LEWIS1999Molecular). The plasticity of the CYP2B6 active site allows it to change size and shape, accommodating a wide range of substrates (Gay2010Structural).

## Function
CYP2B6 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which plays a crucial role in the oxidative metabolism of a wide range of substances, including drugs, xenobiotics, and endogenous compounds. This enzyme is primarily active in the liver but is also expressed in extrahepatic tissues such as the kidney, intestine, uterine endometrium, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (EKINS1999THE). CYP2B6 is involved in the metabolism of approximately 3% of drugs in clinical use, contributing to drug detoxification and bioactivation (LEWIS1999Molecular).

The enzyme's activity is influenced by its ability to recognize and bind various substrates, a process that involves specific amino acid residues within its active site. These interactions are characterized by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, which are crucial for substrate binding affinity and catalytic activity (Turpeinen2006The; LEWIS1999Molecular). CYP2B6 is also subject to induction by various compounds, including classic inducers like dexamethasone and rifampicin, which can enhance its expression and activity (EKINS1999THE).

CYP2B6's function is regulated by nuclear receptors such as the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR), which modulate its expression in response to specific ligands (Pascussi2003The). This regulation is essential for maintaining homeostasis and responding to environmental changes, impacting drug metabolism and potential drug-drug interactions.

## Clinical Significance
The CYP2B6 gene is clinically significant due to its role in drug metabolism and the impact of its genetic polymorphisms on treatment outcomes. Variations in CYP2B6 can lead to altered drug efficacy and toxicity, particularly for medications like efavirenz, used in HIV treatment. The CYP2B6*6 allele, characterized by the c.516G>T SNP, results in decreased enzyme activity due to aberrant splicing, leading to higher plasma levels of efavirenz and increased risk of central nervous system side effects (Zanger2013Pharmacogenetics; Hofmann2008Aberrant). This allele is associated with decreased metabolism of efavirenz but enhanced metabolism of cyclophosphamide, highlighting the substrate-dependent effects of CYP2B6 polymorphisms (Desta2021PharmVar).

The CYP2B6*22 allele, featuring a -82T>C promoter mutation, enhances basal expression and inducibility of the enzyme, potentially affecting drug metabolism and detoxification (Li2010Synergistically). Non-genetic factors, such as exposure to inducers like rifampicin and phenobarbital, can also significantly increase CYP2B6 expression and activity, impacting drug interactions and therapeutic outcomes (Hedrich2016Insights; Turpeinen2012Cytochrome). Understanding these genetic and non-genetic influences is crucial for personalized medicine and optimizing drug dosing strategies.

## Interactions
CYP2B6 interacts with several transcription factors and nuclear receptors that regulate its expression. Notably, it is activated by the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). These factors synergistically cooperate to transactivate the CYP2B6 gene, which is crucial for its expression and inducibility in liver cells. The binding of C/EBPα and HNF4α to the promoter and enhancer regions of CYP2B6 has been demonstrated through chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, indicating their direct interaction with the gene's regulatory elements (Benet2010CCAATEnhancerbinding).

The interaction between these transcription factors and CAR is essential for the efficient transcriptional activation of CYP2B6. The presence of CAR enhances the binding of HNF4α to the CYP2B6 promoter, suggesting a dependency on CAR for HNF4α's binding activity. This cooperative interaction is necessary for the maximal expression of CYP2B6, particularly in response to drug inducers (Benet2010CCAATEnhancerbinding).

CYP2B6 also participates in the metabolism of various drugs and environmental pollutants, interacting with substrates and inhibitors in the liver. These interactions are crucial for understanding drug metabolism and potential drug-drug interactions (Palacharla2017Quantitative).
