# TACR3

## Overview
The TACR3 gene encodes the tachykinin receptor 3, also known as the neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R), which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, playing a crucial role in reproductive function by mediating the effects of the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) (Zhang2020Tacr3NK3R:; Anderson2022Functional). NK3R is characterized by its seven transmembrane α-helical regions, typical of the rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs, and is expressed in various brain regions, including the hypothalamus, where it influences the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (Zhang2020Tacr3NK3R:; Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). Beyond its role in reproduction, NK3R is implicated in mood regulation, chronic pain, and cognitive functions, highlighting its multifunctionality (Siuciak2007Disruption; Fonin2019Multifunctionality). Mutations in TACR3 can lead to reproductive disorders such as normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, underscoring its clinical significance (Francou2011Normosmic).

## Structure
The TACR3 gene encodes the neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. The primary structure of NK3R consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a protein with seven hydrophobic transmembrane α-helical regions, characteristic of the rhodopsin subfamily of GPCRs (Zhang2020Tacr3NK3R:; Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). These helices are integral to the receptor's secondary structure, facilitating its function within the cell membrane.

The tertiary structure of NK3R involves the arrangement of these helices, with an extracellular amino-terminus and an intracellular carboxyl tail, typical of GPCRs (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation). The receptor is a glycoprotein, indicating post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which are common in GPCRs (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation).

NK3R binds to its high-affinity ligand, neurokinin B (NKB), and upon activation, it is internalized into endosomes, triggering various signaling cascades (Zhang2020Tacr3NK3R:). The receptor's structure and function are highly conserved across species, with significant sequence homology observed in porcine models, suggesting stringent evolutionary control (Jakimiuk2017Characterisation).

## Function
The TACR3 gene encodes the neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a pivotal role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, crucial for reproductive function. NK3R is the receptor for the neuropeptide neurokinin B (NKB) and is essential for the pulsatile release of kisspeptin from the hypothalamus, which regulates the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) (Zhang2020Tacr3NK3R:; Anderson2022Functional). This receptor is expressed in KNDy neurons, which are part of the GnRH pulse generator, and its activity is influenced by sex steroids (Zhang2020Tacr3NK3R:).

NK3R is also involved in various physiological processes beyond reproduction, including mood regulation, chronic pain, and cognitive functions. It is expressed in several brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex and amygdaloid complex, and is implicated in learning and memory (Zhang2020Tacr3NK3R:; Siuciak2007Disruption). The receptor's activation by NKB leads to intracellular signaling cascades, including AC/cAMP/PKA and PLC/IP3/PKC pathways, which are crucial for its function in healthy cells (Zhang2020Tacr3NK3R:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TACR3 gene, which encodes the neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R), are associated with several reproductive disorders, most notably normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nCHH). This condition is characterized by a deficiency in gonadotropin secretion, leading to delayed or absent puberty and infertility. Studies have identified various mutations in TACR3, including frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations, which disrupt NK3R function and impair the neuroendocrine control of reproduction (Francou2011Normosmic). 

Patients with TACR3 mutations often exhibit a high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to luteinizing hormone (LH) ratio and an apulsatile LH profile, which can be partially corrected with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) therapy (Francou2011Normosmic). Specific mutations, such as Tyr267Asn, have been shown to cause misfolding of the NK3R protein, affecting its cellular localization and function (Francou2011Normosmic). 

In addition to reproductive disorders, alterations in TACR3 expression and function may contribute to neurological conditions, including schizophrenia and mood disorders, although these associations require further investigation (Xue2020A). The role of TACR3 in these conditions highlights its broader significance in both reproductive and neurological health.

## Interactions
TACR3, or tachykinin receptor 3, is a G-protein-coupled receptor that interacts with neurokinin B (NKB) to regulate various physiological processes, including hormone secretion. In the context of reproductive hormone regulation, TACR3 is involved in the modulation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion through its interactions with kisspeptin and dynorphin in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These interactions are crucial for the control of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, as NKB can have both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on LH release depending on the presence of estradiol (E2) (Navarro2011Interactions).

TACR3 is coexpressed with kisspeptin and dynorphin, and it is suggested that NKB acts autosynaptically to stimulate kisspeptin release, which in turn influences GnRH secretion. The receptor's expression is sensitive to E2 levels, indicating a feedback mechanism in reproductive hormone regulation (Navarro2011Interactions). Mutations in TACR3 can lead to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, highlighting its importance in reproductive health (Navarro2011Interactions).

The receptor is part of the rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs, characterized by structural polymorphism and intrinsic disorder, which allows for interactions with various intracellular proteins, contributing to its multifunctionality (Fonin2019Multifunctionality).
