# SH2D1B

## Overview
SH2D1B, also known as EAT-2, is a gene that encodes the SH2 domain-containing protein 1B, which functions as an adaptor protein in immune cell signaling. This protein is predominantly expressed in natural killer (NK) cells and plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses by facilitating signal transduction through its SH2 domain, which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on other proteins (Borowicz2020Adaptor). The SH2D1B protein is integral to the SLAMF7/EAT-2 pathway, which is involved in macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity and has been associated with improved survival outcomes in high-risk neuroblastoma patients (Tang2022Macrophagemediated). Through its interactions with various receptors and proteins, SH2D1B influences cellular responses and is essential for the proper functioning of the innate immune system.

## Structure


## Function
SH2D1B, also known as EAT-2, is a gene encoding a protein that plays a significant role in immune cell signaling, particularly in natural killer (NK) cells. The protein contains an SH2 domain, which allows it to interact with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on other proteins, facilitating signal transduction processes within immune cells (Borowicz2020Adaptor). 

In healthy human cells, SH2D1B is primarily expressed in NK cells, where it modulates immune responses by influencing the activation and regulation of these cells. The protein acts as an adaptor, meaning it helps form transient molecular complexes that are crucial for signal transduction, despite not having enzymatic activity itself (Borowicz2020Adaptor). This function is essential for the proper functioning of NK cells, which are critical components of the innate immune system responsible for identifying and destroying infected or cancerous cells.

The SH2D1B protein is involved in the SLAMF7/EAT-2 pathway, which is associated with macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity. This pathway's activation is linked to better survival outcomes in high-risk neuroblastoma patients, suggesting its role in enhancing the immune response against tumors (Tang2022Macrophagemediated).

## Clinical Significance
The SH2D1B gene, also known as EAT-2, plays a significant role in immune cell signaling. Alterations in its expression or mutations can impact immune responses and are associated with various conditions. High expression levels of SH2D1B, along with SLAMF7, have been linked to improved survival outcomes in high-risk neuroblastoma patients, suggesting a role in anti-tumor immune responses (Tang2022Macrophagemediated). This indicates that the SLAMF7/EAT-2 pathway may be crucial in enhancing the immune system's ability to combat certain cancers.

While the context does not provide specific diseases directly caused by SH2D1B mutations, it highlights the gene's involvement in immune regulation. The SH2D1B gene is related to SH2D1A, which is associated with X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP), a condition characterized by immune dysfunction and potential development of B cell lymphomas (Borowicz2020Adaptor). Although SH2D1B itself is not explicitly linked to XLP in the provided context, its role in immune signaling suggests that alterations could potentially contribute to similar immune dysregulation disorders. The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its clinical significance in maintaining normal immune function and its potential impact when dysregulated.

## Interactions
SH2D1B, also known as EAT-2, is involved in several protein-protein interactions, primarily through its SH2 domain, which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues. It is recruited with high affinity to specific phosphosites on ErbB receptors, including ErbB1pY727, ErbB2pY772, ErbB3pY789, and ErbB4pY733. This interaction suggests a role in receptor-specific signaling pathways, indicating that SH2D1B may influence cellular responses mediated by these receptors (Hause2012Comprehensive).

In addition to its interactions with ErbB receptors, SH2D1B has been shown to interact with OLIG1, a protein involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation. This interaction is enhanced by the induction of the ABL2 kinase, highlighting the phosphorylation-dependent nature of SH2D1B's binding capabilities (Grossmann2015Phospho‐tyrosine).

These interactions underscore the role of SH2D1B in modulating signaling pathways through its ability to bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues on various proteins. This binding capability is crucial for its function in immune cell signaling and potentially other cellular processes. The specificity and affinity of these interactions are influenced by the structural characteristics of the SH2 domain, which allows SH2D1B to participate in diverse signaling networks.
