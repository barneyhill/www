subfamily of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are key regulators of macrophage function, controlling transcriptional programs involved in lipid homeostasis and inflammation. The inducible LXRA is highly expressed in liver, adrenal gland, intestine, adipose tissue, macrophages, lung, and kidney, whereas LXRB is ubiquitously expressed. Ligand-activated LXRs form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs; see MIM 180245) and regulate expression of target genes containing LXR response elements (summary by Korf et al., 2009 [PubMed 19436111]).[supplied by OMIM, Jan 2010].", "symbol": "NR1H2", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1417823"}, "unigene": "Hs.432976", "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P55055", "TrEMBL": ["M0R3A7", "F1D8P7", "M0R2F9", "M0QYE6", "M0R229", "M0QZF5", "M0R1V8", "M0R0K3"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "Liver X receptor beta"}}
