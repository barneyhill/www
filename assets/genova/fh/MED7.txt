# MED7

## Overview
MED7 is a gene that encodes the protein mediator complex subunit 7, a critical component of the Mediator complex involved in the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The MED7 protein is categorized as a transcriptional coactivator and is integral to the structural and functional integrity of the Mediator complex. It forms a heterodimer with MED21, contributing to the middle module of the complex, which is essential for facilitating interactions between RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of gene expression, impacting processes such as cell growth and differentiation. The structural configuration of MED7, characterized by a four-helix bundle and a coiled-coil domain, allows for flexibility and adaptability in its role within the Mediator complex (Sato2016Role; Baumli2005A; Larivière2013Model).

## Structure
The MED7 protein is a component of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II. Structurally, MED7 forms a heterodimer with MED21, which is part of the Mediator middle module. This heterodimer is characterized by a highly elongated, α-helical structure, consisting of a four-helix bundle and a coiled-coil domain. The N-terminus of MED21 is adjacent to a conserved region of MED7, contributing to a hinge-like structure that is essential for the rigidity and conformation of the middle module (Sato2016Role; Larivière2013Model).

The MED7 protein is involved in forming a tetramer with the Med4/Med9 heterodimer, supported by cross-linking data and hydrophobic clustering at the interface. This structural organization is crucial for the spatial arrangement within the Mediator complex (Larivière2013Model). The MED7N-MED31 subcomplex is flexibly linked near the MED7C/Med21 coiled coil, indicating a degree of flexibility in the structure (Larivière2013Model).

In terms of quaternary structure, MED7 is part of the Med7C/Med21 subcomplex, which is flanked by Med10 and Med31 in the middle module, contributing to the overall flexibility and function of the Mediator complex (Larivière2013Model).

## Function
MED7 is a component of the Mediator complex, a crucial transcriptional coactivator in eukaryotic cells. It plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression by facilitating interactions between RNA polymerase II and transcription factors. MED7, in conjunction with MED21, forms a heterodimer that is integral to the structural integrity and function of the Mediator complex. This heterodimer is part of the middle module of the Mediator, which is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in transcription regulation (Baumli2005A).

The MED7-MED21 heterodimer features a four-helix bundle domain and a coiled-coil protrusion, connected by a flexible hinge that allows for structural changes necessary for its function. This flexibility is crucial for the assembly of the Mediator-RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, as mutations in the hinge region can disrupt the interaction with RNA polymerase II, affecting transcription regulation (Sato2016Role).

In healthy human cells, MED7 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation, by modulating transcriptional responses. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly and stabilization of the Mediator complex, ensuring proper transcriptional regulation (Napoli2012Unraveling).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
MED7 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription regulation by interacting with RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors. Within the Mediator complex, MED7 forms part of the middle module and is involved in several key interactions. It is known to form heterodimers with MED21, as well as with MED31, corresponding to the C-terminal and N-terminal regions of MED7, respectively (Larivière2013Model). These interactions are essential for the structural organization of the middle module and its function in transcription regulation.

In yeast, MED7 interacts with other Mediator subunits such as Med10 and Med21, forming a stable subcomplex that is critical for the integrity of the Mediator complex (Hallberg2006Functional). The interaction between MED7 and MED21 is particularly significant, as it is conserved across species, including Drosophila, indicating evolutionary conservation (Guglielmi2004A).

In humans, MED7 has been shown to interact with MED26 and MED4, with these interactions being enhanced in the presence of MED21. This suggests that MED21 may stabilize the interaction of MED26 with neighboring subunits, including MED7 (Tsai2014Subunit). These interactions highlight the role of MED7 in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the Mediator complex across different species.
