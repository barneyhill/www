# CGB5

## Overview
The CGB5 gene encodes the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a glycoprotein hormone that plays a pivotal role in early pregnancy. The protein product, chorionic gonadotropin subunit beta 5, is a component of the heterodimeric hCG hormone, which is essential for embryo implantation and placental development. This beta subunit is characterized by a cystine knot structure, stabilized by disulfide bonds, which is crucial for its proper folding and function (Nagirnaja2012Structural). The CGB5 gene is subject to regulation by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, which can influence its expression and impact pregnancy outcomes (Uusküla2011Methylation). Beyond its reproductive role, CGB5 is implicated in cancer biology, where its expression is associated with immune evasion and poor prognosis in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Chen2023CGB5).

## Structure
The CGB5 gene encodes the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a glycoprotein hormone crucial for early pregnancy. The primary structure of the CGB5 protein includes specific amino acid sequences that are essential for its function (Nagirnaja2012Structural). The secondary structure of the hCG beta subunit involves alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stability and function (Nagirnaja2012Structural). 

The tertiary structure of the CGB5 protein is characterized by a cystine knot, a conserved structural feature that is crucial for the protein's folding and stability. This structure is maintained by disulfide bonds, particularly involving Cys57, which is adjacent to the Val56Leu mutation site (Nagirnaja2012Structural). 

In terms of quaternary structure, the CGB5 beta subunit associates with the alpha subunit to form the heterodimeric hCG hormone. This assembly is essential for the hormone's bioactivity, although certain mutations like p.Val56Leu can affect the efficiency of this assembly (Nagirnaja2012Structural). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are critical for the stability and function of the hCG beta subunit, influencing its serum half-life and biological activity (Biskup2020N).

## Function
The CGB5 gene encodes the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone essential for maintaining pregnancy. hCG is secreted by the placental trophoblast and plays a critical role in embryo implantation and placental development (Chen2013MTA3). The protein is active in the extracellular space, where it binds to the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor, influencing reproductive processes by supporting the corpus luteum and promoting progesterone production to maintain the uterine lining (Rull2007Finescale).

CGB5, along with CGB8, contributes significantly to the total pool of hCG beta subunit transcripts, which are crucial for early pregnancy maintenance (Uusküla2011Methylation). The expression of CGB5 is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, which can influence gene expression and are associated with pregnancy outcomes (Uusküla2011Methylation). Proper expression of CGB5 is essential for a successful pregnancy, as abnormalities in hCG levels, particularly high levels in the late second trimester, are linked to complications such as preeclampsia (Chen2013MTA3). The regulation of CGB5 involves the repression by Metastasis Associated Protein 3 (MTA3), which modulates hCG levels and may impact pregnancy complications (Chen2013MTA3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CGB5 gene have significant clinical implications. The CGB5 p.Val56Leu mutation, identified in a recurrent miscarriage patient, affects the assembly and bioactivity of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone. This mutation results in only 10% of the mutant hCGβ being assembled into secreted intact hCG compared to the wild-type, although it compensates with a stronger signaling response upon receptor binding (Nagirnaja2012Structural). 

In cancer, CGB5 shows differential expression patterns across various tumor types. It is notably upregulated in gastric, liver, and lung cancers, correlating with poorer prognosis and survival outcomes. High CGB5 expression is associated with unfavorable overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free intervals in cancers such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma (Chen2023CGB5; Qin2021Novel). 

CGB5 expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration and immune evasion in the tumor microenvironment, particularly in gastric cancer. This suggests a role in modulating the immune response and promoting tumor progression (Chen2023CGB5). These findings highlight the potential of CGB5 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
The CGB5 gene encodes the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which interacts with the alpha subunit to form the active hCG hormone. This hormone is crucial for pregnancy maintenance and functions by binding to the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) on target cells, initiating signaling pathways (Nagirnaja2012Structural).

CGB5 is involved in the formation of the hCG heterodimer, a process that can be affected by specific mutations. For instance, the p.Val56Leu mutation in CGB5 significantly reduces the ability of the beta subunit to assemble into the heterodimer, impacting the structural integrity and function of the hormone (Nagirnaja2012Structural). Despite this, the mutation can lead to increased bioactivity upon receptor binding, compensating for the reduced dimer formation (Nagirnaja2012Structural).

In the context of cancer, CGB5 expression is associated with immune checkpoint proteins such as PD-L1 and CTLA-4, suggesting a role in immune evasion by tumors (Chen2023CGB5). This interaction highlights CGB5's potential involvement in the tumor microenvironment and its influence on immune cell infiltration and tumor progression.
