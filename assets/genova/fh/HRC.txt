# HRC

## Overview
The HRC gene encodes the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRC), a non-enzymatic protein primarily involved in calcium homeostasis within the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. This protein is characterized by its high histidine content and its ability to bind calcium ions with high capacity but low affinity, similar to calsequestrin. HRC plays a pivotal role in modulating calcium cycling by interacting with key proteins such as triadin and SERCA2a, influencing both calcium uptake and release processes. These interactions are crucial for proper muscle contraction and relaxation, particularly in cardiomyocytes, thereby contributing to normal cardiac rhythmicity and function. The protein's structure includes notable regions rich in acidic amino acids and a cysteine-rich domain, suggesting potential roles in metal binding and protein-protein interactions. Alterations in the HRC gene have been associated with cardiac conditions, including arrhythmias and heart failure, highlighting its clinical significance (Hofmann1991cDNA; Pollak2017Phosphorylation; Arvanitis2011Histidinerich).

## Structure
The HRC gene encodes a protein that is 699 amino acids long, characterized by a high content of histidine (13%), aspartic acid (11%), and glutamic acid (20%) (Hofmann1991cDNA). The primary structure includes two notable stretches of acidic amino acids: 12 consecutive glutamic acid residues at positions 193-204 and 16 consecutive aspartic acid residues at positions 246-261, which vary among individuals (Hofmann1991cDNA). The protein also features a cysteine-rich region near the carboxyl terminus, with a repeating Cys-X-X-Cys pattern, indicative of a potential heavy metal binding domain (Hofmann1991cDNA).

The secondary structure of the HRC protein likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is suggested to facilitate calcium ion binding, crucial for its role in calcium homeostasis in muscle cells (Hofmann1991cDNA). The protein may form complexes with other proteins, indicating a quaternary structure, although specific interactions are not detailed in the context.

A potential asparagine-linked glycosylation site is present at amino acid position 42, which is absent in the rabbit sequence, suggesting species-specific post-translational modifications (Hofmann1991cDNA).

## Function
The histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRC) plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. It is primarily located in the SR lumen, where it binds calcium ions with high capacity but low affinity, similar to calsequestrin, another calcium-binding protein (Lee2001Interaction; Arvanitis2011Histidinerich). HRC interacts with key proteins involved in calcium cycling, such as triadin and SERCA2a, influencing both calcium uptake and release processes (Arvanitis2018The; Pollak2017Phosphorylation). 

HRC's interaction with triadin is calcium-dependent and affects the function of the ryanodine receptor, which is crucial for calcium release from the SR (Lee2001Interaction; Arvanitis2011Histidinerich). At low calcium concentrations, HRC binds to SERCA2a, modulating calcium uptake into the SR (Arvanitis2018The). This dual role in calcium uptake and release is essential for proper cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation, contributing to normal cardiac rhythmicity and function (Arvanitis2018The; Pollak2017Phosphorylation). 

Phosphorylation of HRC, particularly at serine 96, is important for its function, influencing its interactions with triadin and SERCA2a, and is protective against cardiac arrhythmias (Pollak2017Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HRC gene, which encodes the histidine-rich calcium-binding protein, have been linked to several cardiac conditions, particularly those involving arrhythmias and heart failure. A notable polymorphism, Ser96Ala, is associated with malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (Arvanitis2008The; Pollak2017Phosphorylation). This variant affects the phosphorylation site of HRC, disrupting its interactions with key proteins involved in calcium cycling, such as the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2) pump, leading to dysregulated calcium homeostasis (Arvanitis2018The; Pollak2017Phosphorylation).

Altered expression levels of HRC have also been observed in heart failure. A significant decrease in HRC protein levels has been noted in end-stage heart failure, as well as in experimental models of heart failure in mice and dogs (Arvanitis2018The). Overexpression of HRC in cardiomyocytes can impair sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium handling, leading to reduced contractility and increased risk of heart failure and hypertrophy (Arvanitis2011Histidinerich). Conversely, HRC knockout mice exhibit enhanced contractility but are more prone to cardiac hypertrophy and failure under stress conditions (Arvanitis2018The). These findings underscore the critical role of HRC in maintaining cardiac rhythmicity and its potential as a prognostic marker for arrhythmias.

## Interactions
The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is involved in several critical interactions within the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that are essential for calcium homeostasis and cardiac function. HRC interacts with triadin, a protein embedded in the SR membrane, as part of the quaternary Ca2+-release complex. This interaction is calcium-dependent, with the highest binding affinity at moderate Ca2+ concentrations, and involves the luminal KEKE motif of triadin. This interaction may influence the function of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and affect SR Ca2+ release, potentially impacting myocyte contractility (Arvanitis2018The; Arvanitis2011Histidinerich).

HRC also binds to SERCA2a, a calcium pump responsible for SR calcium uptake. This interaction is maximal at low Ca2+ concentrations and involves distinct binding domains, with HRC's histidine- and glutamic acid-rich domain playing a role in SERCA2 binding. The interaction is Ca2+ sensitive and suggests a regulatory role in SR Ca2+ uptake (Arvanitis2018The; Arvanitis2011Histidinerich).

Additionally, HRC interacts with a mutant form of junction plakoglobin associated with Naxos disease, which may affect Ca2+ homeostasis and contribute to cardiac arrhythmias (Arvanitis2011Histidinerich). These interactions highlight HRC's role in modulating calcium cycling and cardiac rhythmicity.
