# FRK

## Overview
The FRK gene encodes the fyn-related Src family tyrosine kinase, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This kinase is characterized by its three conserved domains: the Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, the Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, and the kinase domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and cellular localization (Jin2013The; Goel2016Understanding). The protein encoded by FRK is predominantly active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it plays a role in regulating cell cycle control and apoptosis (Anneren2003The). FRK is implicated in tumor suppression through its interactions with key proteins such as PTEN and BRCA1, contributing to genomic stability and DNA repair (Goel2016Understanding). Alterations in FRK expression and mutations have been associated with various cancers, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Hu2017Targetable; Goel2016Understanding).

## Structure
The Fyn-related kinase (FRK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the Src family of kinases. It is composed of three conserved functional domains: the Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain, the Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, and the kinase domain (Goel2016Understanding). The SH3 and SH2 domains are located at the amino terminus, while the kinase domain is responsible for its enzymatic activity (Jin2013The). A unique feature of FRK is the presence of a bipartite nuclear localization signal within its SH2 domain, which guides its localization to the nucleus and perinuclear region (Hua2014FRK; Goel2016Understanding).

The primary structure of FRK consists of 505 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 54 kDa (Goel2016Understanding). The secondary structure includes critical residues such as the ATP-contacting lysine (K262), the autophosphorylation tyrosine (Y387), and the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine (Y497), which are conserved across similar kinases (Goel2016Understanding). Phosphorylation of these residues plays a significant role in regulating FRK's kinase activity (Goel2016Understanding). The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by its ability to co-localize with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in perinuclear puncta, suggesting a role in EGFR turnover (Goel2016Understanding).

## Function
FRK (fyn related Src family tyrosine kinase) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. It is primarily active in the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it influences cell cycle control and apoptosis. FRK is involved in the phosphorylation of various substrates, including the SHB protein, which suggests it may act as an upstream regulator of SHB tyrosine phosphorylation (Anneren2003The). This kinase is implicated in the regulation of cell signaling pathways related to cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation, independent of growth factors (Anneren2003The).

In healthy human cells, FRK has been shown to phosphorylate the tumor suppressor PTEN, stabilizing it and reducing AKT activation, which contributes to its tumor-suppressive functions (Goel2016Understanding). It also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), potentially contributing to its tumor-suppressive roles (Goel2016Understanding). FRK's activity is crucial for maintaining genomic stability, as it phosphorylates BRCA1, protecting it from degradation and facilitating DNA repair processes (Goel2016Understanding). These molecular activities highlight FRK's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a tumor suppressor in various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FRK gene have significant implications in various cancers. In breast cancer, FRK is often downregulated, and its loss is associated with increased tumor proliferation and migration. This is partly due to FRK's role in stabilizing PTEN, a tumor suppressor, by phosphorylating it, which prevents its degradation (Goel2016Understanding). In contrast, FRK is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it promotes tumor growth and cell proliferation. This overexpression is linked to somatic mutations in the FRK kinase domain, which enhance its enzymatic activity (Goel2016Understanding).

In ovarian cancer, a specific mutation in the SH2 domain of FRK, S145R, may affect its phosphopeptide-binding ability, suggesting a potential impact on signaling pathways (Goel2016Understanding). FRK fusions, such as CAPRIN1-FRK, have been identified in ALK-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), where they contribute to oncogenic activity by promoting STAT3 phosphorylation (Hu2017Targetable). These fusions result in constitutive kinase activity due to the loss of auto-inhibitory domains, which is a critical factor in their oncogenic mechanism (Bayard2020Recurrent). The clinical significance of these mutations and alterations lies in their potential as therapeutic targets, with inhibitors like dasatinib showing efficacy in some cases (Hu2017Targetable).

## Interactions
FRK (fyn-related kinase) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that participates in various protein interactions, influencing cellular processes and cancer biology. FRK phosphorylates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at Y1173, promoting its internalization and potentially acting as a tumor suppressor by impairing EGFR signaling (Goel2016Understanding). It also phosphorylates BRCA1 at Y1152, enhancing its stability and protecting it from degradation, which is crucial for DNA repair and genomic stability (Goel2016Understanding). FRK interacts with PTEN, phosphorylating it on Y336, which prevents its degradation and enhances its stability, contributing to its tumor-suppressive functions (Goel2016Understanding).

FRK is involved in cell cycle regulation through its association with cell cycle regulators CDC2/Cdk1 and Cdk4 (Goel2016Understanding). It also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), suggesting a role in tumor suppression (Goel2016Understanding). In glioma cells, FRK suppresses cell migration and invasion by inhibiting Jnk and c-Jun phosphorylation and affects the nuclear translocation of the cyclinD1-CDK4 complex, leading to cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase (Goel2016Understanding). These interactions highlight FRK's potential influence on cancer cell signaling and proliferation.
