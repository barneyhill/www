# DUSP9

## Overview
DUSP9, or dual-specificity phosphatase 9, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the dual-specificity phosphatase family, which is involved in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. The protein, also known as MKP-4 or Pyst3, functions by dephosphorylating both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues, thereby inactivating specific kinases such as ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and ASK1. These kinases play critical roles in cellular processes like proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses (Khoubai2021DUSP9). DUSP9 is predominantly expressed in the kidney, adipose tissue, and placenta, with lower expression levels in other tissues such as the brain and reproductive organs (Khoubai2021DUSP9). The protein's activity is intricately regulated through various mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-translational modifications, which are essential for maintaining normal physiological functions and preventing diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cancer (Khoubai2021DUSP9).

## Structure
DUSP9, also known as MKP-4 or Pyst3, is a dual-specificity phosphatase involved in dephosphorylating both tyrosine and serine/threonine residues. The protein is characterized by a conserved dual-specificity phosphatase domain, which is typical of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family. This domain is crucial for its enzymatic activity, allowing DUSP9 to interact with its substrates effectively (Jeong2014The).

Structurally, DUSP9 undergoes a loop-to-strand switch near the active site, transitioning from a loop to an extra β-strand in the central β-sheet. This conformational change is associated with the movement of the D-loop to an outward position, resulting in an inactive conformation. This structural feature is important for forming a binary complex with extracellular receptor kinase (ERK), facilitating a conformational change towards an active state (Jeong2014The).

DUSP9 exhibits an open D-loop conformation, with the aspartate residue located away from the active-site pocket, differing from the canonical P-loop conformation seen in other DUSPs. This unique structural feature contributes to its specificity and activity regulation (Jeong2014The). The presence of a phosphate ion in the active-site pocket further highlights its structural characteristics (Jeong2014The).

## Function
DUSP9, also known as dual-specificity phosphatase 9, is a crucial enzyme involved in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. It dephosphorylates and inactivates specific kinases such as ERK1/2, p38, JNK, and ASK1, which are integral to various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and stress responses (Khoubai2021DUSP9). DUSP9 is primarily expressed in the kidney, adipose tissue, and placenta, with minimal expression in the brain, ovary, testis, and urinary bladder (Khoubai2021DUSP9).

The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms. For instance, transcription factors like HIF1α and BMP signaling can induce DUSP9 expression, affecting pathways like ERK signaling, which is crucial for cell renewal and differentiation (Khoubai2021DUSP9). Post-transcriptionally, miRNAs such as miR-212 and miR-1246 can target DUSP9 mRNA, reducing its expression. Post-translationally, the long non-coding RNA LincU stabilizes DUSP9, preventing its degradation by the proteasome (Khoubai2021DUSP9).

DUSP9's role in dephosphorylating MAPKs helps prevent abnormal activation of signaling pathways, which is important for avoiding dysfunctions and pathologies (Khoubai2021DUSP9). Its regulation of MAPK signaling is significant in both normal physiological conditions and various human diseases, including cardiac dysfunction, liver metabolic syndromes, diabetes, obesity, and cancer (Khoubai2021DUSP9).
