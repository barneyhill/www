# PLEKHH1

## Overview
PLEKHH1 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology, MyTH4, and FERM domain containing H1, which is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, particularly within the nervous system and lipid metabolism. The protein is categorized as a multi-domain protein due to its structural domains that facilitate interactions with other cellular components. It is predominantly expressed in the human brain and plays a significant role in neural crest cell migration, interacting with key transcription factors such as MYC to regulate growth-related gene transcription (Montague2014Comparative). Additionally, PLEKHH1 is implicated in lipid metabolism, with genetic variants linked to hyperalphalipoproteinemia, suggesting a cardioprotective role despite coronary heart disease risk factors (Oates2018Novel). In the context of oncology, PLEKHH1 expression is associated with ovarian cancer progression, indicating its potential involvement in tumor-related pathways and immune responses (Zhang2022Molecular).

## Interactions
PLEKHH1, a gene encoding a protein with pleckstrin homology, MyTH4, and FERM domains, is involved in various cellular interactions. The protein is predominantly expressed in the human brain and is implicated in neural crest cell migration. It contains a MyTH4 domain similar to that of MYO10, which is crucial for the migratory ability of neural crest cells. PLEKHH1 interacts with the transcription factor MYC, a key regulator of neural crest cells, to activate the transcription of growth-related genes (Montague2014Comparative).

In the context of lipid metabolism, PLEKHH1 has been associated with genetic variants linked to hyperalphalipoproteinemia (HALP), suggesting a role in fat and lipid metabolism. These genetic variants may contribute to cardioprotection despite the presence of coronary heart disease risk factors (Oates2018Novel).

In ovarian cancer, PLEKHH1 is expressed at medium to high levels in tumor tissues, and its expression is associated with advanced stages of the disease. The gene is part of a prognostic model for ovarian cancer, indicating its potential involvement in tumor-related pathways and immune response (Zhang2022Molecular).
