# OSR1

## Overview
The OSR1 gene encodes the odd-skipped related transcription factor 1, a protein kinase that belongs to the Ste20 family. This kinase plays a pivotal role in regulating ion transport and maintaining ion homeostasis within human cells. The OSR1 protein is characterized by its classical bilobal kinase fold and is involved in the WNK-OSR1/SPAK signaling pathway, which is crucial for the regulation of ion cotransporters such as NKCC1 and NKCC2. These cotransporters are essential for various physiological processes, including cell volume regulation, blood pressure control, and kidney function. OSR1 is activated through phosphorylation by WNK protein kinases and mTORC2, particularly in response to osmotic changes, underscoring its role in cellular stress responses. Additionally, OSR1 is implicated in cardiovascular function, where it co-regulates NKCC1, contributing to vascular smooth muscle contractility and blood pressure regulation (Richardson2008The; Sengupta2013Regulation; Gagnon2012Molecular).

## Structure
The OSR1 protein, encoded by the OSR1 gene, is a kinase with a classical bilobal kinase fold, similar to the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Its N-terminal kinase domain features a five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and an alpha-helix connecting strands b3-b4, while the C-terminal lobe is primarily alpha-helical (Lee2009Crystal; Villa2008Structure). The OSR1 kinase domain can form domain-swapped dimers, where the P+1 recognition loop and aEF helix are exchanged between subunits, contributing to its inactive conformation (Lee2009Crystal).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of OSR1, also known as the CCT domain, is involved in substrate and activator recognition. It interacts with RFXV motifs present in substrates like NKCC1 and activators such as WNK1/WNK4 (Lee2009Crystal; Villa2007Structural). The CCT domain adopts a novel SPOC fold, consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands and three alpha-helices, and binds to a negatively charged groove (Villa2007Structural). The OSR1 protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions (Villa2007Structural).

## Function
The OSR1 gene encodes a protein kinase that is part of the Ste20 family, playing a crucial role in regulating ion transport and maintaining ion homeostasis in healthy human cells. OSR1 is involved in the WNK-OSR1/SPAK signaling pathway, which is essential for controlling ion cotransporters such as NKCC1 and NKCC2. These cotransporters are vital for processes like cell volume regulation, blood pressure control, and kidney function (Sengupta2013Regulation; Richardson2008The).

OSR1 is activated by phosphorylation through WNK protein kinases and mTORC2, which enhances its activity and stability. This phosphorylation occurs in response to osmotic changes, indicating OSR1's role in acute cellular responses to stress (Sengupta2013Regulation). In the kidney, OSR1 is particularly important in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle's loop, where it regulates NaCl reabsorption by phosphorylating and activating the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) (Gagnon2012Molecular).

OSR1 also plays a role in the cardiovascular system, where it co-regulates NKCC1, contributing to vascular smooth muscle contractility and blood pressure regulation (Gagnon2012Molecular). Its activity is crucial for maintaining electrolyte balance and responding to osmotic stress, highlighting its importance in cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the OSR1 gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders and conditions. A missense variant, p.V108F, in the OSR1 gene has been associated with uterine factor infertility due to its role in Müllerian duct development and endometrial receptivity. This mutation has been identified in individuals with primary amenorrhea, uterine hypoplasia, and thin endometrium unresponsive to sex steroids, leading to reproductive challenges such as spontaneous tubal pregnancies (LofranoPorto2023OSR1). The mutation is rare and suggests a recessive inheritance pattern, potentially causing an abnormal uterine environment unfavorable for embryo implantation (LofranoPorto2023OSR1).

In addition to reproductive tract anomalies, OSR1 mutations have been linked to congenital heart defects. The gene interacts with Tbx5 and Pcsk6 in a network crucial for atrial septation. Mutations in OSR1 can lead to atrial septal defects (ASDs) and atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs) in mice, indicating its significant role in heart development (Zhang2016Gene). These findings highlight the clinical significance of OSR1 mutations in both reproductive and cardiac development.

## Interactions
OSR1 (odd-skipped related transcription factor 1) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. OSR1 interacts with the stress-related kinases SPAK and WNK1, forming part of a signaling pathway that regulates ion transport and cell volume. This interaction is crucial for the activation of OSR1, as WNK1 phosphorylates OSR1, enhancing its activity and influencing the function of the Na+, K+, 2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC) in HeLa cells (Anselmo2006WNK1).

OSR1 also interacts with cation chloride cotransporters such as NKCC1 and NKCC2, mediated by specific amino acid sequences. These interactions are important for the regulation of cotransporter function and are confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Piechotta2002Cation).

Additionally, OSR1 regulates a subset of inward rectifier potassium channels, including Kir2.1 and Kir2.3, through a binding motif variant. This regulation involves enhancing the plasma membrane localization of these channels, which is disrupted by the inhibition of WNKs or depletion of OSR1 (Taylor2018OSR1).

OSR1 also interacts with members of the RELT family, such as RELT, RELL1, and RELL2, and can phosphorylate these proteins in vitro (Cusick2006Identification).
