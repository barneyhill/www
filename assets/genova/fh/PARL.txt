# PARL

## Overview
PARL (presenilin-associated rhomboid-like) is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial intramembrane protease, which is integral to the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis. The protein product of PARL, also known as presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein, is characterized by a '1 + 6' transmembrane helix structure and is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane (Hill2010The). As a rhomboid protease, PARL is involved in the proteolytic processing of key mitochondrial proteins, such as OPA1 and PINK1, which are essential for mitochondrial fusion and quality control, respectively (Jin2010Mitochondrial; Cipolat2006Mitochondrial). Through these interactions, PARL plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and preventing apoptosis, thereby contributing to cellular survival and homeostasis (Yan2019PHB2). Mutations and variations in the PARL gene have been associated with several diseases, including Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and leprosy, underscoring its clinical significance in mitochondrial-related pathologies (Wang2016Common; Phasukkijwatana2010Genomewide).

## Structure
PARL (presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein) is a mitochondrial rhomboid protease characterized by a unique '1 + 6' transmembrane helix structure. This configuration includes an additional transmembrane helix (TMH-A) at the N-terminus, separate from the core rhomboid domain, which consists of six transmembrane helices (TMH-1 to TMH-6) forming the catalytic serine protease domain (Hill2010The). The protein is 379 amino acids long and is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane, with its N-terminus exposed to the matrix and the C-terminus to the intermembrane space (Hill2010The).

PARL undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its proteolytic activity. The N-terminal domain of PARL is subject to two cleavage events: α-cleavage, which is constitutive, and β-cleavage, which is regulated and linked to mitochondrial fragmentation and remodeling (Hill2010The; Jeyaraju2011Structural). The β-cleavage process is influenced by the phosphorylation of residues near the cleavage site (Hill2010The).

The protein's structure is crucial for its function, with specific residues like Asp319 on TMH-5 playing a critical role in its catalytic activity (Jeyaraju2011Structural). The dynamic nature of TMH-5 is hypothesized to allow for substrate recognition and catalysis (Jeyaraju2011Structural).

## Function
The PARL gene encodes a mitochondrial rhomboid protease that plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis and mitochondrial dynamics in healthy human cells. PARL is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the proteolytic processing of OPA1, a protein essential for mitochondrial fusion and antiapoptotic activity. This processing generates a soluble form of OPA1 in the intermembrane space, which is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and preventing the release of cytochrome c, thereby protecting cells from apoptosis (Cipolat2006Mitochondrial).

PARL also regulates the stability and turnover of PINK1, a protein involved in mitochondrial quality control. In healthy cells, PARL cleaves PINK1 within the inner mitochondrial membrane, leading to its degradation. This process prevents the unnecessary activation of mitophagy, a mechanism for removing damaged mitochondria, by ensuring that PINK1 does not accumulate on the mitochondrial surface (Meissner2015Intramembrane; Jin2010Mitochondrial).

The activity of PARL is modulated by interactions with other mitochondrial proteins, such as PHB2, which can influence PARL's role in processing PINK1 and maintaining mitochondrial function (Yan2019PHB2). Overall, PARL's functions are essential for mitochondrial quality control and cellular survival.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PARL gene have been implicated in several diseases. PARL is crucial for regulating apoptosis through its interaction with OPA1, a protein involved in mitochondrial fusion. Deficiency in PARL leads to increased apoptosis, which is associated with conditions such as muscle wasting and cachexia. In mice, the absence of PARL results in progressive multisystemic atrophy and early death due to cachexia, characterized by muscle atrophy and lymphocyte loss (Cipolat2006Mitochondrial).

PARL has also been linked to Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), a condition characterized by vision loss due to optic nerve degeneration. Specific intronic SNPs in the PARL gene, such as rs1402000 and rs3749446, have shown a strong association with LHON, suggesting that PARL variants may modify the sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells to apoptosis (Phasukkijwatana2010Genomewide).

In addition, common variants in the PARL gene have been associated with an increased risk of leprosy in the Han Chinese population. SNPs such as rs12631031 have been linked to leprosy, indicating that PARL may play a role in the disease's pathogenesis (Wang2016Common). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PARL in various diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.

## Interactions
PARL (presenilin associated rhomboid like) is a mitochondrial intramembrane protease that engages in various interactions with other proteins, influencing mitochondrial function and apoptosis. PARL interacts with PINK1, a mitochondrial kinase, cleaving it within its transmembrane domain. This cleavage is crucial for the proper processing and stability of PINK1, which affects the recruitment of PARKIN, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in mitophagy (Shi2011Functional; Deas2010PINK1). The interaction between PARL and PINK1 is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, highlighting PARL's role in maintaining mitochondrial health (Deas2010PINK1).

PARL also interacts with PGAM5, a phosphatase involved in apoptosis. The cleavage of PGAM5 by PARL leads to its accumulation in the cytosol, where it interacts with inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and activates caspase 3, signaling apoptosis (Lysyk2020PARL). Additionally, PARL cleaves Smac, a pro-apoptotic protein, which binds to IAPs and initiates a caspase cascade that triggers apoptosis (Lysyk2020PARL).

PARL's interaction with PDK2, a kinase, is also significant. PDK2 phosphorylates PARL, regulating its cleavage. Inhibition of PDK2 leads to increased cleavage of PARL, indicating a kinase-substrate relationship (Shi2017The). These interactions underscore PARL's multifaceted role in mitochondrial quality control and apoptosis pathways.
