# TNS1

## Overview
TNS1 is a gene that encodes the protein tensin 1, a cytoskeletal protein integral to cell-matrix adhesion and signal transduction. Tensin 1 is categorized as a scaffold protein due to its role in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesion sites, facilitating cellular processes such as motility, shape maintenance, and tissue repair (McCleverty2007Structure; Huang2023Tensins). The protein contains several functional domains, including phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which enable it to interact with integrins and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, respectively (McCleverty2007Structure; Davis1991Presence). These interactions are crucial for the formation of fibrillar adhesions and the extracellular matrix (ECM), impacting processes such as myofibroblast differentiation and ECM assembly (Bernau2017Tensin). Alterations in the TNS1 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cystic kidney diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Wu2019Hyperactivity; Wang2022lncRNA; Stylianou2019Tensin1).

## Structure


## Function
Tensin 1 (TNS1) is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a critical role in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton at cell-matrix adhesion sites. It is involved in the dynamics and maturation of cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts, which are essential for regulating cellular behavior (McCleverty2007Structure). TNS1 is active in focal adhesions, where it interacts with integrins and actin filaments through its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains and actin-binding domains (ABDs) (Huang2023Tensins). This interaction is crucial for the formation of fibrillar adhesions and the development of a fibronectin matrix, which is necessary for ECM formation (Bernau2017Tensin).

TNS1 also plays a significant role in myofibroblast differentiation and ECM formation, as its depletion leads to a decrease in the assembly of a fibrillar fibronectin matrix and reduced deposition of fibronectin and collagen into the ECM (Bernau2017Tensin). In human airway smooth muscle cells, TNS1 is involved in regulating α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) expression and contraction, which are important for normal cellular function (Stylianou2019Tensin1). TNS1's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cell shape, motility, and signal transduction, influencing tissue development and repair.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNS1 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In cystic kidney diseases, TNS1 knockout models exhibit hyperactivity in the Mek/Erk signaling pathway, leading to cystic kidney defects. The loss of TNS1 results in increased Mek activity, which can be mitigated by Mek inhibitors, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for these conditions (Wu2019Hyperactivity). 

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a non-synonymous SNP in TNS1, resulting in an R1197W amino acid substitution, is associated with increased disease risk. This mutation affects the protein's turnover and proteolytic sensitivity, potentially altering αSMA expression and airway smooth muscle mass, contributing to airway obstruction (Stylianou2019Tensin1).

In lung cancer, TNS1 acts as a tumor suppressor. Its expression is downregulated in cancer tissues, and higher levels are associated with better prognosis. TNS1 influences cell proliferation and migration, and its knockdown can enhance these processes, counteracting the tumor-suppressive effects of ZNRD1-AS1 overexpression (Wang2022lncRNA).

TNS1 is also crucial in fibrotic lung conditions, where its expression is increased in myofibroblasts. It plays a role in extracellular matrix formation, and its depletion can significantly impact the assembly of fibrillar fibronectin and collagen deposition (Bernau2017Tensin).

## Interactions
Tensin 1 (TNS1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and migration. TNS1 interacts with integrins, particularly β1-integrin, at focal adhesions, facilitating the formation of fibrillar adhesions and the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Bernau2017Tensin; Park2022Tensin). It binds to the cytoplasmic tails of integrins through its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is indifferent to phosphorylation, allowing it to interact with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated integrin tails (McCleverty2007Structure).

TNS1 also contains an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, which enables it to bind phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, linking signal transduction pathways with the cytoskeleton (Davis1991Presence). This interaction is significant in the context of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling, as TNS1 knockdown results in the loss of TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of FAK, which is essential for myofibroblast differentiation (Bernau2017Tensin).

Additionally, TNS1 interacts with actin filaments, contributing to cytoskeletal organization and stability at focal adhesion sites (CHEN2000Molecular). These interactions highlight TNS1's role as a scaffold protein, integrating structural and signaling components at cell adhesion sites.
