# ANAPC1

## Overview
The ANAPC1 gene encodes the anaphase-promoting complex subunit 1, a critical component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is an essential E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. As a scaffold protein, ANAPC1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of the APC/C by connecting its catalytic and regulatory subcomplexes. This interaction is vital for the APC/C's ability to target specific proteins for degradation, thereby facilitating the transition from metaphase to anaphase and ensuring proper chromosome segregation and mitotic exit (Malavašič2023AnaphasePromoting; Ajeawung2019Mutations). ANAPC1 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and cell differentiation, and is implicated in conditions such as Rothmund-Thomson syndrome type 1 and osteoporosis (Malavašič2023AnaphasePromoting; Ajeawung2019Mutations).

## Structure
The ANAPC1 gene encodes a scaffold subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. The ANAPC1 protein is the largest structural component of the APC/C, playing a key role in maintaining the integrity and function of the complex by holding together its regulatory and structural regions (Malavašič2023AnaphasePromoting; Ajeawung2019Mutations).

The protein contains several important domains, including the WD40 domain, which mediates conformational changes essential for stimulating the APC's catalytic activity upon co-activator binding (Ajeawung2019Mutations). The Mid-N and Mid-C domains coalesce within the APC complex, while the PC domain connects the APC platform to the tetratricopeptide repeat lobe of the APC (Ajeawung2019Mutations).

Although specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ANAPC1 are not provided, the protein's role as a scaffold suggests a complex tertiary structure that facilitates interactions with other APC/C subunits. The ANAPC1 protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and interactions within the APC/C complex (Malavašič2023AnaphasePromoting).

## Function
The ANAPC1 gene encodes a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell cycle regulation. ANAPC1 serves as a scaffold subunit, connecting the catalytic and regulatory subcomplexes of the APC/C, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and function of the complex (Ajeawung2019Mutations; Zhou2016Insights). The APC/C complex facilitates the transition from metaphase to anaphase by tagging specific proteins for degradation, ensuring proper chromosome segregation and mitotic exit (Malavašič2023AnaphasePromoting; Melloy2019The).

ANAPC1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cell division and genomic stability (Melloy2019The). It plays a role in various cellular processes, including senescence, quiescence, DNA replication and repair, cell differentiation, metabolism, and neuronal function (Ajeawung2019Mutations). The APC/C complex, with ANAPC1 as a component, is also involved in preventing chromosomal instability by timely degrading proteins like ctIP, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Ajeawung2019Mutations). In healthy human cells, ANAPC1 is essential for proper cell cycle progression and bone remodeling, influencing osteoblast differentiation and bone mineral density (Malavašič2023AnaphasePromoting).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ANAPC1 gene are linked to Rothmund-Thomson syndrome type 1 (RTS type 1), an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by poikiloderma, sparse hair, nail abnormalities, and bilateral juvenile cataracts. These mutations often involve intronic splicing errors that introduce pseudoexons, leading to premature termination codons and nonsense-mediated decay, resulting in decreased ANAPC1 protein levels. This reduction impairs the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), affecting cell cycle progression and genomic stability (Ajeawung2019Mutations).

ANAPC1 is also associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and osteoporosis. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs17040773, in the intronic region of ANAPC1 is linked to low femoral neck BMD and is considered a risk factor for osteoporosis. Reduced ANAPC1 expression in osteoporosis patients suggests its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis, potentially through its interaction with RUNX2, a transcription factor crucial for osteoblast differentiation (Malavašič2023AnaphasePromoting).

In cancer, ANAPC1's role in the APC/C complex is crucial for maintaining chromosomal stability. Disruption of APC/C components, including ANAPC1, can confer resistance to certain cancer therapies, such as TTK protein kinase inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer (Thu2018Disruption).

## Interactions
ANAPC1, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), plays a critical role in the structural organization and function of this E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. ANAPC1 acts as a scaffold within the APC/C, bridging the catalytic and regulatory subcomplexes, which is essential for the integrity and function of the complex (Ajeawung2019Mutations; Zhou2016Insights). The APC/C is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, and repair, and it requires coactivators like CDC20 and CDH1 for its activity (Ajeawung2019Mutations; Chang2015Atomic).

ANAPC1 interacts with other APC/C subunits, such as Apc2, Apc3, and Apc11, as part of the complex's structural framework (Chang2015Atomic). The interactions within the APC/C are crucial for its function in targeting specific proteins for degradation, thereby regulating cell cycle transitions (Chang2015Atomic). ANAPC1's role as a scaffold is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of the APC/C, which is necessary for its ubiquitination activity and subsequent proteasomal degradation of substrates (Zhou2016Insights). These interactions highlight the importance of ANAPC1 in the regulation of the cell cycle and its potential implications in diseases such as osteoporosis and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome type 1 (Malavašič2023AnaphasePromoting; Ajeawung2019Mutations).
