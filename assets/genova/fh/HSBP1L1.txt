# HSBP1L1

## Overview
The HSBP1L1 gene encodes the heat shock factor binding protein 1 like 1, a protein that is part of the heat shock protein family. This family is known for its role in cellular stress responses, particularly in the stabilization and folding of proteins under stress conditions. The HSBP1L1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of transcription factors and the modulation of stress response pathways. Although the precise biological functions of HSBP1L1 remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancers and liver disorders, due to its involvement in cellular stress mechanisms (Misawa2019Genes; Krasnov2020Human). The protein's low abundance and specific localization present challenges for its detection and study in proteomic analyses (Poverennaya2016State; Krasnov2020Human).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The HSBP1L1 gene has been implicated in various cancers and liver diseases. It is associated with the development of head and neck cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and chemical hepatocyte injury, making it a significant target for studying genetic aspects of liver diseases (Krasnov2020Human). In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the methylation of HSBP1L1 was observed, with a rate of 30.5% in one cohort and 39.0% in the TCGA cohort. This methylation was correlated with mRNA expression but not with significant differences in disease-free survival, suggesting limited prognostic significance (Misawa2019Genes). 

In the context of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, HSBP1L1 was identified as a potential biomarker, being downregulated in both in vitro models and clinical samples, indicating its role in the pathophysiology of liver injury (Rodrigues2016Toxicogenomicsbased). Despite its potential clinical significance, the detection of HSBP1L1 protein remains challenging due to its low abundance and specific localization, which complicates its identification in proteomic studies (Poverennaya2016State; Krasnov2020Human).
