# TMEM201

## Overview
TMEM201 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 201, also known as Samp1, which is a nuclear envelope transmembrane protein. This protein is primarily associated with the inner nuclear membrane and plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope. It is involved in critical cellular processes such as mitotic spindle assembly and chromosomal segregation during cell division, interacting with the LINC complex to contribute to nuclear structure and stability (PadillaMejia2021Evolution; Larsson2018Mitotic). TMEM201 is also implicated in muscle differentiation and is notably up-regulated in skeletal muscle, suggesting its involvement in myogenic differentiation (Wilkie2011Several). Additionally, TMEM201 has clinical significance due to its association with diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma and muscular dystrophies, where its expression levels and mutations can impact disease progression and prognosis (Wang2022TMEM201; de2022Metabolic).

## Function
TMEM201, also known as Samp1, is a transmembrane protein associated with the inner nuclear membrane, playing a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope. It interacts with the LINC complex, a SUN/KASH-domain protein complex that spans the nuclear envelope, contributing to nuclear structure and stability (PadillaMejia2021Evolution). TMEM201 is involved in the assembly of the mitotic spindle, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. It is distributed as filamentous structures within the mitotic spindle and partially colocalizes with ß-tubulin. Depletion of TMEM201 leads to chromosomal mis-segregation and prolonged metaphase, indicating its importance in spindle assembly and chromosomal alignment (Larsson2018Mitotic).

TMEM201 is also implicated in the organization and stabilization of the spindle apparatus during mitosis, associating with both the centrosome and the mitotic spindle (Wilkie2011Several). In skeletal muscle, TMEM201 is more abundant and is up-regulated during muscle differentiation, suggesting a role in myogenic differentiation (Wilkie2011Several). Its involvement in chromatin topology and gene expression further highlights its significance in cellular differentiation processes (PadillaMejia2021Evolution).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM201, or transmembrane protein 201, has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression or mutations. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TMEM201 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with advanced tumor stages, poor histologic grades, and unfavorable prognostic indicators such as high Ishak scores and positive alpha fetoprotein (AFP). High TMEM201 expression correlates with poor overall survival and disease-free intervals, making it an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC (Wang2022TMEM201).

In the context of muscular dystrophies, TMEM201 mutations are linked to Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), a condition characterized by muscle weakness, contractures, and cardiac defects. TMEM201, as a muscle-specific nuclear envelope transmembrane protein, plays a role in genome organization and regulation, contributing to the pathomechanism of EDMD by affecting muscle gene expression and metabolism (de2022Metabolic; Meinke2020A). In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), TMEM201 is misregulated, with its expression correlating with muscle strength, indicating its role in muscle dysfunction observed in DM1 (Todorow2023Nuclear).

## Interactions
TMEM201, also known as Samp1, is a nuclear envelope transmembrane protein involved in various interactions within the cell. During mitosis, TMEM201 associates with the centrosome and the mitotic spindle, indicating its role in microtubule interactions. It is redistributed into small vesicles throughout the cell, except from the spindle area, and shows increased concentration at the spindle base, suggesting a role in organizing or stabilizing microtubules during cell division (Wilkie2011Several).

TMEM201 is also associated with the LINC complex, which links the nucleus and cytoskeleton. This association is significant in the context of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), where TMEM201 expression correlates with muscle strength, particularly dorsiflexion strength. The downregulation of TMEM201 in DM1 suggests its involvement in the disease's progression (Todorow2023Nuclear).

In the context of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), TMEM201 has been identified as a gene with mutations that may contribute to the disease phenotype. This highlights its potential role in mechanotransduction and genome organization, affecting muscle gene expression and contributing to the pathomechanism of EDMD (de2022Metabolic; Meinke2020A).
