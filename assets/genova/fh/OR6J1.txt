# OR6J1

## Overview
OR6J1 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily J member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a significant role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell (Omenn2015Metrics). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR6J1 has been implicated in various physiological and pathophysiological processes, including potential roles in non-chemosensory tissues such as the brain, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Dibattista2020Alzheimer’s). Additionally, variations in the OR6J1 gene, such as copy number variations, may influence gene expression and have broader implications for metabolic traits and immune responses (Gamazon2011A).

## Function
OR6J1 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This protein is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. In healthy human cells, OR6J1 is primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants. This binding triggers neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Omenn2015Metrics).

The function of OR6J1 extends beyond olfactory perception. It has been suggested that olfactory receptors, including OR6J1, may have roles in non-chemosensory tissues such as the brain. In particular, OR6J1 is upregulated in the olfactory bulb during advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease, indicating a potential involvement in pathophysiological processes (Dibattista2020Alzheimer’s). However, the exact function of OR6J1 in healthy cells outside the olfactory system remains unclear.

Additionally, OR6J1 is associated with copy number variations (CNVs) that can influence gene expression and potentially affect metabolic traits. This suggests a broader role for OR6J1 in molecular-environmental interactions and possibly in immune responses (Gamazon2011A).
