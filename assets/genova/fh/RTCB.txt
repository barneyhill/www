# RTCB

## Overview
RTCB is a gene that encodes the protein RNA 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH ligase, a crucial component of the human tRNA ligase complex. This protein functions as an RNA ligase, playing a pivotal role in tRNA splicing and RNA repair processes. It is characterized by a unique structural fold and is distinct from canonical ATP-dependent ligases, featuring metal binding sites that coordinate divalent metal cations, such as manganese (Mn2+) (Gerber2024Structural). The RTCB protein is essential for the maturation of intron-containing pre-tRNAs and the splicing of XBP1 mRNA during the unfolded protein response (UPR), contributing to RNA stability and cellular stress adaptation (Moncan2023Insights; Gerber2024Structural). The protein's activity is modulated by its interaction with Archease, which facilitates its activation through guanylylation, enhancing its ligation efficiency (Popow2014Analysis). RTCB's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders (Direito2021Protein; Moncan2023Insights).

## Structure
The RTCB protein is an RNA ligase involved in tRNA splicing and RNA repair, functioning as the catalytic subunit of the human tRNA ligase complex. Its molecular structure is characterized by a unique fold distinct from canonical ATP-dependent ligases, with two metal binding sites that coordinate divalent metal cations, typically manganese (Mn2+) (Gerber2024Structural). The protein's active site includes key residues such as C122, H259, and H353, which are crucial for metal ion coordination and guanylylation activity (Gerber2024Structural). 

RTCB forms a complex with the activation factor Archease, which introduces subtle conformational changes and contributes to the active site by coordinating metal and nucleotide co-factors (Gerber2024Structural). The interaction between RTCB and Archease is transient, with Archease promoting RTCB guanylylation and allowing for multiple-turnover ligation (Gerber2024Structural). 

The protein's structure is conserved across different species, with significant amino acid identity observed in RTCB orthologues from archaea and nematodes, indicating evolutionary conservation (Moncan2023Insights). The presence of conserved histidine residues suggests a potential requirement for metal ions like Zn2+ in its catalytic activity (Moncan2023Insights).

## Function
The RTCB gene encodes a catalytic subunit of the human tRNA ligase complex, which is essential for tRNA splicing and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the ligation of RNA molecules by forming phosphodiester bonds, a process crucial for the maturation of intron-containing pre-tRNAs and the splicing of XBP1 mRNA during the UPR (Moncan2023Insights; Gerber2024Structural). RTCB functions as part of a pentameric complex that includes other subunits like DDX1, CGI-99, FAM98B, and ASHWIN, although the specific roles of these subunits are not fully understood (Gerber2023Structural).

The activation of RTCB requires guanylylation, a process facilitated by the protein Archease, which enhances the activity of the tRNA ligase complex in the presence of GTP (Popow2014Analysis). This activation is necessary for multiple-turnover ligation and involves the coordination of metal ions (Gerber2024Structural). RTCB is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to RNA stability and cellular stress adaptation (Moncan2023Insights). Its activity is sensitive to oxidative stress, and it is protected by the oxidoreductase PYROXD1, which prevents oxidative inactivation (Moncan2023Insights).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression or interactions of the RTCB gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of breast cancer, RTCB has been identified as a mediator of acquired resistance to antiestrogen treatments, such as tamoxifen. Studies have shown that RTCB aggregation patterns differ between antiestrogen-sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells, with its inhibition re-sensitizing resistant cells to tamoxifen. This suggests that RTCB plays a significant role in maintaining the protective effect of the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway, which is crucial for the unfolded protein response and autophagy in cancer cells (Direito2021Protein).

In neurological contexts, RTCB is suggested to inhibit axonal regeneration, potentially impacting conditions related to nerve injury. Its role in RNA trafficking granules at the tip of injured axons may be linked to this inhibitory effect (Moncan2023Insights). Additionally, RTCB's involvement in B cell biology and its impact on antibody secretion and ER morphology suggest potential implications in immune function disorders (Moncan2023Insights). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of RTCB in various physiological and pathological contexts.

## Interactions
RTCB is a key component of the human tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC), which includes other subunits such as DDX1, CGI-99, FAM98B, and ASHWIN. Within this complex, RTCB is the only subunit essential for RNA ligation, while the other subunits contribute to the structural integrity and function of the complex (Kroupova2021Molecular; Gerber2024Structural). RTCB interacts with the protein Archease, which is crucial for its activation. Archease facilitates the formation of a covalent RTCB-GMP intermediate necessary for RNA ligation, coordinating GTP and metal ions to promote this activation (Gerber2024Structural).

The interaction between RTCB and Archease is transient and dependent on the presence of GTP and Mn2+ ions, which are essential for the formation of the RTCB-Archease complex (Gerber2024Structural). This interaction is mutually exclusive with RNA substrate binding, suggesting a regulatory mechanism where Archease binding precludes nucleotide exchange and RNA access to the active site (Gerber2024Structural). RTCB also interacts with the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, which dephosphorylates RTCB, modulating its function in response to cellular stress (Papaioannou2022Stressinduced).
