subfamily of serine/threonine kinases containing SH2-like (Src homology 2-like) domains, which is involved in signaling pathways. The gene serves as an oncogene in the tumorigenesis of cancer cells For example, its overexpression contributes to the malignant phenotype of a subset of human ductal pancreatic cancers. The encoded protein is a general protein kinase capable of phophorylating several known proteins, and has also been implicated in insulin signaling.
