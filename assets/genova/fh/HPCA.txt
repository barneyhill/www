# HPCA

## Overview
The HPCA gene encodes the protein hippocalcin, a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family, which plays a pivotal role in calcium signaling within the nervous system. Hippocalcin is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, where it is involved in various neuronal processes, including synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection. As a calcium-binding protein, hippocalcin contains EF-hand motifs that facilitate its interaction with calcium ions, although not all motifs are functional. The protein undergoes myristoylation, a post-translational modification that is essential for its membrane association and function. Through its interactions with other proteins, such as potassium channels and guanylate cyclases, hippocalcin modulates neuronal excitability and signal transduction. Mutations in the HPCA gene have been associated with neurological disorders, such as autosomal-recessive primary isolated dystonia, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Charlesworth2015Mutations; Kobayashi1992Molecular; Krishnan2016Singlecolumn).

## Structure
Hippocalcin (HPCA) is a neuronal calcium sensor protein characterized by its primary structure of 193 amino acids, although some sources report 195 residues (Kobayashi1992Molecular; Krishnan2016Singlecolumn). The protein contains four EF-hand motifs, which are helix-loop-helix structures that bind calcium ions. However, the EF-1 motif is non-functional due to a conserved Cys-Pro mutation, and EF-4 is only active in some neuronal calcium sensor proteins (Charlesworth2015Mutations; Krishnan2016Singlecolumn). 

HPCA undergoes myristoylation at its N-terminal glycine, a post-translational modification that facilitates its calcium-dependent membrane association (Kobayashi1993Myristoylation). This myristoylation is crucial for the protein's function, allowing the myristoyl group to interact with lipid bilayers and other membrane proteins (Kobayashi1993Myristoylation; Krishnan2016Singlecolumn). 

The tertiary structure of HPCA involves interactions with various proteins, such as potassium channels and guanylate cyclases, in a calcium-dependent manner, suggesting a role in modulating neuronal functions like long-term potentiation (Krishnan2016Singlecolumn). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but HPCA's interactions indicate its involvement in complex cellular processes.

## Function
Hippocalcin (HPCA) is a neuron-specific calcium-binding protein that plays a significant role in neuronal differentiation and function. It is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, particularly in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1 region. HPCA is involved in the regulation of neuronal differentiation by promoting neurite outgrowth and increasing the expression of synaptic proteins such as synaptophysin (SYP) in SH-SY5Y cells, a model for neuroblastoma (Kang2019MicroRNA243p). The protein acts as a molecular linker between calcium entry through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and the regulated endocytosis of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, which is crucial during synaptic formation (Kang2019MicroRNA243p).

HPCA also plays a role in astrocytic differentiation through the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in hippocampal neural precursor cells, leading to increased expression of neurotrophins and proneural transcription factors (Kang2016Hippocalcin). The protein's function is mediated by its ability to translocate to membranes in response to elevated calcium levels, a process dependent on its myristoylation and calcium-binding properties (Kobayashi1993Myristoylation; O’Callaghan2002Differential). This translocation is essential for its role in calcium signal transduction and neuronal survival (O’Callaghan2003Dynamics).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HPCA gene, which encodes the neuronal calcium sensor protein hippocalcin, have been linked to autosomal-recessive primary isolated dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Specific mutations such as p.Asn75Lys, p.Thr71Asn, and p.Ala190Thr have been identified in individuals with dystonia, suggesting a genetic basis for the condition (Charlesworth2015Mutations). These mutations are thought to impair calcium binding and signal transduction in the brain's striatum, contributing to the development of dystonia (Charlesworth2015Mutations).

The clinical presentation of dystonia associated with HPCA mutations can vary, with some patients experiencing generalized dystonia and others having more localized symptoms such as cervical, craniofacial, and laryngeal dystonia. Psychiatric features like anxiety and depression, as well as cognitive impairments, have also been reported in some cases (Lange2021Genotype–Phenotype). The inheritance pattern of dystonia due to HPCA mutations is autosomal-recessive, and treatment responses can vary, with some patients responding to anticholinergic drugs (Lange2021Genotype–Phenotype).

Research has shown that HPCA mutations may disrupt calcium signaling pathways, which are crucial for normal neuronal function, thereby contributing to the pathophysiology of dystonia (Charlesworth2015Mutations).

## Interactions
Hippocalcin (HPCA) is a neuronal calcium sensor protein that participates in various protein interactions, playing a crucial role in calcium signaling. HPCA interacts with potassium channels to modulate the hyperpolarization of hippocampal neurons, which is important for long-term potentiation and may be linked to dystonia (Krishnan2016Singlecolumn). It also interacts with membrane guanylate cyclases, such as Olfactory Neuro Epithelial Guanylate Cyclase (ONE-GC) and Rod Outer Segment membrane Guanylate Cyclase type 1 (ROS-GC1), activating them in a calcium-dependent manner (Krishnan2009Hippocalcin; Krishnan2016Singlecolumn). 

HPCA forms a complex with the Neuronal Apoptosis Inhibitor Protein (NAIP), which may help prevent unwarranted apoptosis of neurons (Key2019Ubiquitylome; Krishnan2016Singlecolumn). It also interacts with brain-type creatine kinase, modulating its calcium-dependent translocation to membranes (Key2019Ubiquitylome). In the olfactory neuroepithelium, HPCA and ONE-GC form a functional complex, with HPCA directly stimulating ONE-GC activity (Krishnan2009Hippocalcin). These interactions underscore HPCA's role in modulating cellular processes through calcium-dependent mechanisms.
