# MAP3K2

## Overview
MAP3K2 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis by acting as an upstream kinase that influences the phosphorylation and activation of downstream MAPKs, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Liu2021miR‑3613‑3pMAP3K2p38caspase‑3; Wang2019miR302a). MAP3K2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it transmits signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, impacting cellular functions and organismal development (Li2022MiR3723p). The protein's involvement in stress responses and apoptosis, particularly through the p38/caspase-3 signaling pathway, underscores its significance in regulating cell survival and death (Liu2021miR‑3613‑3pMAP3K2p38caspase‑3).

## Function
MAP3K2, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2, is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in the MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for regulating various cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (Wang2019miR302a). In healthy human cells, MAP3K2 is involved in the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which are key components of the MAPK signaling cascade (Wang2019miR302a).

MAP3K2 functions as an upstream kinase, influencing the phosphorylation and activation of downstream MAPKs, such as p38 MAPK, which is involved in stress responses and apoptosis (Liu2021miR‑3613‑3pMAP3K2p38caspase‑3). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it transmits signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, impacting cellular processes and organismal development (Li2022MiR3723p).

In the context of stress conditions, MAP3K2 has been shown to accelerate apoptosis through the p38/caspase-3 signaling pathway, highlighting its role in cell survival and death regulation (Liu2021miR‑3613‑3pMAP3K2p38caspase‑3). While much of the research focuses on its role in pathological conditions, MAP3K2's involvement in these pathways suggests its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAP3K2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In colon cancer, MAP3K2 is frequently upregulated, with a more than twofold increase in expression observed in 77.3% of colon cancer samples. This upregulation is associated with decreased expression of miR-372-3p, a microRNA that functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting MAP3K2. The negative correlation between miR-372-3p and MAP3K2 suggests that MAP3K2 overexpression may contribute to tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation (Li2022MiR3723p).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MAP3K2 is identified as a target of miR-34c-3p, another tumor suppressor microRNA. Downregulation of miR-34c-3p in TNBC leads to increased MAP3K2 expression, which is associated with enhanced cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), processes critical for cancer metastasis (Wu2017Regulation).

In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), MAP3K2 expression is modulated by the long noncoding RNA MIR205HG, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA to miR-299-3p. This interaction promotes cell proliferation and EMT, suggesting that MAP3K2 plays a significant role in LUSC progression (Liu2020MIR205HG).

## Interactions
MAP3K2, also known as MEKK2, is involved in various protein interactions that regulate cellular signaling pathways. It forms a signaling complex with the scaffold protein Lad, promoting MEK5 activation, and can dimerize via its kinase domain for transphosphorylation, enhancing its kinase activity (Cuevas2007Role). MAP3K2 interacts with the protein phosphatase PP2A, where methylation at lysine 260 by SMYD3 inhibits this interaction, thereby enhancing Ras-ERK1/2 signaling (Reynoird2015SMYD3; Colón‐Bolea2014Lysine). This methylation does not alter MAP3K2's intrinsic kinase activity but affects its protein-protein interactions, particularly with the PP2A complex, which includes PPP2CA, PPP2R1A, and PPP2R2A subunits (Reynoird2015SMYD3).

MAP3K2 is also targeted by various microRNAs, such as miR-3613-3p and miR-372-3p, which bind to its 3'-untranslated region, influencing its expression and activity in different cellular contexts (Liu2021miR‑3613‑3pMAP3K2p38caspase‑3; Li2022MiR3723p). These interactions highlight MAP3K2's role in modulating key signaling pathways, including the MAPK pathway, which is crucial for cellular responses to stress and cytokines.
