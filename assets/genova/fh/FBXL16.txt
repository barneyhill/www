# FBXL16

## Overview
FBXL16 is a gene that encodes the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 16, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by the presence of an F-box motif. This protein is involved in the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes, particularly those containing the B55α regulatory subunit, and plays a crucial role in modulating the phosphorylation state of specific substrates, such as vimentin (Honarpour2014Fbox). Unlike typical F-box proteins, FBXL16 does not form a stable SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complex, as it does not associate with the core SCF subunit CUL1 (Honarpour2014Fbox). Instead, it acts as a negative regulator of PP2A activity, influencing cell differentiation and proliferation, particularly in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Honarpour2014Fbox). FBXL16 is also implicated in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and interacts with various proteins, including IRS1, to promote cell growth and migration, especially in the context of cancer (Morel2024FBXL16). The protein's involvement in oncogenic pathways underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment (Morel2024FBXL16).

## Function
FBXL16 is an F-box protein that plays a role in the regulation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes, particularly those containing the B55α regulatory subunit. Unlike typical F-box proteins, FBXL16 does not form a stable SCF complex as it does not associate with the core SCF subunit CUL1. Instead, it binds to PP2A B55α complexes and acts as a negative regulator of PP2A activity, influencing the phosphorylation state of specific substrates such as vimentin (Honarpour2014Fbox). This regulation is crucial in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where FBXL16 influences differentiation along the cardiovascular lineage by modulating the activity of PP2A, thereby affecting the formation of FLK1+ progenitor cells (Honarpour2014Fbox).

FBXL16's role in cell biology extends to its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, although it does not form a typical SCF ubiquitin ligase. It is implicated in the regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation, particularly in the context of ESCs and potentially in other cell types (Honarpour2014Fbox). The exact mechanisms by which FBXL16 regulates PP2A activity are not fully understood, but it may involve altering substrate association or the subcellular localization of the holoenzyme (Honarpour2014Fbox).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FBXL16 gene have been implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) with KRAS mutations. FBXL16 is upregulated in these cancers, promoting cell growth and drug resistance by stabilizing IRS1 and enhancing IRS1/AKT signaling. This upregulation is associated with decreased overall survival in patients, suggesting that FBXL16 may contribute to poorer outcomes in LUADs with KRAS mutations (Morel2024FBXL16). Targeting FBXL16 has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to KRAS-targeted therapies, such as KRASG12C inhibitors like sotorasib, by sensitizing cancer cells to these treatments (Morel2024FBXL16).

In ovarian cancer, FBXO16, a gene related to FBXL16, acts as a tumor suppressor. It regulates the ubiquitination and degradation of hnRNPL, a protein involved in tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Higher expression levels of FBXO16 correlate with better prognosis in ovarian cancer patients, indicating its role in inhibiting oncogenic pathways (Ji2021FBXO16mediated). While FBXL16 and FBXO16 are distinct, their involvement in cancer-related pathways highlights the clinical significance of F-box proteins in tumorigenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
FBXL16 interacts with the IRS1 protein, a relationship that is crucial for its role in lung adenocarcinomas with KRAS mutations. This interaction is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of FBXL16, as deletion of this domain abolishes the interaction. FBXL16 stabilizes IRS1, enhancing IRS1/AKT signaling, which promotes cell growth and migration. The F-box and LRR domains of FBXL16 are essential for these interactions and functions (Morel2024FBXL16). 

FBXL16 is also involved in the regulation of the ubiquitination and stability of oncoproteins such as MYC, SRC3, CYCLIN D1, and HIF1 alpha. By upregulating MYC stability, FBXL16 promotes cancer cell growth and migration (Morel2024FBXL16). 

In the context of HeLa cells, FBXL16 is regulated by E2F1 and is commonly upregulated when p16INK4A and p14ARF are silenced. Although the study by Yoshida et al. does not provide specific details on the physical interactions of FBXL16 with other proteins or nucleic acids, it suggests that FBXL16 may function as a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (Yoshida2009FBXL16).
