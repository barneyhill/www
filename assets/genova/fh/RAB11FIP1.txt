# RAB11FIP1

## Overview
RAB11FIP1 is a gene that encodes the RAB11 family interacting protein 1, a key player in intracellular trafficking processes. This protein is categorized as a Rab effector, specifically interacting with the Rab11 GTPase, which is integral to the endosomal recycling pathway. The RAB11FIP1 protein is involved in the regulation of membrane protein recycling, ensuring that proteins such as the transferrin receptor are directed away from degradation pathways and back to the plasma membrane. This function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper distribution of membrane proteins. Additionally, RAB11FIP1 has been implicated in the trafficking of adiponectin in adipocytes, where it acts as an inhibitor of secretion. The gene and its encoded protein have significant clinical relevance, particularly in cancer and metabolic disorders, where alterations in their expression can impact disease progression and prognosis (Peden2004The; Carson2013The; Zhang2021RAB11FIP1:).

## Function
RAB11FIP1, also known as Rab11 family interacting protein 1, plays a significant role in intracellular trafficking processes, particularly in the endosomal recycling pathway. It interacts with the Rab11 GTPase, which is crucial for the recycling of plasma membrane receptor proteins. In HeLa cells, the RAB11FIP1-Rab11 complex is essential for the recycling of the transferrin receptor (TfR), directing it away from the degradative lysosomal pathway and towards recycling endosomes (Peden2004The). This interaction ensures that TfR is recycled back to the plasma membrane rather than being degraded, highlighting RAB11FIP1's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper membrane protein distribution (Peden2004The).

In adipocytes, RAB11FIP1 is involved in the trafficking and secretion of adiponectin, a hormone important for glucose regulation and fatty acid breakdown. Overexpression of RAB11FIP1 decreases adiponectin secretion, while its knockdown enhances secretion, indicating that RAB11FIP1 acts as an inhibitor in adiponectin trafficking (Carson2013The). Despite its role in adiponectin secretion, RAB11FIP1 does not significantly affect other cellular functions such as transferrin receptor recycling or Glut4 exocytosis in response to insulin (Carson2013The).

## Clinical Significance
RAB11FIP1 has significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), RAB11FIP1 expression is down-regulated, and this reduction is associated with poorer overall survival, making it a potential prognostic biomarker (Zhang2021RAB11FIP1:). The gene's expression correlates with immune cell infiltration, affecting CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, which suggests its role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment (Zhang2021RAB11FIP1:).

In breast cancer, RAB11FIP1 is often amplified, promoting cell invasiveness and motility, and is involved in recycling tyrosine kinase receptors like EGFR1, enhancing signaling pathways that contribute to cancer progression (Voutsadakis2021Amplification). Its dysregulation can lead to changes in cell polarity and metastatic potential, as it affects membrane polarization and vesicle recycling (Voutsadakis2021Amplification).

RAB11FIP1 also plays a role in adiponectin trafficking and secretion, with its expression inversely correlated with obesity markers. Alterations in its expression can impact adipose tissue function and related metabolic processes, highlighting its potential significance in metabolic disorders (Carson2013The). These findings underscore the importance of RAB11FIP1 in various diseases, particularly in cancer and metabolic conditions.

## Interactions
RAB11FIP1, also known as Rab-coupling protein (RCP), is a member of the Rab11 family of interacting proteins and plays a significant role in endosomal trafficking and receptor sorting. It primarily interacts with Rab11, a small GTPase, forming a complex that is crucial for the regulation of protein recycling within cells. This interaction is essential for the localization of RCP to recycling endosomes, where it colocalizes with the transferrin receptor (TfR) (Peden2004The). RAB11FIP1 binds to Rab11 with much higher affinity than to Rab4, indicating that Rab11 is its predominant interacting partner in vivo (Peden2004The).

RAB11FIP1 is also involved in the trafficking of integrin α5β1, which is important for cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Zhang2021RAB11FIP1:). The protein interacts with other Rab11 effectors, such as EHD1 and MICALL1, which are involved in transferrin receptor recycling (Sakai2019The). RFFL, a ubiquitin ligase, can ubiquitinate Rab11 effectors, including RAB11FIP1, impacting their function in endocytic recycling (Sakai2019The). These interactions highlight the role of RAB11FIP1 in modulating the endocytic recycling pathway and its potential impact on cellular processes related to cancer progression.
