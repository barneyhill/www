# FRMPD1

## Overview
FRMPD1 is a gene that encodes the protein FERM and PDZ domain containing 1, which is primarily involved in cellular signaling and protein-protein interactions within the mammalian retina. The protein is characterized by the presence of FERM and PDZ domains, which facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein, linking cytoskeletal proteins to the plasma membrane and binding to the C-terminus of other proteins, respectively (Uversky2014Unreported). Notably, FRMPD1 is largely unstructured, containing significant intrinsically disordered protein regions that are crucial for its interaction with other proteins (Uversky2014Unreported). Functionally, FRMPD1 is essential for the trafficking of G-protein transducin in rod photoreceptors, playing a critical role in the adaptive responses of the retina to varying light intensities (Campla2022Frmpd1). Additionally, mutations in the FRMPD1 gene have been linked to immunodeficiency, highlighting its clinical significance in immune function and genetic research (CobanAkdemir2018Identifying).

## Structure
The FRMPD1 protein is characterized by the presence of FERM and PDZ domains, which are essential for its role in cellular signaling and protein-protein interactions. The FERM domain is involved in linking cytoskeletal proteins to the plasma membrane, while the PDZ domain typically binds to the C-terminus of other proteins (Uversky2014Unreported). 

The protein is largely unstructured, with significant intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs), which are predicted to be mostly disordered. This intrinsic disorder is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, as evidenced by the presence of 23 disorder-based interaction sites identified by the ANCHOR tool (Uversky2014Unreported). 

A specific fragment of Frmpd1, encompassing amino acids 901-951, has been shown to bind to the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs of AGS3, adopting an extended conformation within the concave channel formed by these motifs (Uversky2014Unreported). The structural analysis of this complex was resolved at a 2.4 Å resolution, although some terminal residues were missing in the structure (Uversky2014Unreported). 

The protein's large size and unstructured nature pose challenges for purification and in vitro studies, necessitating the use of specific fragments for experimental analysis (Campla2022Frmpd1). The full-length protein's structural details, including primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, remain largely uncharacterized in the available literature.

## Function
The FRMPD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the trafficking of G-protein transducin (Ga t) in rod photoreceptors of the mammalian retina. This protein is essential for the adaptive and modulatory responses of the retina to varying light intensities. FRMPD1 facilitates the return of Ga t from the synapse back to the outer segments in the dark, which is vital for the recovery of rods from light adaptation (Campla2022Frmpd1). The protein interacts directly with Gpsm2, a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, forming complexes that are crucial for synaptic function and light adaptation in rod photoreceptors (Campla2022Frmpd1). 

FRMPD1 is localized to the inner segments and synapses of rod photoreceptors, suggesting a scaffolding function that supports the structural organization within these cells (Campla2022Frmpd1). It is involved in modulating synaptic transmission from rods to rod bipolar cells under bright light conditions, enhancing synaptic transmission during light adaptation (Campla2022Frmpd1). The protein's role in facilitating the timely return of Ga t to the rod outer segments following light-induced translocation is essential for normal dark adaptation, maintaining normal synaptic function and visual processing in the retina (Campla2022Frmpd1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FRMPD1 gene have been associated with immunodeficiency in individuals. The gene encodes a protein that plays a role in the regulation of subcellular localization of the activator of G-protein signaling 3 (AGS3), which is involved in immune function. Studies have shown that AGS3-null B and T lymphocytes and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells exhibit defects in chemokine signaling, suggesting that alterations in FRMPD1 may impact immune responses (CobanAkdemir2018Identifying).

The identification of FRMPD1 as a candidate gene for Mendelian disease traits through potential gain-of-function mechanisms highlights its clinical significance. The study utilized a whole exome sequencing (WES) database from a disease cohort to identify genes with more than one truncating variant predicted to escape nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in unrelated individuals with Mendelian disease. This approach aims to accelerate gene discovery and improve understanding of the genetic basis of diseases associated with FRMPD1 (CobanAkdemir2018Identifying).

While the specific clinical implications of FRMPD1 gene interactions or related diseases are not fully detailed, the gene's involvement in immune function and potential gain-of-function alleles suggest its relevance in genetic research and disease understanding (CobanAkdemir2018Identifying).

## Interactions
FRMPD1 (FERM and PDZ domain containing 1) is involved in several protein interactions within the mammalian retina, particularly in rod photoreceptors. It localizes to the inner segments and synapses of these photoreceptors, where it functions as a scaffolding protein. FRMPD1 interacts with Gpsm2, a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, forming complexes that are crucial for synaptic function. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in both HEK293 cells and retina lysates, as well as colocalization studies in transfected cells (Campla2022Frmpd1).

The interaction between FRMPD1 and Gpsm2 is mediated by the FRMPD1 protein fragment comprising residues 895-938, which serves as the binding site for Gpsm2. This interaction is not significantly affected by the presence of the G-protein transducin (Ga t), indicating a non-competitive binding mechanism (Campla2022Frmpd1). FRMPD1 also forms a ternary complex with Gpsm2 and Ga t, similar to the Numa-Gpsm2-Gai complex involved in asymmetric cell division (Campla2022Frmpd1). However, FRMPD1 does not interact with Gpsm1 in the presence of Ga t, highlighting a distinct interaction profile (Campla2022Frmpd1). These interactions suggest that FRMPD1 plays a significant role in modulating synaptic transmission and photoreceptor function.
