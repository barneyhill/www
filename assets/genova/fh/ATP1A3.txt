# ATP1A3

## Overview
The ATP1A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a transmembrane protein crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This protein plays a vital role in various cellular processes, including nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction, by facilitating the active transport of ions. Predominantly expressed in neurons, the ATPase Na+/K+ transporting subunit alpha 3 is essential for restoring ion balance after neuronal excitation, thereby maintaining neuronal excitability and function (Smith2020Role). Mutations in ATP1A3 are associated with several neurological disorders, such as Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood and Rapid-Onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining proper neuronal function (Li2022Molecular; Rosewich2012Heterozygous).

## Structure
The ATP1A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a crucial enzyme for maintaining sodium and potassium ion gradients across the plasma membrane. The protein's primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its complex architecture. The secondary structure includes transmembrane helices, notably M4 and M8, which are integral to its function in ion binding and transport (Yang2014ATP1A3).

The tertiary structure of ATP1A3 involves a three-dimensional conformation that allows the protein to undergo conformational changes between E1 and E2 states, essential for its ion transport activity. These conformations enable the selective binding of three Na+ ions in the E1 state and two K+ ions in the E2 state (Yang2014ATP1A3).

In terms of quaternary structure, ATP1A3 forms a functional enzyme complex with other subunits, including the β subunit, which is involved in the protein's biosynthesis and trafficking. The β subunit undergoes glycosylation, which is crucial for proper folding and ER retention (Arystarkhova2021Misfolding).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase, although specific details on these modifications for ATP1A3 are not provided in the context. The protein may also have different isoforms due to alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity.

## Function
The ATP1A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, a crucial enzyme for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions across the plasma membrane. This gradient is essential for various cellular processes, including nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction (Smith2020Role). In neurons, ATP1A3 plays a critical role in restoring ion balance after neuronal excitation, which is vital for maintaining neuronal excitability and function (Smith2020Role). The protein is predominantly expressed in neurons and is involved in transmembrane ionic transport, contributing to synaptic transmission and membrane potential maintenance (Smith2020Role).

ATP1A3 is particularly important in the developing human brain, where it is expressed in specific cell types within the fetal and early postnatal neocortex. This suggests its involvement in the folding and lamination of the cerebral cortex, processes crucial for cortical development (Smith2020Role). The gene's expression is enriched in excitatory neurons and parvalbumin interneurons, indicating its role in neuronal maturation and differentiation (Smith2020Role). Dysfunction in ATP1A3, such as loss of function mutations, can lead to increased intracellular Na+ concentration, which is detrimental to cellular processes and associated with neurological diseases (Smith2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP1A3 gene are linked to several neurological disorders, most notably Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC), Rapid-Onset Dystonia-Parkinsonism (RDP), and CAPOS syndrome. AHC is characterized by episodes of hemiplegia, developmental delay, and dystonia, often triggered by stress or temperature changes (Rosewich2012Heterozygous; Salles2021ATP1A3Related). RDP involves sudden onset of dystonia and parkinsonism, typically following physical or psychological stress, with symptoms such as dysphonia and dysphagia (Li2022Molecular; Salles2021ATP1A3Related). CAPOS syndrome is associated with cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss, often linked to the p.Glu818Lys mutation (Li2022Molecular; Salles2020Untangling).

These conditions are part of a phenotypic continuum, with overlapping features rather than distinct disorders (Carecchio2018ATP1A3related; Boonsimma2020Mutational). Other disorders associated with ATP1A3 mutations include early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, childhood-onset schizophrenia, and autistic spectrum disorder (Li2022Molecular; Salles2021ATP1A3Related). The mutations often lead to dysfunction of the Na+/K+ ATPase, affecting neuronal ion homeostasis and resulting in diverse clinical manifestations (Arystarkhova2019Factors).

## Interactions
The ATP1A3 protein, a subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins that influence its function and stability. The α-subunit, which includes ATP1A3, interacts with the β-subunit, which acts as a molecular chaperone to facilitate the correct folding and integration of the α-subunit into the membrane. There are three isoforms of the β-subunit (β1, β2, and β3), which can assemble with ATP1A3 and affect the affinities for Na+ and K+ ions (Holm2016Neurological).

ATP1A3 also interacts with FXYD proteins, such as FXYD7, which modulate the kinetic properties of the Na+/K+ ATPase by interacting with specific residues in the α-subunit. These interactions can influence the properties of the α-subunit, although the full consequences of these interactions are not completely understood (Holm2016Neurological).

Mutations in ATP1A3, such as D923N and L924P, can lead to misfolding and degradation, affecting its interaction with the β1 subunit. The β1 subunit promotes association with chaperones like calnexin, which can lead to retention in the endoplasmic reticulum rather than degradation, highlighting the importance of these interactions for proper protein folding and function (Arystarkhova2021Misfolding).
