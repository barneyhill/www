# PLXDC2

## Overview
PLXDC2, or plexin domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, including neural development and cell signaling. The protein, also referred to as PLXDC2, functions as a receptor for Pigment Epithelium Derived Factor (PEDF), which is known for its neurotrophic, antiangiogenic, and antitumorigenic properties. PLXDC2 plays a critical role in mediating PEDF-induced effects, such as cell death in endothelial cells, and is implicated in cellular senescence and tumor suppression (Cheng2014Identification). Additionally, PLXDC2 is expressed in neural progenitor cells and is involved in promoting cell proliferation during neural development, particularly in the brain's patterning centers (MillerDelaney2011Plxdc2). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and phosphorylated Cortactin, further underscore its role in cellular signaling pathways and its potential impact on cancer progression and prognosis (Zhang2024Secreted; Wu2022PLXDC2).

## Function
PLXDC2, also known as plexin domain containing 2, is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in neural development and cell signaling. It functions as a receptor for Pigment Epithelium Derived Factor (PEDF), a multifunctional factor with neurotrophic, antiangiogenic, and antitumorigenic properties. PLXDC2 is involved in mediating PEDF-induced cell death in endothelial cells, highlighting its role in cellular senescence and its negative correlation with malignant cell transformation in tumors (Cheng2014Identification).

In the developing nervous system, PLXDC2 acts as a mitogen for neural progenitors, promoting cell proliferation. This is demonstrated by its expression in patterning centers of the brain, such as the cortical hem and midbrain-hindbrain boundary, where it influences neural tube thickening and proliferation in chick models (MillerDelaney2011Plxdc2). The protein's extracellular domain can be cleaved and shed, suggesting a cell non-autonomous function, potentially acting as a ligand (MillerDelaney2011Plxdc2).

PLXDC2 is also identified as a marker of adult stem cells and is present on the cell surface of human pluripotent stem cells, indicating its involvement in maintaining progenitor pools and controlling neural differentiation (Cheng2014Identification). Its expression and function are crucial for understanding its role in healthy human cells and its potential implications in disease contexts.

## Clinical Significance
PLXDC2 has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of gastric cancer (GC). Studies have shown that PLXDC2 is highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and its expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, including lower overall survival rates. High PLXDC2 expression correlates with advanced clinicopathological features such as Neoplasm Histological Grade and TNM Stage, making it an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in GC patients (Wu2022PLXDC2; Guan2021Overexpression).

PLXDC2 promotes invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells by enhancing invadopodium formation through its interaction with protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). This interaction prevents the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Cortactin, facilitating cancer cell invasion (Wu2022PLXDC2). Additionally, PLXDC2 is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammatory signaling pathways, suggesting its role in these processes (Guan2021Overexpression).

In the tumor microenvironment, PLXDC2 is associated with M2 macrophages, which are known to promote tumor growth. This suggests that PLXDC2 may play a role in recruiting M2 macrophages, contributing to tumor progression (Guan2021Overexpression). These findings highlight PLXDC2's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in gastric cancer.

## Interactions
PLXDC2, or plexin domain containing 2, is involved in several significant protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One notable interaction is with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in macrophages, where PLXDC2 facilitates the activation of JAK2 by the tumor suppressor PTEN. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of STAT1, a transcription factor involved in macrophage polarization, and is part of the PTEN-PLXDC2-JAK2-STAT1 signaling axis that reprograms macrophages to an antitumor phenotype (Zhang2024Secreted).

In gastric cancer cells, PLXDC2 interacts with phosphorylated Cortactin (p-Cortactin) and Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). PLXDC2 enhances invadopodium formation by upregulating p-Cortactin levels, which is essential for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. The interaction with PTP1B prevents the dephosphorylation of p-Cortactin, maintaining its active form and promoting invadopodium assembly (Wu2022PLXDC2).

PLXDC2 also serves as a receptor for Pigment Epithelium Derived Factor (PEDF), a multifunctional factor with neurotrophic and antitumorigenic properties. This interaction is necessary for PEDF's activity on target cells, particularly in blood vessel cells, where PLXDC2 mediates PEDF's antiangiogenic effects (Cheng2014Identification).
