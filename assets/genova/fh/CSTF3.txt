# CSTF3

## Overview
CSTF3, or cleavage stimulation factor subunit 3, is a gene that encodes the protein CstF-77, a vital component of the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) complex. This complex is integral to the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA, a critical step in mRNA maturation, stability, and export from the nucleus. CstF-77 functions as a scaffold protein within the CstF complex, facilitating interactions with other subunits such as CstF-64 and CstF-50, and linking them to the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) (Grozdanov2018The). The protein is characterized by its twelve half-a-tetratricopeptide repeat (HAT) domains and a proline-rich 'monkeytail' domain, which are essential for its structural and functional roles (Grozdanov2018The). CSTF3 is involved in the regulation of alternative polyadenylation, influencing RNA stability and translation, and has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in mRNA processing (Nourse2020Emerging; Luo2024CSTF3).

## Structure
The CSTF3 gene encodes the CstF-77 protein, a crucial component of the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) complex involved in mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. CstF-77 serves as a scaffold within the CstF complex, linking CstF-64 and CstF-50 to the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF) (Grozdanov2018The). Structurally, CstF-77 is composed of twelve half-a-tetratricopeptide repeat (HAT) domains and a proline-rich protein-protein interaction domain known as the 'monkeytail' (MT) (Grozdanov2018The). The MT domain interacts with the Hinge domain of CstF-64, while a region adjacent to the MT interacts with CstF-50, indicating flexibility in the complex's conformation (Grozdanov2018The).

The C-terminal domain (CTD) of CstF-77, predicted to form an α-helix, is essential for its function, particularly in its interaction with CstF-64 (Grozdanov2018The). The last 30 amino acids of CstF-77, conserved across metazoans, play a role in altering RNA binding by CstF-64, enhancing cleavage and polyadenylation (Grozdanov2018The). CstF-77 contains a monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) necessary for the nuclear transport of the CstF complex (Grozdanov2018The). The CSTF3 gene also has an alternative polyadenylation site, leading to two transcript variants: CstF-77.L (long form) and CstF-77.S (short form), with the long form being key for polyadenylation (Cheng2013Mathematical).

## Function
CSTF3, or cleavage stimulation factor subunit 3, is a crucial component of the cleavage stimulation factor (CSTF) complex involved in the 3' end processing of pre-mRNA. This process is essential for mRNA maturation, stability, and export from the nucleus. In healthy human cells, CSTF3 plays a significant role in the regulation of 3' end processing of mRNA, which is vital for proper gene expression. CSTF3 undergoes autoregulation through a conserved poly(A) site located in intron 3. At high concentrations of 3' end processing factors, processing at this intronic site generates a short isoform of CSTF3 that does not produce a functional protein, while the expression of the long, functional isoform is reduced. This autoregulation is important for the transition between cell proliferation and differentiation, as differentiated cells express 3' end processing factors at lower levels than proliferating cells (Gruber2019Alternative).

CSTF3 interacts with other proteins in the CSTF complex to facilitate the recognition and processing of the 3' end of pre-mRNA. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, which is essential for normal cellular function and preventing tumorigenesis (Gruber2019Alternative).

## Clinical Significance
CSTF3 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in mRNA processing, particularly in the cleavage and polyadenylation of pre-mRNA. In B-cell leukemia/lymphoma, CSTF3 is expressed at significantly higher levels in tumor samples, which is associated with 3' UTR shortening. This alteration in expression is linked to the deregulation of oncogenes, contributing to cancer pathogenesis (Nourse2020Emerging). In triple-negative breast cancer, elevated CSTF3 expression correlates with 3' UTR shortening, triggering alternative polyadenylation (APA) shortening of oncogenes such as NRAS and JUN. These oncogenes are known to be deregulated in breast cancer, suggesting that CSTF3 expression alterations can significantly impact cancer development by affecting APA and oncogene regulation (Nourse2020Emerging).

While the context does not provide specific information on CSTF3 mutations, the role of CSTF3 in cancer highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. Alterations in CSTF3 expression or its interactions could serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, given its involvement in critical regulatory processes of mRNA stability and translation (Nourse2020Emerging).

## Interactions
CSTF3, a component of the cleavage stimulation factor complex, plays a crucial role in pre-mRNA 3' end processing. It interacts with other proteins such as CSTF1 and CSTF2, forming a complex that recognizes and binds to the polyadenylation signal of pre-mRNA. This interaction is essential for the alternative polyadenylation (APA) process, which affects RNA stability and translation (Luo2024CSTF3).

In ovarian cancer cells, CSTF3 has been shown to interact with the long non-coding RNA NEAT1. CSTF3 binds to the NEAT1 loci at the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), influencing the generation of NEAT1 isoforms. Specifically, CSTF3 promotes the expression of the short isoform NEAT1_1 and reduces the long isoform NEAT1_2, which is associated with platinum resistance in ovarian cancer (Luo2024CSTF3). This interaction is a significant APA event contributing to platinum resistance, highlighting CSTF3's role in modulating RNA processing and its potential as a therapeutic target (Luo2024CSTF3).

CSTF3 also interacts with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which is involved in cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance. This interaction suggests a broader role for CSTF3 in cellular signaling pathways beyond its function in RNA processing (Luo2024CSTF3).
