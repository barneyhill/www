# EIF3H

## Overview
EIF3H is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit H, a component of the eIF3 complex, which is pivotal in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The eIF3 complex, to which EIF3H belongs, is essential for the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex, facilitating the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome and thereby influencing translation initiation's rate and fidelity (Herrmannová2019Adapted; Valášek2017Embraced). EIF3H is categorized as a translation initiation factor and plays a significant role in mRNA circularization, enhancing translation efficiency by promoting ribosome recycling (Herrmannová2019Adapted). Beyond its fundamental role in translation, EIF3H is involved in specific mRNA translation regulation, with implications in tissue-specific processes and oncogenesis, as evidenced by its interactions with proteins such as Snail and METTL3, which contribute to cancer progression (Choe2018mRNA; Guo2020EIF3H).

## Function
EIF3H is a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a critical role in the initiation phase of protein synthesis in human cells. It is involved in the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC), a crucial step in the translation initiation process. EIF3H, along with other eIF3 subunits, facilitates the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome, thereby influencing the rate and fidelity of translation initiation (Herrmannová2019Adapted; Valášek2017Embraced).

In healthy human cells, EIF3H is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of translation. It is part of the eIF3 octamer, which serves as a structural scaffold for the assembly of the translation initiation machinery. This subunit is also implicated in promoting mRNA circularization, which enhances the efficiency of translation by facilitating ribosome recycling (Herrmannová2019Adapted).

EIF3H's role extends to modulating specific mRNA translation, as seen in zebrafish, where it is proposed to regulate the translation of lens-associated crystallin isoform mRNAs, suggesting a potential role in tissue-specific translation processes (Valášek2017Embraced). Its involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining normal cellular function and growth.

## Clinical Significance
EIF3H is implicated in several cancers due to its overexpression and role in promoting tumor progression. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), EIF3H is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, promoting tumorigenesis and growth. It enhances metastatic phenotypes by stabilizing the Snail protein, a transcription factor associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for cancer metastasis (Guo2020EIF3H). Knockdown of EIF3H in ESCC reduces cell proliferation and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Guo2020EIF3H).

In breast cancer, EIF3H is identified as a driver gene within specific chromosomal amplicons. Its overexpression, often due to DNA amplification, contributes to cell growth, survival, and transformation. Silencing EIF3H in breast cancer cell lines leads to decreased cell viability and colony formation, indicating its role in tumorigenesis (Mahmood2013A). EIF3H is also associated with poor prognosis and relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients (Mahmood2013A).

EIF3H is frequently coamplified with MYC in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), correlating with increased sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) like gefitinib, suggesting a potential role in treatment response (Cappuzzo2009MYC).

## Interactions
EIF3H, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in translation and oncogenesis. EIF3H specifically interacts with the transcription factor Snail in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This interaction stabilizes Snail by preventing its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and contributing to cancer aggressiveness (Guo2020EIF3H). The interaction is specific to EIF3H, as other eIF3 subunits like EIF3A and EIF3I do not interact with Snail (Guo2020EIF3H).

EIF3H also interacts with METTL3, a methyltransferase involved in mRNA translation. This interaction is crucial for mRNA circularization and enhanced translation, which supports oncogenic transformation. The METTL3-eIF3H interaction facilitates the formation of densely packed polyribosomes, enhancing the translation of oncogenic mRNAs (Choe2018mRNA). The interaction is mediated by the Mpr1p/Pad1p N-terminal (MPN) domain of EIF3H, which is accessible without impairing ribosome assembly (Choe2018mRNA).

These interactions highlight EIF3H's role in modulating protein stability and translation, contributing to its oncogenic potential.
