# SAXO2

## Overview
SAXO2 is a gene that encodes the protein stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 2, which is integral to the structural and functional maintenance of axonemal microtubules in cilia and flagella. These microtubules are crucial for the motility and signaling functions of these organelles, which play significant roles in processes such as fluid movement across epithelial surfaces and sensory perception. The SAXO2 protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, particularly in areas associated with ciliary structures, and is part of a protein family that includes SAXO1. While SAXO1 is primarily associated with sperm flagella, SAXO2 is found in the axoneme of motile cilia in tissues like the fallopian tube and upper airway epithelia, indicating its specialized role in different cellular contexts (Andersen2024Uncovering; Wang2022Transcriptome; Dacheux2015Human).

## Structure


## Function
SAXO2, or stabilizer of axonemal microtubules 2, is a protein involved in the stabilization of axonemal microtubules, which are essential components of cilia and flagella. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these organelles, which are vital for cell motility and signaling. SAXO2 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in regions associated with ciliary structures, contributing to processes like fluid movement across epithelial surfaces and sensory perception (Andersen2024Uncovering).

SAXO2 is part of a family of proteins that includes SAXO1, which is known to stabilize microtubules in cilia and related structures. While SAXO1 is primarily found in sperm flagella, SAXO2 is present in the axoneme aspect of motile cilia in tissues such as the fallopian tube and upper airway epithelia, suggesting complementary roles for these proteins in different cell types (Dacheux2015Human). SAXO2's involvement in microtubule stabilization is crucial for the proper function of cilia, which are responsible for various physiological processes, including the movement of fluids and the transmission of sensory signals (Wang2022Transcriptome).
