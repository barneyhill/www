# ST6GAL1

## Overview
ST6GAL1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST6 beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1, a glycosyltransferase involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme is categorized as a sialyltransferase and plays a critical role in adding sialic acid in an alpha-2,6 linkage to galactose residues, a modification essential for various cellular processes such as cell-cell interactions, signaling, and glycoprotein stability. The enzyme is predominantly active in the Golgi apparatus and is expressed in multiple tissue-specific isoforms, with significant expression in the liver, where it contributes to immune homeostasis (Dorsett2020Regulation; Zou2022ST6GAL1). ST6GAL1's activity is modulated by genetic and epigenetic factors, and its dysregulation is implicated in several cancers, where it influences tumor progression and metastasis (Dorsett2020Regulation; Schultz2016The).

## Structure
The human ST6GAL1 gene encodes the enzyme ST6 beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1, which is involved in the glycosylation of glycoproteins. The enzyme adopts a GT-A fold, characterized by a single Rossmann-like domain with a mixed β-sheet structure (Kuhn2013The). The molecular structure includes a seven-stranded central β-sheet flanked by α-helices, forming a GT-A variant 2 fold (Kuhn2013The). The enzyme's catalytic domain contains conserved sialylmotifs L, S, III, and VS, which are crucial for substrate binding and catalysis (Harrus2020Unliganded).

ST6GAL1 features a large N-terminal appendage involved in substrate binding, which is absent in related enzymes like ST3Gal-I (Kuhn2013The). The enzyme is glycosylated, with a notable glycan bound to Asn149, which mimics a substrate complex (Kuhn2013The). The enzyme's structure includes disulfide bonds, with six cysteine residues involved in these bonds, contributing to its stability and function (Kuhn2013The).

ST6GAL1 is expressed in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may lead to distinct functional properties. The enzyme is localized in the Golgi apparatus membrane and undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which are essential for its activity and stability (Kuhn2013The).

## Function
ST6GAL1 is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, specifically adding sialic acid in an alpha-2,6 linkage to galactose residues. This modification is significant for various cellular processes, including cell-cell interactions, signaling, and the stability of glycoproteins. The enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it facilitates the sialylation process, impacting the immune response and development (Dorsett2020Regulation).

In healthy human cells, ST6GAL1 expression is tissue-specific, with high levels observed in the liver. This expression pattern is linked to maintaining systemic immunity, as evidenced by studies showing that loss of α2,6 sialylation in hepatocytes can induce a proinflammatory state, suggesting a role in immune homeostasis (Zou2022ST6GAL1). ST6GAL1 is also expressed in nonmalignant stem and progenitor cell populations, and its upregulation is associated with the induction of pluripotency in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines (Dorsett2020Regulation).

The enzyme's activity is influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors, such as promoter methylation, which can regulate its expression in different tissues and cell types (Zou2022ST6GAL1). In differentiated cells, ST6GAL1 expression is low in certain epithelial cells but high in hepatocytes, indicating its varied roles depending on the cellular context (Dorsett2020Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
The ST6GAL1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. It is significantly upregulated in several epithelial cancers, including ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancers, where its high expression is associated with poor prognosis, increased metastatic potential, and reduced chemosensitivity (Dorsett2020Regulation; Hait2022Extracellular; Schultz2016The). In ovarian and pancreatic cancers, ST6GAL1 expression is linked to cancer stem cell characteristics, such as spheroid growth and chemotherapy resistance, enhancing tumor-initiating potential (Schultz2016The). In breast cancer, ST6GAL1 promotes cell growth and invasiveness, with its extracellular presence compensating for reduced endogenous levels, maintaining mesenchymal and stemness marker expression (Hait2022Extracellular).

In gliomas, ST6GAL1 expression is regulated by DNA methylation, with dense methylation leading to transcriptional silencing. Reactivation of ST6GAL1 through demethylation decreases cell adhesion and invasivity, suggesting a potential therapeutic target (Kroes2016The). In thyroid cancers, ST6GAL1 expression is higher in tumors compared to normal tissue, particularly in the follicular variant of papillary carcinoma, and is associated with tumor aggressiveness and lymph node metastasis (Gunjača2023Role).

## Interactions
ST6GAL1 interacts with various proteins, influencing cellular processes through its role in glycosylation. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ST6GAL1 modulates the sialylation of the melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) on the cell surface. This modification reduces MCAM's interaction with galectin-3, a protein involved in cell-cell adhesion, thereby inhibiting cell migration and invasion (Zou2022ST6GAL1). The interaction between ST6GAL1 and MCAM is crucial for its role in suppressing HCC metastasis (Zou2022ST6GAL1).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ST6GAL1 stabilizes intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) through sialylation, enhancing its stability and suppressing metastasis. This interaction is confirmed by immunoprecipitation and cycloheximide treatment experiments, which show prolonged ICAM-1 half-life in ST6GAL1-overexpressing cells (Zhou2019&lt; p&gt; The).

ST6GAL1 also forms heteromeric complexes with B4GALT1 in the Golgi membranes. These interactions are mediated by highly charged surface domains and are essential for the catalytic activity of both enzymes. The assembly of these complexes involves lateral interactions, which are crucial for glycan synthesis (KhoderAgha2019Assembly). The interaction surfaces on ST6GAL1 and B4GALT1 are distinct, with specific residues playing key roles in these interactions (KhoderAgha2019Assembly).
