# SEC31B

## Overview
SEC31B is a gene that encodes the protein SEC31 homolog B, a component of the COPII coat complex involved in vesicular transport. This protein is integral to the formation of transport vesicles at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating the movement of proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, a key step in the secretory pathway. As a structural protein, SEC31 homolog B plays a critical role in the assembly of the COPII coat, which is necessary for cargo selection and vesicle budding. The proper functioning of SEC31B is essential for maintaining cellular protein trafficking and secretion, impacting various cellular processes and overall organismal health. Disruptions in the activity of SEC31B can lead to significant cellular dysfunctions and are associated with various diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Function
SEC31B is a crucial component of the COPII coat complex, which is essential for the formation of transport vesicles at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This protein plays a significant role in the transport of proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, a critical step in the secretory pathway. SEC31B is involved in the assembly of the COPII coat, which is necessary for selecting cargo proteins and facilitating vesicle budding. This process is vital for maintaining efficient cellular protein trafficking and secretion pathways, ensuring that proteins are correctly processed and delivered to their intended destinations within the cell.

In healthy human cells, SEC31B's activity is primarily localized to the ER, where it participates in the early stages of protein sorting and vesicle formation. By contributing to the structural integrity and function of the COPII coat, SEC31B helps regulate the flow of proteins through the secretory pathway, impacting various cellular functions and organismal outcomes. Proper functioning of SEC31B is essential for cellular homeostasis and the overall health of the organism, as disruptions in protein trafficking can lead to a range of cellular dysfunctions and diseases.
