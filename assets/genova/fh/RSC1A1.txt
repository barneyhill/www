# RSC1A1

## Overview
The RSC1A1 gene encodes the protein known as Regulator of Solute Carriers 1 (RS1), which plays a critical role in the regulation of glucose transport within cells. RS1 is a regulatory protein that influences the activity of solute carrier proteins, particularly the sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). It functions by modulating the exocytotic pathway of SGLT1-containing vesicles, thereby affecting glucose uptake. RS1's regulatory mechanisms are mediated through interactions with various proteins and are influenced by glucose concentrations, highlighting its role in cellular glucose homeostasis (Koepsell2020Glucose). Additionally, RSC1A1 is implicated in the regulation of other solute carriers, such as those involved in neurotransmitter transport, which is significant in the context of neurological conditions like cocaine addiction (Feng2022Machine).

## Function


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
The RSC1A1 protein, also known as RS1, is involved in the regulation of the SGLT1 transporter, particularly in the context of glucose transport. RS1 participates in a dynamin-dependent exocytotic pathway, where it decelerates the release of SGLT1-containing vesicles from the Golgi apparatus. This regulation is influenced by protein kinases, as RS1 contains multiple consensus sequences for these kinases (Koepsell2020Glucose). RS1 interacts with ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in a glucose-dependent manner. At low glucose concentrations, RS1 binds to ODC, inhibiting its activity and reducing putrescine levels, which slows the budding of SGLT1-containing vesicles. High glucose concentrations lead to a conformational change in ODC, dissociating RS1 and increasing putrescine levels, thereby enhancing vesicle budding (Koepsell2020Glucose).

In the context of cocaine addiction, RSC1A1 is part of the protein-protein interaction networks involving the norepinephrine transporter (NET). It is described as a regulatory solute carrier protein that mediates transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the SLC5A1 gene and is involved in the transcriptional regulation of SLC22A2 (Feng2022Machine). These interactions are crucial for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of cocaine addiction and developing potential therapeutic interventions (Feng2022Machine).
