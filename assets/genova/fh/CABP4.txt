# CABP4

## Overview
CABP4 is a gene that encodes the protein calcium binding protein 4 (CaBP4), which is a neuronal calcium-binding protein primarily involved in the function of photoreceptor synapses in the retina. CaBP4 plays a crucial role in modulating L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, specifically Ca v 1.3 and Ca v 1.4, which are essential for synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and bipolar cells (Lee2007Phosphorylation; Haeseleer2008Interaction). As a calcium-binding protein, CaBP4 influences the activation and inactivation properties of these channels by competing with calmodulin for binding (Lee2007Phosphorylation). The protein's function is further regulated by phosphorylation through protein kinase C, which enhances its interaction with Ca v 1.4 channels, particularly under light-adapted conditions (Lee2007Phosphorylation). Mutations in the CABP4 gene are linked to various retinal disorders, underscoring its importance in visual signal transduction and synaptic integrity (Zeitz2015Congenital; Khan2012Clinical).

## Function
CaBP4 (calcium binding protein 4) is a neuronal calcium-binding protein that plays a critical role in the function of photoreceptor synapses in the retina. It is involved in the regulation of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, specifically Ca v 1.3 and Ca v 1.4, which are essential for normal synaptic transmission between photoreceptors and bipolar cells (Lee2007Phosphorylation; Haeseleer2008Interaction). CaBP4 modulates these channels by competing with calmodulin for binding, affecting their activation and inactivation properties (Lee2007Phosphorylation).

Phosphorylation of CaBP4 by protein kinase C (PKC) at serine 37 enhances its interaction with Ca v 1.4 channels and modulates Ca v 1.3 inactivation, which is crucial for maintaining calcium currents and neurotransmitter release in response to light (Lee2007Phosphorylation). This phosphorylation is more prominent in light-adapted conditions, indicating its role in light-dependent signal transduction (Lee2007Phosphorylation).

CaBP4 is localized in the photoreceptor synaptic terminal and is necessary for normal neurotransmission to bipolar cells. Mice lacking CaBP4 exhibit synaptic defects and impaired cone and rod synaptic function, highlighting its importance in visual transmission (Lee2007Phosphorylation; Haeseleer2008Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CABP4 gene are associated with several retinal disorders, primarily affecting synaptic transmission in photoreceptors. One of the main conditions linked to CABP4 mutations is congenital cone-rod synaptic disorder, which is characterized by symptoms such as reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, and photophobia, but notably not night blindness (Khan2012Clinical; Littink2009A). This disorder results from impaired synaptic function between photoreceptors and bipolar cells, leading to abnormal electroretinography (ERG) findings, such as electronegative waveforms and decreased cone responses (Smirnov2018Retinal; Khan2012Clinical).

CABP4 mutations have also been implicated in autosomal recessive incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (icCSNB), where the gene's role in calcium channel regulation is disrupted, affecting glutamate release from photoreceptors (Zeitz2015Congenital). Additionally, a specific missense mutation in CABP4 has been linked to autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, although this does not appear to affect visual function (Shi2024CABP4).

The clinical presentation of CABP4-related disorders can vary, with some patients exhibiting unique retinal features such as fine radial folds and dark foveal dots, as observed in a French patient with compound heterozygous mutations (Smirnov2018Retinal).

## Interactions
CaBP4 (calcium binding protein 4) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in photoreceptor function. One significant interaction is with the synaptic photoreceptor protein Unc119. This interaction has been characterized using various biochemical methods, including affinity chromatography, yeast two-hybrid systems, coimmunoprecipitation, and gel overlay assays. The interaction is Ca2+-sensitive, as demonstrated by experiments showing that CaBP4 is partially eluted from Unc119 upon the addition of CaCl2, indicating a stronger interaction in the absence of calcium ions (Haeseleer2008Interaction).

CaBP4 also interacts with L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, specifically the Ca v 1.3 and Ca v 1.4 channels. It competes with calmodulin for binding to these channels, influencing their functional properties. Phosphorylation of CaBP4 by protein kinase C at serine 37 modulates its interaction with these channels, enhancing its binding to Ca v 1.4 while weakening its interaction with Ca v 1.3. This phosphorylation is light-dependent and plays a role in adjusting calcium signals in response to light intensity, affecting neurotransmitter release in photoreceptors (Lee2007Phosphorylation).

These interactions highlight CaBP4's role in modulating synaptic transmission and maintaining photoreceptor synapse integrity.
