# GPX2

## Overview
The GPX2 gene encodes the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 2, a member of the glutathione peroxidase family, which is characterized by its role in reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to protect cells from oxidative damage. This enzyme is a selenoprotein, incorporating a selenocysteine residue at its active site, which is crucial for its catalytic function (Guo2015Characterization). Glutathione peroxidase 2 is predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a vital role in maintaining the redox balance and protecting epithelial cells from oxidative stress (Kelner2000Structural). The enzyme's activity is regulated by several signaling pathways, including the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, which is important for intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation (Kipp2007Activation). GPX2's involvement in various protein-protein interactions and its regulation by microRNAs highlight its complex role in cellular processes, particularly in cancer-related pathways (Wang2022Glutathione; Esworthy2023Using). Alterations in GPX2 expression have been linked to the progression and prognosis of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Xu2023Glutathione; Ahmed2022Glutathione).

## Structure
The molecular structure of glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2) includes several key features typical of the glutathione peroxidase family. The primary structure of GPX2 contains a selenocysteine residue at the active site, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Guo2015Characterization). The secondary structure of GPX2 is characterized by a thioredoxin fold, which includes alpha-helices and beta-strands (Guo2015Characterization). This fold is common among the glutathione peroxidase family and contributes to the enzyme's stability and function.

The tertiary structure of GPX2 forms a compact, globular shape, with the catalytic tetrad located in a surface pocket. This arrangement allows for flexible substrate access, which is essential for its role in reducing hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides (Guo2015Characterization). The quaternary structure of the recombinant seleno-hGPx2 mutant differs from the native form, existing as a monomer rather than a tetramer, which may influence its catalytic activity (Guo2015Characterization).

GPX2 is a selenoprotein, and its expression involves the incorporation of selenocysteine in response to an opal (UGA) codon, a process that poses challenges in prokaryotic expression systems (Guo2015Characterization). The enzyme's activity and stability are affected by temperature and pH, with optimal activity observed at 25°C and pH 7.4 (Guo2015Characterization).

## Function
The human gene GPX2 encodes the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 2, which plays a critical role in maintaining cellular redox balance by reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides using glutathione as a substrate. This enzyme is primarily active in the gastrointestinal tract, where it protects epithelial cells from oxidative damage caused by toxic dietary lipid hydroperoxides (Kelner2000Structural). GPX2 is particularly important in the proliferative zones of the intestinal epithelium, where it supports the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation, crucial for the renewal and maintenance of the intestinal lining (Kipp2007Activation).

GPX2 is regulated by the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of intestinal cells. The GPX2 promoter contains multiple b-catenin/TCF binding sites, indicating its regulation by Wnt signals (Kipp2007Activation). In healthy tissues, GPX2 helps maintain intestinal homeostasis and supports the normal self-renewing processes of the gastrointestinal epithelium. It also plays a role in the adaptive response to reduce inflammatory processes, thereby protecting against the initiation of cancer development (Kipp2007Activation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GPX2 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), high GPX2 expression is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival, as it contributes to an immunologically cold tumor microenvironment that hinders the effectiveness of immune therapies (Ahmed2022Glutathione). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in cases with KRAS mutations, GPX2 is significantly upregulated, promoting malignant progression and resistance to cisplatin treatment (Wang2022Glutathione). GPX2 overexpression in gastric cancer is linked to tumor metastasis and poor prognosis, with its knockdown shown to suppress tumor growth and metastasis by affecting the kynurenine metabolism pathway (Xu2023Glutathione).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), GPX2 is a downstream target of NRF2, and its high expression is associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance (Jin2024NRF2). GPX2 also plays a role in maintaining redox balance and is involved in the regulation of immune cell infiltration in various cancers, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer (Esworthy2023Using). These findings suggest that GPX2 is a significant factor in cancer progression and resistance to treatment, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
Glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2) participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, which are significant for its role in cellular processes. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), GPX2 is involved in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that includes associations with genes in the chemokine-signaling pathway, such as CXCR1, CXCR2, and XCR1 (Guo2021The). In KRAS-driven lung cancer, GPX2 interacts with matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis. This interaction is significant for the malignant progression of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) (Wang2022Glutathione).

GPX2 is also targeted by microRNA miR-325-3p, which can inhibit its effects, suggesting a regulatory interaction at the nucleic acid level. The knockdown of MMP1 or overexpression of miR-325-3p can partially reverse the effects of GPX2, indicating the importance of these interactions in the context of KRAS-driven lung cancer (Wang2022Glutathione). Additionally, a potential protein-protein interaction between GPX2 and PCBP2 has been identified, which may stabilize GPX2, marking the first reported interaction of this kind for GPX2 (Esworthy2023Using). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory networks in which GPX2 is involved, influencing various cancer-related pathways.
