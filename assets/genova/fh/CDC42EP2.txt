# CDC42EP2

## Overview
CDC42EP2, also known as Borg1, is a gene that encodes the CDC42 effector protein 2, a member of the CDC42 effector protein family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cell shape, motility, and polarity. CDC42 effector protein 2 interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways. It is characterized by several domains, including a CRIB domain for binding to CDC42, and is involved in the formation of filamentous structures that co-localize with actin fibers and septin filaments. The protein is also a substrate for kinases such as ERK2, which suggests that phosphorylation may regulate its function. CDC42EP2 has been implicated in various physiological processes, including muscle development and neuronal cytoskeleton regulation, and is associated with pathological conditions such as cancer, where it may contribute to tumor progression and metastasis (Farrugia2016The; Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

## Structure
CDC42EP2, also known as Borg1, is a member of the CDC42 effector protein family characterized by several distinct domains. The protein contains a highly homologous N-terminal CRIB (Cdc42/Rac interactive binding) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with active Cdc42 and TC10, but not Rac1 (Farrugia2016The). Following the CRIB motif, CDC42EP2 features a Borg Homology (BH) 1 domain, unique to Borg proteins, although the specific roles of the BH1 and BH2 domains remain undefined (Farrugia2016The). The central region of CDC42EP2 includes a proline-rich domain, and the C-terminal part contains the BH3 domain, which is necessary for binding to septins and is common to all Borg proteins (Farrugia2016The).

CDC42EP2 is involved in the formation of filamentous structures that co-localize with actin fibers and septin filaments, indicating a functional relationship with the cytoskeleton (Farrugia2016The). The protein is also a substrate of ERK2, suggesting that phosphorylation may play a role in its regulation and function (Farrugia2016The). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
CDC42EP2, also known as Borg1, is a member of the CDC42 effector protein family involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. It interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, influencing cell shape, motility, and polarity. CDC42EP2 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in processes like cell signaling and morphogenesis.

CDC42EP2 is primarily involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and signaling, playing a crucial role in cell shape regulation, directed migration, and differentiation. It interacts with the Rho GTPase Cdc42, which is essential for various cellular functions, including cytokinesis and cell polarity (Farrugia2016The). CDC42EP2 binds to septins, particularly SEPT2/6/7, and is involved in cell shape regulation and myogenesis. It is also a substrate for atypical MAP kinases ERK3 and MK5, which are implicated in neuronal cytoskeleton regulation and dendritic spine formation (Farrugia2016The).

In muscle development, CDC42EP2 suppresses myogenic differentiation by decreasing the expression of muscle regulatory factors, indicating its role in controlling muscle development and differentiation (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). Additionally, CDC42EP2 is involved in actin filament assembly and cell shape control, particularly in response to mechanical stimuli such as cyclic tensile stress (Wang2011Early).

## Clinical Significance
CDC42EP2 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, CDC42EP2 is overexpressed, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). It is also involved in a fusion with POLA2 in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and bladder cancer, indicating its involvement in oncogenic processes (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). The protein's role in cancer is linked to its impact on cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in the re-localization of septins from actin stress fibers to microtubules, which is crucial for cancer metastasis (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

CDC42EP2's interactions with septins and actin filaments are significant in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In detached tumor cells, CDC42EP2 localizes with septins to microtubules at the base of microtentacles, structures that facilitate metastasis (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). Disruption of the septin cytoskeleton, which involves CDC42EP2, reduces microtentacle formation, highlighting its role in metastatic processes (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound). Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which CDC42EP2 contributes to these diseases remain to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research to understand its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CDC42EP2, also known as Borg1, is a member of the CDC42 effector protein family that interacts with the small GTPase CDC42, playing a significant role in actin cytoskeleton organization. CDC42EP2 interacts with CDC42 through its CRIB domain, which is crucial for its function in promoting actin and septin filament formation. A CRIB mutant of CDC42EP2 was unable to cause changes in actin organization, highlighting the importance of CDC42 binding (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

CDC42EP2 also binds directly to septins, specifically SEPT2, SEPT6, and SEPT7, which are important for cytoskeletal dynamics and are implicated in processes such as cancer metastasis. In detached tumor cells, CDC42EP2 relocalizes with septins to the membrane, co-localizing with microtubules at the base of microtentacles, structures that aid in metastasis (Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by kinases like ERK3, regulate the function of CDC42EP2. ERK3 phosphorylates CDC42EP2, which is involved in septin-dependent dendritic spine formation, indicating that its role in cytoskeletal dynamics is mediated through its phosphorylation status (Farrugia2016The; Tomasso2024Cdc42EP3bound).
