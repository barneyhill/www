# KATNAL2

## Overview
KATNAL2 is a gene that encodes the katanin catalytic subunit A1 like 2 protein, which is a member of the AAA (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) protein family. This protein is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, playing a critical role in processes such as cell division, spermatogenesis, and ciliogenesis. The KATNAL2 protein is characterized by a tripartite domain structure, including an N-terminal LisH domain, a CTLH domain, and a C-terminal AAA catalytic domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization to microtubule structures (Joachimiak2020The; Ververis2015A). Mutations in the KATNAL2 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, highlighting its importance in normal brain development and function (Zheng2022Knockout; Hız2022The).

## Structure
The KATNAL2 protein is characterized by a tripartite domain organization, including an N-terminal LisH (Lis1-homology) domain, a less conserved linker region, and a C-terminal AAA catalytic domain. The LisH domain is crucial for subcellular localization, dimerization, and stability, and is located between residues R25 and L57. The CTLH domain follows from D58 to K92, and the AAA catalytic domain, which shares high sequence homology with the canonical katanin p60, spans from V213 to V539 (Joachimiak2020The).

KATNAL2 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with molecular masses ranging from 41.8 to 61.1 kDa. These isoforms include Katnal2-L1, Katnal2-L2, Katnal2-L3, Katnal2-S1, and Katnal2-S2, which exhibit sequence variations near their N-terminus. Some isoforms contain a LisH motif, important for self-association and protein-protein interactions (Ververis2015A; Dunleavy2017Kataninlike).

The protein localizes to microtubules, centrioles, and the mitotic spindle, and is involved in various microtubule-based processes. It interacts with nucleotide-binding proteins Nubp1 and Nubp2, suggesting an oligomeric functional form similar to p60 katanin (Joachimiak2020The; Ververis2015A).

## Function
The KATNAL2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in various microtubule (MT)-based processes in mammalian cells. It is involved in regulating centriole numbers, MT dynamics, cytokinesis, and cell cycle progression. In healthy cells, KATNAL2 helps maintain normal centriole numbers and ensures accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Silencing of KATNAL2 leads to an increase in centriole numbers, multipolar spindles, and defects in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis, indicating its role in maintaining normal cell division and mitotic spindle formation (Ververis2015A).

KATNAL2 is also essential for normal spermatogenesis in humans, where it is expressed in the pericentriolar material and mitochondrial sheaths of spermatozoa. Mutations in KATNAL2 can lead to male infertility characterized by oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia, which includes decreased sperm count, poor motility, and severe morphological abnormalities (Wei2021Biallelic).

In addition to its role in cell division and spermatogenesis, KATNAL2 is involved in ciliogenesis. Both silencing and overexpression of KATNAL2 result in a reduced number of ciliated cells, suggesting that balanced KATNAL2 activity is crucial for ciliogenesis (Ververis2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KATNAL2 gene have been associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). Studies have identified various mutations in KATNAL2, such as missense and loss-of-function mutations, in patients with ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (Zheng2022Knockout). These mutations can lead to altered microtubule dynamics, affecting cellular processes crucial for brain development and function (Hız2022The).

In zebrafish models, knockout of the katnal2 gene results in autism-like behaviors, developmental delays, and other ASD-related symptoms, such as impaired social behaviors and increased anxiety (Zheng2022Knockout). Similarly, in mice, an ASD-associated mutation in Katnal2 disrupts ependymal ciliary motion, leading to hydrocephalus and ASD-related behavioral deficits (Qiu2023ASD).

In humans, a novel missense mutation in KATNAL2 has been linked to epilepsy, autistic symptoms, and intellectual disability, with proteomic analysis revealing altered interactions with microtubule-related proteins (Hız2022The). These findings suggest that KATNAL2 mutations can disrupt normal neuronal connectivity and brain development, contributing to the clinical manifestations observed in affected individuals.

## Interactions
KATNAL2 is known to participate in various protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for its role in microtubule-based processes. It interacts with nucleotide-binding proteins Nubp1 and Nubp2, which are involved in centriole duplication and ciliogenesis. These interactions have been confirmed through in vivo pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that KATNAL2 can self-interact and also bind to Nubp1 and Nubp2 (Ververis2015A).

KATNAL2 also interacts with δ-tubulin (TUBD1) and ε-tubulin (TUBE1), particularly in the manchette and basal body regions of haploid male germ cells. These interactions suggest a role in regulating microtubule structures essential for sperm development (Dunleavy2017Kataninlike).

In addition, KATNAL2 interacts with KATNB1, a regulatory protein of katanin severing proteins, indicating its involvement in microtubule dynamics during spermiogenesis. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assays (Dunleavy2017Kataninlike).

The protein's interactions are mediated by domains such as the LisH-CTLH domain, which is important for dimerization and stability, although its exact mechanism of action remains to be fully elucidated (Joachimiak2020The).
