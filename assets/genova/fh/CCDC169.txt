# CCDC169

## Overview
The CCDC169 gene encodes the protein coiled-coil domain containing 169, which is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil motifs. These motifs are structural features that facilitate protein-protein interactions, suggesting that CCDC169 may play a role in cellular processes that require such interactions. While the specific biological functions of the CCDC169 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its structural properties imply potential involvement in the organization of cellular architecture or signaling pathways. Further research is needed to determine its precise role and any implications in human health and disease.
