# RBM7

## Overview
RBM7 (RNA binding motif protein 7) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a key component of the Nuclear Exosome Targeting (NEXT) complex. This protein is characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM) that facilitates its role in RNA processing and degradation, particularly in the regulation of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs) (Hrossova2015RBM7). The RBM7 protein is involved in the cellular response to stress, as it is phosphorylated by the p38 MAPK/MK2 pathway, which modulates its RNA-binding capacity (Tiedje2014p38MAPKMK2mediated). Additionally, RBM7 interacts with other proteins within the NEXT complex, such as ZCCHC8, to form a stable unit essential for RNA metabolism (Falk2016Structure). Clinically, RBM7 has been implicated in cancer biology, with its expression levels influencing tumor progression and patient prognosis, particularly in breast cancer (Huang2024RBM7; Xi2020Oncogenic). This dual role in both tumor suppression and promotion underscores its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Structure
The RBM7 protein is characterized by an RNA recognition motif (RRM) that is highly conserved among vertebrates. This motif adopts a compact fold with a β1-α1-β2-β3-α2-β4 topology, typical of the RRM family, and includes two α-helices packed along a face of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Hrossova2015RBM7). The α-helix 2 of the RBM7 RRM is shorter due to a conserved proline at position 64, which disrupts the secondary structure and alters the arrangement of surrounding residues (Hrossova2015RBM7). The RRM contains conserved RNP1 and RNP2 sequences, crucial for RNA binding, located on the β3 and β1 strands, respectively (Hrossova2015RBM7).

RBM7 also features a C-terminal serine-rich domain that undergoes phosphorylation by the p38 MAPK pathway, particularly in response to genotoxic stress and viral infections like SARS-CoV-2 (Sobeh2022Cterminal). This phosphorylation affects its interaction with RNA and its function in the nuclear exosome targeting complex (NEXT) (Sobeh2022Cterminal). The protein's interaction with ZCCHC8 within the NEXT complex involves conserved hydrophobic contacts, forming a stable architectural unit (Falk2016Structure). The RBM7-ZCCHC8 interaction is characterized by a dissociation constant of 28 nM, indicating a strong binding affinity (Falk2016Structure).

## Function
RBM7 (RNA binding motif protein 7) is a crucial component of the Nuclear Exosome Targeting (NEXT) complex, which plays a significant role in RNA processing and degradation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs) by binding to uridine-rich sequences through its RNA recognition motif (RRM) (Hrossova2015RBM7). RBM7's interaction with these RNA sequences is essential for the recruitment of the NEXT complex to snRNAs, facilitating their processing and degradation (Hrossova2015RBM7).

RBM7 is also implicated in the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription. It interacts with the 7SK ribonucleoprotein complex, influencing the release of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) during genotoxic stress, which aids in the transition of RNA polymerase II from a paused to an elongation state (Sobeh2022Cterminal). Additionally, RBM7 is phosphorylated by the p38 MAPK/MK2 pathway, which modulates its RNA-binding capacity and is involved in the cellular response to stress (Tiedje2014p38MAPKMK2mediated). This phosphorylation does not affect its interaction with other NEXT components but is crucial for its function in RNA stability and degradation (Tiedje2014p38MAPKMK2mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RBM7 gene have significant implications in breast cancer. RBM7 is involved in RNA metabolism and splicing regulation, and its expression levels are crucial in determining cancer progression and patient prognosis. In breast cancer, decreased expression of RBM7 is associated with increased metastatic potential, particularly to the lungs, and is linked to poorer disease-free survival. This is due to RBM7's role in regulating the splicing of MFGE8, where its deficiency leads to a splicing switch that promotes cancer cell migration and invasion. RBM7 also negatively regulates the NF-κB pathway, and its loss can enhance angiogenesis and tumor aggressiveness (Huang2024RBM7).

Conversely, RBM7 has been shown to have oncogenic properties by promoting breast cancer cell proliferation through the stabilization of CDK1 mRNA. Overexpression of RBM7 increases CDK1 levels, accelerating cell cycle progression and tumor growth. This suggests that RBM7's interaction with CDK1 mRNA is a critical factor in breast cancer progression, highlighting its dual role in both tumor suppression and promotion depending on the context (Xi2020Oncogenic). These findings underscore the complex role of RBM7 in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RBM7 is a component of the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) complex, which includes ZCCHC8 and hMTR4. This complex is involved in directing non-coding RNAs for degradation by the RNA exosome. RBM7 interacts with ZCCHC8 through a proline-rich segment, forming a stable complex that is crucial for RNA processing and degradation (Falk2016Structure). The RNA recognition motif (RRM) of RBM7 shows a preference for U-rich sequences, which are prevalent near snRNA genes, facilitating its role in targeting 3′-end extended forms of snRNAs (Hrossova2015RBM7).

RBM7's interactions are regulated by phosphorylation, particularly at serine residues S136 and S204, which are mediated by the p38 MAPK/MK2 signaling pathway. This phosphorylation reduces RBM7's RNA-binding capacity and facilitates its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, linking it to stress responses and the DNA damage response (Tiedje2014p38MAPKMK2mediated; Blasius2014A). The phosphorylation of RBM7 also affects its ability to bind promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), thereby modulating RNA stability and processing under stress conditions (Tiedje2014p38MAPKMK2mediated).

RBM7 can also interact with splicing factors such as SAP145, suggesting a potential cross-talk between the NEXT complex and the spliceosomal machinery (Falk2016Structure). These interactions highlight RBM7's multifaceted role in RNA metabolism and cellular stress responses.
