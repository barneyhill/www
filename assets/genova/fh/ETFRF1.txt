# ETFRF1

## Overview
ETFRF1, or electron transfer flavoprotein regulatory factor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of mitochondrial electron transport and energy metabolism. The protein, categorized as a regulatory factor, plays a pivotal role in modulating the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex, which is crucial for transferring electrons derived from fatty acid and amino acid catabolism to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This regulation is essential for ATP production and maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. ETFRF1 is known to negatively regulate the ETF complex by facilitating the removal of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) from the ETF holoenzyme, thereby influencing the balance of β-oxidation and energy production. The gene's function is conserved across species, as demonstrated by its homolog in Drosophila, known as Orsai, which affects lipid metabolism and growth control (FernandezAcosta2022orsai; Floyd2016Mitochondrial).

## Structure


## Function
ETFRF1, also known as electron transfer flavoprotein regulatory factor 1, plays a crucial role in mitochondrial function, particularly in the regulation of electron transport and energy metabolism. It is involved in the modulation of the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) complex, which is essential for transferring electrons from fatty acid and amino acid catabolism to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This process is vital for ATP production and maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (FernandezAcosta2022orsai; Floyd2016Mitochondrial).

ETFRF1 is suggested to negatively regulate the ETF complex by promoting the removal of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) from the ETF holoenzyme. This regulation is crucial for maintaining the balance of β-oxidation and energy production, which is essential for normal development and growth (FernandezAcosta2022orsai; Floyd2016Mitochondrial). The interaction between ETF and ETFRF1 may serve several functions, including the replacement of damaged FAD, destabilization of ETF for proteolysis, or prevention of reactive oxygen species generation (Floyd2016Mitochondrial).

In Drosophila, the homolog of ETFRF1, known as Orsai, has been shown to affect lipid metabolism and growth control, suggesting a conserved role across species. The expression of human ETFRF1 can rescue the loss of function phenotypes in Drosophila, indicating similar biochemical functions in humans (FernandezAcosta2022orsai).

## Interactions
ETFRF1, also known as LYRM5, is involved in interactions with the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF), which consists of ETFA and ETFB. These interactions form a stable complex, as demonstrated by size-exclusion chromatography and validated through immunoprecipitation and blue native PAGE analysis. The LYRM5-ETF complex notably lacks the characteristic yellow color of flavoproteins, indicating that LYRM5 may prevent the incorporation of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) into ETF or facilitate its removal. This interaction suggests a role for LYRM5 in modulating ETF function, potentially indicating a non-electron transferring role for ETF (Floyd2016Mitochondrial).

In the context of mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (ACPM) interactions, ETFA and ETFB, which are direct partners of LYRM5, were identified as interactors of ACPM. Although LYRM5 itself was not confirmed as a direct interactor due to peptide criteria, the presence of its associated proteins ETFA and ETFB suggests a potential indirect interaction pathway involving LYRM5 (Majmudar20194′Phosphopantetheine).

These interactions highlight the regulatory role of ETFRF1 in mitochondrial function, particularly in relation to electron transfer processes and the modulation of ETF activity.
