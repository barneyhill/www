# ATG101

## Overview
ATG101 is a gene that encodes the autophagy-related protein 101, a pivotal component in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular degradation process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. The ATG101 protein is characterized by its single HORMA domain, which facilitates its interaction with ATG13 within the ULK1 complex, a critical initiator of autophagy (Kim2018The; Qi2015Structure). This protein is integral to the stability and function of the autophagy initiation complex, interacting with key proteins such as ULK1, ATG13, and FIP200 to promote autophagosome formation (Mercer2009A; Hosokawa2009Atg101). ATG101's role extends to the cytoplasm, particularly at the phagophore assembly site, where it aids in recruiting other autophagy-specific proteins, thus playing a crucial role in cellular responses to nutrient deprivation (Kim2018The; Du2017ATG101). Additionally, ATG101 has clinical significance, with its expression levels being linked to various cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and survival outcomes (Wang2022ATG101related; Zhang2022Comprehensive).

## Structure
The ATG101 protein is characterized by a single HORMA domain, which is crucial for its interaction with ATG13 within the ULK1 complex, a key component in autophagy initiation (Kim2018The; Qi2015Structure). The HORMA domain of ATG101 is similar to the mitotic spindle checkpoint protein Mad2, capable of adopting open and closed conformations (Qi2015Structure). In humans, ATG101 is locked in the open conformation due to the length of its b5-aC linker (Qi2015Structure).

The protein's structure includes a WF finger motif, consisting of conserved tryptophan and phenylalanine residues, which is important for protein-protein interactions (Kim2018The; Qi2015Structure). The C-terminal region of ATG101 is flexible, adopting different conformations such as β-strands, α-helices, or random coils, depending on its interaction state (Kim2018The). This region is involved in bridging the ULK1 and PtdIns3K complexes, essential for autophagosome formation (Kim2018The).

ATG101 forms a heterodimer with ATG13, stabilizing the latter's HORMA domain and facilitating the recruitment of downstream autophagy-related proteins (Kim2018The; Qi2015Structure). The interaction between ATG101 and ATG13 is stabilized by a conserved salt bridge and other hydrophobic interactions (Qi2015Structure).

## Function
ATG101 is a critical component of the autophagy initiation complex in human cells, playing a significant role in the formation of autophagosomes. It interacts with ULK1, ATG13, and FIP200, forming a stable complex essential for autophagy regulation. This interaction is mediated by ATG13, and ATG101 is crucial for the stability and basal phosphorylation of both ATG13 and ULK1, which are necessary for autophagosome formation and nutrient signaling (Mercer2009A; Hosokawa2009Atg101).

ATG101 stabilizes ATG13 by preventing its proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining its expression levels and function within the autophagy pathway. This stabilization is independent of nutrient conditions, indicating a consistent role in autophagy (Mercer2009A). The C-terminal region of ATG101 is particularly important for bridging the ULK1 complex with the PtdIns3K complex, which is crucial for autophagosome formation (Kim2018The).

ATG101 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at the phagophore assembly site, where it contributes to the recruitment of other autophagy-specific proteins. Its role is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, especially under conditions of nutrient deprivation (Kim2018The; Du2017ATG101).

## Clinical Significance
ATG101 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), high ATG101 expression is associated with poor prognosis and lower overall survival rates (Zhang2022Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also linked to immune checkpoint genes and tumor mutation burden (TMB) in several cancers, suggesting its role in tumor immunity (Zhang2022Comprehensive). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ATG101 is identified as a risk factor for survival, with high expression correlating with worse overall survival and disease-specific survival (Wang2022ATG101related). The ATG101-related signature (ATS) in HCC is associated with drug resistance and an inflamed tumor microenvironment, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2022ATG101related).

ATG101's role in autophagy is crucial, and its interactions with other autophagy-related proteins are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in these interactions, such as those involving the C-terminal region of ATG101, can affect autophagy initiation, potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Kim2018The).

## Interactions
ATG101 is a crucial component of the ULK1 complex, which is essential for the initiation of autophagy. It interacts directly with ATG13, forming a stable complex that is vital for the stability and function of ATG13. This interaction is mediated by the HORMA domain of ATG101, which binds to the HORMA domain of ATG13 (Kim2018The; Noda2016Atg101:). ATG101 also interacts with the proline-serine (PS) domain of ULK1, contributing to the formation of the ULK1 complex, which includes ULK1, ATG13, and FIP200 (Mercer2009A; Hosokawa2009Atg101).

The C-terminal region of ATG101 is important for its interaction with the PtdIns3K complex, which includes components such as ATG14, UVRAG, BECN1, and PIK3C3. This interaction is crucial for autophagy initiation and is enhanced by the presence of ATG14 (Kim2018The). ATG101 also has a WF finger region that is involved in recruiting downstream factors like WIPI1 and ZFYVE1/DFCP1, although it does not interact with the PtdIns3K complex (Kim2018The; Noda2016Atg101:). These interactions highlight ATG101's role in stabilizing and activating the ULK1 complex, facilitating autophagic processes.
