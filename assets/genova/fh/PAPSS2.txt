# PAPSS2

## Overview
PAPSS2, or 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 2, is a gene that encodes a bifunctional enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), a critical sulfate donor in various biological sulfation reactions. The enzyme, categorized as a synthase, consists of two main domains: an ATP sulfurylase domain and an APS kinase domain, which facilitate the conversion of ATP and sulfate into PAPS. This process is essential for the sulfation of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, impacting cellular signaling, detoxification, and structural integrity. PAPSS2 is particularly significant in the sulfation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), thereby regulating androgen levels in the body. Mutations in the PAPSS2 gene are linked to skeletal disorders and conditions related to androgen metabolism, such as autosomal recessive brachyolmia and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Noordam2009InactivatingPAPSS2Mutations; Mueller2018Human; Brylski2022DiseaseRelated).

## Structure
PAPSS2 is a bifunctional enzyme composed of two main domains: an ATP sulfurylase domain and an APS kinase domain (Brylski2019Melting). The APS kinase domain is particularly significant as it is the primary interaction site for the sulfotransferase SULT2A1, which is crucial for DHEA sulfation (Mueller2018Human). The molecular structure of PAPSS2 involves independently folding domains, which contribute to its complex folding properties and stability (Brylski2019Melting). 

PAPSS2 is described as a naturally fragile protein, with its stability being enhanced by binding with certain nucleotide ligands (Brylski2019Melting). The protein can form stable enzyme-substrate complexes, and its folding behavior is influenced by the concentration of substrates like adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (APS), which can stabilize different domains of the protein (Brylski2019Melting). 

Mutations in the APS kinase domain can lead to destabilization and aggregation, affecting the enzyme's function. Specific mutations such as G78R, T48R, C43Y, and L76Q are associated with various disease phenotypes, impacting the stability and aggregation of the protein in cells (Brylski2022DiseaseRelated). The protein's quaternary structure is dimeric, which is typical for PAPS synthases (Brylski2019Melting).

## Function
PAPSS2 (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS), a universal sulfate donor essential for various sulfation reactions in the body. These reactions are vital for the modification of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, impacting cellular signaling, detoxification, and structural integrity (Stelzer2007Expression). PAPSS2 is particularly important in the sulfation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a process that limits the conversion of DHEA to active androgens, thereby regulating androgen levels in the body (Noordam2009InactivatingPAPSS2Mutations; Oostdijk2015PAPSS2).

In healthy human cells, PAPSS2 is active in the cytoplasm and is involved in the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which are crucial for maintaining the integrity and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This process is necessary for various biological functions, including cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (Li2023PAPSS2). PAPSS2 also plays a significant role in cartilage formation and skeletal development by facilitating the sulfation of proteoglycans, which is essential for chondrocyte growth and development (Stelzer2007Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAPSS2 gene are associated with several skeletal disorders and conditions related to androgen metabolism. One of the primary conditions linked to PAPSS2 mutations is autosomal recessive brachyolmia, characterized by short-trunk short stature, spinal deformities such as kyphosis and scoliosis, and advanced bone age (Iida2013Clinical; Miyake2012PAPSS2mutations). These mutations often result in loss of function, leading to a spectrum of skeletal dysplasia phenotypes, including spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD), Pakistani type, which features short stature, bowed limbs, and osteoarthritic changes (Iida2013Clinical; Miyake2012PAPSS2mutations).

PAPSS2 mutations also impact androgen metabolism, causing conditions such as premature pubarche and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) due to impaired DHEA sulfation. This results in hormonal imbalances, including elevated levels of androstenedione and testosterone (Noordam2009InactivatingPAPSS2Mutations; Oostdijk2015PAPSS2). The T48R mutation, in particular, is associated with PCOS-like symptoms due to its effect on steroid sulfation (Brylski2022DiseaseRelated).

In cancer research, PAPSS2 has been implicated in breast cancer cell migration and metastasis. The gene is a downstream target of the Snail protein, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhances cell migration, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Zhang2018Enhanced).

## Interactions
PAPSS2 interacts directly with the sulfotransferase enzyme SULT2A1, which is crucial for the sulfation of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This interaction is stronger than that between SULT2A1 and its ortholog PAPSS1, as demonstrated by proximity ligation assays and molecular docking studies. The interaction is characterized by SULT2A1 docking uniformly to the APS kinase domain of PAPSS2, indicating a specific protein-interaction interface. This interaction is driven by electrostatic forces and stabilizes the PAPSS2 protein, reducing fluctuations at the SULT2A1 interface (Mueller2018Human).

PAPSS2's interaction with SULT2A1 is significant in tissues where both PAPS synthases are present at similar levels and SULT2A1 is co-expressed with other sulfotransferases. The interaction is facilitated by amino acid exchanges unique to hominids, correlating with higher DHEAS/DHEA ratios in species like gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans (Mueller2018Human).

PAPSS2 is also involved in transient interactions with other proteins in the sulfation pathway, which may stabilize or activate it. These interactions are important for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of sulfation pathways and the role of transient protein-protein interactions in cellular environments (Brylski2019Melting).
