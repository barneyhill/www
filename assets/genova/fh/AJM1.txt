# AJM1

## Overview
The AJM1 gene encodes the apical junction component 1 homolog, a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion and epithelial integrity. This protein is categorized as a component of the apical junction complex, which is essential for the establishment and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity and barrier function. The AJM1 protein is involved in the formation of tight junctions, which are critical for the selective permeability of epithelial layers. Its function is vital for various physiological processes, including tissue homeostasis and the regulation of paracellular transport. Mutations or dysregulation of AJM1 can lead to compromised epithelial barriers and are implicated in several pathological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in disease contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).
