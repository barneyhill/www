# ZCCHC18

## Overview
ZCCHC18 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCHC-type containing 18 protein, which is characterized by the presence of CCHC-type zinc finger motifs. These motifs are typically involved in nucleic acid binding, suggesting a potential role in RNA processing or regulation. The protein encoded by ZCCHC18 is implicated in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. Research has indicated that ZCCHC18 may play a role in tumor immunity and cancer pathogenesis, as its expression levels are altered in several types of cancer, including thyroid carcinoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Yin2023Differential; Pal2018Identification). Additionally, ZCCHC18 has been associated with Paraneoplastic Neuronal Disorder, highlighting its potential oncogenic role and significance as a biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapy (AceitunoValenzuela2020Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
ZCCHC18 has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels. In thyroid carcinoma (THCA), ZCCHC18 expression is lower in patients compared to normal controls, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry. This gene shows potential diagnostic utility with an AUC value of 0.89, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing THCA from non-cancerous tissues. ZCCHC18 is positively correlated with immune cells such as B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and CD4+ T cells, suggesting a role in tumor immunity (Yin2023Differential).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), ZCCHC18 expression is significantly higher in non-stereotypic unmutated CLL compared to stereotypic unmutated CLL. This differential expression suggests that ZCCHC18 may contribute to the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of CLL, potentially influencing disease progression and response to treatment (Pal2018Identification).

ZCCHC18 is also associated with Paraneoplastic Neuronal Disorder (PND), a non-metastatic complication of cancer, where it appears to play an oncogenic role (AceitunoValenzuela2020Genomewide). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZCCHC18 in cancer and its potential as a biomarker for diagnosis and therapeutic targeting.
