# NDUFS7

## Overview
The NDUFS7 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S7, a critical component of mitochondrial complex I, which is the first enzyme in the electron transport chain. This protein is integral to the hydrophilic domain of complex I and plays a pivotal role in its assembly and function, particularly in the formation of the N2 (4Fe-4S) iron-sulfur cluster essential for electron transfer (Yin2023Structural; Triepels1999Leigh). As a part of the mitochondrial inner membrane, NDUFS7 is crucial for cellular energy metabolism, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, thereby contributing to ATP production (Triepels1999Leigh). Mutations in NDUFS7 can lead to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, associated with severe disorders such as Leigh syndrome, underscoring its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function and energy homeostasis (Lebon2007A).

## Structure
The NDUFS7 gene encodes a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, which is involved in the electron transport chain. The protein is part of the hydrophilic domain of complex I and plays a crucial role in its assembly and function (Yin2023Structural). The primary structure of NDUFS7 includes a sequence of amino acids that is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in complex I function (Triepels1999Leigh). 

Mutations in NDUFS7 can lead to structural changes that affect its function. For instance, a G364A transition results in a V122M amino acid substitution, potentially altering the protein's conformation or its incorporation into complex I (Triepels1999Leigh). Another mutation, R145H, affects the secondary structure due to the presence of a cyclic group in histidine, impacting the protein's stability (PagniezMammeri2012Mitochondrial).

The quaternary structure of NDUFS7 involves its interaction with other subunits within complex I, such as NDUFS1, NDUFS3, and NDUFS8, which are crucial for the early assembly stages of the complex (Mckenzie2010Assembly). These interactions are essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of complex I (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
The NDUFS7 gene encodes a subunit of complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is the first enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This complex is crucial for cellular energy production through oxidative phosphorylation, a process that generates ATP, the primary energy carrier in cells (Triepels1999Leigh). NDUFS7 is involved in the formation of the N2 (4Fe-4S) iron-sulfur cluster, which is essential for electron transfer within complex I (Triepels1999Leigh). The protein is active in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it plays a vital role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (Triepels1999Leigh).

In healthy human cells, NDUFS7 is part of the early assembly intermediates of complex I, contributing to the peripheral matrix arm of the complex, which contains the evolutionarily conserved hydrogenase module (Mckenzie2010Assembly). The proper function of NDUFS7 is crucial for maintaining the stability and catalytic activity of complex I, ensuring efficient ATP production and preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (Ugalde2004Differences). The gene is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with higher expression levels in tissues with high metabolic rates, such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and liver, indicating its importance in energy-demanding tissues (Triepels1999Leigh).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFS7 gene are clinically significant as they can lead to mitochondrial complex I deficiency, which is associated with Leigh syndrome, a severe neurological disorder. Leigh syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, and severe neurological impairments, often resulting in early death (Lebon2007A). The specific mutation identified in the NDUFS7 gene involves a homozygous C-G substitution that activates a cryptic exon, leading to a frame-shift and the production of a shortened protein. This mutation impairs the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, as evidenced by a marked decrease in fully assembled complex I in patient fibroblasts (Lebon2007A).

The mutation creates a strong donor splice site in the first intron of the NDUFS7 gene, which severely hampers the assembly of complex I, as shown by blue native gel electrophoresis (Lebon2007A). This impaired assembly results in a significant decrease in complex I activity, as observed in muscle homogenate, and an elevated CIV/CI activity ratio in affected individuals (Lebon2007A). The study highlights the crucial role of NDUFS7 in the biogenesis of complex I and its impact on mitochondrial function (Lebon2007A).

## Interactions
NDUFS7 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, involved in the assembly and function of this essential component of the electron transport chain. It is part of several assembly intermediates, interacting closely with other subunits such as NDUFS2, NDUFS3, and NDUFS8 to form early assembly intermediates like intermediate 2, which is part of the peripheral matrix arm containing the hydrogenase module (Mckenzie2010Assembly; Mimaki2012Understanding). NDUFS7 is also part of a 400 kDa complex, intermediate 4, which includes ND1 and forms part of the membrane arm of complex I (Mckenzie2010Assembly).

NDUFS7 undergoes posttranslational modification through the hydroxylation of an arginine residue by the NDUFAF5 hydroxylase complex, which is crucial for complex I assembly (Pei2021Human). The assembly factors Ndufaf3 and Ndufaf4 are involved in anchoring early intermediates containing NDUFS7 to the membrane, facilitating the integration of these subunits into larger complexes (Mimaki2012Understanding). Additionally, the Fe-S protein Ind1 is essential for the assembly of subcomplexes containing NDUFS7, suggesting a role in the delivery of Fe-S clusters to NDUFS7 (Mimaki2012Understanding).
