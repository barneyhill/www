# COL6A6

## Overview
The COL6A6 gene encodes the collagen type VI alpha 6 chain, a protein that is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix. This protein is involved in forming microfibrils that provide structural support and stability to various tissues. Unlike other collagen VI chains, the α6(VI) chain does not co-assemble with the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains, suggesting unique assembly pathways (Fitzgerald2008Three). The α6(VI) chain is characterized by its multiple von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its function in the extracellular matrix (Fitzgerald2008Three). It plays a significant role in tissue integrity and is implicated in processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and muscle fibrosis (Sabatelli2012Expression; Di2023Collagen). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with early-onset atopic dermatitis and its potential as a biomarker for various dermatological conditions (Heo2017Identification; Holm2023A).

## Structure
The COL6A6 gene encodes the collagen type VI alpha 6 chain, which is a component of the extracellular matrix. The protein structure includes a signal peptide, seven N-terminal von Willebrand factor A (VWA) domains, a 336-amino acid triple helical domain, and two C-terminal VWA domains (Fitzgerald2008Three). The triple helix is characterized by imperfections in the Gly-X-Y repeat motif, which is typical of collagen proteins (Fitzgerald2008Three). The α6(VI) chain has a predicted molecular mass of 245 kDa and is composed of 2262 amino acids (Fitzgerald2008Three).

The α6(VI) chain does not co-assemble with the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains, suggesting it may not form part of the typical collagen VI trimeric structure, indicating alternative assembly pathways or critical assembly regions outside the N7 to C2 domains (Fitzgerald2008Three). The α6(VI) chain is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including lung, kidney, and heart, but is notably absent from the liver (Fitzgerald2008Three). The presence of VWA domains is crucial for protein-protein interactions, contributing to the structural stability and function of the protein in the extracellular matrix (Fitzgerald2008Three).

## Function
The COL6A6 gene encodes the collagen type VI alpha 6 chain, a component of the extracellular matrix involved in forming microfibrils that provide structural support and stability to tissues. This protein is expressed in a wide range of fetal and adult tissues, including the lung, kidney, liver, spleen, thymus, heart, and skeletal muscle, indicating its broad role in maintaining tissue integrity (Fitzgerald2008Three). The α6(VI) chain is part of the extracellular matrix and is involved in the structural integrity of tissues, contributing to the formation of beaded microfilaments that are crucial for biomechanical support (Fitzgerald2008Three; Gregorio2018Collagen).

In muscle tissue, the α6(VI) chain is implicated in extracellular matrix organization and remodeling, particularly in the context of muscle fibrosis, where it is up-regulated in fibrotic areas (Sabatelli2012Expression). The α6(VI) chain is also involved in cell adhesion and migration, potentially playing a role in tissue repair and development (Di2023Collagen). Its expression and localization patterns suggest a specialized role in maintaining the structural integrity of specific tissue areas, such as the endomysium in muscle (Sabatelli2012Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the COL6A6 gene have been implicated in early-onset atopic dermatitis (AD). A study using whole-exome sequencing identified novel candidate variants in the COL6A6 gene among Korean families with early-onset AD. Although no significant association was found in a case-control study, certain variants showed a higher frequency in AD cases compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in the disease's genetic predisposition (Heo2017Identification).

The COL6A6 gene is located near the 3q21 locus, previously identified as an AD susceptibility region. Variants in this gene may impair protein function, as indicated by low SIFT scores and high PhyloP and PhastCons scores, which suggest deleterious effects (Heo2017Identification). The study highlights the potential of COL6A6 polymorphisms as novel candidates for early-onset AD, emphasizing the importance of genetic screening for identifying risk variants (Heo2017Identification).

Additionally, elevated levels of a fragment of the type VI collagen alpha-6 chain, C6A6, have been observed in patients with various dermatological conditions, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease severity and treatment response (Holm2023A).

## Interactions
COL6A6, a component of the extracellular matrix, is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been shown to interact with the P4HA3 protein, a relationship that plays a significant role in suppressing the growth and metastasis of pituitary adenoma cells. This interaction is crucial for blocking the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which is important for tumor development and metastasis. The overexpression of COL6A6 leads to decreased expression of P4HA3 and reduced levels of phosphorylated PI3K and Akt, although the total levels of PI3K and Akt remain unchanged. This suggests that COL6A6 acts as an anti-oncogene by modulating the activity of the PI3K-Akt pathway through its interaction with P4HA3 (Long2019COL6A6).

The interaction between COL6A6 and P4HA3 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a close physical association between these proteins. This interaction is specific, as the inhibitory effects of COL6A6 on the PI3K-Akt pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition can be reversed by the overexpression of P4HA3 or the addition of IGF-1, highlighting the specificity and importance of this protein-protein interaction (Long2019COL6A6).
