# BTRC

## Overview
The BTRC gene encodes the beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a pivotal component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is integral to the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Characterized by its WD40 repeats and F-box domain, the BTRC protein is involved in crucial cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and transcriptional control (Zhang2018TSPAN15; Kim2023BetaTransducin). It plays a significant role in pathways like Wnt and NF-κB, influencing cell proliferation and immune responses (Zheng2020miR224; Zhang2018TSPAN15). The gene's expression and activity are tightly regulated, with implications in cancer biology and other diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Shi2017Genetic; Kim2023BetaTransducin).

## Structure
The BTRC gene encodes the beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, which is a component of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by the presence of several WD40 repeats, which form a beta-propeller structure that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Zhang2018TSPAN15). The F-box domain is another critical feature of the BTRC protein, playing a crucial role in binding to the SCF complex, which is essential for targeting proteins for ubiquitination (Kim2023BetaTransducin).

The BTRC protein is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of various substrates, a process that is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Kim2023BetaTransducin). The protein's activity and stability can be influenced by these modifications, which are crucial for its function in cellular processes like cell cycle progression and signal transduction (Kim2023BetaTransducin).

BTRC has multiple splice variants, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct functions (Kim2023BetaTransducin). These structural features and modifications underscore the protein's role in maintaining protein homeostasis and its implications in cancer biology.

## Function
The BTRC gene encodes the beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, a crucial component of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. In healthy human cells, BTRC is involved in the regulation of several key cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation (Yan2015EBVmiRBART103p; Zhang2018TSPAN15).

BTRC plays a significant role in the Wnt signaling pathway by mediating the degradation of β-catenin, preventing its accumulation and activation of Wnt target genes. This regulation is essential for controlling cell proliferation and maintaining normal cellular functions (Zheng2020miR224). Additionally, BTRC is involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway, where it facilitates the degradation of IκBα, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (Zhang2018TSPAN15).

The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as apoptosis and cell adhesion. Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing tumorigenesis by regulating the degradation of various substrates, including Snail and other cell cycle regulators (Yan2015EBVmiRBART103p; Qi2022The).

## Clinical Significance
The BTRC gene, encoding β-transducin repeat-containing proteins (β-TrCPs), plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Overexpression or mutation of β-TrCPs is linked to tumorigenesis in several cancers, including skin, gastric, prostate, and colon cancers. Specifically, increased β-TrCP1 expression is associated with colorectal cancer, where it activates β-catenin and the NF-κB pathway, leading to decreased apoptosis in tumor cells (Kim2023BetaTransducin). Somatic mutations in BTRC, such as A99V, H342Y, H425Y, C206Y, and G260E, have been identified in gastric cancer, resulting in β-catenin accumulation (Kim2023BetaTransducin).

In multiple myeloma, enhanced BTRC activity correlates with disease progression, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (Belachew2021Genetic). The BTRC gene is also implicated in melanoma, where genetic variants like rs61873997 are associated with improved survival outcomes (Shi2017Genetic). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, down-regulation of BTRC is linked to poor prognosis (Shi2017Genetic). Additionally, BTRC is involved in the progression of osteoarthritis synovitis, suggesting its broader role in disease pathogenesis (Yang2021Based). These findings highlight the clinical significance of BTRC in various diseases, particularly cancers.

## Interactions
BTRC, also known as beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate various cellular pathways. BTRC interacts with miR-224, which binds to the 3'UTR of BTRC mRNA, leading to the downregulation of BTRC protein levels without affecting mRNA levels. This interaction plays a role in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, influencing colorectal cancer progression by promoting cell migration and invasion (Zheng2020miR224).

In oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), BTRC interacts with TSPAN15, enhancing the ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated IκBα. This interaction activates NF-κB signaling, which is associated with cancer metastasis (Zhang2018TSPAN15). BTRC also plays a role in the degradation of human Lipin-1 through its interaction with the DSGXXS motif, facilitating ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Ishimoto2017Degradation).

In intervertebral disc degeneration, BTRC is targeted by miR-583, which suppresses its expression. Circ-FAM169A acts as a competitive endogenous RNA, modulating BTRC expression by sponging miR-583, thereby influencing the NF-κB pathway (Guo2020The). These interactions highlight BTRC's role in various cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.
