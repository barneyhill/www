# GLB1L2

## Overview
The GLB1L2 gene encodes the protein galactosidase beta 1 like 2, which is a member of the glycoside hydrolase family. This protein is involved in the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds, a critical function in the metabolism of carbohydrates. Although the specific biological role of GLB1L2 is not fully elucidated, it is believed to participate in various cellular processes due to its enzymatic activity. The protein's structure and function suggest it may have implications in certain metabolic pathways, potentially influencing cellular homeostasis and energy production. Further research is needed to fully understand the interactions and clinical significance of GLB1L2, as current literature does not provide comprehensive insights into its role in human health and disease.
