# HAX1

## Overview
The HAX1 gene encodes the HCLS1 associated protein X-1, a multifunctional intracellular protein primarily involved in the regulation of apoptosis, cell motility, and calcium homeostasis. This protein is categorized as an apoptosis regulator due to its interactions with various cellular components that influence cell survival and stress responses. HAX1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, with the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm under certain conditions. It plays a crucial role in mRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis, impacting mRNA stability and translation. Mutations in the HAX1 gene are linked to severe congenital neutropenia and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Balcerak2022The; Bezzerri2020Nonsense; Grzybowska2012HAX‐1).

## Structure
The HAX1 protein is a 35 kDa intracellular protein involved in apoptosis regulation. Its primary structure consists of 279 amino acids, with specific regions crucial for its function, such as the amino acid sequence from 175 to 206, which is essential for binding with caspase-9 (Han2006Overexpression). The secondary structure of HAX1 includes a C-terminal domain that shares a common pattern of secondary structure elements with the Myeloid Leukemia Factor (MLF) family, including three beta strands and an alpha helix (Kokoszyńska2010Distant).

HAX1 contains two Bcl-2 homology domains, BH1 and BH2, which are typically associated with proteins involved in apoptosis regulation (Han2006Overexpression; Yap2011HAX‐1:). The C-terminal part of HAX1 is implicated in RNA binding, with a potential nucleic acid binding region located there, possibly forming a beta-sheet (Kokoszyńska2010Distant).

HAX1 is known to produce up to eight different transcripts due to splicing events, resulting in at least two distinct protein isoforms with molecular weights of approximately 35 kDa and 32 kDa (Yap2011HAX‐1:). These isoforms differ by a 48 amino acid deletion in the region containing the acidic box and the BH1 domain.

## Function
The HAX1 gene encodes a multifunctional protein involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, HAX1 plays a significant role in apoptosis regulation, cell motility, and calcium homeostasis. It is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, but can also shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, depending on the isoform and cellular conditions (Li2012Hax1; Grzybowska2012HAX‐1).

HAX1 is involved in mRNA processing and post-transcriptional regulation, particularly under stress conditions. It interacts with the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain mRNAs, influencing their stability and translation. This interaction suggests a role in mRNA degradation and translation repression, as evidenced by its co-localization with P-body markers (Grzybowska2012HAX‐1).

The protein is also implicated in ribosome biogenesis and translation. It binds to RNA in a nonconventional manner, stabilizing transcripts involved in these processes. HAX1 affects the ribosomal profile, particularly the ratio of the small ribosomal subunit to the monosome, which is crucial for efficient ribosome assembly and function (Balcerak2022The).

HAX1's involvement in these molecular processes contributes to its protective role against cellular stress and its regulation of cell survival, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Li2012Hax1; Kang2010Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HAX1 gene are primarily associated with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), specifically recognized as SCN3 or Kostmann disease. This condition is characterized by a significant reduction in neutrophils, leading to recurrent life-threatening infections. The most common mutation in certain populations, such as those of Middle Eastern origin, is the homozygous c.131G>A (p.W44X) nonsense mutation (Bezzerri2020Nonsense). In Turkey, the homozygous c.130-131 ins A (pW44X) mutation is notably prevalent, particularly among the Kurdish population, due to high rates of consanguineous marriages (Yılmaz2019Homozygous).

HAX1 mutations can also lead to neurological symptoms, including developmental delays and epilepsy, particularly with mutations like p.R86X and p.Q190X. These mutations are associated with severe neurodevelopmental abnormalities and are more frequently observed in patients from Japan and Sweden (Matsubara2007Severe; Ishikawa2008Neurodevelopmental). The p.Q190X variant is linked to early, severe neutropenia and poor outcomes (Bezzerri2020Nonsense).

Altered expression of HAX1 is linked to cancer and psoriasis, where it promotes cell survival and proliferation. In cancer, HAX1 shows altered spatial distribution, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation (Yap2011HAX‐1:).

## Interactions
HAX1 (HCLS1 associated protein X-1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell migration, and calcium homeostasis. It interacts with the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), binding specifically to its BIR2 and BIR3 domains. This interaction inhibits apoptosis by preventing the polyubiquitination and degradation of XIAP, thereby enhancing cell survival (Kang2010Molecular).

HAX1 also binds to the bile salt export protein (BSEP) and regulates its abundance in the apical membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analyses, indicating a role in membrane protein regulation (Ortiz2004Identification).

In cardiomyocytes, HAX1 interacts with phospholamban (PLN), modulating the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), which is crucial for heart muscle function (Larsen2020Intrinsically).

HAX1 also exhibits RNA-binding capabilities, interacting with transcripts involved in translation, ribosome biogenesis, and rRNA processing. This suggests a role in mRNA stability and ribosome assembly, as evidenced by its binding to specific RNA targets in human cell lines (Balcerak2022The).
