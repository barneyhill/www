# NOA1

## Overview
NOA1, or Nitric Oxide Associated 1, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial GTPase protein involved in critical cellular processes. The NOA1 protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial function, particularly in the biogenesis and assembly of mitoribosomes, which are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis (Kolanczyk2011NOA1). As a GTPase, NOA1 is characterized by its ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, a function that is crucial for its role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and energy production through oxidative phosphorylation (Kolanczyk2011NOA1). Additionally, NOA1 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, highlighting its importance in programmed cell death and cellular health (Kolanczyk2011NOA1). The protein's interactions with mitochondrial ribosomal components and nucleic acids, including G-quadruplex structures, further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular function and genomic stability (AlFuroukh2013Binding).

## Structure
The NOA1 protein is a mitochondrial GTPase with a complex structure that includes several functional domains. It contains a classical N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), which is crucial for its import into mitochondria. This sequence is processed during mitochondrial import, resulting in a shorter mature protein (AlFuroukh2014NOA1). NOA1 also features a Walker A motif, known as the P-loop, which is essential for GTP binding and hydrolysis. Mutations in this motif, such as K353R, can inactivate the enzyme and prevent GTP hydrolysis (AlFuroukh2013Binding).

The protein has a preference for binding to G-quadruplex structures, particularly those that are antiparallel, and this binding is independent of its GTPase activity (AlFuroukh2013Binding). NOA1 also contains a conserved RNA-binding site in its C-terminus, similar to the RNA-binding motif of TRAP in bacteria, which suggests a role in ribosome assembly (AlFuroukh2013Binding).

NOA1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including processing by the mitochondrial matrix protease ClpXP, which is involved in its degradation (AlFuroukh2014NOA1). The presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) indicates its involvement in nucleo-mitochondrial transport (AlFuroukh2014NOA1).

## Function
The NOA1 gene encodes a GTPase that is essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis and plays a critical role in maintaining mitochondrial function in healthy human cells. NOA1 is predominantly localized to the mitochondria, where it is involved in the biogenesis of mitoribosomes, which are crucial for the synthesis of proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA (Kolanczyk2011NOA1). This protein is necessary for the proper assembly of the 55S mitoribosomes, and its deficiency leads to a decrease in these ribosomes, resulting in impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis (Kolanczyk2011NOA1).

NOA1 also plays a significant role in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), a process vital for ATP production. In NOA1-deficient cells, there is a global defect in OXPHOS, affecting the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, III, IV, and V, which are essential for efficient energy production (Kolanczyk2011NOA1). The protein's involvement in apoptosis is highlighted by its role in mitochondrial membrane potential regulation and caspase-dependent apoptosis, indicating its importance in programmed cell death (Kolanczyk2011NOA1).

Overall, NOA1 is crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis, energy production, and apoptosis regulation, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal health (Kolanczyk2011NOA1).

## Interactions
NOA1, a mitochondrial GTPase, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function. It interacts with components of the mitochondrial ribosome, such as MRPL12, MRPS27, and MRPS29, indicating its role in mitochondrial ribosome assembly and protein synthesis (Kolanczyk2011NOA1). NOA1 also binds to G-quadruplex structures in nucleic acids, with a preference for antiparallel G-quadruplexes. This interaction is significant for its function, as it stimulates NOA1's GTPase activity, although the binding does not depend on this activity (AlFuroukh2013Binding).

NOA1's interaction with G-quadruplexes is stoichiometric and involves both mitochondrial DNA and RNA, including sequences like the CSBII in mtDNA (AlFuroukh2013Binding). The protein also interacts with UBF1, a nucleolar transcription factor, in an RNA and DNA independent manner, suggesting a role in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling (AlFuroukh2014NOA1). These interactions highlight NOA1's multifaceted role in mitochondrial function, ribosome assembly, and potentially in genomic stability and transcription regulation.
