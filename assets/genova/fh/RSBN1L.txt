# RSBN1L

## Overview
RSBN1L is a gene that encodes the protein known as round spermatid basic protein 1 like. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. RSBN1L is expressed in multiple tissues, with notable expression in the testes, suggesting a potential role in spermatogenesis. The protein is categorized as a basic protein due to its amino acid composition, which may influence its interaction with other cellular components. Further research is needed to fully understand the pathways and mechanisms in which RSBN1L is involved, as well as its potential implications in human health and disease.
