# YWHAZ

## Overview
The YWHAZ gene encodes the 14-3-3 zeta protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, which plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. This protein is characterized by its ability to form homo- or heterodimers, which are essential for its function in binding phosphoserine-containing proteins and facilitating interactions with numerous target proteins (Eisa2019YWHA; Xu2019YWHA1433). The 14-3-3 zeta protein is involved in the regulation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway, which is crucial for maintaining tissue stiffness and epidermal homeostasis (Kular2015A). Its interactions with other proteins, such as DAAM1 and αB-Crystallin, underscore its significant role in cancer progression and metastasis (Gan2020The; Mei2021YWHAZ). Alterations in the YWHAZ gene are associated with various cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its clinical significance as a potential therapeutic target (Nishimura2013Overexpression; Popov2019A).

## Structure
The YWHAZ gene encodes the 14-3-3 zeta protein, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family involved in signal transduction. The protein typically forms homo- or heterodimers, contributing to its quaternary structure (Eisa2019YWHA). The secondary structure of YWHAZ includes nine antiparallel alpha helices, which form a horseshoe-shaped dimer with a conserved amphipathic groove. This groove is crucial for binding phosphorylated serine/threonine residues, facilitating interactions with various target proteins (Xu2019YWHA1433).

The 14-3-3 zeta protein is known for its role in binding phosphoserine-containing proteins, which is essential for its function in signal transduction pathways (Puri2008Proteomic). Common post-translational modifications of YWHAZ include phosphorylation, which is critical for its interaction with binding partners and its regulatory functions (Puri2008Proteomic). Although the context does not provide specific details on the primary or tertiary structure of YWHAZ, the presence of the amphipathic groove and its role in protein-protein interactions are well-documented (Xu2019YWHA1433). The protein's ability to form dimers and its structural features enable it to participate in diverse cellular processes, including cell cycle control and metabolism (Eisa2019YWHA).

## Function
The YWHAZ gene encodes the 14-3-3ζ protein, a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, 14-3-3ζ plays a critical role in regulating the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway. This regulation is essential for maintaining tissue stiffness and epidermal homeostasis by moderating mechano-reciprocity, which is the balance of mechanical forces that maintain tissue integrity (Kular2015A).

14-3-3ζ interacts with Mypt1, leading to the dephosphorylation and inactivation of the regulatory myosin light chain (Mlc2), thereby reducing actomyosin contractility. This interaction is crucial for dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) production and remodeling during wound healing, ensuring proper re-epithelialization and preventing excessive tissue stiffness (Kular2015A). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing cellular responses and organismal development (Kasinski2014Transcriptional).

In the absence of 14-3-3ζ, there is increased ROCK signaling, leading to enhanced ECM production and tissue stiffness, which can accelerate wound healing but also promote tumor growth (Kular2015A). This highlights the protein's role as a negative regulator of ROCK signaling, crucial for maintaining epidermal homeostasis and proper wound repair (Kular2015A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the YWHAZ gene are implicated in several diseases and conditions. In cancer, YWHAZ is frequently up-regulated, acting as an oncogene that promotes malignant phenotypes such as cell growth, migration, and invasion. Its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis in various cancers, including gastric, breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers. In gastric cancer, YWHAZ overexpression correlates with larger tumor size and worse survival outcomes (Nishimura2013Overexpression). In pancreatic cancer, high YWHAZ expression is associated with enhanced metastatic phenotypes and a worse prognosis (Cao2023Highthroughput).

YWHAZ is also involved in chemoresistance in cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, where its knockdown increases sensitivity to chemotherapy (Gan2020The). In neurological disorders, specific YWHAZ variants, such as S230W, are associated with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, a RASopathy characterized by developmental delays and facial abnormalities. This variant enhances ERK signaling, contributing to the syndrome's phenotype (Popov2019A). Another variant, Lys49Asn, is linked to intellectual disability and global developmental delay, affecting neurodevelopment and cognitive functions (Wan2022YWHAZ).

## Interactions
YWHAZ, also known as 14-3-3 zeta, is a protein that participates in various interactions with other proteins, influencing multiple cellular processes. In breast cancer cells, YWHAZ interacts with DAAM1, a protein involved in microfilament remodeling and cancer metastasis. This interaction is crucial for DAAM1-mediated microfilament remodeling and RhoA activation, contributing to cell migration and poor prognosis in breast cancer (Mei2021YWHAZ). The interaction between YWHAZ and DAAM1 is not disrupted by the DAAM1-Y652F mutation, indicating a robust binding (Mei2021YWHAZ).

YWHAZ also forms complexes with various proteins in different cancer types. In hepatocellular carcinoma, YWHAZ complexes with αB-Crystallin to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through ERK1/2 phosphorylation, affecting drug efficacy (Gan2020The). In lung cancer, YWHAZ interacts with Hsp27, and its knockdown suppresses cell migration (Gan2020The). Additionally, YWHAZ binds to serine 83 on p85 in breast cancer, contributing to transformation-related properties (Gan2020The).

YWHAZ's interactions extend to the regulation of apoptosis pathways and chemoresistance, highlighting its role in cancer progression and potential as a therapeutic target (Gan2020The).
