# SCART1

## Overview
SCART1 is a gene that encodes the protein scavenger receptor family member expressed on T cells 1, which is a member of the scavenger receptor family. This protein is predominantly expressed on Vg6+ T cells, a subset of gamma delta T cells, and is involved in immune response regulation. As a receptor, SCART1 plays a crucial role in binding various ligands and is implicated in processes such as endocytosis and pathogen recognition. The expression of SCART1 is particularly significant in the adaptation of Vg6+ T cells to skin residency, where these cells function as activated effector cells, contributing to tissue homeostasis and immune surveillance (Tan2019SingleCell).

## Function
SCART1, encoded by the gene Cd163l1, is a protein primarily expressed on Vg6+ T cells, a subset of gamma delta T cells, and plays a significant role in immune response regulation. It is part of the scavenger receptor family, which is involved in binding various ligands and participating in processes such as endocytosis and pathogen recognition. SCART1 is specifically expressed on the surface of Vg6+ T cells, distinguishing them from Vg4+ T cells, which express SCART2 (Tan2019SingleCell).

In healthy human cells, SCART1 is involved in the adaptation of Vg6+ T cells to skin residency, where these cells function as activated effector cells. These cells exhibit an IL-17 and amphiregulin-producing effector phenotype, contributing to tissue homeostasis and immune surveillance (Tan2019SingleCell). The expression of SCART1 is associated with the tissue-specific adaptation of Vg6+ T cells, particularly in the skin, where they are mainly tissue-resident and exhibit low proliferation rates compared to those in peripheral lymph nodes and thymus (Tan2019SingleCell).

SCART1's role in Vg6+ T cells includes involvement in the regulation of immune cell signaling and activation, contributing to the cells' longevity and functional differentiation within tissues (Tan2019SingleCell).
