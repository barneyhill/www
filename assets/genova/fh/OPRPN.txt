# OPRPN

## Overview
The OPRPN gene encodes the opiorphin prepropeptide, a protein that has garnered interest due to its potential role in modulating pain and stress responses. Opiorphin is a naturally occurring peptide that functions as an inhibitor of enkephalin-degrading enzymes, thereby enhancing the activity of endogenous opioids. This protein is categorized as a regulatory peptide due to its involvement in modulating physiological processes. Research has also explored the gene's implications in cancer biology, particularly in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where its expression levels may influence the response to radiotherapy (Rong2022Conjoint).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The OPRPN gene, encoding the opiorphin prepropeptide, has been studied for its clinical significance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly in the context of radiotherapy. Alterations in the expression of OPRPN have been linked to the prognosis of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients undergoing radiotherapy. The expression of OPRPN is upregulated in response to fractionated ionizing radiation in HNSCC cell lines, suggesting a potential role in mediating radioresistance (Rong2022Conjoint).

In clinical settings, elevated levels of OPRPN, along with SMR3A, have been associated with treatment failure and unfavorable clinical outcomes post-radiotherapy. However, the predictive power of OPRPN alone is considered minor compared to SMR3A (Rong2022Conjoint). While high SMR3A expression is an independent unfavorable biomarker, increased OPRPN expression may have a protective function, as suggested by multivariate Cox regression analyses (Rong2022Conjoint).

The study highlights the potential of OPRPN and SMR3A as prognostic markers for HNSCC post-radiotherapy, although further research with larger patient cohorts is needed to confirm these findings (Rong2022Conjoint).
