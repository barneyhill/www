# CD300E

## Overview
CD300E is a gene that encodes the CD300e molecule, a transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as an activating receptor within the immune system. The CD300e protein is predominantly expressed on human monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells, where it plays a crucial role in modulating immune responses. Structurally, the protein features an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain and a transmembrane region that facilitates its interaction with the DAP12 adaptor protein, essential for its signaling capabilities (Brckalo2010Functional). Upon activation, CD300e triggers intracellular signaling pathways that lead to the mobilization of calcium ions and the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhancing T cell responses (Brckalo2010Functional). The gene's expression and the protein's function are implicated in various clinical contexts, including cancer progression and immune system disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Luo2024Exercisedownregulated; Li2022Immunophenotypic).

## Structure
The CD300E protein, also known as IREM-2, is a monomeric glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 32 kDa. It features a single extracellular immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain, which is a common structural motif in proteins involved in immune responses (Brckalo2010Functional). The protein is characterized by a transmembrane domain containing a positively charged lysine residue, which facilitates its association with the DAP12 adaptor protein, a critical interaction for its function as an activating receptor (Brckalo2010Functional). 

The CD300E protein is N-glycosylated, a post-translational modification that can influence protein folding, stability, and interactions (Isobe2018The). This glycosylation occurs at specific asparagine residues within the Ig-like domain, as confirmed by Western blot analysis (Isobe2018The). The protein's structure allows it to participate in immune signaling pathways, particularly in monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells, where it plays a role in regulating inflammatory responses (Brckalo2010Functional). 

While detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of CD300E is not provided, its functional domains and post-translational modifications are well-documented, highlighting its role in immune cell activation and signaling.

## Function
CD300E, also known as IREM-2, is an activating receptor primarily expressed on human monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDC). It associates with the DNAX-activating protein (DAP)12 adaptor, which facilitates intracellular signaling. Upon engagement, CD300E triggers intracellular calcium mobilization and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anion (O2-), in monocytes. This activation leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, including TNF-a and IL-8/CXCL8, and upregulates the expression of co-stimulatory molecules like CD25, CD83, and CD86, enhancing the alloreactive response of T cells (Brckalo2010Functional).

CD300E also plays a role in promoting the survival of monocytes and mDC by reducing apoptosis, as evidenced by decreased annexin V binding in stimulated cells. This anti-apoptotic effect is comparable to that observed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (Brckalo2010Functional). Additionally, CD300E is involved in the differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells, where it influences the expression of surface molecules and enhances the migratory capacity of these cells towards chemokines like CCL21 (Clark2007Monocytes).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CD300E gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions, particularly in the context of cancer and immune system disorders. In cancer, CD300E is often upregulated and associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. It is linked to genomic instability and tumor progression in cancers such as kidney chromophobe (KICH), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), and others, with its expression correlating with tumor mutational burden in several cancer types, including sarcoma (SARC) and ovarian cancer (OV) (Luo2024Exercisedownregulated). CD300E expression is also associated with immune cell modulation within the tumor microenvironment, influencing both immunosuppressive and immune-promoting cells, which can affect tumor growth and metastasis (Luo2024Exercisedownregulated).

In the context of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), high CD300E expression on monocytes is associated with better progression-free survival and AML-free survival, suggesting it as a favorable prognostic marker (Li2022Immunophenotypic). CD300E also plays a role in Helicobacter pylori infections, where its upregulation in macrophages contributes to chronic inflammation and impaired antigen presentation, potentially allowing the bacteria to persist in the host (Pagliari2017Helicobacter). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CD300E in both cancer and immune-related conditions.

## Interactions
CD300E, also known as the CD300e molecule, is an immune-activating receptor that interacts with several proteins to mediate immune responses. In mice, the ortholog mCD300e has been shown to physically interact with the signaling proteins FcRγ and DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12). These interactions are essential for mCD300e to deliver activating signals, as the absence of DAP12 and FcRγ completely abrogates mCD300e-mediated cytokine production in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) (Isobe2018The). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between mCD300e and these adaptor proteins (Isobe2018The).

CD300E is also known to associate with DAP12 in human cells, which is crucial for its signaling capabilities. This association is facilitated by a positively charged amino acid residue within the transmembrane region of CD300E, allowing it to interact with ITAM-bearing adaptors like DAP12. Upon engagement, CD300E triggers intracellular calcium mobilization and the production of superoxide anion in monocytes, indicating its role in activating signaling pathways (Brckalo2010Functional). CD300E's interaction with DAP12 enhances its surface expression and contributes to its function as an activating receptor (Gasiorowski2013CD300).
