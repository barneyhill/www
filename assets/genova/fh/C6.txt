# C6

## Overview
The C6 gene encodes the complement component 6 protein, a vital part of the human immune system. This protein is a key player in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is responsible for lysing target cells, such as bacteria and aged erythrocytes, by creating transmembrane pores. As a single-chain glycoprotein, complement C6 shares structural similarities with other complement proteins, including C7, C8, and C9, and contains specific domains like the thrombospondin type-1 domain and the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain. These domains are crucial for its function in immune defense. The C6 protein interacts with other complement components to form the MAC, highlighting its role in immune surveillance and pathogen elimination. Mutations in the C6 gene can lead to complement component 6 deficiency, increasing susceptibility to infections, particularly those caused by Neisseria meningitidis (SchröderBraunstein2019Complement; Morgan2017Molecular; Chakravarti1989Structural).

## Structure
The human complement protein C6 is a single-chain glycoprotein involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the immune system. The primary structure of C6 includes an amino-terminal sequence with a signal peptide of 21 residues and a site for N-glycosylation at residue 303 (Chakravarti1989Structural). The protein exhibits extensive amino acid sequence homology with other complement proteins such as C7, C8, and C9, with similarity percentages ranging from 47.1% to 52.4% (Chakravarti1989Structural).

The secondary structure of C6 is predicted to include β-sheets and β-turns in the amino-terminal half, while α-helices are present in the other half of the sequence (Chakravarti1989Structural). The tertiary structure of C6 is characterized by a compact conformation in solution, similar to C7, with distinct glycosylation patterns (Lukassen2021Similarities). The quaternary structure involves its assembly with other complement proteins to form the MAC.

C6 contains specific domains such as the thrombospondin type-1 domain (TSP1), low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain (LDL), and a central membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain (Lukassen2021Similarities). Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation and C-mannosylation, contributing to its structural and functional properties (Lukassen2021Similarities).

## Function
Complement C6 is a crucial component of the complement system, specifically involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which plays a significant role in the immune response by lysing target cells such as bacteria and aged erythrocytes (Morgan2017Molecular). C6 binds to C5b, forming the C5b6 complex, which is essential for the subsequent binding of C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules to complete the MAC assembly (Lin2020Development; Morgan2017Molecular). This complex creates transmembrane pores that lead to cell lysis, effectively destroying pathogens (Tegla2011Membrane).

C6 contains several domains, including a C-terminal Cys-rich domain that binds to the α-chain of C5b, facilitating the formation of the C5b6 complex (Tegla2011Membrane). The MACPF domain within C6 is crucial for the lytic function of the MAC, contributing to its ability to form pores in cell membranes (Tegla2011Membrane). While the primary role of C6 is in immune defense, excessive MAC formation can lead to tissue damage, highlighting the importance of its regulation in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Lin2020Development).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C6 gene are associated with complement component 6 deficiency, which significantly increases susceptibility to infections, particularly those caused by Neisseria meningitidis. Individuals with C6 deficiency have a markedly higher risk of developing meningococcal disease, with a 1000 to 10,000-fold increased risk compared to the general population (SchröderBraunstein2019Complement; Grumach2014Are). This deficiency is part of the terminal complement complex (TCC) deficiencies, which include other components like C5, C7, C8, and C9, all of which are linked to increased risk of invasive infections by Neisseria species (Degn2011DiseaseCausing).

C6 deficiencies are often inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and can lead to decreased levels of CH50 and AH50, which are measures of complement activity (SchröderBraunstein2019Complement). In addition to infections, C6 deficiencies have been associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (SchröderBraunstein2019Complement). The genetic diversity of C6 mutations, including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations, contributes to the variability in clinical presentations and susceptibility to diseases (El2019Clinical).

## Interactions
Complement C6 is a crucial component of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the complement system. It interacts with several other complement proteins to form this complex, which is essential for immune defense. C6 binds to the α-chain of C5b, forming the C5b6 complex, which can then attach to cell membranes through ionic and hydrophobic interactions (Tegla2011Membrane). This interaction is pivotal for the subsequent binding of C7, leading to the formation of the C5b-7 complex. The C5b-7 complex has a high affinity for lipids and anchors to the membrane, facilitating the binding of C8 and the polymerization of C9, ultimately forming the C5b-9 complex, also known as the MAC (Tegla2011Membrane).

C6 also interacts with sialylated molecules on cell membranes, such as glycophorin, through ionic forces. This interaction is crucial for the deposition of the C5b-7 complex on membranes, although the binding of C7 disrupts this interaction, exposing hydrophobic residues that aid in membrane insertion (Marshall1996Interaction). Additionally, C6 has been shown to bind to heparin, with an IC50 value of 37 µg/ml, indicating its relative affinity for this molecule (Sahu1993Identification). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of C6 in the complement system.
