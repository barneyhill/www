# RECQL

## Overview
The RECQL gene encodes the RecQ-like helicase, a crucial enzyme within the RecQ helicase family, which is integral to maintaining genomic stability. This protein functions primarily as a DNA helicase, unwinding DNA strands to facilitate processes such as DNA repair, replication, and recombination. The RecQ-like helicase is characterized by its conserved domains, including a nucleotide-binding site and a 'DEAD' box, which are essential for its helicase activity. It is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it plays a significant role in the DNA damage response, particularly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Mutations in the RECQL gene have been linked to genomic instability disorders, such as RECON syndrome, underscoring its importance in DNA repair mechanisms and chromosomal stability (AbuLibdeh2022RECON; Puranam1994Cloning; Sharma2007RECQL).

## Structure
The RECQL protein, a member of the RecQ helicase family, is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 659 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 72,000 Da (Puranam1994Cloning). The secondary structure of RECQL includes putative alpha-helices, particularly near the amino terminus, and the protein is composed of 12% acidic and 15% basic residues, with an estimated isoelectric point (pI) of 8.62 (Puranam1994Cloning). 

The tertiary structure of RECQL features several conserved domains typical of DNA and RNA helicases, including the nucleotide-binding site and the 'DEAD' box, which are crucial for its helicase activity (Puranam1994Cloning). These domains are involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis, facilitating the unwinding of DNA strands. 

In terms of quaternary structure, RECQL is predominantly found in the nuclear and membrane fractions of cells, suggesting its involvement in nuclear processes related to DNA repair (Puranam1994Cloning). The protein's sequence similarity to the E. coli RecQ protein indicates a potential role in DNA repair mechanisms, particularly in response to DNA damage (Puranam1994Cloning). 

The RECQL protein does not exhibit TCF DNA binding activity, distinguishing it from other helicases with similar structural motifs (Puranam1994Cloning).

## Function
RECQL, a member of the RecQ helicase family, plays a critical role in maintaining genomic stability in human cells. It is involved in DNA repair, replication, and recombination processes, primarily functioning to unwind DNA structures, which facilitates the resolution of DNA damage and prevents genomic instability (Sharma2007RECQL). RECQL is active in the nucleus, particularly during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, where it participates in homologous recombination (HR) repair at double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Sharma2007RECQL).

In RECQL-deficient cells, there is an increased frequency of chromosomal instability, including chromosome aberrations, translocations, and aneuploidy, highlighting its role in the DNA damage response (Sharma2007RECQL). Despite these cellular abnormalities, RECQL knockout mice are viable and fertile, suggesting potential functional redundancy with other RecQ helicases like WRN, BLM, RECQL4, and RECQL5 (Sharma2007RECQL).

RECQL's involvement in DNA repair processes is essential for maintaining chromosomal stability and processing inappropriate recombination intermediates during replication. Its absence can lead to improper maintenance of DNA replication forks, resulting in increased sister chromatid exchanges (Sharma2007RECQL). This underscores RECQL's critical role in genomic integrity and its potential cooperation with other nuclear DNA metabolic factors.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RECQL gene are associated with RECON syndrome, a genome instability disorder characterized by progeroid facial features, xeroderma, skin photosensitivity, and slender, elongated thumbs. The specific mutation p.Ala459Ser in the zinc binding domain of RECQL1 compromises its ATPase and helicase activities, impairing DNA repair and replication processes. This mutation leads to defects in repairing abortive topoisomerase 1 and 2 cleavage complexes and reduces the ability to restart replication following exposure to genotoxic agents like hydroxyurea and methylmethane sulfonate (AbuLibdeh2022RECON).

RECON syndrome patients exhibit symptoms such as pre-and postnatal growth retardation, facial erythema, poikiloderma, skin pigmentation issues, alopecia, and increased cancer predisposition. The RECQL1 p.A459S mutation affects the ability to restart stalled replication forks, leading to increased endogenous replication stress (AbuLibdeh2022RECON). The clinical phenotype of RECON syndrome is relatively mild compared to other RecQ-associated disorders, possibly due to residual protein function (AbuLibdeh2022RECON).

Heterozygous mutations of RECQL have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, although this association is disputed (AbuLibdeh2022RECON).

## Interactions
RECQL, a member of the RecQ helicase family, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for DNA repair and genomic stability. It interacts with topoisomerase IIIα, RMI1, and RMI2, forming the BLM-Topo IIIα-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex, which is essential for resolving recombination intermediates and maintaining genomic integrity (Sharma2006Mechanisms). RECQL also interacts with nucleic acids, unwinding DNA structures during replication and repair (Estep2017RecQ).

RECQL1, a specific member of the RecQ family, interacts with Ku, a protein involved in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), and its absence reduces Ku-DNA-binding activity. It also interacts with EXO1 and the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex, which are involved in alternative NHEJ (Alt-NHEJ) (Croteau2014Human).

RECQL5, another member, interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), inhibiting transcript elongation. It also binds and inhibits RAD51-mediated D-loop formation, playing a role in homologous recombination (HR) by promoting non-crossover repair products and preventing aberrant RAD51 filament formation (Lu2021Human; Hamadeh2020RECQL5). These interactions highlight RECQL's role in DNA repair and transcription processes, contributing to genomic stability.
