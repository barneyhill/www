# KIAA1614

## Overview
KIAA1614 is a human gene that encodes the KIAA1614 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes. Although the precise biological function of the KIAA1614 protein remains to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in several physiological and pathological contexts. The gene has been associated with the regulation of cellular adhesion proteins and is linked to cardiovascular disease risk, particularly through genetic variants such as SNP rs7521237 (Larson2016Blood). Additionally, KIAA1614 is upregulated in type 1 diabetes mellitus complications, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection (Mussa2022Identification). The gene is also part of a panel used for classifying COVID-19 patients, although its role in this context is not fully defined (Zhang2022Genomic). Furthermore, KIAA1614 has been identified as a prognostic factor in Crohn's disease, indicating its broader significance in disease progression and clinical outcomes (Pernat2018DNA).

## Clinical Significance
KIAA1614 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and genetic associations. In type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), KIAA1614 is significantly upregulated in complications such as neuropathy, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early detection of these complications (Mussa2022Identification). The gene's expression is associated with a higher predictive value for the onset of T1DM complications, indicating its clinical significance in this context (Mussa2022Identification).

In the context of atherosclerosis, a genetic variant within KIAA1614, specifically SNP rs7521237, has been linked to the regulation of circulating cellular adhesion protein levels in non-Hispanic white participants. This association suggests a potential role for KIAA1614 in cardiovascular disease risk prediction (Larson2016Blood).

KIAA1614 is also part of a gene panel used to classify COVID-19 patients, although its specific clinical significance in this context is less clear. It is considered potentially substitutable within the classifier, indicating that while it contributes to the classification, it may not be a core gene (Zhang2022Genomic).

In Crohn's disease, SNP rs7515553 associated with KIAA1614 has been identified as a prognostic factor for disease progression, highlighting its potential role in predicting clinical outcomes (Pernat2018DNA).
