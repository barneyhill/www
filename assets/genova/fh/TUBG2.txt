# TUBG2

## Overview
TUBG2 is a gene that encodes the protein tubulin gamma 2, a member of the tubulin family, which plays a pivotal role in the organization and nucleation of microtubules within cells. Tubulin gamma 2 is a critical component of the microtubule-organizing center, particularly active in the centrosome, where it contributes to the formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby influencing cell cycle progression and stability (Thulasirajah2022A). This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain, especially in neurons located in regions such as the thalamus, striatum, and hippocampus, indicating its significant role in neuronal function and brain development (YubaKubo2005Gene). Although TUBG2 is not essential for mitotic spindle organization, as evidenced by the viability of TUBG2 knockout mice, its specific functions in differentiated cells, particularly in the central nervous system, underscore its importance in brain development and function (Corvaisier2020NonCanonical; YubaKubo2005Gene).

## Function
TUBG2 encodes the γ-tubulin2 protein, which is a component of the microtubule-organizing center and plays a crucial role in microtubule nucleation and organization within cells. This protein is primarily active in the centrosome, where it contributes to the formation of the mitotic spindle, influencing cell cycle progression and stability (Thulasirajah2022A). In humans, TUBG2 is highly expressed in the brain, particularly in neurons within regions such as the thalamus, striatum, and hippocampus, suggesting a significant role in neuronal function and brain development (YubaKubo2005Gene).

The γ-tubulin2 protein is involved in the assembly of γ-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs) into γ-tubulin complexes (γ-TuCs), which are essential for microtubule nucleation and organization (Thulasirajah2022A). Despite its high expression in the brain, TUBG2 is not essential for mitotic spindle organization and cell division, as evidenced by the viability and fertility of TUBG2 knockout mice (YubaKubo2005Gene). The protein's specific functions in differentiated cells, particularly in the central nervous system, are supported by its increased expression during brain development and its role in processes related to brain function (Corvaisier2020NonCanonical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBG2 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. A de novo missense variant in TUBG2, specifically c.747G>A p.(Met249Ile), has been identified in a child with global developmental delay, microcephaly, refractory epilepsy, and perisylvian polymicrogyria. This variant was absent from control databases and predicted to be deleterious, suggesting its potential role in these conditions (Thulasirajah2022A). Functional studies indicated that this mutation affects protein stability and cellular growth, which may contribute to the clinical symptoms observed in the patient (Thulasirajah2022A).

The TUBG2 gene is expressed in the human brain, and its expression increases during brain development, indicating its role in differentiation (Corvaisier2020NonCanonical). In mice, TUBG2 knockout results in defects such as abnormalities in circadian rhythm and response to painful stimulation, although these mice remain viable, unlike TUBG1 knockout mice, which exhibit severe developmental issues (Rosselló2018γTubulin–γTubulin). These findings suggest that alterations in TUBG2 expression or function can lead to significant developmental and neurological abnormalities, highlighting its clinical significance in brain malformations and related disorders.

## Interactions
TUBG2, a member of the tubulin family, is involved in critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with γ-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs) to form the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), essential for microtubule organization and spindle formation during mitosis. A study identified a de novo missense variant in TUBG2, specifically the p.(Met249Ile) substitution, which was found to increase the interaction between TUBG2 and GCP2 compared to the wild-type protein. This suggests that the variant may alter normal protein interactions, potentially contributing to clinical symptoms such as global developmental delay and microcephaly (Thulasirajah2022A).

TUBG2 is primarily expressed in the brain and is part of a meshwork that assists in recruiting proteins like PCNA to chromatin, indicating its role in nuclear processes (Corvaisier2021The). The protein's interactions are crucial for its function in microtubule nucleation and organization, with its depletion leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, highlighting its essential role in cell division (Rosselló2018γTubulin–γTubulin).
