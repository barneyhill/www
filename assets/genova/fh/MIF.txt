# MIF

## Overview
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional cytokine involved in the regulation of immune responses and various cellular processes. The MIF protein is categorized as a cytokine and is structurally characterized by a unique α/β-barrel fold, forming a homotrimer that plays a significant role in immune signaling and inflammation (Sun1996Crystal). MIF is constitutively expressed in a wide range of cell types, including immune and non-immune cells, and is known for its ability to modulate pro-inflammatory responses, cell migration, and apoptosis inhibition (Roger2007Regulation). The protein interacts with several receptors and intracellular proteins, influencing pathways that are critical for cell survival and immune function (Kang2019The). Clinically, alterations in MIF expression and genetic polymorphisms are associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kang2019The).

## Structure
The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) protein is a homotrimer, with each monomer consisting of 115 amino acids. The primary structure of MIF includes a unique sequence that lacks significant homology with other cytokines, highlighting its distinct nature (Bernhagen1998Regulation). The secondary structure of MIF is characterized by a β-α-β-β-α-β-α-β motif, with two antiparallel α-helices and a four-stranded β-sheet forming the core of each monomer (Sun1996Crystal). 

In terms of tertiary structure, MIF forms a unique α/β-barrel fold, where three β-sheets wrap around each other, creating a solvent-accessible channel with a positive electrostatic potential, which may interact with negatively charged molecules (Sun1996Crystal). The quaternary structure of MIF is a trimer, stabilized by subunit-subunit interactions, including hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions (Sun1996Crystal). 

MIF also contains a CXXC motif, which is characteristic of thiol-protein oxidoreductases, suggesting a potential role in redox reactions (Kleemann1998Disulfide). The protein's structure is further stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond, contributing to its conformational stability (Kleemann1998Disulfide).

## Function
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and cellular processes in healthy human cells. MIF is constitutively expressed by a variety of cells, including immune cells like monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, as well as non-immune cells such as epithelial and endocrine cells (Roger2007Regulation). It is involved in promoting pro-inflammatory responses by upregulating the expression of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and matrix metalloproteinases, and by enhancing the host's antimicrobial defense mechanisms (Roger2007Regulation).

MIF interacts with its receptor complex, CD74 and CD44, to initiate signaling pathways that lead to the activation of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) and sustained ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation. This signaling cascade results in the upregulation of cPLA2 and nuclear translocation of p53, which inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell survival (Kang2019The). MIF also influences cell migration and macrophage retention through its interaction with chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 (Kang2019The).

In addition to its role in immune signaling, MIF modulates the cell cycle by interacting with Jab1, a coactivator of the AP-1 transcription factor, thereby influencing AP-1 activity and cell growth (Kleemann2000Intracellular). MIF's ability to inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis is significant for maintaining macrophage viability and proinflammatory function, which is essential for the innate immune response (Mitchell2001Macrophage).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MIF gene are associated with various diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), high MIF expression correlates with severe disease manifestations, promoting cytokine production, resistance to apoptosis, and angiogenesis, which contribute to joint erosion and inflammation (Kang2019The). The -794 CATT microsatellite in the MIF promoter region is linked to disease severity in RA, with higher repeat numbers associated with increased MIF expression (Kang2019The). In juvenile idiopathic arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, high-expression MIF alleles are common in patients with glucocorticoid resistance (Kang2019The).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), high-expression MIF alleles are linked to severe disease manifestations and increased circulating MIF and TNF levels (Kang2019The). In ulcerative colitis, MIF polymorphisms are associated with CpG island hypermethylation of the CDKN2A gene, potentially contributing to carcinogenesis (Sakurai2020Influence). In multiple myeloma, MIF protects cells against proteasome inhibitors by maintaining mitochondrial function, suggesting its role in therapeutic resistance (Wang2020MIF). MIF is also implicated in chronic lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer, where it may promote fibrosis and tumor growth (FlorezSampedro2020The).

## Interactions
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its biological functions. MIF interacts with myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in endothelial cells, particularly with the N-terminal region of MLCK, enhancing intracellular tension and colocalizing with actin stress fibers and phosphorylated myosin light chains (Wadgaonkar2005Intracellular). MIF also binds to the cell surface protein CD74, initiating signal transduction pathways such as ERK-1/2 phosphorylation (Leng2003MIF). 

MIF interacts with the chemokine receptor CXCR7, promoting receptor internalization and engaging in signaling pathways like ERK1/2 and ZAP-70, which are crucial for lymphocyte chemotaxis (Alampour‐Rajabi2015MIF). It forms heterocomplexes with the CXC-motif chemokine CXCL4L1, inhibiting MIF's binding to the CXCR4 receptor and affecting inflammatory and thrombotic processes (Brandhofer2022Heterocomplexes). 

Additionally, MIF interacts with Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein (TXNIP), influencing NF-κB signaling by increasing transcriptional activity, while TXNIP suppresses it (Kim2017Macrophage). These interactions highlight MIF's role in modulating immune responses, cell motility, and inflammation.
