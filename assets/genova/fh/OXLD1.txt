# OXLD1

## Overview
The OXLD1 gene encodes the protein oxidoreductase like domain containing 1, which is a member of the oxidoreductase family. This protein is characterized by its involvement in redox reactions, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic processes. The oxidoreductase like domain containing 1 protein is implicated in various biochemical pathways, where it facilitates the transfer of electrons between molecules, thereby playing a vital role in cellular respiration and detoxification processes. Its activity is essential for the regulation of oxidative stress, which, if unbalanced, can lead to cellular damage and contribute to the pathogenesis of several diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
