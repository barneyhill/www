# PLEKHO2

## Overview
PLEKHO2 is a gene that encodes the pleckstrin homology domain containing O2 protein, which is a member of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell survival and death, including apoptosis and necroptosis. PLEKHO2 plays a critical role in modulating the activation and ubiquitination of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), thereby influencing TNFα-induced cell death and promoting NF-κB activation, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune responses (Zhou2021PLEKHO2). Additionally, PLEKHO2 is vital for the survival of macrophages, particularly under conditions of limited macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), by inhibiting caspase activation (Zhang2017PLEKHO2). The protein is also expressed in platelets, where it interacts with phosphoinositides, although its precise role in platelet signaling is not yet fully understood (Durrant2020Identification). Overall, PLEKHO2 is integral to the regulation of immune function and cell survival across various cellular environments.

## Structure


## Function
PLEKHO2, a member of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein superfamily, plays a significant role in intracellular signaling and cell survival. It is involved in the regulation of cell death processes, particularly apoptosis and necroptosis, by modulating the activation and ubiquitination of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). In healthy human cells, PLEKHO2 inhibits TNFα-induced cell death by suppressing RIPK1 activation, thereby promoting NF-κB activation, which is crucial for cellular homeostasis and immune response (Zhou2021PLEKHO2).

PLEKHO2 is also essential for macrophage survival, particularly under conditions where macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is limited. It prevents apoptosis in macrophages by inhibiting caspase activation, ensuring the maintenance of tissue-resident macrophage populations in organs such as the spleen and peritoneal cavity (Zhang2017PLEKHO2).

In addition to its role in cell death regulation, PLEKHO2 is expressed in platelets, where it is thought to interact with phosphoinositides like PtdIns(3,4)P2, although its specific function in platelet signaling remains to be fully elucidated (Durrant2020Identification). Overall, PLEKHO2 is crucial for modulating immune function and cell survival in various cellular contexts.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PLEKHO2, a member of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing protein superfamily, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It plays a crucial role in regulating receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) activation, which is pivotal in TNFα-induced apoptosis and necroptosis. PLEKHO2 deficiency leads to increased interaction of RIPK1 with FADD and caspase 8, enhancing the formation of complex II, a key component in necroptosis (Zhou2021PLEKHO2). This suggests that PLEKHO2 may inhibit these interactions under normal conditions, thereby regulating cell death pathways.

PLEKHO2 is also identified as a novel PtdIns(3,4)P2-regulated protein, indicating its potential role in platelet signaling. This interaction is facilitated by its PH domain, which binds to phosphoinositides, although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed (Durrant2020Identification). In macrophages, PLEKHO2 is essential for survival, particularly under conditions of M-CSF insufficiency, by inhibiting apoptosis-related caspase activation (Zhang2017PLEKHO2). While the exact protein interactions in macrophages are not fully elucidated, PLEKHO2's role in preventing apoptotic cell death suggests it may interact with components of the apoptotic machinery.
