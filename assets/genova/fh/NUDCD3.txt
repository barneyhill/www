# NUDCD3

## Overview
NUDCD3 (NudC domain containing 3) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, including mitosis, intracellular transport, and ciliogenesis. The protein, also referred to as NudC domain containing 3, is a key component of the dynein complex, a motor protein essential for the movement of cellular components along microtubules. This interaction is vital for proper mitotic spindle function and chromosome segregation during cell division (Lee2014Singlecell). Additionally, NUDCD3 plays a role in the regulation of cilia length and formation, interacting with proteins such as WDR34 to ensure proper cilia function (Asante2014Subunit). The protein is also involved in the assembly and function of the dynein-2 complex and interacts with molecular chaperones like Hsp90 to maintain cellular protein homeostasis (Vassileva2023Small; Asante2014Subunit). NUDCD3's involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function.

## Structure


## Function
NUDCD3 (NudC domain containing 3) encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular processes such as mitosis and intracellular transport. The NUDCD3 protein interacts with the dynein complex, a motor protein responsible for the movement of cellular components along microtubules. This interaction is crucial for proper mitotic spindle function and chromosome segregation during cell division. Depletion of NUDCD3 results in the loss of dynein function, leading to insufficient recruitment of γ-tubulin to spindle poles and mislocalization of the dynein complex during mitosis, highlighting its importance in maintaining dynein complex activity and γ-tubulin localization (Lee2014Singlecell).

NUDCD3 is also involved in ciliogenesis and cilia length control. Its depletion leads to longer cilia and affects the localization of WDR34 around the pericentrosomal region, indicating its necessity for proper cilia formation and length regulation (Asante2014Subunit). Additionally, NUDCD3 localizes to centrosomes and is suggested to play a role in the assembly of dynein-2 within the main body of the cell, although it has not been detected in cilia by immunofluorescence (Asante2014Subunit).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NUDCD3 gene have been implicated in several clinical contexts. In coronary artery disease (CAD), NUDCD3 is among the genes upregulated in affected individuals, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis through its involvement in cell regulation (ARVIND2015Understanding). In cancer, particularly in drug-tolerant cancer cells, NUDCD3 is associated with microtubule stabilization and organization during mitosis. Alterations in its expression or function can impact cell division processes, potentially contributing to drug resistance (Lee2014Singlecell). A specific missense mutation in NUDCD3 (H131D) has been identified in drug-tolerant breast cancer cells, indicating a potential role in the development of drug tolerance (Lee2014Singlecell).

In melanoma, NUDCD3 is involved in BRAF fusion kinases, which can lead to paradoxical activation of the MAPK signaling pathway when treated with RAF inhibitors. This activation is linked to the presence of dimerization domains contributed by NUDCD3, affecting drug responses and suggesting a significant role in melanoma progression (Botton2019Genetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NUDCD3 in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and cardiovascular conditions.

## Interactions
NUDCD3 is known for its specific interactions with proteins containing Kelch domains. It has been shown to copurify with several 3xFLAG-tagged Kelch domain proteins in 293T cells, indicating a strong preference for these interactions (Taipale2014A). This specificity is contrasted with other members of the NUDC family, which interact with different protein domains, such as WD40 and RCC1 repeat proteins (Taipale2014A).

NUDCD3 also plays a role in the assembly and function of the dynein-2 complex. It associates with WDR34, an intermediate chain of the dynein-2 complex, suggesting its involvement in dynein-2 function (Asante2014Subunit). Although NUDCD3 localizes to centrosomes, it has not been detected in cilia, indicating its role is likely in the assembly of dynein-2 within the cell body rather than in cilia (Asante2014Subunit).

NUDCD3 interacts with Hsp90, a molecular chaperone, and is involved in facilitating the transfer of client proteins to Hsp90 by recruiting substrates bound to Hsp40 while excluding Hsp70 (Vassileva2023Small). This interaction is crucial for expediting client activation and maintaining cellular protein homeostasis.
