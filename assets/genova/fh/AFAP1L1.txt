# AFAP1L1

## Overview
AFAP1L1 is a gene that encodes the actin filament associated protein 1 like 1, a member of the actin filament associated protein (AFAP) family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as motility, adhesion, and signaling. AFAP1L1 is characterized by several structural domains, including Src homology 3 (SH3) and Src homology 2 (SH2) binding motifs, pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, and a C-terminal actin-binding domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization to actin-rich structures like invadosomes (Snyder2011AFAP1L1). The protein's involvement in cellular invasion processes and its expression in various tissues, such as the brain and breast, suggest its significance in maintaining cellular architecture and function (Snyder2011AFAP1L1). Additionally, AFAP1L1 has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ren2023Hypoxiainduced; Snyder2024A).

## Structure
AFAP1L1 is a protein encoded by the AFAP1L1 gene, characterized by several structural domains that facilitate its role in actin cytoskeleton organization. The protein consists of 768 amino acids and is encoded by 19 exons located on chromosome 5q33.1 (Snyder2011AFAP1L1). It contains predicted Src homology 3 (SH3) and Src homology 2 (SH2) binding motifs, pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a serine/threonine-rich region, and a C-terminal actin-binding domain (Snyder2011AFAP1L1). The PH domains are structurally similar across the AFAP family and are involved in binding phosphoinositides, linking AFAP1L1 to the plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton (Tie2015Regulation).

The protein's C-terminus includes a leucine zipper or coiled-coil motif, which may facilitate multimerization and interaction with actin filaments (Tie2015Regulation; Snyder2011AFAP1L1). AFAP1L1 is phosphorylated at specific tyrosine residues, such as Y136 and Y566, which are crucial for its function in invadopodia formation and interaction with proteins like Vav2 and Nck2 (Tie2015Regulation). These post-translational modifications are essential for its role in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell signaling pathways (Tie2015Regulation). The protein's ability to form dimers and potentially higher-order multimers is facilitated by its proline-rich motifs (Tie2015Regulation).

## Function
AFAP1L1 is a member of the actin filament associated protein (AFAP) family and plays a significant role in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. It is involved in cellular processes such as motility, adhesion, and signaling pathways by interacting with actin filaments. AFAP1L1 localizes to invadosomes, which are actin-rich structures associated with cell adhesion and invasion, and is known to interact with cortactin, a protein involved in actin branching and invadosome formation (Snyder2024A; Snyder2011AFAP1L1).

In healthy human cells, AFAP1L1 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, where it is found in the Purkinje cell layer and dentate nucleus, suggesting a potential role in motor coordination and neuron-neuron interactions (Snyder2011AFAP1L1). The protein is also present in the contractile myoepithelial cell layer of the breast and the mucous membrane and colonic crypts in the colon, indicating its involvement in maintaining cellular architecture and movement (Snyder2024A; Snyder2011AFAP1L1).

AFAP1L1's interaction with cortactin and its localization to invadosomes suggest it may influence cellular invasion processes, potentially affecting cell shape and motility (Snyder2024A; Takahashi2014AFAP1L1).

## Clinical Significance
AFAP1L1 is implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers, due to its role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cellular signaling. In cancer, AFAP1L1 expression is aberrantly altered, being up-regulated in cancers such as cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), and glioblastoma (GBM), while downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and breast cancer (BRCA). High AFAP1L1 expression is associated with worse overall survival and disease-free survival in certain cancers, highlighting its prognostic significance (Ren2023Hypoxiainduced).

The gene's expression is also linked to pathological neovascularization, a process critical in tumor progression and ocular diseases. AFAP1L1 is upregulated under hypoxic conditions, mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), which enhances its role in angiogenesis. Knockdown of AFAP1L1 in endothelial cells reduces migration and tube formation, indicating its involvement in angiogenesis and potential as a therapeutic target (Ren2023Hypoxiainduced).

AFAP1L1's interaction with cortactin and its localization to invadosomes suggest a role in cancer metastasis, as these structures are involved in cellular invasion. Its ability to induce podosome formation further supports its involvement in cancer cell motility and invasion (Snyder2024A).

## Interactions
AFAP1L1 is an adaptor protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes such as motility and adhesion. It interacts with VAV2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, to activate CDC42 signaling, which is crucial for promoting ITGA5 expression and activating downstream signaling pathways like FAK and ERK in gastric cancer cells (Sun2023AFAP1L1). This interaction is significant for cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer (Sun2023AFAP1L1).

AFAP1L1 also interacts with cortactin, a protein involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. This interaction occurs through the SH3 domain of cortactin, which is distinct from AFAP1's interaction with the Src SH3 domain (Snyder2024A; Snyder2011AFAP1L1). AFAP1L1's interaction with cortactin is significant for its localization to invadosomes, structures involved in cell invasion, and for its potential role in podosome formation (Snyder2024A; Snyder2011AFAP1L1). These interactions suggest that AFAP1L1 plays a unique role in actin filament association and cross-linking, contributing to its function in cellular structural integrity and signaling pathways (Snyder2011AFAP1L1).
