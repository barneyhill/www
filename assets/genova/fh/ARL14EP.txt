# ARL14EP

## Overview
ARL14EP is a gene located on chromosome 11p13, encoding the ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 14 effector protein, which is involved in chromatin regulation and axonal development. The protein, also known as C11orf46, functions primarily as a chromatin regulator and is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with various chromatin-regulatory proteins. Notably, it forms part of the SETDB1-KRAB associated protein (KAP1)-MCAF1 chromatin repressor complex, playing a crucial role in chromatin regulation and neuronal connectivity (Peter2019In). Mutations in ARL14EP have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, underscoring its importance in brain development and function (Peter2019In).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ARL14EP gene, also known as C11orf46, have been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders. Haploinsufficiency of ARL14EP is associated with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, a condition that affects interhemispheric communication and is often observed in individuals with WAGR syndrome, which includes Wilms tumor, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and a range of developmental delays (Peter2019In). The gene is located in the chromosome 11p13 WAGR risk locus, and its deletion is linked to significant differences in corpus callosum volumes, suggesting its critical role in neurodevelopment (Peter2019In).

Mutations such as G218E and R236H in ARL14EP disrupt its interaction with the SETDB1 complex, which is crucial for chromatin regulation. These mutations are associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting the gene's role in axonal development and neuronal connectivity (Peter2019In). The dysregulation of ARL14EP affects the expression of axonal genes, particularly Sema6a, which is essential for midline crossing of callosal projections (Peter2019In). These findings suggest that ARL14EP-mediated epigenomic regulation is vital for proper brain development, and its dysregulation may contribute to various neurodevelopmental conditions.

## Interactions
ARL14EP, also known as C11orf46, is a protein that plays a significant role in chromatin regulation and axonal development through its interactions with various proteins. It is predominantly localized in the nucleus and interacts with chromatin-regulatory proteins. A key interaction is with the SETDB1-KRAB associated protein (KAP1)-MCAF1 chromatin repressor complex, which is a top binding partner of ARL14EP. This interaction is specific to the full-length ARL14EP, as a truncated form lacking the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) shows weak or no interactions with nuclear proteins, including the SETDB1 complex. A point mutation, R236H, in the CRD domain abolishes the interaction with SETDB1, while the deletion of the CRD domain weakens it. Despite these mutations, ARL14EP retains binding affinity with histone H3 (Peter2019In).

ARL14EP is also associated with the SETDB1 complex, a histone-3 lysine-9 trimethyltransferase (H3K9me3) complex, and interacts with nuclear proteins like Lamin B1 (LMNB1) and Lamina-associated protein 2, isoform alpha (LAP2A). These interactions are crucial for chromatin regulation and axonal development (Peter2019In). The protein's interactions with these nuclear components suggest its role as a chromatin regulator in the SETDB1 complex.
