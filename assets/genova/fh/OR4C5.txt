# OR4C5

## Overview
The OR4C5 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 4 subfamily C member 5, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it plays a critical role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. As a transmembrane receptor, OR4C5 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is responsible for binding specific odor molecules, which initiates a cascade of intracellular events leading to the perception of smell (Razmara2021Mechanism; Benetti2020Clinical). Beyond its role in olfaction, OR4C5 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including its potential involvement in immune response and disease susceptibility, such as COVID-19 and glioblastoma (Khan2023Identification; Benetti2020Clinical). Despite these associations, the precise clinical significance of OR4C5 mutations remains an area of active research (Drozd2021A).

## Function
The OR4C5 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Benetti2020Clinical). The OR4C5 protein is involved in olfactory signal transduction, where odorant ligands bind to the receptor, leading to a cascade of events involving the dissociation of the G protein subunit, activation of adenylate cyclase, and generation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). This process results in the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, allowing Ca2+ and Na+ influx, which causes membrane depolarization and ultimately triggers neuronal responses (Razmara2021Mechanism).

In healthy human cells, OR4C5 may also play a role in olfactory function, and its normal functioning could be linked to increased susceptibility to certain conditions, such as COVID-19, as suggested by studies indicating a higher frequency of deleterious mutations in controls compared to COVID-19 patients (Benetti2020Clinical). The gene's expression and potential involvement in immune response and disease susceptibility are areas of ongoing research (Benetti2020Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
The OR4C5 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to COVID-19. A study identified OR4C5 as a protective factor against COVID-19, suggesting that individuals with a higher mutational burden in this gene might have a protective advantage. This is because deleterious mutations in OR4C5 were found more frequently in control groups than in COVID-19 patients, indicating that a more functional OR4C5 gene could be a susceptibility factor for the virus (Benetti2020Clinical). The expression of OR4C5 may trigger natural immunity, potentially leading to virus and cell death, but it could also result in higher liver damage due to its expression in the liver without corresponding mRNA expression (Benetti2020Clinical).

In the context of glioblastoma, OR4C5 was among the genes with a high number of somatic mutations identified in tumor samples, although the specific clinical implications of these mutations in glioblastoma remain unclear (Khan2023Identification). In schizophrenia research, OR4C5 variants were identified but were considered to have benign consequences and not directly linked to disease-causing mutations (Drozd2021A). Overall, while OR4C5 mutations are noted in various studies, their direct clinical significance requires further investigation.
