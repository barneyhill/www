# ZG16B

## Overview
ZG16B is a gene that encodes the zymogen granule protein 16B, a secretory lectin primarily involved in the formation and stabilization of zymogen granules in the pancreas. This protein is characterized by a jacalin-related β-prism fold, which is typical of mannose-binding-type lectins, and plays a significant role in the storage and regulated secretion of digestive enzymes. ZG16B is also expressed in other tissues, such as the lacrimal gland, where it may contribute to ocular surface protection. The protein's interactions with glycosaminoglycans suggest a functional role in glycosaminoglycan binding. In addition to its physiological roles, ZG16B is implicated in cancer progression, particularly in breast and colorectal cancers, where its expression levels are altered. These findings highlight its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Lu2020Identification; Kanagawa2011Crystal; EscuderoPaniagua2019PAUFZG16B).

## Structure
The ZG16B protein, also known as PAUF, exhibits a jacalin-related β-prism fold, a structural motif commonly found in mannose-binding-type lectins. This fold consists of three β-sheets, which is a characteristic feature of this protein family (Kanagawa2011Crystal). Unlike its paralog ZG16p, ZG16B lacks a short α-helix and the β1 strand, which are present in ZG16p (Kanagawa2011Crystal). The protein is likely monomeric in solution, as suggested by its small maximum contact area in crystals and its elution position in size exclusion chromatography (Kanagawa2011Crystal).

ZG16B's sugar-binding site features different amino acid residues compared to ZG16p, indicating altered sugar-binding preferences. A positively charged patch near this site may interact with sulfated groups of glycosaminoglycans, suggesting a functional glycosaminoglycan-binding site (Kanagawa2011Crystal). Unlike ZG16p, ZG16B lacks cysteine residues, which in ZG16p likely form an intramolecular disulfide bridge (Kanagawa2011Crystal). The protein was expressed in E. coli, purified, and crystallized, with its structure solved at a resolution of 2.75 Å (Kanagawa2011Crystal).

## Function
ZG16B (zymogen granule protein 16B) is a secretory lectin protein primarily active in the pancreas, where it plays a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of zymogen granules. These granules are essential for the storage and regulated secretion of digestive enzymes, contributing to efficient digestion and nutrient absorption (Kanagawa2011Crystal). The protein is involved in the condensation-sorting of pancreatic enzymes to the zymogen granule membrane, interacting with glycosaminoglycans, which suggests a potential glycosaminoglycan-binding site (Kanagawa2011Crystal).

ZG16B is also expressed in the lacrimal gland, where it may regulate the exocytosis of secretory proteins in response to neural stimulation, indicating a role in ocular surface protection and retinal homeostasis (Perumal2015Characterization). In the context of type 2 diabetes mellitus, ZG16B expression is reduced in the saliva of patients with poorly controlled diabetes, suggesting that hyperglycemia might affect the secretory function of salivary glands (Jia2021Impact). This protein's involvement in various cellular processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal physiological functions in different tissues.

## Clinical Significance
ZG16B (zymogen granule protein 16B) has been implicated in various cancers, notably breast and colorectal cancer, due to alterations in its expression levels. In breast cancer, ZG16B is significantly upregulated, particularly in luminal-like and triple-negative subtypes, and is associated with tumor progression. Its high expression is linked to a favorable prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. The overexpression of ZG16B in breast cancer may be driven by promoter hypomethylation, which influences tumor progression through interactions with proteins such as UBAC1, LYZ, and CXCR4 (Lu2020Identification).

In colorectal cancer, ZG16B, also known as PAUF, plays a complex role. Initially, its expression declines in early stages but increases at metastatic sites. PAUF/ZG16B is involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and mitotic functions, contributing to cancer progression. Silencing PAUF/ZG16B in colorectal cancer cells leads to chromosomal instability, aneuploidy, and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in maintaining genomic stability. These alterations suggest that PAUF/ZG16B is crucial for cancer progression and may serve as a therapeutic target (EscuderoPaniagua2019PAUFZG16B).

## Interactions
ZG16B, also known as PAUF, is involved in various protein interactions that play a significant role in cancer progression. In colorectal cancer, ZG16B is found in the secretome of metastatic cells and interacts with several proteins involved in critical cellular processes. It interacts with components of the cell cycle, mitotic checkpoint, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Notably, ZG16B interacts with ZW10, a protein involved in membrane trafficking and mitosis, which is crucial for chromosomal instability initiation (EscuderoPaniagua2019PAUFZG16B).

Proteomic analysis has identified 581 proteins associated with ZG16B, highlighting its involvement in processes such as mitotic cell cycle, chromosome organization, and regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Key proteins in these interactions include APC, ANAPC1, ANAPC5, SKA2/3, and NEK9, which are involved in centrosome duplication and chromosome segregation (EscuderoPaniagua2019PAUFZG16B).

In breast cancer, ZG16B is upregulated and interacts with proteins such as UBAC1, LYZ, and CXCR4. It is also co-expressed with ZBTB42 and LYZ, suggesting significant interactions with these proteins (Lu2020Identification). These interactions indicate ZG16B's role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
