# CGB1

## Overview
CGB1 is a gene located on chromosome 19q13.3 that encodes the protein chorionic gonadotropin subunit beta 1, which is part of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) hormone family. This protein is categorized as a hormone subunit and plays a crucial role in reproductive biology, particularly in the maintenance of pregnancy through its involvement in supporting the corpus luteum and promoting progesterone production. Although CGB1 is expressed at lower levels compared to other genes in the hCG beta subunit cluster, its transcription in various tissues, including the placenta, testis, and certain cancer tissues, suggests additional functional roles beyond pregnancy. The gene's expression is modulated by various factors, including growth factors and steroid hormones, and it may serve as a regulatory element within its gene cluster. Alterations in CGB1 expression have been implicated in several cancers, where it may contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer cell invasion, drawing parallels to its role in placental development and implantation (Śliwa2019Regulation; Rull2005Expression; Hallast2007The).

## Structure


## Function
The CGB1 gene is part of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) beta subunit gene cluster, located on chromosome 19q13.3. It is involved in the production of hCG, a hormone essential for maintaining pregnancy by supporting the corpus luteum and promoting progesterone production (Rull2005Expression). Although CGB1 is expressed at low levels compared to other CGB genes, it is transcribed in various tissues, including the placenta, testis, and breast cancer tissue, suggesting a functional role beyond pregnancy (Rull2007Finescale; Hallast2007The).

CGB1 and its closely related gene, CGB2, are hypothesized to encode a novel protein due to frameshifting, which differs from the typical hCG beta subunit. Despite the lack of a known protein product, the presence of mRNA in multiple tissues indicates potential functionality, possibly in implantation and placental development (Hallast2007The). The gene's expression is notably higher in the testis, suggesting a specific role in male reproduction, although this role remains unclear (Rull2007Finescale).

The transcriptional activity of CGB1 is influenced by growth factors, cytokines, and steroid hormones, likely through cAMP-mediated signaling pathways (Casarini2018Two). Despite its low expression levels, CGB1 may act as a regulatory element within the gene cluster, potentially affecting the expression of other CGB genes (Rull2007Finescale).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CGB1 gene have been associated with various cancers. In ovarian cancer, CGB1 expression is linked to DNA demethylation of its promoter regions, which correlates with increased expression of CGB genes. This suggests that CGB1 expression is a unique feature of a subset of ovarian cancers, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis through epigenetic changes and interactions with transcription factors such as TFAP2A and SP3 (Śliwa2019Regulation).

CGB1 expression is also observed in other cancer types, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. The expression levels of CGB1 and its related gene CGB2 are significantly different between non-malignant and primary tumor tissues in several cancers, indicating a potential role in cancer diagnosis or prognosis (Białas2020The).

The expression of CGB1 and CGB2 in cancer tissues may mimic the invasive properties of placental cells, suggesting a role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. This expression pattern is similar to that observed during the first trimester of pregnancy, where it may aid in fetal implantation (Białas2020The).
