# PAG1

## Overview
PAG1, or phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The PAG1 protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and is integral to the modulation of Src family kinases (SFKs) through its interactions within lipid rafts. It is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple phosphorylation sites and motifs for protein-protein interactions, allowing it to serve as a scaffold for signaling complexes. PAG1's function extends to the regulation of receptor signaling and cellular processes such as migration and proliferation, with implications in both normal physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer and psychiatric disorders (Hořejší2004Transmembrane; Hrdinka2013PAG; lin2020pag1).

## Structure
The PAG1 protein, also known as phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains 1, is a transmembrane adaptor protein with a complex molecular structure. It consists of 432 amino acids, including a 16 amino acid extracellular peptide, a 20 amino acid transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic domain rich in functional motifs (Hrdinka2013PAG). The cytoplasmic domain contains 10 tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated, creating SH2 domain binding sites, and two proline-rich motifs for SH3 domain interaction. Additionally, it has a PDZ domain-binding motif at the C terminus (Hrdinka2013PAG).

PAG1 is heavily phosphorylated, which contributes to its migration as a broad band of 80-85 kDa in gel electrophoresis, despite having a theoretical molecular weight of approximately 48 kDa. This discrepancy is due to phosphorylation, lipid modifications like palmitoylation, and a high content of acidic amino acids (Hrdinka2013PAG). Palmitoylation of cysteine residues near the transmembrane domain is crucial for its localization in lipid rafts (Draberova2014Transmembrane; Hrdinka2013PAG). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various proteins, including Src family kinases, through SH2 domain interactions, and it plays a significant role in signal transduction pathways (Hrdinka2013PAG).

## Function
PAG1, also known as phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains, is a transmembrane adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling in healthy human cells. In resting T cells, PAG1 is heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated, which recruits the protein tyrosine kinase CSK (carboxy-terminal SRC kinase) to the plasma membrane. This recruitment leads to the phosphorylation of the negative regulatory C-terminal tyrosine residue of the SRC kinase LCK, resulting in an inactive conformation of the kinase, thereby inhibiting TCR-mediated signaling in the absence of antigen (Hořejší2004Transmembrane).

PAG1 is also involved in the regulation of receptor signaling within lipid rafts, which are membrane microdomains with specific lipid and protein compositions. These microdomains are implicated in receptor signaling and other physiologically important phenomena (Hrdinka2013PAG). PAG1 interacts with several proteins, including Csk, Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Shc, and PI3K, and its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are regulated by multiple phosphatases, including CD45 and Shp-2 (Hrdinka2013PAG). PAG1's role extends to the regulation of SRC kinase activity, maintaining an inhibitory state by phosphorylating C-termini inhibitory tyrosines of Src kinases (Strazza2021Transmembrane).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PAG1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and psychiatric disorders. In schizophrenia, PAG1 is involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Although certain missense variants in PAG1 were identified in schizophrenia patients, no significant association with the disorder was found in a large case-control study, nor were there differences in PAG1 expression levels between patients and controls (Balan2014Sequencing).

In cancer, PAG1 plays a role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), PAG1 is upregulated and promotes cell proliferation and metastasis by downregulating PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene. This interaction is crucial for NPC's malignant progression, suggesting that targeting the PAG1/PTEN axis could be a therapeutic strategy (lin2020pag1). In laryngeal carcinoma, PAG1 contributes to radioresistance through its interaction with integrin β1 in lipid rafts, highlighting its potential role in resistance to radiotherapy (Dong2018Identification). In breast cancer, PAG1 upregulation is associated with increased chemoresistance and tumor progression, mediated through the Src and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways (Lu2017Upregulation).

## Interactions
PAG1, also known as phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains, is a transmembrane adaptor protein that participates in various protein interactions crucial for cellular signaling. It interacts with the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), a negative regulator of Src family kinases (SFKs), by recruiting Csk to lipid rafts, thereby modulating SFK activity (Hrdinka2013PAG). PAG1 is heavily phosphorylated by SFKs such as Fyn in T cells and Lyn in B cells, which facilitates its interaction with SH2 domain-containing proteins (Hrdinka2013PAG).

PAG1 also forms complexes with various proteins, including Lck, Shc, Vav, GAP, PI3K, ZAP-70, and Syk, through SH2 domain interactions, influencing multiple signaling pathways (Hrdinka2013PAG). In T cells, PAG1 interacts with proteins such as ZAP-70, GRB2, NCK1, and CRKL, playing a role in T cell receptor signaling (Reginald2015Revisiting). Additionally, PAG1's interaction with the actin cytoskeleton via PDZ-EBP50-ezrin affects cell migration and RhoA activity, highlighting its role in cellular structural organization (Hrdinka2013PAG). These interactions underscore PAG1's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and regulation.
