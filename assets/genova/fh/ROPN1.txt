# ROPN1

## Overview
ROPN1, or rhophilin associated tail protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to sperm motility and fertility. The protein, categorized as a component of the fibrous sheath in the sperm flagellum, is involved in the regulation of sperm motility through its interactions with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), particularly AKAP3. This interaction is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm's principal piece and is essential for proper sperm function (Pelloni2017Molecular; Fiedler2013Loss). ROPN1 is also implicated in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathways, which are vital for sperm capacitation and motility (Fiedler2013Loss). Beyond its role in reproduction, ROPN1 is recognized as a cancer-testis antigen, with potential implications in cancer immunotherapy, particularly in melanoma and BRCA1-mutated breast cancers (Da2021Ropporin1; Arakelyan2021Transcriptome). The protein's evolutionary conservation underscores its essential role in flagellar and ciliary function across species (Newell2008Protein).

## Structure
ROPN1, also known as rhophilin associated tail protein 1, is a protein that plays a crucial role in sperm motility. It is part of the R2D2 protein family and contains a highly conserved RII dimerization/docking (R2D2) domain, which is similar to the domain found in the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) (Newell2008Protein). This domain facilitates interactions with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), although ROPN1 does not bind cAMP, unlike the RII subunit of PKA (Newell2008Protein).

The protein is expressed in the sperm flagellum, specifically in the fibrous sheath, and is involved in the regulation of sperm motility (Pelloni2017Molecular). ROPN1 has a coiled-coil domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions and can form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure (FuentesAlbero2021Protein). It also undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which regulate its interaction with other proteins like rhophilin (Pelloni2017Molecular).

ROPN1 is expressed in various tissues and has splice variant isoforms that may affect its function (Newell2008Protein). The protein's evolutionary conservation, particularly in ciliated organisms, suggests its essential role in maintaining flagellar and ciliary function (Newell2008Protein).

## Function
ROPN1, also known as rhophilin associated tail protein 1, is a protein primarily expressed in the flagellum of sperm cells, where it plays a crucial role in sperm motility and fertility. It is a component of the fibrous sheath of the mammalian sperm flagella and is involved in regulating sperm motility by interacting with A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), particularly AKAP3 (Pelloni2017Molecular; Fiedler2013Loss). ROPN1 binds to AKAP3, which is a major protein of the fibrous sheath, and this interaction is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm's principal piece (Fiedler2013Loss).

ROPN1 is involved in cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathways, which are crucial for sperm capacitation and motility (Fiedler2013Loss). The protein's role in these pathways suggests it may act as a regulatory subunit similar to PKA's RII subunit, facilitating signal transduction necessary for sperm function (Fiedler2013Loss). In humans, ROPN1 expression is higher in sperm from normozoospermic samples compared to asthenozoospermic samples, indicating its importance in normal sperm motility (Pelloni2017Molecular). The protein's activity is localized to the principal and end pieces of the sperm flagella, where it contributes to the regulation of sperm motility and overall fertility (Pelloni2017Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ROPN1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly those affecting sperm motility and male fertility. In the context of asthenozoospermia, a condition characterized by reduced sperm motility, ROPN1 is significantly downregulated. This downregulation correlates with impaired sperm motility, suggesting that ROPN1 expression is crucial for normal flagellar function and male fertility (Pelloni2017Molecular). 

Beyond reproductive health, ROPN1 has been implicated in cancer. It is classified as a cancer-testis antigen, which makes it a potential target for cancer immunotherapy. ROPN1 is overexpressed in certain cancers, such as melanoma, where it evokes strong immune responses, indicating its potential as a target for vaccine development (Da2021Ropporin1). Additionally, ROPN1 is associated with cancer stem cell characteristics in BRCA1-mutated breast cancers, suggesting a role in cancer progression and metastasis (Arakelyan2021Transcriptome). 

In summary, ROPN1's altered expression is linked to male infertility and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in these conditions.

## Interactions
ROPN1, also known as rhophilin associated tail protein 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly in the context of sperm motility and structural integrity. ROPN1 interacts with A-kinase anchoring protein 3 (AKAP3) within the fibrous sheath of sperm, a crucial interaction for the proper assembly and function of the sperm tail. This binding is phospho-regulated and essential for maintaining the fibrous sheath's integrity, as evidenced by defects observed in ROPN1 knockout models (Fiedler2013Loss).

ROPN1 also forms complexes with rhophilin-1 (RHPN1) and RhoA, which are vital for activating RhoA signaling pathways. This interaction is significant in promoting cell motility and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by enhancing actin stress fiber formation (Liu2020Rhophilin‐associated). The interaction between ROPN1 and RHPN1 is necessary for RhoA activation, as silencing RHPN1 disrupts this process (Liu2020Rhophilin‐associated).

Additionally, ROPN1 interacts with other proteins such as CABYR and SPA17, as indicated by yeast-two hybrid studies, suggesting a role in anchoring signaling pathways that regulate motility (Fiedler2013Loss). These interactions highlight ROPN1's multifaceted role in cellular motility and structural integrity.
