# SGK1

## Overview
SGK1, or serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase belonging to the AGC family of kinases. The SGK1 protein plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including ion transport, cell survival, and stress response. It is activated through phosphorylation, which is mediated by signaling pathways involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and other kinases such as PDK1 and mTORC2 (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 2 of 12; Lu2011mSIN1 page 2 of 5). SGK1 is involved in the regulation of ion channels and transporters, influencing physiological functions such as sodium retention, potassium excretion, and blood pressure regulation (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 10 of 12). Additionally, SGK1 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and cancer, where its expression and activity can serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers (Sang2021SGK1; Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 9 of 12).

## Structure
SGK1, or serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1, is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the AGC family of protein kinases. Its primary structure includes a kinase domain, an N-terminal phox homology domain, and a C-terminal hydrophobic motif (Jang2022Serum). The kinase domain of SGK1 shares 45%-60% sequence homology with other serine/threonine protein kinases and features a typical protein kinase folding pattern with β-strand structures at the N-terminus and α-helical structures at the C-terminus (Jang2022Serum). 

In its inactive form, SGK1 lacks the αC helix, which forms upon activation through phosphorylation at Thr256, leading to conformational changes that make the active SGK1 structure resemble other protein kinases (Akhoon2019Computational). The active conformation is characterized by the assembly of the regulatory spine and the DFG motif shifting to an 'in' conformation, which is crucial for its kinase activity (Akhoon2019Computational).

SGK1 undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation at specific residues such as Thr256 and Ser422, which are essential for its activation and function (Jang2022Serum; Cicenas2022SGK1). These modifications influence the protein's stability and activity, playing a significant role in its regulatory mechanisms (Tessier2006Serum).

## Function
SGK1 (serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in the regulation of ion channels and transporters, significantly impacting sodium retention and potassium excretion, which are vital for maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure regulation (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 10 of 12). SGK1 is activated by phosphorylation through a signaling cascade involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), PDK1, and PDK2, and is maximally activated when phosphorylated at two key sites: 256 Thr and 422 Ser (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 2 of 12).

In the cardiovascular system, SGK1 influences blood pressure by affecting sodium reabsorption in the kidneys and regulating cardiac ion channels, which are crucial for cardiac action potential (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 9 of 12). In the neuromuscular system, SGK1 upregulates glutamate transporters and the kainate receptor GluR6, contributing to synaptic transmission and plasticity, and is involved in memory consolidation (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 9 of 12). SGK1 also plays a role in glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose transporters, enhancing glucose uptake, and influencing glycogen synthase activity (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 7 of 12). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, impacting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and stress response (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 0 of 12).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SGK1 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In the cardiovascular system, SGK1 influences blood pressure regulation through its effects on sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, with certain gene variants linked to increased blood pressure and metabolic syndrome, characterized by hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 9 of 12; Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 10 of 12). In the neurological domain, SGK1 is involved in neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity, with dysregulation potentially contributing to conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease through altered glutamate clearance and receptor activity (Lang2006(Patho)physiological page 11 of 12).

In cancer, SGK1 expression is often dysregulated, acting as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. High SGK1 expression is associated with poor outcomes in cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and gastric cancer, while low expression correlates with poor survival in glioblastoma multiforme (Sang2021SGK1). SGK1 also contributes to therapy resistance, particularly in prostate cancer and NSCLC (Sang2021SGK1). Mutations in SGK1, such as K127M and T256A, can lead to significant conformational changes and functional loss, contributing to disease progression (AlAjmi2021Impact).

## Interactions
SGK1 (serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its regulatory functions. SGK1 interacts with the mTORC2 complex through the mSIN1 protein, which is crucial for its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (Lu2011mSIN1). The interaction between SGK1 and mSIN1 is essential for SGK1's hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation, which is necessary for its activation and function in ENaC regulation (Lu2011mSIN1).

SGK1 also interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, inhibiting its activity and preventing the degradation of ENaC, thereby promoting its expression on the cell surface (Soundararajan2009Epithelial). This interaction is enhanced by GILZ1, which acts as a scaffolding protein, facilitating the recruitment of SGK1 into a regulatory complex that includes Raf-1 and Nedd4-2 (Soundararajan2009Epithelial).

SGK1's interaction with PDK1 is mediated through the PIF-binding pocket, which is essential for its phosphorylation and activation. This interaction is dependent on prior phosphorylation at SGK1's hydrophobic motif, which enhances its binding to PDK1 (Biondi2001The). These interactions collectively highlight SGK1's role in regulating ion transport and cellular signaling pathways.
