# KRT86

## Overview
KRT86 is a gene that encodes keratin 86, a type II hair keratin protein, which is integral to the structural framework of hair and nails. As a member of the keratin family, keratin 86 is categorized as an intermediate filament protein, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers. The protein is predominantly expressed in hair follicle cells, where it contributes to the formation of keratin intermediate filaments, essential for hair shaft integrity. Beyond its structural role, keratin 86 is involved in cellular processes such as stress response and cytoarchitecture. Mutations in the KRT86 gene are linked to monilethrix, a genetic disorder affecting hair structure, and the gene's expression is also significant in uterine epithelium during early pregnancy, indicating its broader biological importance (Zhang2020Keratin; Schweizer2007Hair; Chamcheu2011Keratin).

## Structure
The KRT86 gene encodes a type II hair keratin protein, which is a crucial component of the structural framework of hair and nails. The protein structure is organized into a head-rod-tail domain configuration, typical of keratins. The central rod domain is composed of α-helical coiled-coil structures, which are essential for the formation of keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) (Chamcheu2011Keratin). This rod domain is divided into four helical segments (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) interrupted by non-helical linkers, with heptad repeats that facilitate coiled-coil dimerization (Chamcheu2011Keratin). 

The helix initiation motifs (HIMs) and helix termination motifs (HTMs) within the rod domain are highly conserved and critical for filament assembly, making them hotspots for mutations associated with keratin disorders like monilethrix (Chamcheu2011Keratin). The quaternary structure involves the formation of heterodimers through coiled-coil interactions, which align to form tetramers and eventually mature KIFs (Ho2022Update). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, influencing the protein's function and stability, although specific modifications for KRT86 are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
Keratin 86 (KRT86) is a type II hair keratin protein that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and mechanical strength of hair fibers. In healthy human cells, KRT86 is primarily active in hair follicle cells, where it contributes to the formation of intermediate filaments. These filaments are essential for providing resilience and stability to the hair shaft, ensuring proper hair formation and maintenance (Wu2012A; Ramot2009Endocrine).

KRT86 is involved in the assembly of coiled-coil dimers, which are critical for the structural integrity of keratins. This assembly process is facilitated by the highly conserved helix initiation and termination motifs within the protein, which are essential for filament formation (Chamcheu2011Keratin). The protein's role extends beyond structural support, as it is also implicated in the regulation of cellular processes such as stress response and cytoarchitecture (Chamcheu2011Keratin).

In addition to its role in hair, KRT86 is expressed in the uterine epithelium during early pregnancy, where it is regulated by estrogen. This expression is important for maintaining the cytoskeleton's viscoelasticity and flexibility, which are crucial for successful embryo implantation (Zhang2020Keratin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KRT86 gene are primarily associated with monilethrix, a rare autosomal dominant hair disorder characterized by fragile, beaded hair that breaks easily, often leading to scarring alopecia and follicular hyperkeratosis on the neck and extremities (De2012A; van2015Novel). The condition exhibits phenotypic variability, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, and can show incomplete penetrance, meaning not all individuals carrying the mutation will exhibit symptoms (De2012A). 

Monilethrix is most commonly caused by mutations in the KRT81 and KRT86 genes, with novel mutations in KRT86 expanding the known mutational spectrum (van2015Novel). A specific mutation, A280V (c.839C > T), has been identified in the coil 2A region of KRT86, marking the first mutation found outside the typical helix initiation and termination motifs of type II hair keratins (De2012A).

Alterations in KRT86 expression have also been implicated in conditions beyond hair disorders. For instance, KRT86 is upregulated in the uterine endometrium during embryo implantation, suggesting a role in uterine receptivity and potential implications for fertility treatments (Zhang2020Keratin). Additionally, KRT86 methylation has been studied as a prognostic biomarker in epithelial ovarian cancer, although its independent prognostic value remains limited (Heinze2021CAMK2N1RUNX3).

## Interactions
KRT86, or keratin 86, is a type II hair keratin that plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of hair fibers. It interacts with other keratins to form intermediate filaments, which are essential for the mechanical stability of hair. These interactions involve the formation of heterodimers with type I keratins, contributing to the assembly of keratin filaments in hair follicles (Barthélemy2012Proteomic; Cruz2017Peptide—protein).

The interactions between KRT86 and keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) are also significant. These interactions are primarily driven by hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds, which are crucial for the structural integrity and strength of hair fibers (Cruz2017Peptide—protein). The presence of post-translational modifications, such as dimethylation and trioxidation, on KRT86 suggests complex interactions that may influence its function and stability (Barthélemy2012Proteomic).

KRT86 is also implicated in genetic disorders such as monilethrix, where mutations in the gene can disrupt its interactions and lead to hair shaft deformities (Schweizer2007Hair). These mutations highlight the importance of KRT86's interactions in maintaining normal hair structure.
