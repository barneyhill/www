# SMCHD1

## Overview
The SMCHD1 gene encodes the protein structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1, which is a multifunctional chromatin-associated protein involved in gene regulation and chromatin organization. This protein is categorized as a chromatin modifier and plays a pivotal role in processes such as X chromosome inactivation and the regulation of autosomal gene clusters, including imprinted genes and the protocadherin gene cluster (Mould2013Smchd1; Mason2017SMCHD1). SMCHD1 is characterized by its unique structural domains, including an N-terminal GHKL-ATPase domain and a C-terminal SMC-hinge domain, which facilitate its dimerization and interaction with chromatin (Chen2020Crystal; Pedersen2019A). The protein's ability to act as both a transcriptional repressor and activator underscores its versatility in gene regulation (Wong2024SMCHD1). Mutations in SMCHD1 are linked to diseases such as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 and Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance (Larsen2014Diagnostic; Gordon2017De).

## Structure
The SMCHD1 protein is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. It features an N-terminal GHKL-ATPase domain, which is part of a superfamily known for an unconventional ATP-binding fold called the Bergerat fold. This domain includes a central ATP-binding pocket and a transducer domain, which undergoes conformational changes upon ATP binding and hydrolysis, facilitating dimerization and stabilization (Pedersen2019A). The N-terminal region also contains a unique ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain that contributes to dimerization but does not affect ATPase activity (Pedersen2019A).

The C-terminal region of SMCHD1 contains a SMC-hinge domain, which is crucial for homodimerization and chromatin association. This hinge domain forms a doughnut-shaped dimer and is involved in nucleic acid binding, with specific residues like Arg 1848 and Arg 1867 playing key roles in chromatin localization (Chen2020Crystal). The hinge domain's structure is distinct from canonical SMC proteins, featuring longer helices and different secondary structural elements (Chen2020Crystal).

SMCHD1 is also subject to post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and exists in several splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and interactions.

## Function
The SMCHD1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in chromatin organization and gene regulation in healthy human cells. It is involved in X chromosome inactivation (XCI), a process essential for dosage compensation in female mammals, by maintaining DNA methylation patterns and ensuring proper gene silencing on the inactive X chromosome (Wang2019Role; Mould2013Smchd1). SMCHD1 also regulates the expression of autosomal gene clusters, including imprinted genes and the protocadherin (PCDH) gene cluster, by binding to specific regulatory sites and influencing DNA methylation (Mason2017SMCHD1).

In addition to its role in XCI, SMCHD1 is crucial for the proliferation of human myoblasts, acting as a transcriptional activator for genes involved in cell cycle progression, such as LAP2 (Wong2024SMCHD1). The protein's activity is not limited to muscle cells; it is also necessary for the proliferation of other stem cell populations, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions (Wong2024SMCHD1). SMCHD1's dual role as both a transcriptional repressor and activator, depending on the genomic context, underscores its versatility in gene regulation (Wong2024SMCHD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SMCHD1 gene are associated with several diseases, most notably facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (FSHD2) and Bosma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome (BAMS). In FSHD2, SMCHD1 mutations lead to hypomethylation of the D4Z4 region on chromosome 4, resulting in the inappropriate expression of the DUX4 gene, which is implicated in muscle degeneration (Larsen2014Diagnostic; Goossens2019Intronic). These mutations can include missense, nonsense, splice site variants, and insertions/deletions, which disrupt normal splicing and lead to frameshifts and premature stop codons (Hamanaka2016Clinical; Goossens2019Intronic). 

In BAMS, de novo missense mutations in the extended ATPase domain of SMCHD1 are responsible for the condition, which is characterized by nasal and ocular abnormalities. These mutations may exhibit gain-of-function or neomorphic activity, contrasting with the loss-of-function mutations seen in FSHD2 (Gordon2017De). 

SMCHD1 mutations can also act as modifiers of disease severity in FSHD1, where they exacerbate symptoms by further reducing D4Z4 methylation levels (Larsen2014Diagnostic). The gene's role in chromatin organization and gene regulation underscores its significance in these conditions.

## Interactions
SMCHD1 is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in chromatin organization and gene regulation. It interacts with RUVBL1, a significant interactor involved in the repression of the DUX4 gene, which is implicated in Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). This interaction is crucial for maintaining the repressive state of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat on chromosome 4q, which contains the DUX4 locus (Goossens2021A). 

SMCHD1 also interacts with EZHIP, a protein that inhibits global H3K27me3 deposition by the Polycomb repressive complex PRC2, although this interaction is not relevant in muscle cells where EZHIP is not expressed (Goossens2021A). 

In addition to protein interactions, SMCHD1's hinge domain is involved in nucleic acid binding, facilitated by clusters of positively charged residues that enhance its interaction with nucleic acids (Chen2020Crystal). 

SMCHD1's interaction with RAD21, a component of the cohesin complex, suggests a role in chromatin structure regulation, although the necessity of this interaction for DUX4 silencing remains unclear (Goossens2021A). These interactions highlight SMCHD1's role in chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation.
