# RAB6C

## Overview
RAB6C is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein involved in intracellular trafficking processes. The RAB6C protein is distinct from other members of the RAB6 family due to its unique localization to the centrosome and its specialized role in cell division, rather than being associated with the Golgi apparatus like its counterparts (Fohlin2019RAB6C). Functionally, RAB6C is implicated in regulating vesicle transport and membrane trafficking, processes essential for cellular homeostasis and protein sorting. It has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor, given its ability to inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, while promoting apoptosis (Fohlin2019RAB6C). The gene's expression varies with tissue type and is notably lower in highly metastatic cells, suggesting its involvement in cancer biology. RAB6C's interactions with microRNAs and tumor suppressor proteins further underscore its significance in cellular processes and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (He2021Rab6c).

## Structure


## Function
RAB6C is a member of the RAB6 family of small GTPases, which are involved in intracellular trafficking processes. In healthy human cells, RAB6C is primarily localized to the centrosome and plays a significant role in cell division. Unlike other RAB6 family proteins that are located in the Golgi apparatus, RAB6C is distinct in its function and localization, suggesting a specialized role in cellular processes (Fohlin2019RAB6C).

The protein encoded by the RAB6C gene is involved in regulating vesicle transport and membrane trafficking, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting. These processes impact cellular communication and function, highlighting the importance of RAB6C in normal cellular activities (Fohlin2019RAB6C).

RAB6C has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, and it promotes apoptosis. Its expression is associated with tissue type, with lower levels observed in cells with high metastatic ability compared to normal tissue. This suggests that RAB6C may act as a tumor suppressor, although its precise function in healthy cells is not fully elucidated (Fohlin2019RAB6C).

## Clinical Significance
RAB6C has been identified as a significant prognostic factor in breast cancer, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-negative (ER+/PR-) cases. High expression of RAB6C is associated with a reduced risk of distant recurrence in these patients, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Fohlin2019RAB6C). The gene's expression is linked to favorable prognostic factors, such as lower tumor grade and decreased recurrence rates, especially in ER+/PR- breast cancer (Fohlin2019RAB6C).

In contrast, RAB6C expression in bladder cancer is associated with tumor progression. It is upregulated in bladder cancer tissues and promotes cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion. This effect is regulated by miR-218, which targets RAB6C, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in bladder cancer (He2021Rab6c).

RAB6C's role in breast cancer treatment response has also been studied. Low RAB6C expression in ER+/PR- breast cancer is associated with a significant benefit from tamoxifen treatment, indicating that RAB6C expression levels could guide personalized treatment strategies (Fohlin2020Low). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RAB6C in cancer prognosis and treatment.

## Interactions
RAB6C, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It has been identified as a target of miR-218, a microRNA that regulates its expression. In bladder cancer, RAB6C is upregulated, while miR-218 is downregulated. The interaction between RAB6C and miR-218 is characterized by a conserved binding site in the 3'UTR of RAB6C mRNA, allowing miR-218 to downregulate RAB6C expression. This interaction was confirmed using a dual luciferase reporter assay, demonstrating that miR-218 can bind to and inhibit RAB6C, affecting cancer cell proliferation and invasion (He2021Rab6c).

RAB6C also interacts with the p53 protein, a critical tumor suppressor often mutated in cancers. This interaction suggests a pathway through which RAB6C may exert its effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis, particularly in breast cancer. High RAB6C expression is associated with reduced recurrence risk in estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer, indicating its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Fohlin2019RAB6C). These interactions highlight RAB6C's involvement in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.
