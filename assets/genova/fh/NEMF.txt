# NEMF

## Overview
The NEMF gene encodes the nuclear export mediator factor protein, which plays a pivotal role in the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway. This protein is essential for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by resolving stalled ribosomes during translation, a process that can prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic proteins. NEMF is characterized by its structural domains, including helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) domains and a coiled-coil region, which facilitate its interactions with ribosomal subunits and other proteins involved in the RQC pathway (Burroughs2014A). Functionally, NEMF is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of aberrant nascent polypeptides, thereby protecting cells from protein aggregation and neurodegeneration (Martin2020NEMF; Joazeiro2019Mechanisms). Mutations in the NEMF gene have been linked to various neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Martin2020NEMF; Ahmed2020Biallelic).

## Structure
The NEMF (nuclear export mediator factor) protein is part of a highly conserved gene family characterized by specific structural domains. Its primary structure includes a sequence of amino acids encoded by the NEMF gene, featuring an uncharacterized N-terminal domain, two helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) domains, a coiled-coil region, and a domain annotated as DUF814 (Burroughs2014A). In eukaryotes and archaea, an additional C-terminal domain, DUF3441, also known as the NFACT-C domain, is present and is predicted to adopt an α/β fold, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Burroughs2014A).

The NEMF protein is involved in ribosome-associated quality control, where it plays a role in processes like splicing and rRNA biogenesis (Burroughs2014A). It is also associated with RNA-binding roles, as suggested by the presence of the DUF814 domain, which is linked to RNA modification and translation (Burroughs2014A). The protein's involvement in ribosomal quality control is further highlighted by its interaction with the 60S ribosome to facilitate ubiquitination (PlessisBelair2024NEMF). The NEMF protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and can exist in different functional forms due to splice variant isoforms.

## Function
The NEMF gene encodes a protein that is integral to the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis in cells. In healthy human cells, NEMF is involved in resolving stalled ribosomes during translation, a process that can occur due to the absence of termination codons or a deficiency of charged tRNAs. When ribosomes stall, they sequester ribosomal subunits and produce incomplete polypeptide chains that can be toxic. NEMF recognizes the aberrant nascent chain-tRNA/60S structure and facilitates the recruitment of the E3 ligase LTN1, which ubiquitinates the nascent chain, leading to its degradation by the proteasome (Martin2020NEMF; Joazeiro2019Mechanisms).

NEMF also catalyzes the C-terminal elongation of 60S-anchored nascent chains with untemplated alanine and threonine tails (CAT tails), which assist in protein degradation. This function is crucial for maintaining translational homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic proteins, thereby protecting neurons from degeneration (Martin2020NEMF; Joazeiro2019Mechanisms). NEMF operates in the cytoplasm as part of the RQC complex, which includes the ubiquitin ligase LTN1, and plays a role in managing stalled nascent chains that can become non-functional and prone to aggregation (Ennis2024NEMFmediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NEMF gene are associated with a range of neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases. These mutations can impair the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, leading to motor neuron degeneration and neuromuscular diseases in both humans and mouse models (Martin2020NEMF). Patients with NEMF mutations may exhibit symptoms such as intellectual disability, speech delays, axonal neuropathy, spastic paraplegia, hypotonia, and peripheral neuropathy (Martin2020NEMF). 

Biallelic loss-of-function variants in NEMF have been linked to central nervous system impairments and axonal polyneuropathy, affecting axonal outgrowth and synapse development (Ahmed2020Biallelic). In mouse models, specific NEMF mutations, such as R86S and R487G, lead to nuclear transport defects and protein mislocalization, contributing to neurodegenerative disease hallmarks like TDP-43 pathology (PlessisBelair2024NEMF). These mutations disrupt Importin-β's function, causing transcriptional dysregulation and protein aggregation, which are characteristic of diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (PlessisBelair2024NEMF).

## Interactions
NEMF (nuclear export mediator factor) is a key component of the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) pathway, interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids to maintain protein homeostasis. NEMF binds to the 60S ribosomal subunit, where it plays a crucial role in recognizing stalled ribosomes and facilitating the recruitment of the E3 ligase LTN1, which ubiquitinates nascent chains for degradation (Martin2020NEMF). NEMF also interacts with tRNA, particularly tRNA-Ala, to add C-terminal alanine tails to nascent polypeptides, marking them for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Thrun2021Convergence).

NEMF's interaction with Importin-β is significant, especially in the context of nuclear transport. Mutations in NEMF, such as the R86S mutation, lead to defects in Importin-β-mediated nuclear import, resulting in the cytoplasmic accumulation of ribosomal products (PlessisBelair2024Importinβ; PlessisBelair2024NEMF). This interaction is crucial for the proper localization of proteins with nuclear localization sequences and is implicated in neurodegenerative disease phenotypes (PlessisBelair2024NEMF).

NEMF also interacts with other E3 ligases, such as Pirh2 and KLHDC10, in a Listerin-independent manner, facilitating the degradation of Ala-tailed ribosome stalling products (Thrun2021Convergence). These interactions highlight NEMF's central role in protein quality control and its potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases.
