# COA3

## Overview
The COA3 gene encodes the cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 3, a mitochondrial membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a critical component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is categorized as an assembly factor, essential for the biogenesis of COX by stabilizing its subunits and facilitating their proper integration into the mitochondrial membrane. COA3 is part of the MITRAC complex, which is involved in the early stages of COX assembly, ensuring the correct synthesis and maturation of COX1, the first subunit of the COX complex. The protein's intrinsically disordered nature and oligomeric state allow it to interact flexibly with other mitochondrial proteins, which is crucial for its function in maintaining respiratory competence and efficient ATP production (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial; Neira2016Human; Mick2010Coa3).

## Structure
The human COA3 protein, also known as MITRAC12 or CCDC56, is a 106-residue polypeptide essential for the formation of the catalytic core of cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Its primary structure lacks disulfide bridges or free cysteine residues and includes a unique tryptophan and three tyrosines, with a high abundance of charged amino acids suggesting large unstructured regions (Neira2016Human). COA3 is characterized as an intrinsically disordered protein, lacking stable secondary or tertiary structures and existing as an ensemble of rapidly interconverting structures (Neira2016Human).

The secondary structure of COA3 includes a single transmembrane domain (residues 58 to 78) and a coiled-coil domain (residues 79 to 104) (Neira2016Human). Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates a composition of 8% α-helix, 44% β-sheet, and 48% random coil, although these results are inconsistent with theoretical predictions (Neira2016Human). The tertiary structure is not well-defined, as the protein lacks a rigid conformation (Neira2016Human).

COA3 is oligomeric in aqueous solution, forming aggregates of different molecular masses, with hydrodynamic experiments indicating multiple self-associated species and oligomerization equilibria (Neira2016Human). The protein's flexibility is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, facilitating mitochondrial protein translocation and assembly of proteins involved in the respiratory chain (Neira2016Human).

## Function
COA3, also known as cytochrome c oxidase assembly factor 3, is a mitochondrial membrane protein that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), a key component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In healthy human cells, COA3 is part of the MITRAC complex, which includes COX1, COX14, and CMC1, and is involved in the early stages of COX assembly. COA3, along with COX14, stabilizes specific COX1 transmembrane helices during synthesis, preventing premature degradation and ensuring proper insertion and maturation of COX1 (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial).

COA3 is essential for the negative feedback regulation of COX1 translation, working in conjunction with COX14 to sequester the translational activator Mss51 in an inactive state, thereby controlling COX1 synthesis. This regulation ensures that COX1 synthesis is coordinated with the availability of other COX subunits, such as COX4, facilitating the proper assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase complex (Mick2010Coa3).

The absence of COA3 leads to increased COX1 synthesis and rapid turnover of newly synthesized COX1, highlighting its role in maintaining respiratory competence and preventing respiratory deficiencies (Mick2010Coa3). COA3's function is critical for efficient ATP production and cellular energy metabolism, underscoring its importance in mitochondrial function (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COA3 gene are associated with isolated complex IV deficiency, a condition that affects the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This deficiency is linked to a range of clinical manifestations, including neuropathy, exercise intolerance, obesity, and short stature (Ostergaard2015Mutations). The study by Ostergaard et al. identified two pathogenic variants in the COA3 gene: c.199dupC, which causes a frameshift and premature stop codon, and c.215A>G, a missense mutation resulting in an amino acid change from tyrosine to cysteine (Ostergaard2015Mutations). These mutations lead to a significant reduction in COA3 protein levels, impairing the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) (Ostergaard2015Mutations).

The COA3 gene plays a critical role in stabilizing the COX1 subunit, essential for the proper assembly of the COX holoenzyme. The deficiency in COX assembly due to COA3 mutations results in decreased COX activity, contributing to the clinical symptoms observed in affected individuals (Ostergaard2015Mutations). The pathogenicity of these mutations was confirmed by expressing wild-type COA3 in patient fibroblasts, which corrected the COX assembly defect and normalized COX1 levels (Ostergaard2015Mutations). The clinical presentation of COA3-related deficiencies is generally milder compared to other severe COX assembly defects, which are often fatal early in life (Ostergaard2015Mutations).

## Interactions
The human COA3 protein, also known as MITRAC12 or CCDC56, is involved in the assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) complex, a crucial component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. COA3 interacts with the first subunit protein of COX to form its catalytic core and promotes its assemblage with other units, playing a significant role in COX biogenesis (Neira2016Human). The protein is described as oligomeric and highly flexible, with a high percentage of secondary structure that is not rigid, suggesting it may fold into a defined structure only in the presence of binding partners (Neira2016Human). This flexibility is crucial for its interaction with other proteins, facilitating mitochondrial protein translocation and assembly of proteins involved in the respiratory chain (Neira2016Human).

COA3 is characterized by intrinsically disordered regions, with a single transmembrane domain and a coiled-coil domain, which contribute to its high flexibility and low degree of order in large regions of its structure (Neira2016Human). The protein's interactions are important for the early steps of complex IV biogenesis and the translocation machinery at the inner mitochondrial membrane (Neira2016Human).
