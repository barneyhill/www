# C17orf49

## Overview
C17orf49 is a gene located on chromosome 17 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 17 open reading frame 49. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are still being elucidated. It is categorized as a non-kinase protein and has been implicated in the regulation of certain signaling pathways, such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway, which plays a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the interactions and functions of the protein encoded by C17orf49 is crucial for comprehending its potential implications in human health and disease.
