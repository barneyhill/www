# NAPA

## Overview
The NAPA gene encodes the protein alpha-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (αSNAP), which is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in vesicular transport and autophagy. As an adaptor protein, αSNAP is crucial for the disassembly and recycling of SNARE complexes, facilitating membrane fusion events necessary for processes such as autophagosome maturation and exocytosis (Barnard1996Domains; Ivanov2017A). It interacts with the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) to stimulate ATPase activity, leading to SNARE complex dissociation (Abonyo2003Characterization). Additionally, αSNAP is involved in maintaining Golgi integrity and is a component of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) complex, impacting protein trafficking and degradation (Ivanov2017A; Wu2011Silencing). Mutations in NAPA have been linked to neurological disorders, highlighting its critical role in neuroepithelial integrity and cortical development (Chae2004The; Bátiz2009A).

## Function
The NAPA gene encodes the protein alpha-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein (αSNAP), which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, particularly in vesicular transport and autophagy. αSNAP is essential for the disassembly and recycling of SNARE complexes, which are critical for membrane fusion events. This function is vital for processes such as autophagosome biogenesis and maturation, as well as the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (Ivanov2017A). In the context of exocytosis, αSNAP interacts with the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) to stimulate ATPase activity, leading to SNARE complex dissociation, which is necessary for vesicle fusion with target membranes (Barnard1996Domains).

In alveolar type II cells, αSNAP is involved in lung surfactant secretion, a process crucial for proper lung function. It is predominantly associated with membranes and plays a significant role in the late stages of exocytosis by forming a complex with NSF, which activates NSF ATPase and leads to SNARE complex disassembly (Abonyo2003Characterization). Additionally, αSNAP is involved in maintaining Golgi integrity and function, which is important for regulating autophagic flux and protein trafficking (Ivanov2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NAPA gene, which encodes the αSnap protein, have been linked to significant neurological disorders. The M105I missense mutation in NAPA is associated with the hyh (hydrocephalus with hop gait) phenotype in mice, characterized by congenital hydrocephalus, brain maldevelopment, and gait abnormalities. This mutation leads to a reduction in αSnap protein levels, resulting in neuroepithelial disruption and severe cortical morphogenesis defects, including neuronal ectopias and cortical lamination defects (Chae2004The; Bátiz2009A).

The mutation causes an imbalance in neuron production, with an excess of early-born neurons and a deficiency of late-born neurons, affecting the laminar organization of the cerebral cortex (Chae2004The). This disruption in neural development is linked to altered neural progenitor cell fate and premature cell cycle exit, leading to a smaller cerebral cortex and malformed hippocampus (Chae2004The).

While the M105I mutation does not significantly impair αSnap's function in vitro, it is not fully functional in a complex cellular context, contributing to the hyh phenotype (Bátiz2009A). These findings underscore the critical role of NAPA in maintaining neuroepithelial integrity and its potential implications for understanding similar conditions in humans.

## Interactions
NAPA, also known as NSF attachment protein alpha, is involved in several critical protein interactions that regulate cellular processes. It interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SYVN1, influencing its ubiquitination and degradation. Knockdown of NAPA leads to increased ubiquitination and degradation of SYVN1, which results in the accumulation of the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction suggests that NAPA plays a role in modulating the stability of SYVN1 and, consequently, p53 levels, affecting cellular responses to chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin (Wu2011Silencing).

NAPA is also a component of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) complex, which includes SYVN1, BiP, and SEL1L. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of misfolded proteins. NAPA's role in the ERAD complex is crucial for its formation and function, impacting the ubiquitination of p53 (Wu2011Silencing).

Additionally, NAPA interacts with the SNARE complex, which is essential for vesicular trafficking and neurotransmitter release. It acts as an adaptor protein linking SNAREs to NSF, facilitating the disassembly and recycling of SNARE complexes (Naydenov2012Loss).
