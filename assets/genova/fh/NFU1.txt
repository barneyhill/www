# NFU1

## Overview
The NFU1 gene encodes the NFU1 iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein, which plays a pivotal role in the assembly and maturation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, particularly the [4Fe-4S] clusters, within human mitochondria. These clusters are essential cofactors for a variety of mitochondrial enzymes that are critical for cellular energy metabolism and redox regulation. The NFU1 protein functions as a late-acting carrier protein, facilitating the transfer of Fe-S clusters to target apoproteins, such as lipoic acid synthase and components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Structurally, NFU1 is a bimodular protein with a conserved C-terminal domain that is crucial for ligating Fe-S clusters. It operates primarily as a dimer, interacting with other mitochondrial scaffold proteins like ISCU2 and ISCA1 to assemble and stabilize these clusters. Mutations in the NFU1 gene are linked to multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome 1 (MMDS1), a severe autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neurological and metabolic abnormalities (Melber2016Role; Lebigot2021A; Jain2020Assembly).

## Structure
The NFU1 protein is a bimodular protein consisting of a degenerate N-terminal domain (NTD) and a highly conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) (Jain2020Assembly). The CTD contains a conserved CXXC motif, which is crucial for ligating iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters (Jain2020Assembly). This domain is responsible for binding and transferring [4Fe-4S] clusters, essential for various cellular processes (Cai2020ISCU).

The NFU1 protein functions as a dimer, with each monomer contributing cysteine residues to ligate a [4Fe-4S] cluster (Jain2020Assembly). The dimerization is facilitated by interactions with scaffold proteins such as ISCU2 and ISCA1, which donate [2Fe-2S] clusters that coalesce to form the [4Fe-4S] cluster bridging the dimer (Jain2020Assembly). The interaction between NFU1 and ISCU involves the two α-helices on the CTD of NFU1, which provide a platform for binding (Cai2020ISCU).

The NFU1 protein's structure is critical for its role in Fe-S cluster assembly and transfer, protecting the cluster from degradation during these processes (Jain2020Assembly). The protein's tertiary structure, characterized by its dumbbell shape, is formed by the NTD and CTD connected by a flexible linker (Cai2020ISCU).

## Function
The NFU1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the assembly and maturation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, specifically the [4Fe-4S] clusters, in human cells. These clusters are essential cofactors for various mitochondrial enzymes involved in cellular energy metabolism and redox regulation. NFU1 functions as a late-acting carrier protein, facilitating the transfer of Fe-S clusters to target apoproteins, such as lipoic acid synthase (LIAS) and subunits of respiratory complexes I and II (Suraci2021ISCA1; Jain2020Assembly).

NFU1 interacts with mitochondrial scaffold proteins ISCU2 and ISCA1, which donate [2Fe-2S] clusters that are combined into a [4Fe-4S] cluster with the help of electrons from FDX2. This process is crucial for the proper functioning of mitochondrial proteins that require these clusters for their activity (Suraci2021ISCA1; Jain2020Assembly). The NFU1 protein is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it ensures the stability and function of Fe-S clusters, thereby supporting mitochondrial function and energy production (Melber2016Role).

Deficiencies in NFU1 can lead to metabolic disorders and mitochondrial dysfunction, highlighting its essential role in maintaining cellular and organismal health (Maio2020Outlining; Jain2020Assembly).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NFU1 gene are associated with multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndrome 1 (MMDS1), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by severe neurological and metabolic abnormalities, including encephalopathy, developmental delay, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (Kropp2021Allelespecific; Lebigot2021A). Patients with MMDS1 often present with symptoms such as lactic acidosis, hyperglycinemia, and reduced activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) (NavarroSastre2011A; Ahting2015Clinical).

The NFU1 gene is crucial for the maturation of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing proteins, and mutations can disrupt the delivery of these clusters, impairing mitochondrial function (NavarroSastre2011A). A common mutation, p.Gly208Cys, is linked to severe disease phenotypes, including PAH, due to its impact on Fe-S cluster transfer and protein function (NavarroSastre2011A; Lebigot2021A). Other mutations, such as Gly189Arg, may result in milder disease progression (Lebigot2021A).

Most patients with MMDS1 die within the first few years of life, and current treatments, including lipoic acid supplementation and ketogenic diets, have been largely ineffective (Lebigot2021A). Some patients with specific genetic variants exhibit atypical biochemical profiles and longer survival, suggesting potential epigenetic factors or compensatory pathways (Lebigot2021A).

## Interactions
The NFU1 protein is involved in the assembly and transfer of [4Fe-4S] clusters and interacts with several proteins in this process. NFU1 forms a dimer to ligate a [4Fe-4S] cluster, interacting directly with ISCU2, ISCA1, and FDX2, which are involved in the donation and assembly of Fe-S clusters. ISCU2 and ISCA1 donate [2Fe-2S] clusters that are combined into a [4Fe-4S] cluster on NFU1, with FDX2 providing the necessary electrons for this process (Jain2020Assembly). The interaction with ISCU2 is mediated by a hydrophobic motif consisting of residues F230 and Y231 on the C-terminal domain of NFU1. Mutational analysis showed that the double mutation F230A_Y231A completely abrogated the interaction with ISCU2, while the interaction with the recipient protein SDHB was unaffected (Jain2020Assembly).

NFU1 also interacts with the ISA complex, which includes Isa1, Isa2, and Iba57, and is involved in the formation of [4Fe-4S] clusters within mitochondria. NFU1 works in conjunction with Bol3 to facilitate the transfer of Fe-S clusters from the biosynthetic apparatus to client proteins, thereby preventing oxidative damage to [4Fe-4S] clusters (Melber2016Role). In humans, NFU1 specifically interacts with ISCA1 but not with ISCA2, as shown by immunoprecipitation experiments. The interaction between NFU1 and ISCA1 is crucial for the transfer of the [4Fe-4S] cluster (Suraci2021ISCA1).
