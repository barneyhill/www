# STX7

## Overview
STX7 is a gene that encodes the protein syntaxin 7, a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) protein family, which is integral to vesicular transport and membrane fusion processes within cells. Syntaxin 7 is primarily involved in the fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes, a critical step in the endocytic pathway that ensures the degradation and recycling of cellular components, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Mullock2000Syntaxin). The protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including an N-terminal domain, a SNARE domain, and a transmembrane domain, which facilitate its localization and function in cellular compartments (Mori2021The). Syntaxin 7's activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation by the SGK3 kinase, which enhances its interaction with other SNARE proteins and promotes the formation of SNARE complexes necessary for membrane fusion (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics). The gene and its encoded protein have significant implications in cellular processes and have been linked to various hematolymphoid neoplasms, highlighting their potential role in disease pathogenesis and therapy resistance (Bhat2016An; Malik2019Phosphoproteomics).

## Structure
Syntaxin 7 (STX7) is a member of the SNARE protein family, characterized by its involvement in vesicular transport and membrane fusion processes. The molecular structure of STX7 includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD), a SNARE domain, and a transmembrane domain (TMD). The NTD is crucial for sorting STX7 to specific synaptic vesicle subpools that depend on actin polymerization, while the SNARE domain is essential for its presynaptic and vesicular localization (Mori2021The).

STX7 is phosphorylated at Ser126 by the SGK3 kinase, a modification that enhances its interaction with other SNARE proteins and facilitates the formation of the SNARE complex. This phosphorylation is crucial for its function in endosomal fusion events (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics). The phosphorylation of STX7 by SGK3 is specific and is not efficiently performed by Akt, highlighting the unique regulatory role of SGK3 in STX7 function (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics).

The tertiary structure of STX7 involves its folding into a configuration that allows interaction with other SNARE proteins, forming a quaternary structure necessary for membrane fusion. These interactions are vital for the fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes, a process that also requires calcium and calmodulin (He2016Munc134).

## Function
Syntaxin 7 (STX7) is a SNARE protein that plays a critical role in the fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes, a key process in the endocytic pathway of mammalian cells. This fusion is essential for the degradation and recycling of cellular components, contributing to cellular homeostasis and the maintenance of proper cellular function (Mullock2000Syntaxin). STX7 is localized to late endosomal and lysosomal compartments, where it forms a SNARE complex with other proteins such as syntaxin 8, Vti1b, and VAMP8. This complex facilitates the specific fusion events necessary for the delivery of endocytosed materials to lysosomes (Mullock2000Syntaxin).

The phosphorylation of STX7, particularly at Ser126, by the SGK3 kinase enhances its interaction with SNARE partners, promoting the formation of the SNARE complex and facilitating endosomal fusion processes. This phosphorylation is stimulated by IGF1, indicating a regulatory mechanism that influences STX7 activity and interactions (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics). The function of STX7 is evolutionarily conserved, with parallels drawn to the yeast syntaxin Vam3p, which is involved in vacuolar biogenesis and fusion events (Mullock2000Syntaxin). Overall, STX7 is crucial for lysosomal biogenesis and the proper degradation of proteins, ensuring cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
STX7 (syntaxin 7) has been implicated in various hematolymphoid neoplasms due to alterations in its expression levels. In normal hematopoietic tissues, STX7 is expressed in B precursors and mature B cells but is absent in plasma cells and T cells. In neoplastic conditions, STX7 expression is significantly reduced in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), with only 25% of cases showing expression, which is statistically significant. This reduction in expression can help differentiate between normal B precursors and B-ALL, potentially aiding in the identification of minimal residual disease (Bhat2016An).

In mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, STX7 is expressed in most cases of Burkitt lymphoma and follicular lymphoma, with higher expression in higher-grade follicular lymphoma cases. However, it is completely lost in neoplasms derived from terminally differentiated plasma cells (Bhat2016An). Aberrant expression of STX7 has also been observed in a subset of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with specific cytogenetic abnormalities, such as t(8;21), which frequently show aberrant CD19 expression (Bhat2016An).

Additionally, STX7 is phosphorylated by the SGK3 kinase, which may play a role in cancer therapy resistance. This phosphorylation is linked to the regulation of SNARE complexes involved in vesicle fusion processes, suggesting that alterations in STX7 phosphorylation could be relevant in cancer biology (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics).

## Interactions
Syntaxin 7 (STX7) is a SNARE protein that participates in various protein interactions crucial for vesicular transport and membrane fusion processes. STX7 forms a SNARE complex with Vti1b, Stx8, and VAMP8, which is essential for the fusion of late endosomes with lysosomes and homotypic fusion of lysosomes (Dingjan2018Endosomal; Mullock2000Syntaxin). This complex can also include VAMP7 instead of VAMP8, facilitating different fusion events (Dingjan2018Endosomal).

STX7 interacts with the chloride channel CFTR and the cargo adaptor EpsinR, and its activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and palmitoylation (Dingjan2018Endosomal). The phosphorylation of STX7 at Ser126 by SGK3 enhances its binding to SNARE partners, which is crucial for SNARE complex formation (Malik2019Phosphoproteomics).

STX7 also interacts with the HOPS and CORVET tethering complexes, which are involved in endosomal trafficking and are hijacked by RNA viruses to facilitate viral entry (Dingjan2018Endosomal). Additionally, STX7 is involved in synaptic vesicle recycling in neurons, where it interacts with Syb2/VAMP2 in a Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated pathway (Mori2021The).
