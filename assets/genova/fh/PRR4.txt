# PRR4

## Overview
Proline-rich protein 4 (PRR4) is a gene that encodes a protein predominantly expressed in the lacrimal glands, contributing significantly to the tear proteome. The PRR4 protein is characterized by a high proline content, which influences its structural properties, including the formation of polyproline helices. This protein is involved in maintaining ocular surface health by stabilizing the tear film and providing protection against environmental irritants. PRR4 is notably more abundant in reflex tears, indicating its role in response to neural stimuli and its importance in lacrimal gland function. The protein undergoes various post-translational modifications, such as methylation and acetylation, which may enhance its biological functions, including antimicrobial activity and lubrication. Alterations in PRR4 expression have been linked to ocular conditions like dry eye syndrome, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for ocular pathologies (Perumal2014Characterization; Perumal2015Characterization; Perumal2016Proteomics).

## Structure
The PRR4 protein, encoded by the human PRR4 gene, is characterized by a high content of proline residues, which significantly influences its molecular structure. The primary structure of PRR4 is rich in proline, contributing to the formation of polyproline helices, a common feature in its secondary structure (Perumal2014Characterization). The tertiary structure details of PRR4 are not extensively described in the available literature, but the presence of specific domains or motifs is suggested by its functional roles in the tear proteome.

PRR4 exists in multiple isoforms, including a newly identified variant, PRR4-N3, which highlights the protein's structural diversity due to splice variant isoforms (Perumal2014Characterization). The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, such as methylation, acetylation, oxidation, and pyroglutamate formation, which can alter its structure and function (Perumal2014Characterization; Perumal2015Characterization). These modifications may affect the protein's charge, size, hydrophobicity, and susceptibility to degradation, thereby influencing its biological activity and potential role in cellular regulation (Perumal2014Characterization). The quaternary structure of PRR4 is not detailed in the current context.

## Function
Lacrimal proline-rich protein 4 (PRR4) is primarily expressed in the acinar cells of the human lacrimal gland and is a major component of the tear proteome. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of the ocular surface by contributing to the stability of the tear film and providing protection against irritants (Perumal2014Characterization; Perumal2015Characterization). PRR4 is significantly more abundant in reflex tears compared to basal tears, suggesting its involvement in the response to neural stimulation and its importance in the proper functioning of the lacrimal gland (Perumal2015Characterization).

The protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including methylation, acetylation, oxidation, and pyroglutamate formation, which may enhance its biological functions in maintaining the ocular surface system (Perumal2014Characterization; Perumal2015Characterization). These modifications can affect protein structure and function, potentially playing critical roles in cellular regulation and protein stability (Perumal2014Characterization).

PRR4 is also believed to have antimicrobial properties and act as a lubricant, contributing to the protection of epithelial cells and mucosal immunity, which are essential for ocular health (Perumal2014Characterization). Its decreased levels in tear fluid have been associated with dry eye syndrome, indicating its potential as a biomarker for ocular pathologies (Perumal2015Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PRR4 gene have been associated with various ocular conditions, particularly dry eye syndrome (DES). Studies have shown that PRR4 expression is significantly decreased in patients with DES, including those with aqueous-deficient and evaporative subtypes, as well as in conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (Perumal2016Proteomics). This reduction in PRR4 levels is hypothesized to be linked to impaired neurological processes in the lacrimal gland, which may affect tear film stability and immune responses (Perumal2016Proteomics).

In contrast, PRR4 is found to be more abundant in reflex tears, suggesting its role in response to neurological stimuli and in washing out irritants from the ocular surface (Perumal2015Characterization). The differential expression of PRR4 in reflex versus basal tears highlights its potential involvement in ocular surface protection and its regulation by neurological factors (Perumal2015Characterization).

The clinical significance of PRR4 extends to its potential as a biomarker for DES and other systemic diseases affecting the eyes, such as diabetic proliferative retinopathy and thyroid-associated orbitopathy (Perumal2014Characterization). However, the exact biological function of PRR4 in tears and its implications in disease pathogenesis remain to be fully elucidated (Perumal2016Proteomics).
