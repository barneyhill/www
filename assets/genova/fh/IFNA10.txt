# IFNA10

## Overview
IFNA10 is a gene that encodes the protein interferon alpha 10, a member of the type I interferon family, which plays a pivotal role in the immune system's response to viral infections. The protein interferon alpha 10 is categorized as a cytokine, a type of signaling molecule that is crucial for mediating and regulating immunity, inflammation, and hematopoiesis. It is primarily produced by immune cells, particularly plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and functions by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are essential for antiviral defense and immune modulation (Hoffmann2015Interferons). The gene's expression is tightly regulated by interferon regulatory factors, ensuring a balanced immune response (Génin2009Differential). Variations in the IFNA10 gene have been associated with several immune-related conditions, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Akahoshi2004Association; Chan2006Variation).

## Function
IFNA10, a member of the type I interferon family, plays a significant role in the immune response by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This activation leads to the transcriptional induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are crucial for antiviral defense and modulation of the immune response (Hoffmann2015Interferons). IFNA10 is produced by various immune cells, with plasmacytoid dendritic cells being major producers, capable of generating large amounts of IFN-alpha compared to other cell types (Hoffmann2015Interferons).

In healthy human cells, IFNA10 is involved in antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities. It binds to a shared receptor complex composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, present on nearly all nucleated cells, to exert its effects (Xiao2015Exome). The protein is part of a larger family of IFN-alpha subtypes, which are known for their high specific antiviral activity, suggesting a primary role in antiviral defense (Pestka2004Interferons).

The expression of IFNA10 is regulated by interferon regulatory factors, particularly IRF-7, which is crucial for its activation. IRF-3, in contrast, has a limited effect on IFNA10 induction (Génin2009Differential). This regulation is essential for controlling the amplitude of immune responses and maintaining balanced IFN-alpha production (Génin2009Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IFNA10 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. A premature stop codon in the IFNA10 gene, known as Cys20Stop, has been identified, which results in a non-functional allele. This allele was found with a frequency of 8.7% in the Swedish population and 15% in the German population, although it is not directly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) predisposition (Miterski1999The). However, the IFNA10 gene, in combination with other genes, has been associated with asthma and atopy phenotypes. Specifically, haplotypes involving IFNA10 were significantly associated with positive skin prick tests to cockroach allergens, indicating a role in atopic responses (Chan2006Variation).

In the context of sarcoidosis, a T→A polymorphism at nucleotide position 60 in the IFNA10 gene, resulting in a nonsense mutation, has been studied. This polymorphism is part of a haplotype associated with increased production of IFN-α and IL-12p70, suggesting a potential link to sarcoidosis susceptibility (Akahoshi2004Association). These findings highlight the potential genetic contribution of IFNA10 to autoimmune and allergic conditions, although specific disease associations require further investigation.
