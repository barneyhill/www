# BEX3

## Overview
BEX3, or brain expressed X-linked 3, is a gene that encodes the BEX3 protein, which is predominantly expressed in the nervous system. The BEX3 protein is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including neuronal survival, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is involved in the regulation of the trkA gene transcription and interacts with key signaling pathways such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. BEX3's interactions with neurotrophin receptors, particularly p75NTR and TrkA, highlight its significance in neurotrophin-mediated signaling and apoptosis. Clinically, alterations in BEX3 expression have been associated with neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia, underscoring its importance in neurodevelopment and psychiatric conditions (NavasPérez2020Characterization; Calvo2015Bex3).

## Structure
BEX3 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) with regions of ordered 3D structure. Its primary structure includes a sequence that allows for interactions with various proteins, such as the neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR) (Cabral2015Biophysical). The secondary structure of BEX3 is composed of approximately 31% α-helix and 20% β-strand, with partially folded regions near the N-and C-termini (Cabral2015Biophysical). In the presence of 50% TFE, the α-helical content increases to 52%, indicating a stabilization of α-helical structures (Cabral2015Biophysical).

The tertiary structure of BEX3 includes a hydrophobic core, which is partially solvent-accessible, contributing to its oligomeric state and functional interactions (Cabral2015Biophysical). BEX3 forms high-order oligomers, accommodating 13-75 subunits, and exhibits a globular and slightly elongated conformation (Cabral2015Biophysical). The quaternary structure is characterized by its ability to form oligomers, which are in equilibrium with monomeric forms (Cabral2015Biophysical).

BEX3 contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (LR-NES domain) crucial for self-association and partner protein interactions (Cabral2015Biophysical). It also has ubiquitination boxes and a C-terminal CaaX motif important for proteasomal targeting and mitochondrial association (Cabral2015Biophysical).

## Function
BEX3 is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system. It plays a significant role in regulating the transcription of the trkA gene, which is essential for neuronal survival and differentiation. BEX3 enhances trkA promoter activity, especially in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation, by binding to the trkA promoter and facilitating its activation. This process is crucial for NGF-mediated neuronal functions, as BEX3 dimerization is necessary for its ability to activate the trkA promoter (Calvo2015Bex3).

BEX3 also interacts with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is vital for cell growth, proliferation, and survival. It is suggested that BEX3 regulates this pathway by interacting with the TSC1/TSC2 complex, which is necessary for NGF-p75NTR-BEX3-mediated apoptosis. This interaction may prevent the TSC1/2 complex from interacting with mTORC2, thus fine-tuning mTOR signaling cascades (NavasPérez2020Characterization).

In terms of cellular localization, BEX3 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, with its trafficking potentially regulated by interactions with other proteins and nuclear export signals. This shuttling is important for its function in modulating gene expression and neuronal differentiation (Calvo2015Bex3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BEX3 gene have been linked to several neurological disorders. BEX3 is downregulated in patients with Alzheimer's disease and is associated with intellectual disabilities and autism when deleted or duplicated (NavasPérez2020Characterization). In neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia, there is a significant decrease in the expression of BEX/TCEAL genes, with BEX3 being notably enriched among differentially expressed genes (NavasPérez2020Characterization). BEX3 deficiency in mice leads to hyperactivation of the mTORC2 pathway, affecting phosphorylation processes and potentially contributing to neurological phenotypes (NavasPérez2020Characterization).

BEX3 mutations can lead to craniofacial changes and impact repetitive behaviors, indicating its clinical significance in neurological disorders (NavasPérez2020Characterization). BEX3-deficient mice exhibit a reduction in cortical and subcortical interneurons, linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, and show significant brain morphological changes and behavioral abnormalities, including memory and learning impairments (NavasPérez2020Characterization). These findings suggest that BEX3 mutations or expression alterations could be clinically significant in neurological disorders due to their impact on neuron maintenance, synaptic transmission, and signaling pathways (NavasPérez2020Characterization).

## Interactions
BEX3 is involved in several physical interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of neurotrophin receptor signaling. It interacts with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, which is involved in cell survival and apoptosis. This interaction is significant in nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced apoptosis, where BEX3 associates with the death domain of p75NTR through specific residues (81-106) (Kazi2015BrainExpressed). BEX3 also forms a complex with p75NTR and the adaptor protein 14-3-3ε, essential for NGF-induced apoptosis in certain cell types (Kazi2015BrainExpressed).

BEX3 binds to dopamine responsive gene-1 (DRG-1), inhibiting DRG-1 induced cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor suppressive role (Kazi2015BrainExpressed). It interacts with hamartin, a protein expressed by the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) gene, required for NGF-induced apoptosis (Kazi2015BrainExpressed). BEX3 also associates with another class of NGF receptor, TrkA, through the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor, and this association is enhanced by NGF (Calvo2015Bex3). These interactions suggest that BEX3 plays a role in neuron development and apoptosis regulation. BEX3's interaction with p75NTR and TrkA is involved in the regulation of NF-κB activity, crucial for cell proliferation and survival signaling pathways (Kazi2015BrainExpressed).
