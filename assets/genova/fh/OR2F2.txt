# OR2F2

## Overview
The OR2F2 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily F member 2, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odorant molecules, initiating the neuronal response that leads to the perception of smell. The OR2F2 protein is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, which allows it to traverse the cell membrane multiple times. This structural feature is essential for its function in signal transduction, as it facilitates the interaction with G proteins to trigger downstream signaling pathways. The olfactory receptor family, to which OR2F2 belongs, is one of the largest gene families in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system (Qiu2020aarFDC).
