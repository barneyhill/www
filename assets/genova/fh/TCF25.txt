# TCF25

## Overview
TCF25, or transcription factor 25, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation and ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) processes. The TCF25 protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, binding to specific DNA sequences to modulate gene expression and influence cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and differentiation (Karlina2020Identificationa). It is predominantly active in the nucleus and is subject to post-translational regulation, including proteasomal degradation, which affects its protein levels despite high mRNA expression across various tissues (Dos2024Transcriptional). TCF25 is also implicated in cancer progression and other diseases, with its expression and methylation patterns linked to conditions such as bladder cancer and hearing loss (Patil2024A; Zhong2016Screening).

## Function
TCF25, or transcription factor 25, is involved in transcriptional regulation, playing a significant role in modulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. In human cells, TCF25 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and differentiation (Karlina2020Identificationa). The gene is expressed at high mRNA levels across various tissues, but this does not correspond to similarly high protein levels, suggesting regulation at the translation or post-translation level (Dos2024Transcriptional). 

The protein's expression is regulated post-translationally, as evidenced by increased protein levels upon proteasome inhibition, indicating that TCF25 is subject to proteasomal degradation (Dos2024Transcriptional). TCF25 is also implicated in ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) processes, where it helps manage translation defects that lead to ribosome stalling and protein aggregation (Dos2024Transcriptional). 

In addition to its role in co-translational quality control, TCF25 may have functions in transcriptional regulation, as suggested by its distinct patterns of gene expression changes upon knockdown, which differ from other RQC components (Dos2024Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TCF25 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of primary immunodeficiency, a study identified a patient with a dominant negative mutation in CARD11 and a pathogenic missense SNV in MEFV, alongside an intron retention event in TCF25. Although no direct causative variant was found in TCF25, the study suggested that disruptions in TCF25 could be a susceptibility factor in familial Mediterranean fever carriers (Berger2022Targeted).

In cancer research, TCF25 has been observed to be upregulated in microsatellite instable (MSI) cell lines. This upregulation contrasts with the downregulation of LTN1, a member of the ribosomal quality control complex, suggesting that TCF25 expression changes may be associated with MSI and mutation burden in cancer cell lines (Nusinow2020Quantitative).

DNA methylation changes in TCF25 have been linked to hearing loss. A systematic review found strong associations between methylation in the TCF25 promoter and various hearing loss-related conditions, including age-related hearing loss and otosclerosis (Patil2024A).

In the context of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, TCF25 is suggested to function as a transcriptional repressor of the serum response factor, which is involved in cardiac gene regulation. Although variants in TCF25 were not predicted to be deleterious, they may affect protein stability and interactions, potentially contributing to the disease (König2017Exploring).

## Interactions
TCF25 is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a role in various cellular processes. It is a component of the Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) complex, where it interacts with proteins such as LTN1 and NEMF. This complex is responsible for identifying and degrading incomplete protein products resulting from translation defects. TCF25's expression is regulated post-translationally, as its protein levels increase when the proteasome is inhibited, indicating that proteasomal degradation controls its expression (Dos2024Transcriptional).

In the context of bladder cancer, TCF25 is associated with the circular RNA circTCF25, which acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). CircTCF25 binds to microRNAs miR-103a-3p and miR-107, sequestering them and thereby influencing the expression of target genes such as CDK6. This interaction promotes cell proliferation and migration, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Zhong2016Screening).

TCF25 is also noted for its involvement in transcriptional regulation networks, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed. It is suggested to contribute to maintaining certain cellular states, such as in the TC-YIK cell line (Lizio2015Mapping).
