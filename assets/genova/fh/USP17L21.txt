# USP17L21

## Overview
USP17L21 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 21, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. These enzymes play a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thus rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The USP17L21 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, it is implicated in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been studied for its potential role in cancer and other diseases due to its regulatory functions in cell proliferation and apoptosis (Qiu2020aarFDC).
