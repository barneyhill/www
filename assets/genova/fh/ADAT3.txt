# ADAT3

## Overview
The ADAT3 gene encodes the adenosine deaminase tRNA-specific 3 protein, which is a non-catalytic component of the ADAT2/3 heterodimeric complex involved in tRNA editing. This protein plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules, specifically in the deamination of adenosine to inosine at the wobble position of tRNA anticodons. Although ADAT3 itself is catalytically inactive, it is essential for the structural positioning of tRNA, facilitating the enzymatic activity of the ADAT2 subunit. This modification is vital for accurate protein synthesis and is particularly important during brain development, influencing neuronal migration and cortical development (RamosMorales2021The; DelPozoRodriguez2024Neurodevelopmental). Mutations in the ADAT3 gene are linked to a syndromic form of intellectual disability, underscoring its significance in human health (El‐Hattab2016ADAT3‐related).

## Structure
The ADAT3 protein is a component of the ADAT2/3 heterodimeric complex involved in tRNA editing. Its structure includes distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal domain of ADAT3 adopts a ferredoxin-like fold, characterized by a slightly twisted 4-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with two α-helices in a βαββαβ arrangement, and an additional appended α-helix (RamosMorales2021The; Dolce2022Structural). This domain is crucial for tRNA binding, interacting with the D-arm and the upper part of the anticodon stem-loop (RamosMorales2021The).

The C-terminal domain of ADAT3 forms a pseudo-catalytic domain (PCD), which resembles its prokaryotic homolog TadA, but is inactivated for deamination (Liu2020Crystal). The N-terminal domain is flexibly attached to the catalytic core, allowing it to rotate relative to the catalytic domain without affecting the structure of the catalytic domain (RamosMorales2021The).

The ADAT3 protein interacts with ADAT2 through a substantial interface involving hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, but not salt bridges (Liu2020Crystal). The quaternary structure of the ADAT2/3 complex is stabilized by these interactions, which are critical for its enzymatic activity (Liu2020Crystal).

## Function
The ADAT3 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the ADAT2/ADAT3 tRNA deaminase complex, which is responsible for the post-transcriptional modification of tRNA molecules in human cells. This complex catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine at the wobble position of tRNA anticodons, a modification essential for accurate protein synthesis. The presence of inosine at this position allows a single tRNA to recognize multiple codons, thereby expanding the decoding capacity of the genetic code (Ramos2020Identification; RamosMorales2021The).

In healthy human cells, the ADAT2/ADAT3 complex ensures the correct level of inosine in tRNA, which is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions and protein synthesis. This modification is particularly important during brain development, as it influences neuronal migration and cortical development (Mao2024ADATs:; DelPozoRodriguez2024Neurodevelopmental). The ADAT3 protein, although structurally inactive in catalysis, plays a critical role in the structural positioning of tRNA for the deamination process, ensuring the proper modification of tRNA necessary for accurate protein translation (RamosMorales2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAT3 gene are associated with a syndromic form of intellectual disability characterized by a range of neurological and physical manifestations. The most common mutation, c.382G>A:p.(V128M), is a homozygous founder mutation prevalent in Saudi Arabia, leading to cognitive impairment, strabismus, growth failure, microcephaly, tone abnormalities, epilepsy, and nonspecific brain abnormalities (Sharkia2019A; El‐Hattab2016ADAT3‐related). This mutation results in a valine to methionine substitution at position 128, impairing the function of the ADAT3 protein in tRNA editing and protein translation (El‐Hattab2016ADAT3‐related).

Other variants, such as p.V144M, p.Ala196Val, and p.Gln274*, have also been linked to intellectual disability, absent speech, seizures, and strabismus (Ramos2020Identification). These mutations disrupt the ADAT2/ADAT3 tRNA deaminase complex, crucial for proper neuronal migration and protein synthesis, leading to reduced tRNA wobble inosine levels and diminished enzymatic activity (Ramos2020Identification; DelPozoRodriguez2024Neurodevelopmental). The condition is autosomal recessive and particularly prevalent in regions with high inbreeding coefficients, such as Arabia (El‐Hattab2016ADAT3‐related).

## Interactions
ADAT3 interacts with ADAT2 to form a heterodimeric complex essential for tRNA editing, specifically the deamination of adenosine to inosine at the wobble position of tRNA. This interaction is crucial for the enzymatic activity of the complex, as ADAT2 serves as the catalytic subunit while ADAT3, despite being catalytically inactive, is necessary for proper tRNA binding and positioning (RamosMorales2021The; Mao2024ADATs:).

The N-terminal domain of ADAT3, which contains a ferredoxin-like domain, plays a significant role in binding tRNA. This domain interacts with the tRNA D arm and the upper part of the stem of the anticodon stem-loop (ASL), while the ADAT2 active site recognizes the anticodon loop. The positively charged surfaces of ADAT3-N facilitate stable binding to the tRNA backbone (RamosMorales2021The).

Mutations in ADAT3, such as V144M, affect its interaction with other proteins, including heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and the TRiC chaperonin complex. These interactions suggest that the V144M mutation leads to misfolding and aggregation of ADAT3, which is targeted by chaperonin complexes. ADAT2 can suppress these interactions, indicating its role in preventing ADAT3 aggregation and facilitating proper folding (Ramos2018Formation; Ramos2019Formation).
