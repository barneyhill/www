# GMFG

## Overview
The GMFG gene encodes the glia maturation factor gamma, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for various cellular processes such as motility, migration, and structural changes. This protein is categorized as an actin-binding protein due to its structural similarity to cofilin and its involvement in actin dynamics (Ikeda2006Glia). GMFG is predominantly expressed in microvascular endothelial cells and immune cells, including T lymphocytes and macrophages, where it facilitates actin-based cellular functions (Lippert2012Glia). The protein's interaction with the Arp2/3 complex and its regulation through phosphorylation underscore its significance in cellular movement and immune responses (Ikeda2006Glia). Additionally, GMFG has been implicated in cancer progression, with its expression levels influencing tumor cell migration and invasion, as well as immune cell function (Zuo2014High; Lan2021Bioinformatics).

## Structure
The glia maturation factor gamma (GMFG) protein shares significant structural similarity with cofilin, a key regulator of actin cytoskeleton reorganization, with a 39% similarity to cofilin. GMFG contains an actin-depolymerizing factor homology domain, which is crucial for its function in actin dynamics (Ikeda2006Glia). The protein's structure includes serine residues at the second and fourth positions, which are potential sites for phosphorylation, a common post-translational modification that regulates protein function (Ikeda2006Glia). Phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine residues, specifically Ser2, enhances GMFG's association with F-actin and its interaction with the Arp2/3 complex, promoting actin polymerization (Ikeda2006Glia). 

The GMFG gene is organized over a 9.5-kb region and includes seven exons, with the first methionine located in exon 1, initiating the open reading frame (Kawai2003Structure). The gene's promoter is TATA-less and GC-rich, containing binding sites for various transcription factors (Kawai2003Structure). Despite the structural similarities with GMFB, GMFG has different expression patterns and is expressed in a wider range of organs (Kawai2003Structure). Specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of GMFG are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Glia maturation factor gamma (GMFG) is a protein involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, a process crucial for various cellular functions such as cell motility, migration, and shape changes. GMFG is preferentially expressed in microvascular endothelial and inflammatory cells, including T lymphocytes and macrophages, where it plays a significant role in actin-based cellular functions (Lippert2012Glia; Ikeda2006Glia). 

In endothelial cells, GMFG is associated with F-actin and enhances actin polymerization, particularly at the leading edge of cells, which is essential for cell movement and structure (Ikeda2006Glia). GMFG interacts with the Arp2/3 complex, a critical regulator of actin polymerization, and this interaction is enhanced by phosphorylation at specific serine residues, potentially mediated by small GTPases like Rac and Cdc42 (Ikeda2006Glia).

In T lymphocytes, GMFG is crucial for chemotaxis and migration, influencing integrin-mediated adhesion and distribution. Its expression is necessary for effective cell movement, as it regulates the transition of actin networks at the leading edge of migrating cells (Lippert2012Glia). GMFG's role in these processes highlights its importance in immune cell function and vascular development.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GMFG gene have been implicated in various cancers. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), high GMFG expression is associated with poor prognosis, including lower progression-free survival and overall survival rates. GMFG overexpression promotes cell migration and invasion, contributing to tumor progression and chemoresistance (Zuo2014High). In breast cancer, GMFG expression is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor RNF144A, which targets the transcription factor YY1 for degradation. This regulation affects cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Zhang2022RNF144A).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), GMFG expression is modulated by the long non-coding RNA LANCL1-AS1 and microRNA miR-3680-3p. Alterations in this regulatory axis can influence NSCLC progression and patient prognosis (Pan2023Upregulation). GMFG expression is also linked to immune cell function, particularly in T lymphocytes, where it regulates migration and adherence. Dysregulation of GMFG can lead to impaired cell movement and altered integrin expression, impacting immune responses (Lippert2012Glia).

In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, GMFG is crucial for their development and maintenance. Its expression is elevated in leukemia patients, suggesting a role in hematopoietic disorders (Li2023Glia).

## Interactions
GMFG (glia maturation factor gamma) is known to interact with the Arp2/3 complex, a critical regulator of actin polymerization. This interaction is evidenced by coprecipitation experiments using an anti-ARPC2 antibody, which demonstrate that GMFG binds to the Arp2/3 complex, enhancing actin polymerization at the cell's leading edge (Ikeda2006Glia). The interaction is further supported by co-immunoprecipitation analyses showing GMFG's association with Arp2, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex (Zuo2014High). GMFG's binding to the Arp2/3 complex is modulated by its phosphorylation at Ser2, which is potentially mediated by the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42, enhancing its interaction with both the Arp2/3 complex and F-actin (Ikeda2006Glia).

In the context of cancer, GMFG's interaction with the Arp2/3 complex is significant for actin cytoskeleton depolymerization, which enhances the motility of cancer cells and immunocytes (Lan2021Bioinformatics). GMFG also interacts with immunomodulators such as ITGB1 and TLR4, playing a role in immune response pathways and potentially impacting the tumor microenvironment (Lan2021Bioinformatics). These interactions suggest that GMFG is involved in various cellular processes, including cell migration, immune response, and cancer progression.
