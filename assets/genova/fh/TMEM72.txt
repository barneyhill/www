# TMEM72

## Overview
TMEM72 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 72, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its structural characteristics. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, particularly those associated with membrane dynamics and signal transduction. TMEM72 is expressed in two isoforms, TMEM72_ORF1 and TMEM72_ORF2, which differ in their structural features and cellular localization. TMEM72_ORF1 is primarily associated with early endosomes and the plasma membrane, while TMEM72_ORF2 is found in the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting diverse functional roles. The protein is implicated in protein phosphorylation pathways, indicating its involvement in cellular signaling. TMEM72 has been studied in the context of cancer, particularly clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where it is notably downregulated, and it is also associated with immune infiltration in tumors (Wesoly2024Structural). Despite these associations, the precise biological functions and clinical implications of TMEM72 remain to be fully understood.

## Structure
TMEM72 is a transmembrane protein with two isoforms, TMEM72_ORF1 and TMEM72_ORF2, resulting from alternative splicing. TMEM72_ORF1 consists of 275 amino acids and retains all predicted transmembrane domains, while TMEM72_ORF2, with 157 amino acids, lacks these domains due to the exclusion of exon 2 (Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM72 is predicted to contain four transmembrane domains, with its C-terminus involved in anterograde protein transport and facing the cytoplasm, while the N-terminus is protected in the early endosome lumen (Wesoly2024Structural).

The protein is associated with early endosomes and the plasma membrane, suggesting its involvement in membrane-associated processes (Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM72_ORF1 is localized in early endosomes and partially in the plasma membrane, whereas TMEM72_ORF2 is distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, likely due to a predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Wesoly2024Structural). The protein is involved in protein phosphorylation pathways, indicating a role in signal transduction (Wesoly2024Structural). Despite these insights, detailed molecular structural information such as atomic-level details or 3D conformation is not provided in the available sources.

## Function
TMEM72 is a transmembrane protein that is involved in various cellular processes, primarily associated with its localization in the plasma membrane and early endosomes. It is predicted to contain four transmembrane domains, with its C-terminus playing a role in anterograde protein transport, which is crucial for cellular protein trafficking (Wesoly2024Structural). TMEM72 is also implicated in cellular signaling processes, as its overexpression leads to the deregulation of genes involved in the protein phosphorylation pathway, suggesting a role in signal transduction (Wesoly2024Structural).

The protein exists in two isoforms, TMEM72_ORF1 and TMEM72_ORF2, which differ in their cellular localization and mobility. TMEM72_ORF1 is associated with early endosomes and the plasma membrane, indicating a role in membrane association, while TMEM72_ORF2, which lacks transmembrane domains, is distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, potentially due to a nuclear localization signal (Wesoly2024Structural). This distribution suggests that TMEM72 may have diverse roles depending on its isoform, including potential involvement in nuclear processes (Wesoly2024Structural). However, the specific function of TMEM72 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, as most studies focus on its role in cancer contexts.

## Clinical Significance
TMEM72 has been implicated in the development of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). It is one of the most downregulated transmembrane proteins in ccRCC at the mRNA level, with its downregulation being more pronounced in advanced tumors. This downregulation is potentially linked to clinical parameters such as metastasis (Wesoly2024Structural). Despite its involvement in ccRCC, mutations and chromosomal aberrations in TMEM72 are infrequent, with 92% of samples showing no acquired copy number variants (Wesoly2024Structural). 

TMEM72 is also associated with immune infiltration in ccRCC, as it is positively correlated with the TREG signature, suggesting a role in attracting regulatory T-cells to the tumor environment (Wesoly2024Structural). Additionally, TMEM72 has been identified as undergoing positive selection, which may indicate rapid evolution and potential implications for its role in disease (Ye2024Estimating).

In the context of selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgAD), TMEM72 is mentioned as a locus containing variants with suggestive significance, although specific clinical implications are not detailed (Bronson2016Common). Overall, while TMEM72 is linked to certain conditions, its exact clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.
