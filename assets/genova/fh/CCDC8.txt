# CCDC8

## Overview
The CCDC8 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 8 protein, which is integral to cellular processes involving microtubule and genome integrity. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains, facilitating interactions with other proteins, and is a key component of the 3M complex, which includes CUL7 and OBSL1 (Nie2015Ankyrin; Hanson2011Exome). The CCDC8 protein plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis, by ensuring proper microtubule dynamics and spindle checkpoint activation (Yan2014The). Mutations in the CCDC8 gene are linked to 3M syndrome, a disorder characterized by growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities, underscoring its importance in growth regulation and cellular integrity (Hanson2012Mutations). The protein's interactions, particularly with ANKRA2 and the HIV-1 Gag protein, highlight its diverse functional roles in both cellular and viral contexts (Nie2015Ankyrin; Wei2015Inhibition).

## Structure
The CCDC8 protein is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which are structural motifs composed of alpha-helices wound around each other, facilitating protein-protein interactions (Nie2015Ankyrin; Hanson2011Exome). The protein includes an alanine-rich domain and several putative coiled-coil domains, which are common in transcription factors and structural cytoskeletal proteins (Hanson2011Exome). The N-terminal region of CCDC8 shares similarity with the N-terminal region of the Paraneoplastic Ma antigens (PNMA) family of proteins (Hanson2011Exome).

The C-terminal domain of CCDC8 contains a PxLPxL motif, which is crucial for its interaction with the ankyrin-repeat protein ANKRA2 (Nie2015Ankyrin). This motif is involved in hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, contributing to the strong binding affinity with ANKRA2 (Nie2015Ankyrin). Phosphorylation of threonine 504 in CCDC8 slightly weakens its binding to ANKRA2, indicating that post-translational modifications can influence its interactions (Nie2015Ankyrin).

The CCDC8 protein is encoded by a single exon, and mutations in this gene can lead to premature termination codons, resulting in a predicted loss of function without nonsense-mediated decay (Hanson2011Exome). The protein's structure and interactions are significant in the context of 3M syndrome, a disorder affecting growth and development (Nie2015Ankyrin; Hanson2011Exome).

## Function
The CCDC8 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the 3M complex, which also includes CUL7 and OBSL1. This complex is essential for maintaining microtubule and genome integrity, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation and mitotic progression (Yan2014The). CCDC8 is required for the centrosomal localization of CUL7, which is vital for proper microtubule dynamics and the spindle activation checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis (Yan2014The). 

In healthy human cells, CCDC8 is involved in regulating microtubule dynamics, potentially by controlling the levels of microtubule stabilizers. Its depletion leads to defects such as altered microtubule dynamics, prometaphase arrest, and mitotic cell death, indicating its role in ensuring genomic stability and normal cellular development (Yan2014The). The protein is active in the nucleus and is associated with processes like DNA repair and mitotic spindle organization (Yan2014The). 

Mutations in CCDC8 can lead to 3M syndrome, characterized by growth retardation and skeletal abnormalities, highlighting its importance in growth regulation and cellular integrity (Hanson2012Mutations; Hanson2011Exome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CCDC8 gene are associated with 3M syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe growth retardation, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. This condition is part of a group of primordial growth disorders and is linked to mutations in the CUL7 and OBSL1 genes as well, which function in the same molecular pathway as CCDC8 (Yan2014The; Hanson2011Exome). The CCDC8 protein interacts with OBSL1 and CUL7, forming a complex that is crucial for maintaining microtubule and genome integrity. Disruptions in this complex due to CCDC8 mutations lead to defects in mitosis and cytokinesis, contributing to the clinical manifestations of 3M syndrome (Yan2014The).

Mutations in CCDC8 often result in premature termination codons, producing truncated proteins with loss of function. These mutations are found in a small percentage of 3M syndrome cases, with CUL7 mutations being the most common (Clayton2012Exploring). The interaction of CCDC8 with ANKRA2, which binds to a specific motif on CCDC8, is also implicated in the pathogenesis of 3M syndrome, potentially affecting the interaction of CUL7 with other proteins (Nie2015Ankyrin).

## Interactions
CCDC8 is involved in several protein interactions, forming part of the 3M complex with CUL7 and OBSL1. This complex is crucial for maintaining microtubule and genome integrity. CCDC8 interacts with both the N and C termini of CUL7, and its presence is necessary for the proper centrosomal localization of CUL7, indicating a regulatory interaction (Yan2014The). CCDC8 also interacts with ANKRA2 through a PxLPxL motif located at its C-terminal domain. This interaction is specific and does not occur with RFXANK, highlighting the motif's importance for binding (Nie2015Ankyrin).

In the context of HIV-1, CCDC8 interacts with the Gag protein, leading to its polyubiquitination and degradation. This interaction involves a larger complex with Obsl1 and the E3 ligase Cul7, although Obsl1 and Cul7 alone do not inhibit Gag production (Wei2015Inhibition). CCDC8's overexpression reduces the half-life of the Gag protein, indicating its role in accelerating Gag degradation through a ubiquitination pathway (Wei2015Inhibition). These interactions suggest that CCDC8 plays a significant role in both cellular integrity and viral inhibition processes.
