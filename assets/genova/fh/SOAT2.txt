# SOAT2

## Overview
Sterol O-acyltransferase 2 (SOAT2) is a gene that encodes the enzyme sterol O-acyltransferase 2, which is integral to cholesterol metabolism. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the liver and intestines, where it catalyzes the esterification of free cholesterol with long-chain fatty acyl-CoA to form cholesteryl esters. These esters are crucial for lipid droplet formation and lipoprotein secretion, processes vital for lipid transport and storage within the body (Ohshiro2017Selective; Sun2021Sterol). SOAT2 is a membrane-bound enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a significant role in maintaining lipid homeostasis by converting cholesterol into a less toxic form, thereby preventing cellular dysfunction due to free cholesterol accumulation (Eckhardt2021High; Sun2021Sterol). The enzyme's activity is modulated by its interaction with apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), which enhances its stability and function, particularly under stress conditions (Sun2021Sterol). Understanding the function and regulation of SOAT2 is crucial for elucidating its role in cholesterol-related diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Function
Sterol O-acyltransferase 2 (SOAT2) is an enzyme primarily expressed in the liver and intestines, where it plays a crucial role in cholesterol metabolism. SOAT2 catalyzes the esterification of free cholesterol with long-chain fatty acyl-CoA to form cholesteryl esters (CE), a process that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This conversion is essential for the formation of lipid droplets and the secretion of lipoproteins, which are vital for lipid transport and storage in the body (Ohshiro2017Selective; Sun2021Sterol).

In healthy human cells, SOAT2 activity is significant for maintaining lipid homeostasis by facilitating the storage of cholesterol in a less toxic form, thus preventing the accumulation of free cholesterol that can disrupt cellular functions. The enzyme's activity is particularly important in hepatocytes, where it contributes to the storage and secretion of cholesteryl esters, impacting overall lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health (Eckhardt2021High; Sun2021Sterol).

SOAT2's function is closely linked to its interaction with apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), which acts as a chaperone to enhance SOAT2's enzymatic activity and stability, particularly under stress conditions such as viral infections and nutrient excess (Sun2021Sterol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SOAT2 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cholesterol metabolism-related conditions. SOAT2 is crucial for cholesterol esterification in the liver and small intestine, and its deficiency has been linked to resistance to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and gallstone formation in mice. This resistance is due to reduced cholesterol absorption and esterification, suggesting that SOAT2 plays a vital role in managing plasma cholesterol levels in response to dietary intake (Buhman2000Resistance).

In the context of cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD), SOAT2 deficiency in lysosomal acid lipase (LAL)-deficient mice results in reduced hepatic cholesterol ester sequestration, indicating a protective effect against liver damage and disease progression (Lopez2018Impact). This suggests that targeting SOAT2 could be a therapeutic strategy for managing CESD and similar conditions involving cholesterol ester accumulation.

SOAT2's role in atherosclerosis has also been explored, with studies indicating that its deficiency leads to smaller atherosclerotic lesions in mice, highlighting its potential as a target for reducing atherosclerosis risk (Hai2021AcylCoenzyme). These findings underscore the importance of SOAT2 in cholesterol-related diseases and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SOAT2 interacts with apolipoprotein J (ApoJ) in the context of hepatic lipid accumulation, particularly under stress conditions such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and free fatty acid exposure. ApoJ acts as a chaperone, facilitating the co-localization and stabilization of SOAT2 at the ER-Golgi contact sites near lipid droplets. This interaction enhances SOAT2's enzymatic activity, leading to increased cholesterol esterification and lipid accumulation in lipid droplets (Sun2021Sterol).

The interaction between SOAT2 and ApoJ is mediated by the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of both proteins, which are crucial for their co-localization and the formation of large puncta of SOAT2. This suggests a role in phase-separation-based condensation, which is important for the stabilization of SOAT2. ApoJ silencing results in reduced SOAT2 protein levels, indicating that ApoJ binding is necessary for maintaining SOAT2 stability (Sun2021Sterol).

ApoJ does not interact with SOAT1 to the same extent as with SOAT2, highlighting a specific interaction between ApoJ and SOAT2 that plays a significant role in stress-induced hepatosteatosis by coordinating cholesterol esterification and lipid droplet formation (Sun2021Sterol).
