# UBE2I

## Overview
UBE2I is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 I, also known as UBC9, which is a key player in the post-translational modification process known as SUMOylation. This enzyme belongs to the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family and is characterized by its conserved ubiquitin conjugating (UBC) domain, which facilitates the transfer of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to target substrates. The SUMOylation process is crucial for regulating a variety of cellular functions, including nuclear transport, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Stewart2016E2; Valimberti2015E2). UBE2I is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, where it interacts with several proteins, such as RAD52 and p53, to influence DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Shen1996Associations). The enzyme's activity and interactions are modulated by its own SUMOylation, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to stress (Stewart2016E2). UBE2I's dysregulation has been implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Yang2020UBE2I; Driscoll2010The).

## Structure
UBE2I, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 I, features a conserved catalytic core known as the ubiquitin conjugating (UBC) domain. This domain typically consists of an α/β-fold with an N-terminal helix (α1), a four-stranded β-meander, a short 3_10-helix, and two C-terminal helices (α3-α4) (Gundogdu2019Structural). The active-site cysteine is located in a shallow groove surrounded by conserved residues that facilitate thioester and isopeptide bond formation (Gundogdu2019Structural). 

The E2 enzymes, including UBE2I, have a low-affinity interaction with E3 ligases, which allows for the disengagement of E2 after ubiquitination, enabling it to be recharged by E1 (Gundogdu2019Structural). The surface-exposed residues forming the E3-binding site can differ across the E2 family, affecting which E3s a given E2 can associate with (Gundogdu2019Structural). 

UBE2I's activity is enhanced by interactions with SUMO, a small ubiquitin-like modifier, indicating its role in sumoylation processes (Garg2020Structural). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions. UBE2I may have splice variant isoforms that alter its function or localization.

## Function
UBE2I, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 I, plays a crucial role in the SUMOylation process, where it facilitates the attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to target proteins. This post-translational modification is essential for regulating various cellular processes, including nuclear transport, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and signal transduction (Stewart2016E2; Valimberti2015E2). UBE2I is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, influencing cell cycle progression and stress responses (Stewart2016E2).

UBE2I specifically interacts with proteins such as RAD52, RAD51, p53, and UBL1, playing a significant role in DNA repair processes. It is involved in RAD52-dependent processes, cell cycle control, and p53-mediated pathways, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular functions related to DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (Shen1996Associations). UBE2I's interaction with RAD52 is mediated by RAD52's self-association region, suggesting a role in modulating RAD52's function (Shen1996Associations).

UBE2I is also involved in the regulation of its own activity through SUMOylation, which can modulate its function in a context-dependent manner, affecting SUMO transfer activity and interactions with other proteins (Stewart2016E2). This regulation is crucial for various cellular activities, including stress responses and protein interactions.

## Clinical Significance
UBE2I, also known as ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 I, plays a significant role in various cancers due to its involvement in the SUMOylation pathway. In multiple myeloma (MM), UBE2I expression is elevated, correlating with poor patient outcomes. Patients with higher UBE2I levels have lower survival rates, and its dysregulation is linked to enhanced tumorigenesis and adverse prognosis (Driscoll2010The). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), UBE2I is overexpressed, promoting metastasis and correlating with poor prognosis. Knockdown of UBE2I reduces cell invasion and migration, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Yang2020UBE2I).

In breast cancer, UBE2I is associated with larger, less differentiated tumors and resistance to chemotherapy. Its expression is higher in aggressive subtypes, such as triple-negative and triple-positive breast cancers, and is linked to decreased disease-free survival (Voutsadakis2012Ubiquitin). UBE2I is also implicated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), where it is highly expressed and associated with tumor growth. Its nuclear translocation in ccRCC tissues serves as a potential diagnostic biomarker (Li2022Identification). These findings highlight UBE2I as a potential target for therapeutic intervention across various cancers.

## Interactions
UBE2I, also known as UBC9, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in the SUMOylation process. It specifically interacts with RAD52, RAD51, p53, and UBL1, as identified using a yeast two-hybrid system. The interaction with RAD52 is particularly significant, as UBE2I binds to the self-association domain of RAD52, which is essential for RAD52's function in DNA repair. This interaction may influence RAD52's degradation or modulate its function by competing with its self-association (Shen1996Associations).

UBE2I also interacts with several proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and SUMOylation pathways. It is positively correlated with proteins such as PIAS1, NSMCE2, SAE1, RANBP2, UBA2, PIAS4, RAN-GAP1, SUMO3, SUMO1, and SUMO2. These interactions are linked to poor overall survival and recurrence-free survival in hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting UBE2I's role in cancer progression (Yang2020UBE2I).

In the context of systemic lupus erythematosus, UBE2I interacts with AIM2 to mediate sumoylation-based repression of type I interferon expression. This interaction is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Lu2021Aim2).
