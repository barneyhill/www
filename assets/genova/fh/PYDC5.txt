# PYDC5

## Overview
PYDC5, also known as pyrin domain containing 5 or POP3, is a gene that encodes a PYD-only protein involved in the regulation of inflammasome activation. The protein is characterized by its pyrin domain, which allows it to interact with other components of the inflammasome pathway, specifically the pyrin domains of AIM2 and IFI16, but not ASC-PYD. This interaction inhibits the formation of the AIM2-ASC complex, thereby modulating the cytosolic dsDNA-induced inflammasome response, particularly during viral infections such as those caused by Vaccinia virus, CMV, and KSHV. PYDC5 is regulated by type I interferons, indicating its role in a feedback loop to control inflammasome activity and maintain immune homeostasis. The protein's function is conserved across species, as demonstrated by its ability to bind to mouse AIM2 and IFI16, highlighting its evolutionary significance in immune regulation (Devi2020An).

## Structure
PYDC5, also known as POP3, is a protein composed of 113 amino acids and is characterized by the presence of a pyrin domain (PYD) (Devi2020An). The protein structure includes five Î± helices, as revealed by homology modeling, which distinguishes it from other death domain folds (Devi2020An). Unlike other members of the PYHIN family, PYDC5 lacks the oligonucleotide binding HIN-200 domain, which is typically present in these proteins (Devi2020An).

PYDC5 shares 19% sequence identity with ASC and 61% with AIM2, indicating a possible origin from exon duplication (Devi2020An). The protein interacts with the PYD of AIM2 and IFI16, inhibiting the formation of the AIM2-ASC complex, which is crucial for the cytosolic dsDNA-induced inflammasome response (Devi2020An). This interaction is specific to certain viral infections, such as those caused by dsDNA viruses like Vaccinia virus, CMV, and KSHV (Devi2020An).

PYDC5 is regulated by type I interferons, suggesting its involvement in a feedback loop to modulate inflammasome responses (Devi2020An). The protein's function is conserved across species, as human PYDC5 can bind to mouse AIM2 and IFI16 (Devi2020An).

## Function
PYDC5, also known as POP3, is a protein that plays a significant role in regulating inflammasome activation in human cells. It is a PYD-only protein that interacts with the pyrin domains of AIM2 and IFI16, but not with ASC-PYD, distinguishing it from other members of the PYHIN family (Devi2020An). By binding to AIM2, PYDC5 prevents the formation of the AIM2-ASC complex, thereby inhibiting the nucleation of ASC polymerization. This action specifically impairs the cytosolic dsDNA-induced inflammasome response, without affecting other canonical inflammasomes, and blocks responses induced by dsDNA viruses such as Vaccinia virus, CMV, and KSHV (Devi2020An).

PYDC5 is regulated by type I interferons, which enhance its transcription and protein stability, suggesting its involvement in a feedback loop to resolve cytosolic DNA-driven inflammasome responses (Devi2020An). In transgenic mice, the expression of PYDC5 in monocytes, macrophages, and conventional dendritic cells impairs AIM2-mediated antiviral defense, leading to higher viral titers (Devi2020An). This indicates that PYDC5 modulates the immune response by inhibiting excessive inflammasome activation, which is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing inappropriate inflammation (Devi2020An).

## Interactions
PYDC5, also known as POP3, is a PYD-only protein that interacts with specific components of the inflammasome pathway. It is localized within a type I IFN-inducible genomic cluster on chromosome 1q23 and is part of the human PYHIN family. PYDC5 interacts with the pyrin domain (PYD) of AIM2 and IFI16, but it does not bind to the ASC-PYD. This interaction with AIM2 is significant as it prevents the formation of the AIM2-ASC complex, thereby inhibiting ASC polymerization. This action specifically impairs the cytosolic dsDNA-induced inflammasome response without affecting other canonical inflammasomes. PYDC5 effectively blocks inflammasome responses induced by dsDNA viruses such as Vaccinia virus, CMV, and KSHV (Devi2020An).

The function of PYDC5 is conserved across species, as human PYDC5 can bind to mouse AIM2 and IFI16. In transgenic mice, the expression of PYDC5 in specific immune cells impairs AIM2-mediated antiviral defense, leading to higher viral titers. PYDC5 is regulated by type I interferons, suggesting it is part of an inflammasome feedback loop to resolve cytosolic DNA-driven responses (Devi2020An).
