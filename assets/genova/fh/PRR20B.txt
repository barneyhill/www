# PRR20B

## Overview
The PRR20B gene encodes the proline-rich protein 20B, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by their abundance of proline residues. These proteins are often involved in protein-protein interactions due to their structural properties, which allow them to form flexible linkages and facilitate binding with other proteins. While the specific biological functions of PRR20B remain to be fully elucidated, proline-rich proteins, in general, are known to play roles in cellular signaling pathways and structural organization within the cell. The PRR20B gene is located on chromosome 13 in humans, and its expression patterns and potential interactions suggest it may have implications in various physiological and pathological processes (Qiu2020aarFDC).
