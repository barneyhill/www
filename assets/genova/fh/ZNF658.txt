# ZNF658

## Overview
ZNF658 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 658, a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression in response to zinc levels within cells. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences known as zinc transcriptional regulatory elements (ZTREs). Through this binding, zinc finger protein 658 modulates the transcription of target genes, acting as both an activator and repressor depending on zinc availability (Francis2019Genomic). The protein plays a critical role in maintaining zinc homeostasis and is involved in various cellular processes, including phospholipid synthesis and protein stabilization during zinc deficiency (Francis2019Genomic). ZNF658's activity is primarily nuclear, where it competes with other transcription factors to influence gene expression, highlighting its importance in cellular zinc regulation and overall cellular function (Francis2019Genomic).

## Function
ZNF658 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to zinc levels in healthy human cells. It binds to the zinc transcriptional regulatory element (ZTRE), a motif characterized by palindromic flanking pairs and variable bridging bases, to modulate the transcription of target genes (Francis2019Genomic). ZNF658's activity is zinc-dependent, allowing it to act as both an activator and repressor of gene expression, similar to the yeast protein Zap1 (Francis2019Genomic). This dual regulatory function is essential for maintaining zinc homeostasis and regulating genes involved in cellular processes such as phospholipid synthesis and protein stabilization during zinc deficiency (Francis2019Genomic).

In the cellular context, ZNF658 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it competes with Sp1-like transactivators to influence transcriptional outcomes (Francis2019Genomic). It is involved in the regulation of genes that are critical for cellular responses to zinc availability, including those associated with transcriptional activation processes and compensating for zinc deficiency (Francis2019Genomic). This regulatory role is vital for cellular functions and organismal outcomes, particularly in maintaining zinc homeostasis and ensuring proper cellular function under varying zinc conditions (Francis2019Genomic).

## Interactions
ZNF658 is a zinc finger protein that interacts with the zinc transcriptional regulatory element (ZTRE) to modulate gene expression in response to cellular zinc levels. This interaction is zinc-dependent, allowing ZNF658 to act as either an activator or repressor of transcription, similar to the yeast protein Zap1 (Francis2019Genomic). ZNF658 is suggested to compete with Sp1-like transactivators to suppress transcription, indicating its role in transcriptional regulation through competitive binding (Francis2019Genomic).

The protein is involved in the regulation of rRNA gene expression, which is transcribed by RNA polymerase I, highlighting its role in activating transcription (Maksimenko2021CTCF). ZNF658 may also work cooperatively with metal-responsive element-binding transcriptional factor-1 (MTF-1) to regulate zinc transporter expression, suggesting a collaborative role in maintaining zinc homeostasis (kogan2018cellular).

The genomic analysis of ZNF658 indicates its potential interaction with various transcription factors, such as the Sp1/KLF family, NFY family, and androgen receptors, based on similarities in binding motifs (Francis2019Genomic). These interactions suggest that ZNF658 may participate in diverse biological processes depending on the location of ZTREs within gene promoters.
