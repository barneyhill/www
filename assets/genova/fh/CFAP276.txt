# CFAP276

## Overview
CFAP276, or cilia and flagella associated protein 276, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella. These organelles are essential for various cellular processes, including motility and sensory functions. The CFAP276 protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein, playing a pivotal role in the organization and stabilization of microtubule structures within the ciliary axoneme, which is crucial for the proper assembly and function of cilia and flagella (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional; Tai2023Incell). It is particularly significant in the testis, where it influences sperm motility and fertility, highlighting its importance in reproductive health (Corda2024Differential). Additionally, CFAP276 is implicated in the pathology of certain genetic conditions, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and is considered relevant in the study of ciliopathies due to its role in ciliary function (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional; BenMahmoud2022A).

## Function
CFAP276, or cilia and flagella associated protein 276, plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CFAP276 is involved in the organization and stabilization of microtubule structures within cilia and flagella, particularly in the ciliary axoneme, the core structure of these organelles (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional; Tai2023Incell). The protein is thought to contribute to the periodicity and regulatory components of ciliary motors, which are vital for the proper assembly and function of cilia (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional).

CFAP276 is also associated with the organization of microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) in sperm, indicating its role in stabilizing the microtubule structure necessary for sperm motility and fertility (Tai2023Incell). The protein's activity is particularly enhanced in the testis, where it is linked to male fertility, affecting sperm morphology and fertilization capabilities (Corda2024Differential). These functions highlight CFAP276's importance in maintaining the structural integrity and motility of cilia and flagella, which are critical for respiratory function and reproductive health.

## Clinical Significance
CFAP276 is associated with certain genetic conditions, although it is not directly linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The gene was excluded as a candidate for NDDs due to its low expression levels in the human brain and the absence of reported genetic variants in NDD subjects. However, two missense mutations in CFAP276 have been linked to dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a neurological disorder that affects peripheral nerves but is not directly related to neurodevelopmental disorders (BenMahmoud2022A).

In the context of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), CFAP276 is identified as a microtubule inner protein (MIP) gene expressed in late mature ciliated cells. These MIP genes, including CFAP276, are thought to play a role in organizing the periodicity of ciliary motors and their regulatory components, which is crucial in the later stages of cilia assembly (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional). Although the study does not directly associate CFAP276 with specific diseases, its involvement in ciliary function suggests potential implications in ciliopathies, a group of disorders caused by dysfunctional cilia, which can affect respiratory function, fertility, and organ positioning (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional).

## Interactions
CFAP276, or cilia and flagella associated protein 276, is involved in the structural stability of microtubule doublets in cilia and flagella. While specific physical interactions of CFAP276 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, it is known to play a role in stabilizing the ribbon defined by protofilaments A11, A12, and A13 of the doublet microtubules (Tai2023Incell). In the context of mouse sperm axonemes, CFAP276 is mentioned in relation to its interaction with CFAP45 within the B-tubule, specifically in a 48 nm repeat structure, although the precise nature of these interactions is not elaborated (Tai2023Incell).

In studies of airway cells from patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, CFAP276 is identified as one of the microtubule inner proteins highly expressed in late mature ciliated cells, suggesting its involvement in organizing the periodicity of ciliary motors and their regulatory components (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional). Despite these insights, detailed descriptions of CFAP276's interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain limited, and further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in ciliary and flagellar function.
