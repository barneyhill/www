# C10orf67

## Overview
C10orf67 is a gene located on chromosome 10 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 10 open reading frame 67. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by C10orf67 is not currently categorized under any specific protein family such as kinases, receptors, or transmembrane proteins, indicating that it may have a unique or less characterized role within the cell. Research into C10orf67 and its protein product is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its potential involvement in cellular pathways and its implications in health and disease.
