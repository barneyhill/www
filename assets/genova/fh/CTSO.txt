# CTSO

## Overview
The CTSO gene encodes cathepsin O, a cysteine protease that is part of the papain-like family of proteases, specifically classified under the C1 protease family. Cathepsin O is primarily involved in intracellular protein degradation within lysosomes, playing a crucial role in cellular protein turnover and homeostasis. It is also implicated in antigen processing and apoptosis, contributing to immune system function and cellular health. Beyond its lysosomal activities, cathepsin O is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix components, although its precise role in healthy cells remains to be fully elucidated. The enzyme's activity is modulated by environmental factors such as pH and glycosaminoglycans, which influence its proteolytic functions. Mutations in the CTSO gene have been linked to various diseases, including breast cancer and intracranial aneurysms, highlighting its clinical significance (Freneau2023Identification; Fonović2014Cysteine; Cheng2023Overview).

## Structure
Cathepsin O (CTSO) is a cysteine protease that belongs to the papain-like family of proteases, classified under the C1 protease family. The primary structure of CTSO consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which is typical for proteins in this family (Fonović2014Cysteine; Ketterer2017Inherited). The secondary structure of CTSO includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of CTSO is characterized by a three-dimensional conformation stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are common in cysteine proteases (Fonović2014Cysteine).

CTSO functions primarily as a monomer, indicating that it lacks a quaternary structure (Fonović2014Cysteine). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, which can influence its activity and stability. CTSO is involved in protein degradation processes, particularly in the extracellular matrix, and plays a role in various cellular functions, including intracellular protein turnover and extracellular matrix remodeling (Fonović2014Cysteine). The protein's structure and modifications are crucial for its function in these biological processes.

## Function
Cathepsin O (CTSO) is a cysteine protease primarily involved in intracellular protein degradation and processing within lysosomes, contributing to cellular protein turnover and homeostasis. It plays a significant role in antigen processing and apoptosis, which are crucial for maintaining immune system function and cellular health (Cheng2023Overview). CTSO is active in the lysosomal compartment, where it helps degrade proteins into peptides, facilitating their recycling and preventing the accumulation of damaged or misfolded proteins (Fonović2014Cysteine).

In addition to its lysosomal functions, CTSO is implicated in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, although its specific role in ECM degradation in healthy cells is less clear. Cysteine cathepsins, including CTSO, are known to be involved in ECM remodeling, which is essential for processes like bone remodeling and wound healing (Fonović2014Cysteine). The enzyme's activity is regulated by the local microenvironment, including pH and the presence of glycosaminoglycans, which can modulate its proteolytic functions (Fonović2014Cysteine).

Overall, CTSO's functions in healthy human cells are integral to maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis through its roles in protein degradation, immune response, and potentially ECM remodeling.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CTSO gene have been implicated in several diseases, notably breast cancer and intracranial aneurysm (IA). In breast cancer, particularly ERα-positive types, SNPs near the CTSO gene are associated with tamoxifen sensitivity. These SNPs can lead to increased CTSO expression, which affects the levels of BRCA1, a protein crucial for DNA repair. This interaction influences breast cancer cell proliferation and response to tamoxifen therapy, potentially leading to drug resistance. The study suggests that CTSO may regulate BRCA1 through transcription factors like ZNF423, impacting breast cancer progression and treatment outcomes (Cairns2017SNPs).

In the context of intracranial aneurysm, rare missense variants in the CTSO gene, such as c.128C>T and c.946G>A, have been identified in familial cases. These variants result in reduced secretion of the CTSO protein, which is involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and vascular smooth muscle cell function. The altered CTSO activity is associated with increased fibronectin deposition and changes in cell adhesion and migration, contributing to IA development and progression, particularly under conditions of high blood pressure (Freneau2023Identification).

## Interactions
Cathepsin O (CTSO) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its functional roles in cellular processes. In the context of breast cancer, CTSO has been shown to interact with BRCA1 and ZNF423 proteins. These interactions are crucial for the regulation of BRCA1 levels, as CTSO mediates the degradation of BRCA1 through a cysteine protease mechanism. This interaction affects the stability of BRCA1 and ZNF423, influencing tamoxifen sensitivity in ERα-positive breast cancer cells (Cairns2017SNPs).

CTSO also interacts with various proteins involved in transcription regulation, such as MTDH, PABPC4L, LMNA, and EEF1A1. These interactions are significant for the modulation of BRCA1 expression and the cellular response to tamoxifen treatment (Cairns2017SNPs). The interaction between CTSO and these proteins suggests a broader role in protein catabolism and cellular proliferation, particularly in the context of cancer therapy.

In vascular smooth muscle cells, CTSO is implicated in the degradation of fibronectin, which affects cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is relevant to the pathophysiology of intracranial aneurysms, where CTSO influences extracellular matrix dynamics and vascular remodeling (Freneau2023Identification).
