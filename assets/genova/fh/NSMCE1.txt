# NSMCE1

## Overview
The NSMCE1 gene encodes the NSE1 homolog, a critical component of the SMC5-SMC6 complex, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability. The NSE1 protein is characterized by a RING domain, which is essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, contributing to the stability and assembly of the SMC5-SMC6 complex (TapiaAlveal2011Nse1dependent; Lorite2024Crucial). This complex is involved in various chromosomal processes, including DNA replication, repair, and chromosome segregation, underscoring its importance in cellular homeostasis and genome integrity (Lorite2024Crucial). The NSMCE1 gene's role in encoding this protein highlights its significance in cellular mechanisms that prevent genomic instability, which can lead to diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Liu2021Identification; Lorite2024Crucial).

## Structure
The NSMCE1 protein, a component of the Smc5/6 complex, contains a RING domain characterized by a C4HC3 arrangement of zinc-coordinating residues, which is crucial for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (TapiaAlveal2011Nse1dependent; Lorite2024Crucial). This domain is essential for the stability of the Smc5/6 complex and is involved in protein-protein interactions within the complex (Lorite2024Crucial). The RING domain's integrity is vital for maintaining the stability and nuclear localization of the Smc5/6 complex, as mutations in the zinc-coordinating centers lead to destabilization and increased degradation of the complex (Lorite2024Crucial).

NSMCE1 forms part of the Nse1/3/4 subcomplex, which interacts with the Smc5/Smc6 core, playing a role in DNA binding and ATPase activity stimulation (Hallett2021CryoEM). The Nse1/3 heterodimer is particularly important for double-stranded DNA binding, suggesting a docking pose for DNA between Nse1 and Nse3 (Hallett2021CryoEM). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the Smc5/6 complex, contributing to genome stability and DNA repair processes (Lorite2024Crucial).

## Function
The NSMCE1 gene encodes the NSE1 protein, a crucial component of the Smc5/6 complex, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability in human cells. This complex is involved in various chromosomal transactions, including DNA replication, repair, and chromosome segregation. NSE1 contains a C-terminal RING domain with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is vital for the stability of the Smc5/6 complex. Proper folding of the RING domain is necessary for normal cell growth and DNA damage repair (Lorite2024Crucial).

The Smc5/6 complex, including NSE1, plays a significant role in replication fork progression and protection, operating independently of the FANCM protein. This suggests that the Smc5/6 complex has a unique role in maintaining genome integrity during DNA replication, separate from FANCM's function (Lorite2024Crucial). Mutations in the NSE1 RING domain can lead to destabilization of the Smc5/6 complex, resulting in impaired genomic stability, slower mitosis progression, and activation of DNA damage responses (Lorite2024Crucial).

In human cells, the Smc5/6 complex is crucial for the physical separation of sister chromatids during mitosis and for promoting replication fork progression and chromosome disjunction (Lorite2024Crucial). The RING domain of NSE1 is implicated in the stability and assembly of the Smc5/6 complex, potentially through interactions with other subunits like NSE3 and NSE4 (Lorite2024Crucial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NSMCE1 gene, which encodes a component of the SMC5/6 complex, are associated with genomic instability, a condition that can lead to various diseases, including cancer. The RING domain of NSE1 is crucial for the stability and function of the SMC5/6 complex, and mutations in this domain can result in impaired DNA replication fork progression and increased sensitivity to DNA damage (Lorite2024Crucial). These mutations can cause increased genomic instability, characterized by aberrant anaphases and micronuclei formation, which are often linked to cancer and other genetic disorders (Lorite2024Crucial).

Alterations in NSMCE1 expression levels have been observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) levels correlate with higher gene expression. This suggests a potential oncogenic role for NSMCE1 in CLL progression (WernigZorc2019Global). Additionally, NSMCE1 is implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathology, where its expression and interaction networks are altered, potentially affecting neurodegenerative processes (Liu2021Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NSMCE1 in maintaining genomic stability and its potential involvement in various diseases.

## Interactions
NSMCE1, a component of the SMC5-SMC6 complex, plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is part of a multiprotein complex that includes SMC5, SMC6, and other non-SMC elements like NSE3 and NSE4. NSMCE1 forms a stable heterotrimer with NSE3 and NSE4, with NSE4 bridging the head domains of SMC5 and SMC6 (Pebernard2008Nse1). The NH-RING domain of NSMCE1 is essential for its interaction with NSE4, facilitating the stable trimerization of the Nse1-Nse3-Nse4 subcomplex, which is crucial for the DNA damage response (Pebernard2008Nse1).

NSMCE1's RING domain is suggested to play a role in the assembly and stability of the SMC5/6 complex, potentially by hindering a degron motif that targets the complex for degradation (Lorite2024Crucial). This domain may also participate in direct protein-protein interactions within the complex, particularly in the presence of ATP, where it binds the joint region of SMC5 (Lorite2024Crucial). Although NSMCE1 contains a RING-like domain typically associated with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, in vitro assays have not detected such activity, suggesting its primary role is structural rather than enzymatic (Pebernard2008Nse1).
