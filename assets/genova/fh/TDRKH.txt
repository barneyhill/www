# TDRKH

## Overview
TDRKH is a gene that encodes the protein tudor and KH domain containing, which plays a pivotal role in the biogenesis of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity in germ cells. The protein is characterized by the presence of a Tudor domain and two KH domains, which are involved in recognizing methylated arginine residues and RNA binding, respectively. TDRKH is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm of male germ cells and is essential for spermatogenesis, particularly during the onset of meiosis. It interacts with Piwi proteins, such as Miwi and Miwi2, through its Tudor domain, facilitating the processing and maturation of piRNA intermediates. This interaction is critical for the epigenetic silencing of transposable elements, thereby safeguarding genomic stability. Mutations in TDRKH have been linked to male infertility and distal hereditary motor neuropathy, underscoring its clinical significance (Saxe2013Tdrkh; Miura2019TDRKH; Chen2009Mouse).

## Structure
The TDRKH protein, encoded by the human TDRKH gene, contains a Tudor domain and two KH domains. The Tudor domain is crucial for recognizing methylated arginine residues, particularly in the context of interactions with PIWI proteins such as Miwi. This domain features an aromatic cage that facilitates binding to methylated arginine, a key post-translational modification that influences protein-protein interactions (Chen2009Mouse). The crystal structure of the Tudor domain reveals a single Tudor barrel flanked by α-helices, similar to the Tudor domain of SND1, with a negatively charged surface that accommodates the positively charged termini of Miwi (Chen2009Mouse).

The KH domains in TDRKH are typically associated with RNA binding, suggesting a role in RNA metabolism and piRNA biogenesis (Chen2009Mouse). The protein's structure is integral to its function in the piRNA pathway, where it may regulate the organization and function of Piwi proteins (Chen2009Mouse). TDRKH is expressed in the cytoplasm of male germ cells and is involved in spermatogenesis, with its expression increasing during the onset of meiosis (Chen2009Mouse). The protein's interaction with Miwi is arginine methylation-dependent, highlighting the importance of post-translational modifications in its function (Chen2009Mouse).

## Function
The TDRKH gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which are essential for silencing transposable elements in germ cells. TDRKH is involved in the primary piRNA biogenesis pathway, particularly in the processing and maturation of piRNA intermediates into mature piRNAs. It facilitates the 3'-5' processing of 31-37 nucleotide intermediates, a critical step in piRNA maturation (Saxe2013Tdrkh).

TDRKH is a mitochondrial-associated protein that localizes to the intermitochondrial cement (IMC) in germ cells, where it interacts with Piwi proteins such as Miwi and Miwi2. This interaction is mediated by the Tudor domain of TDRKH, which recognizes symmetrically dimethylated arginine residues on these proteins (Ding2018Mitochondrial; Saxe2013Tdrkh). TDRKH's role in piRNA biogenesis is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity during spermatogenesis, as it is involved in the epigenetic silencing of transposons and the regulation of DNA methylation at transposon sites (Saxe2013Tdrkh).

In TDRKH mutants, there is a significant reduction in mature piRNAs, leading to meiotic arrest and defects in spermatogenesis, highlighting its essential role in male fertility (Saxe2013Tdrkh).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TDRKH gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. TDRKH is considered a candidate gene for distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN), a condition characterized by progressive muscle atrophy and weakness, primarily affecting distal muscles. A missense variant in TDRKH (c.851G>A [p.Arg284His]) was identified in a Japanese family with autosomal dominant dHMN, suggesting its potential role in motor neuron dysfunction (Miura2019TDRKH).

In the context of male infertility, TDRKH is essential for spermatogenesis. Mutations in TDRKH can lead to meiotic arrest and spermatogenic failure, as observed in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). These mutations disrupt piRNA biogenesis, crucial for germ cell survival and function, leading to altered piRNA expression and spermatogenic arrest (Nagirnaja2022Diverse; Saxe2013Tdrkh).

Alterations in TDRKH expression have also been linked to cancer. The long non-coding RNA TDRKH-AS1, associated with TDRKH, is overexpressed in various cancers, including colorectal cancer and breast cancer, where it promotes tumor progression and correlates with poor prognosis (Ding2023LncRNA; Jiao2020Long).

## Interactions
TDRKH, also known as TDRD2, is a protein that interacts with members of the Piwi protein family, specifically Miwi and Miwi2, through its Tudor domain. This interaction is crucial for piRNA biogenesis and is mediated by symmetrically dimethylated arginine residues in the N-terminal domain of Miwi and Miwi2 (Chen2009Mouse; Saxe2013Tdrkh). The Tudor domain of TDRKH recognizes these methylated arginine residues, facilitating the binding to Miwi, which is essential for the formation and function of the piRNA complex (Chen2009Mouse).

TDRKH is also associated with mitochondria in the germline and is found in pi-bodies and piP-bodies, which are involved in piRNA processing (Saxe2013Tdrkh). The interaction between TDRKH and Miwi is RNA-independent, as demonstrated by experiments where RNase A treatment did not affect their co-immunoprecipitation (Saxe2013Tdrkh). TDRKH's interaction with Miwi and Miwi2 is essential for the localization of these proteins and the repression of transposable elements, such as Line-1 retrotransposons, in the germline (Saxe2013Tdrkh). These interactions highlight TDRKH's role in maintaining genome integrity during germ cell development.
