# ELL

## Overview
The ELL gene encodes a protein that functions as an elongation factor for RNA polymerase II, playing a pivotal role in the transcription process by facilitating the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. This protein, categorized as a transcription elongation factor, is integral to the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) and the Little Elongation Complex (LEC), where it enhances transcription elongation and regulates small nuclear RNA gene transcription, respectively (Byun2012ELL; Basu2020DBC1). ELL's activity is modulated through interactions with various proteins, including DBC1 and p300, which influence its stability and function through acetylation and deacetylation mechanisms (Basu2020DBC1). Clinically, the ELL gene is significant due to its involvement in chromosomal translocations that lead to the formation of the MLL-ELL fusion protein, associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Wiederschain2003Molecular). This fusion protein disrupts normal transcriptional regulation and inhibits tumor suppressor pathways, contributing to leukemogenesis (Wiederschain2003Molecular).

## Structure
The ELL protein, an elongation factor for RNA polymerase II, is characterized by several conserved domains that are crucial for its function. It contains an RNA polymerase II elongation domain (Pol II-domain), a lysine-rich domain (K-domain), and an occludin homology domain (OH-domain) (Sakurai2004Inhibition). The Pol II-domain is located near the N-terminus and spans approximately 350 amino acids, playing a key role in transcription elongation (Sakurai2004Inhibition). The OH-domain, located near the C-terminus, is essential for the protein's leukemia-inducing properties and its interaction with p53, a tumor suppressor protein (Wiederschain2003Molecular).

The extreme C-terminus (eCT) of ELL is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting p53's transcriptional activity, highlighting its importance in protein-protein interactions (Wiederschain2003Molecular). ELL can also function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting proteins like c-Myc for degradation, although it lacks the typical domains found in other E3 ligases (Chen2016ELL). The protein's interaction with complexes such as the super elongation complex (SEC) and its role in transcription regulation further underscore its functional versatility (Byun2012ELL). The presence of these domains suggests a conserved structure across species, although specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ELL gene encodes a protein that functions as a key elongation factor in the transcription process by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in human cells. ELL enhances transcription elongation by reducing the rate of Pol II stalling, thereby facilitating efficient mRNA synthesis (Basu2020DBC1). It is a component of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC) and interacts with ELL-associated factors (EAF1/2) to enhance transcription elongation. ELL also forms part of the Little Elongation Complex (LEC), which regulates small nuclear RNA gene transcription and is involved in transcription-coupled DNA repair (Basu2020DBC1).

The stability and function of ELL are regulated by a pathway involving DBC1, HDAC3, p300, and Siah1. p300-mediated acetylation increases ELL stability, while HDAC3-mediated deacetylation decreases it through polyubiquitylation by Siah1. DBC1 competes with HDAC3 for binding sites on ELL, enhancing its acetylation and stability (Basu2020DBC1). This regulation is crucial for the expression of genes involved in various physiological processes, including glucose metabolism (Basu2020DBC1). ELL's role in transcriptional regulation is further supported by experiments showing impaired expression of target genes upon DBC1 knockdown, which reduces ELL levels (Basu2020DBC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ELL gene are clinically significant, particularly in the context of leukemia. The ELL gene is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations that result in the formation of the MLL-ELL fusion protein, which is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (Wiederschain2003Molecular). This fusion protein inhibits the tumor suppressor p53, contributing to leukemogenesis by preventing p53-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Wiederschain2003Molecular). The extreme C terminus of ELL is crucial for this inhibitory interaction, highlighting its role in the malignant transformation of bone marrow cells (Wiederschain2003Molecular).

The MLL-ELL fusion protein also affects transcriptional regulation by altering the expression of genes such as HOXA9 and HOXA10, which are involved in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis (Bei2014Regulation). Additionally, the ELL gene's interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Triad1 influences the development of MLL-ELL-induced AML, with Triad1 modulating protein ubiquitination and cell proliferation (Wang2018The). These interactions and alterations underscore the role of ELL in the pathogenesis of leukemia and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ELL, a transcription elongation factor for RNA polymerase II, engages in several critical interactions with other proteins that are essential for transcriptional regulation. ELL is a component of the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), where it co-assembles with AFF4 and AF9 family members. This complex is crucial for the recruitment of P-TEFb to rapidly induced genes, facilitating the transition from transcription initiation to elongation (Byun2012ELL). ELL also forms distinct complexes with p300, a histone acetyltransferase, which is vital for the activation of rapidly induced genes and stabilization of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) (Byun2012ELL).

ELL interacts with DBC1, which stabilizes ELL protein levels in mammalian cells. This interaction is confirmed through mass spectrometric analysis and immunoprecipitation assays (Basu2020DBC1). DBC1 competes with HDAC3 for binding to ELL, with DBC1 promoting ELL stability by preventing HDAC3-mediated deacetylation and subsequent degradation (Basu2020DBC1). ELL's interaction with p300 also involves acetylation, which stabilizes ELL, while HDAC3-mediated deacetylation leads to its destabilization (Basu2020DBC1).

ELL is involved in the recruitment of the PIC mediator components, such as Med1 and CDK8, which are crucial for the stability and function of the scaffold PIC and the rapid transition to elongation (Byun2012ELL). These interactions highlight ELL's role in the transcription cycle, particularly in the post-recruitment steps before commitment to productive elongation.
