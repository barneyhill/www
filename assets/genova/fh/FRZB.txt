# FRZB

## Overview
FRZB, also known as secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3), is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein involved in the modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein, categorized as a Wnt antagonist, plays a critical role in regulating cellular processes by inhibiting Wnt ligand interactions with frizzled receptors, thereby preventing the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its subsequent nuclear translocation. This regulatory function is essential for proper skeletal and joint development during embryogenesis and influences adult bone mass. The FRZB protein is characterized by its cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and netrin-like (NTN) domain, which are crucial for its interaction with Wnt proteins and its role in osteogenesis and skeletal morphogenesis (Thysen2016Osteogenesis; Hoang1996Primary). Variants in the FRZB gene have been associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in disease progression and as a potential therapeutic target (Loughlin2004Functional; QIN2014FRZB).

## Structure
FRZB, also known as secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3), is characterized by two main structural domains: an amino-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and a carboxy-terminal netrin-like (NTN) domain. The CRD is homologous to the Wnt-binding region of Frizzled receptors and is crucial for binding Wnt ligands, containing a conserved pattern of ten cysteine residues that form disulfide bridges, contributing to its structural integrity (Thysen2016Osteogenesis; Saldanha1998Identification). The NTN domain shows homology to the axonal guidance protein Netrin and is involved in protease inhibition, similar to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (Thysen2016Osteogenesis).

The CRD and NTN domains play distinct roles in FRZB's function. Overexpression of the NTN domain alone can induce osteogenic effects similar to the full-length protein, while the CRD alone does not (Thysen2016Osteogenesis). FRZB is a secreted protein and often undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. It can exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its function and interaction with Wnt proteins (QIN2014FRZB).

## Function
The FRZB gene encodes secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3), a glycoprotein that functions as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, sFRP3 inhibits the signaling of Wnt ligands through frizzled membrane-bound receptors. This inhibition is crucial for regulating the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin. Normally, β-catenin is sequestered by a multiprotein complex that includes glycogen synthase kinase 3β, which phosphorylates β-catenin, marking it for ubiquitination and degradation. When Wnt/frizzled signaling is inhibited by sFRP3, β-catenin does not accumulate in the cytoplasm, preventing its translocation into the nucleus and subsequent activation of T cell factor/lymphoid-enhancing factor-dependent transcription. This regulatory mechanism is important for skeletal and joint patterning during embryogenesis and has been implicated in determining mature adult bone mass (Loughlin2004Functional).

The FRZB protein is also involved in skeletal morphogenesis, as it is expressed in skeletal structures and has significant homology to the N-terminal domain of Drosophila Frizzled. Its expression pattern in developing appendicular skeletons suggests its involvement in the development and patterning of skeletal tissues (Hoang1996Primary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FRZB gene, also known as secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3), have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving the Wnt signaling pathway. In osteoarthritis (OA), specific variants of the FRZB gene, such as Arg200Trp and Arg324Gly, are associated with an increased risk of hip OA, especially in women. These variants are linked to joint space narrowing and the presence of femoral osteophytes, suggesting a role in disease progression rather than initiation (Loughlin2004Functional; Lane2006Frizzled‐related). The R324G variant, in particular, has a decreased ability to antagonize Wnt signaling, which is crucial for cartilage homeostasis (Loughlin2004Functional; Min2005Association).

FRZB is also involved in muscle-related conditions. In the context of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy recessive 1 calpain3-related (LGMDR1), FRZB acts as a negative regulator of myogenesis. Its upregulation in LGMDR1 patients leads to impaired muscle function, but silencing FRZB can restore the expression of important muscle proteins (CasasFraile2020Frizzled).

In cancer, FRZB functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating β-catenin activity. Its knockdown in gastric cancer cells increases β-catenin activity, promoting cell growth and invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (QIN2014FRZB).

## Interactions
FRZB, also known as secreted frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3), is involved in several interactions with Wnt proteins, influencing the Wnt signaling pathway. It binds to Wnt-1 and Xwnt-8 proteins, antagonizing Xwnt-8 signaling in Xenopus embryos by blocking Wnt-1 induced cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway (Lin1997The). The cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of FRZB is crucial for binding and inhibiting Wnt-1, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation experiments (Lin1997The).

FRZB also interacts with Wnt-5A, although it does not inhibit Wnt-5A signaling, suggesting that coimmunoprecipitation does not necessarily imply functional inhibition (Lin1997The). In gastric cancer, FRZB negatively correlates with β-catenin levels, suggesting a regulatory role in its subcellular localization and acting as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (QIN2014FRZB).

In osteogenesis, FRZB interacts with Wnt3a and Wnt5a, showing varied effects on osteogenic markers and canonical Wnt signaling pathways (Thysen2016Osteogenesis). These interactions highlight FRZB's role as a modulator of Wnt signaling, affecting processes like cell proliferation and differentiation.
