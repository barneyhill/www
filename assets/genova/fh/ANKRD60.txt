# ANKRD60

## Overview
ANKRD60 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 60 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that the ankyrin repeat domain 60 protein may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. While the specific functions of ANKRD60 and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, proteins with ankyrin repeat domains are often involved in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is needed to clarify the precise biological roles and potential clinical significance of ANKRD60.
