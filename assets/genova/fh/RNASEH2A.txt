# RNASEH2A

## Overview
RNASEH2A is a gene that encodes the ribonuclease H2 subunit A, a catalytic component of the ribonuclease H2 complex. This protein is crucial for the ribonucleotide excision repair pathway, which maintains genomic stability by removing ribonucleotides misincorporated into DNA and resolving RNA-DNA hybrids known as R-loops (Sugawara2022RNaseH2A; Cristini2022RNase). The ribonuclease H2 subunit A is characterized by its catalytic activity, which is essential for DNA replication and repair processes, and is involved in cell cycle regulation (Marsili2021Gene). Mutations in RNASEH2A are linked to Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a severe neuroinflammatory disorder, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing inappropriate immune responses (Cristini2022RNase; Rice2013Assessment).

## Structure
RNASEH2A is a component of the ribonuclease H2 complex, which plays a crucial role in the ribonucleotide excision repair pathway. The primary structure of RNASEH2A includes a sequence of amino acids that form the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. The secondary structure of RNASEH2A is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its stable three-dimensional conformation necessary for enzymatic function (Hyjek2019RNases).

The tertiary structure of RNASEH2A forms a stable three-dimensional shape that is essential for its enzymatic activity. This structure includes a catalytic core similar to RNase H1, with unique helices and a C-terminal helical extension (Hyjek2019RNases). The active site of RNASEH2A involves a DEDD motif and a third metal ion that stabilizes the transition state, crucial for its catalytic function (Hyjek2019RNases).

In terms of quaternary structure, RNASEH2A assembles with two other subunits, RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C, to form the active ribonuclease H2 complex. This heterotrimeric complex is necessary for the enzyme's full catalytic activity (Cristini2022RNase). The B subunit contains a winged helix-turn-helix motif, suggesting its role in substrate binding, and a PIP-box motif that interacts with the sliding clamp PCNA, promoting DNA replication processivity (Hyjek2019RNases).

## Function
RNASEH2A encodes the catalytic subunit of the ribonuclease H2 complex, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. This enzyme complex is responsible for removing ribonucleotides that are mistakenly incorporated into DNA during replication or repair, as well as resolving RNA-DNA hybrids known as R-loops that form during transcription (Sugawara2022RNaseH2A). RNASEH2A's activity is essential for preventing genomic instability, which can lead to DNA damage and mutations (Marsili2021Gene).

RNASEH2A is active in the nucleus, where it participates in DNA replication, repair, and cell cycle regulation. It is involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA replication and repair, ensuring proper chromosome segregation during mitosis, and maintaining genomic stability (Marsili2021Gene). The enzyme's role in resolving R-loops is particularly important for preventing DNA breaks and inflammation, which are associated with diseases like Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (Cristini2022RNase).

RNASEH2A is highly expressed in proliferative tissues and various cancers, suggesting its involvement in cell cycle regulation beyond its established roles in DNA replication and repair (Marsili2021Gene). Its expression peaks during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, indicating a potential role in cancer progression (Marsili2021Gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RNASEH2A gene are associated with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), a severe neuroinflammatory disorder characterized by early-onset encephalopathy, intracranial calcification, and an upregulated type I interferon response (Cristini2022RNase; Rice2013Assessment; Crow2016Neurologic). AGS is considered a type I interferonopathy, as mutations in RNASEH2A lead to the accumulation of RNA/DNA hybrids, known as R-loops, which can cause DNA damage and trigger an inflammatory response (Cristini2022RNase; Dragoni2022Characterization). This inflammatory response is mediated by the cGAS-STING pathway, contributing to the neuropathology of AGS (Cristini2022RNase).

In addition to neurological symptoms, AGS patients with RNASEH2A mutations may experience mitochondrial dysfunction, including altered membrane potential and increased oxidative stress, which can exacerbate immune activation (Dragoni2022Characterization). The presence of RNASEH2A mutations is linked to increased production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial DNA release, further promoting type I interferon-mediated immune responses (Dragoni2022Characterization). These findings underscore the role of RNASEH2A in maintaining genomic stability and preventing inappropriate immune activation, with its dysfunction contributing significantly to the pathogenesis of AGS.

## Interactions
RNASEH2A, a subunit of the ribonuclease H2 complex, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It forms a heterotrimeric complex with RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C, which is essential for its enzymatic activity in degrading RNA from RNA-DNA hybrids, a process crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Cristini2022RNase). Mass spectrometry analysis has confirmed RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C as top binding partners of RNASEH2A, validating these interactions (Marsili2021Gene).

RNASEH2A also interacts with proteins such as CCT8, DNAJA1, and AIFM1, which are involved in cell cycle regulation and mitosis. These interactions were identified through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells, with correlation coefficients of 0.84, 0.585, and 0.378, respectively (Marsili2021Gene). Additionally, RNASEH2A is associated with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), playing a role in DNA replication by removing RNA primers to facilitate Okazaki fragment maturation (Xu2019Genome-Wide).

RNASEH2A's interaction with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) suggests a role in transcription, as it binds to active genes genome-wide in a transcription-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for resolving co-transcriptional R-loops, preventing DNA breaks and inflammation (Cristini2022RNase).
