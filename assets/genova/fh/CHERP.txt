# CHERP

## Overview
The CHERP gene encodes the calcium homeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein, a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes, particularly RNA processing and splicing. Initially identified as an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, CHERP has been redefined as a nuclear protein that localizes to nuclear speckles and interacts with components of the spliceosome complex, such as the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) (LinMoshier2013Reevaluation). The protein is characterized by several domains, including the SURP/SWAP domain, CID domain, RS domain, and G patch motif, which are indicative of its role in RNA splicing (LinMoshier2013Reevaluation). CHERP's interactions extend to the ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle, influencing calcium mobilization, and to phosphorylated RNA Polymerase II, affecting transcriptional processes (SasakiOsugi2013Nuclear; Ryan2011Identification). Clinically, CHERP is implicated in various cancers, where its dysregulation can lead to altered splicing of cell-cycle genes, impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wang2019U2‐related; Martín2021Alternative).

## Structure
The CHERP protein is a 100 kDa protein encoded by a cDNA sequence of 4018 nucleotides, translating into 884 amino acids with a calculated isoelectric point of 9.46 (LAPLANTE2000Cloning). Its structure includes two predicted transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2), identified using the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy scale, which are characteristic of ion channels (LAPLANTE2000Cloning). Between these domains, there is a predicted sheet-turn-sheet structure, similar to the pore region of many channels, and it shares sequence similarity with certain K+ channel proteins (LAPLANTE2000Cloning).

The protein contains several specific domains, including a polyglutamine tract, a proline/alanine-rich region, and an amphiphilic imperfect aromatic tryptophan-repeat region (LAPLANTE2000Cloning). It also features a serine/arginine-rich region, which is implicated in protein-protein binding and contains phosphorylation sites for various kinases (LAPLANTE2000Cloning). The presence of histidine repeats and consensus sequences for glycosylation and glycosaminoglycan attachment suggests potential post-translational modifications (LAPLANTE2000Cloning). The protein is associated with a 128 kDa product, indicating possible post-translational modifications (LAPLANTE2000Cloning). The CHERP gene is located on human chromosome 19, within the 19p13.1 region (LAPLANTE2000Cloning).

## Function
The calcium homeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein (CHERP) is involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to RNA processing and splicing. Initially thought to be an integral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein regulating intracellular calcium channels, recent studies have redefined CHERP's role as a nuclear protein. It is localized in nuclear speckles and interacts with components of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) spliceosome complex, such as SR140 and SF3B2, which are involved in RNA processing and splicing (LinMoshier2013Reevaluation).

CHERP possesses domains typically found in proteins involved in RNA processing, including the NH2-terminal SURP/SWAP domain, CID domain, RS domain, and COOH-terminal G patch motif. These domains suggest its involvement in RNA splicing, supported by its co-localization with SC35, a splicing factor, within nuclear speckles (LinMoshier2013Reevaluation). The protein's nuclear localization is facilitated by sequences within its COOH-terminal region, which contain nuclear localization signals (LinMoshier2013Reevaluation).

While CHERP's role in calcium signaling is now considered indirect, its impact on spliceosomal function can influence cell growth and induce cell cycle arrest, highlighting its importance in cellular proliferation (LinMoshier2013Reevaluation).

## Clinical Significance
CHERP (calcium homeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein) has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in alternative splicing regulation. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CHERP and its binding partner SR140 are significantly upregulated, correlating with higher tumor grades and shorter patient survival times. Their knockdown in cancer cells leads to DNA damage and apoptosis, indicating their protumorigenic functions (Wang2019U2‐related). CHERP and SR140 regulate the splicing of UPF3A, a factor crucial for cancer cell proliferation, and their dysregulation contributes to colorectal tumorigenesis (Wang2019U2‐related).

CHERP is also involved in other cancers, such as neuroblastoma and castration-resistant prostate cancer. Mutations in CHERP have been observed in 25% of metaplastic breast carcinomas with chondroid metaplasia (Wang2019U2‐related). The SPF45/SR140/CHERP complex regulates alternative splicing of cell-cycle genes, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis. Knockdown of CHERP in HeLa cells leads to G2/M arrest and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in cell-cycle regulation (Martín2021Alternative). These findings suggest that alterations in CHERP expression or function can significantly impact cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
CHERP (calcium homeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. CHERP interacts with the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) in skeletal muscle, affecting intracellular calcium mobilization and excitation-contraction coupling. This interaction is crucial for regulating calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (Ryan2011Identification).

In the nucleus, CHERP is associated with RNA processing and alternative splicing. It interacts with components of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, including SF3B1, SF3B2, SF3B3, U2AF2, and U2SURP, indicating its role in spliceosomal function (LinMoshier2013Reevaluation; Yamanaka2022CHERP). CHERP forms a complex with RBM17 and U2SURP, which influences splicing changes, particularly retained introns and skipped exons (Yamanaka2022CHERP).

CHERP also interacts with phosphorylated RNA Polymerase II, specifically the transcriptionally engaged form, in a Ca2+-independent manner. This interaction is mediated by the proline-rich region of CHERP (SasakiOsugi2013Nuclear). Additionally, CHERP is part of a functional complex with SPF45/RBM17 and SR140/U2SURP, which regulates alternative splicing of cell-cycle genes, impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Martín2021Alternative).
