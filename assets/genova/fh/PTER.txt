# PTER

## Overview
The PTER gene encodes the phosphotriesterase-related protein, which is a member of the phosphotriesterase family. This protein is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphotriester bonds, a function that is crucial in the detoxification of organophosphates, which are commonly found in pesticides and nerve agents. The phosphotriesterase-related protein is categorized as a hydrolase enzyme, which plays a significant role in various biochemical pathways by breaking down complex molecules. The gene and its encoded protein have been subjects of interest due to their potential applications in bioremediation and therapeutic interventions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
