proteins. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein.

Binding of this protein to multiple cell surface receptors mediates its role in tumor suppression, including a stimulatory effect on autophagy and inflammation and an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis and tumorigenesis. This gene and the related gene biglycan are thought to be the result of a gene duplication. Mutations in this gene are associated with congenital stromal corneal dystrophy in human patients.
