# NOTCH2NLA

## Overview
NOTCH2NLA is a human-specific gene that encodes the protein notch 2 N-terminal like A, which is involved in the modulation of the NOTCH signaling pathway. This gene is part of the NOTCH2NL gene family and is characterized by its unique structure, which includes a partial duplication of the NOTCH2 gene. The protein encoded by NOTCH2NLA is secreted due to the absence of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, distinguishing it from other NOTCH family proteins. It plays a crucial role in brain development by enhancing NOTCH signaling, particularly in the germinal zones of the developing human cortex, where it influences the proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. The evolutionary significance of NOTCH2NLA is underscored by its contribution to the expansion of the human cortex, a feature that is linked to increased brain size and complexity (Lodewijk2020Evolution; Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Fiddes2017Humanspecific).

## Structure
The NOTCH2NLA gene encodes a protein that is part of the NOTCH2NL gene family, which is characterized by its involvement in the NOTCH signaling pathway. The protein structure of NOTCH2NLA is derived from a partial duplication of the NOTCH2 gene, incorporating the NOTCH2 promoter and six N-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains from NOTCH2 exons 1-4. However, it lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, resulting in a protein that can be secreted by cells (Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Fiddes2017Humanspecific).

NOTCH2NLA has a unique fifth exon derived from NOTCH2 intronic sequence, which provides 20 unique amino acids. A notable feature of NOTCH2NLA is the ATG/ATA mutation in the NOTCH2 start codon, leading to the absence of the N-terminal 39 amino acids, including the signal peptide, and is thus referred to as 'short NOTCH2NL' (NOTCH2NL Sh) (Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Fiddes2017Humanspecific).

The protein's EGF-like domains are conserved and play a role in the dimerization of NOTCH receptors, which is crucial for modulating NOTCH activity (Fiddes2018Human-Specific). The structural diversity of NOTCH2NL paratypes, including NOTCH2NLA, suggests an optimization of NOTCH pathway modulation (Fiddes2017Humanspecific).

## Function
NOTCH2NLA is a human-specific gene that plays a significant role in brain development by modulating the Notch signaling pathway. This gene is expressed in the germinal zones of the developing human cortex, particularly in outer radial glia (oRG) cells, which are crucial for the expansion of the human cortex (Fiddes2017Humanspecific). NOTCH2NLA enhances Notch signaling, which is essential for the self-renewal and proliferation of neural progenitor cells. This enhancement supports the proliferation of these cells while delaying their differentiation into neurons, a process vital for cortical development (Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Fiddes2017Humanspecific).

The gene's activity is linked to the evolutionary expansion of the human brain, as it prolongs the proliferation of neuronal progenitor cells, contributing to increased brain size (Lodewijk2020Evolution). NOTCH2NLA interacts with NOTCH receptors, particularly NOTCH2, enhancing their activation through both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms (Fiddes2018Human-Specific). This interaction is facilitated by conserved N-terminal EGF-like domains, which are involved in receptor dimerization (Fiddes2018Human-Specific). The gene's dosage is crucial for maintaining healthy brain function, as variations in its copy number are associated with neurological disorders (Lodewijk2020Evolution).

## Interactions
NOTCH2NLA is known to interact with NOTCH receptors, particularly enhancing the activation of NOTCH2, NOTCH1, and NOTCH3 receptors. This interaction is facilitated by the presence of six N-terminal EGF-like domains in NOTCH2NL proteins, which are conserved across species and play a role in the dimerization of NOTCH receptors (Fiddes2018Human-Specific; Heide2021HumanSpecific). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated that NOTCH2NL, including NOTCH2NLA, can physically interact with NOTCH2, suggesting a direct role in modulating NOTCH signaling pathways (Fiddes2018Human-Specific).

The interactions of NOTCH2NLA with other EGF-like domain-containing proteins, such as EGFR and PDGFRB, have not been detected, indicating a specificity for NOTCH receptors (Fiddes2018Human-Specific). The protein's ability to enhance NOTCH signaling is not limited to specific NOTCH paralogs or ligands, suggesting a broad role in modulating the NOTCH signaling pathway (Fiddes2018Human-Specific). Despite these interactions, there is no evidence of NOTCH2NLA interacting with nucleic acids (Fiddes2018Human-Specific). The functional impact of these interactions includes the modulation of neuronal progenitor differentiation and the proliferation of radial glia stem cells, which are crucial for cortical development (Fiddes2018Human-Specific).
