# PLXNA2

## Overview
PLXNA2 is a gene that encodes the protein plexin A2, a transmembrane receptor involved in semaphorin signaling pathways. Plexin A2 plays a pivotal role in axon guidance, neuronal migration, and cell signaling by interacting with semaphorins, such as semaphorin-3B and semaphorin-6A. The protein's structure includes a sema domain, a PSI domain, and IPT/TIG domains, which are essential for its function in signal transduction and cellular responses (Siebold2013Structural; Kong2016Structural). Plexin A2 is crucial for maintaining the proper laminar structure of the cerebral cortex and is involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular migration (Sabag2014The; Hatanaka2019Semaphorin). Alterations in the PLXNA2 gene have been linked to several neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders, as well as cancer metastasis, highlighting its clinical significance (Tian2013Identification; Altuame2021PLXNA2).

## Structure
PLXNA2 (plexin A2) is a transmembrane receptor involved in semaphorin signaling, crucial for axon guidance and cell migration. The protein's extracellular region features a sema domain, a PSI domain, and IPT/TIG domains. The sema domain has a distinctive β-propeller architecture, which is a common feature among semaphorins and their receptors (Siebold2013Structural). The PSI domain is characterized by a cysteine-knot structure that closely associates with the sema domain (Siebold2013Structural).

The extracellular segment of PLXNA2 adopts a ring-like conformation, which is relatively rigid and crucial for the receptor's autoinhibition and activation mechanisms (Kong2016Structural). This conformation is maintained by intermolecular head-to-stalk interactions, preventing premature signaling by keeping the cytoplasmic domains apart (Kong2016Structural). The protein can also adopt a less frequent, twisted-open chair-like conformation, which may play a role in signaling (Kong2016Structural).

PLXNA2 forms dimers or small oligomers through interactions at the sema-PSI2-IPT2 interface, which are enhanced upon semaphorin binding (Kong2016Structural). These interactions are essential for the receptor's function and regulation, facilitating rapid signaling upon ligand binding (Kong2016Structural).

## Function
PLXNA2 (plexin A2) is a receptor involved in semaphorin signaling, which plays a critical role in axon guidance, neuronal migration, and cell signaling. In healthy human cells, PLXNA2 functions as a receptor for semaphorins, particularly semaphorin-3B (sema3B) and semaphorin-6A (sema6A), facilitating signal transduction that influences cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular responses (Sabag2014The).

PLXNA2 is crucial for the proper termination of neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex. It interacts with semaphorin-6A to mediate a repulsive response that reduces the affinity between migrating neurons and radial glia, facilitating the detachment and proper positioning of neurons (Hatanaka2019Semaphorin). This interaction is essential for maintaining the correct laminar structure of the cortex by preventing neurons from invading inappropriate layers (Hatanaka2019Semaphorin).

Structurally, PLXNA2 is part of a receptor complex that includes neuropilins and other plexins, such as plexin-A4, which are necessary for semaphorin signaling. These complexes are pre-formed and become activated upon ligand binding, leading to dimerization and signal transduction (Sabag2014The; Kong2016Structural). This mechanism ensures precise spatial-temporal control in axon guidance and neuronal development (Kong2016Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PLXNA2 gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders. PLXNA2 is associated with intellectual disability, as evidenced by studies involving consanguineous families with novel homozygous variants in the gene, where patients exhibited varying degrees of intellectual disability and, in some cases, cardiac anomalies (Altuame2021PLXNA2). The gene has also been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with specific missense variants identified in patients, suggesting a potential role in ASD and related behavioral disorders (Pijuan2021PLXNA2).

In the context of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric conditions, PLXNA2 variants have been associated with schizophrenia, anxiety, and psychological distress, highlighting its significance in neural development and function (Pijuan2021PLXNA2). Additionally, PLXNA2 expression is upregulated in prostate cancer, particularly in cases with the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion, contributing to increased cell motility and invasiveness, which are key characteristics of cancer metastasis (Tian2013Identification).

A de novo deletion involving PLXNA2 has been identified in a child with psychomotor developmental delay, suggesting its potential relevance to developmental conditions, although the clinical significance of this deletion remains uncertain (Falcone2022Identification). These findings underscore the diverse clinical implications of PLXNA2 gene alterations.

## Interactions
PLXNA2 (plexin A2) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, primarily in the context of axon guidance and cellular signaling. It interacts with semaphorin 6A (Sema6A) to regulate the lamina-restricted projection of hippocampal mossy fibers. PLXNA2 attenuates the repulsive activity of Sema6A, allowing mossy fibers to invade specific regions of the hippocampus, such as the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region (Suto2007Interactions). This interaction is crucial for proper axon guidance, as demonstrated by the restoration of normal mossy fiber projection in plexin-A2/Sema6A double knockout mice (Suto2007Interactions).

PLXNA2 also participates in Fyn-dependent phosphorylation, which is essential for zebrafish eye development. Specific tyrosine residues on PLXNA2, such as Y1605 and Y1677, are phosphorylated by the Src family kinase Fyn. This phosphorylation is critical for the proper signaling function of PLXNA2, as mutations at these sites result in developmental defects (St.2017Fyn‐dependent).

In prostate cancer cells, PLXNA2 is regulated by the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion protein, which binds to a putative ETS binding site in the PLXNA2 gene promoter. This regulation is linked to cell migration and invasion, highlighting PLXNA2's role in cancer metastasis (Tian2013Identification).
