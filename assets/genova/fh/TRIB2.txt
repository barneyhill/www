# TRIB2

## Overview
TRIB2, or tribbles pseudokinase 2, is a gene that encodes a member of the Tribbles family of pseudokinases. Unlike typical kinases, the protein product of TRIB2 lacks catalytic activity due to its atypical kinase-like domain. Despite this, tribbles pseudokinase 2 functions as a crucial scaffold or adaptor protein, influencing a variety of cellular signaling pathways, including MAPK, NF-kB, and PI3K/AKT. These interactions are pivotal in regulating cellular processes such as apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including an N-terminal PEST domain, a pseudokinase domain, and a C-terminal E3 ligase-binding domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications. TRIB2 is implicated in several physiological processes, such as hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis, and plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of various cancers, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the context (Fang2021Tribbles; MayoralVaro2021The; Foscarini2023Tribbles).

## Structure
TRIB2 (tribbles pseudokinase 2) is a member of the Tribbles family of pseudokinases, characterized by a kinase-like domain that lacks catalytic activity. The primary structure of TRIB2 includes an N-terminal PEST domain, a pseudokinase domain, and a C-terminal E3 ligase-binding domain. The pseudokinase domain contains a Ser/Thr protein kinase-like domain, but it has an aberrant glycine-rich loop and a deformed ɑC-helix, contributing to an attenuated ATP-binding active site (Fang2021Tribbles; Jamieson2022Nanobodies).

The secondary structure of TRIB2 involves typical kinase-like folds, including alpha helices and beta sheets. The tertiary structure is defined by the overall 3D conformation, which includes a unique cysteine-rich C-helix that interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases (Fang2021Tribbles). The quaternary structure of TRIB2 can involve dimerization, as seen with the binding of specific nanobodies that promote a face-to-face dimerization of TRIB2 (Jamieson2022Nanobodies).

TRIB2 is involved in various cellular processes, and its function can be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. The protein's interaction with covalent inhibitors like afatinib and neratinib is influenced by cysteine residues, particularly Cys96 and Cys104, which are critical for ligand binding (Foulkes2018Repurposing). These structural features and interactions highlight TRIB2's potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Function
TRIB2 (tribbles pseudokinase 2) is a pseudokinase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes despite lacking catalytic activity. It functions primarily as a scaffold or adaptor protein, influencing key signaling pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-κB (NF-kB), and PI3K/AKT. These interactions regulate processes like apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation (Fang2021Tribbles; MayoralVaro2021The).

In hematopoiesis, TRIB2 is crucial for the regulation of thymocyte proliferation and differentiation, particularly in the development of T-cells. It acts as a cell cycle brake, ensuring balanced proliferation of developing thymocytes and maintaining normal thymocyte proliferation and development (Liang2016TRIB2). TRIB2 is also involved in erythropoiesis and is a downstream target of master regulators of megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation, such as FOG and GATA1 (Salomé2018Inverse).

TRIB2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it impacts transcriptional regulation and protein degradation. It interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases to control the stability of downstream effectors, influencing cell cycle regulation through a ubiquitin and proteasome-dependent pathway (Fang2021Tribbles; MayoralVaro2021The).

## Clinical Significance
TRIB2 (tribbles pseudokinase 2) is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression or interactions contribute to disease progression and therapy resistance. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), TRIB2 acts as an oncogene by degrading the transcription factor C/EBPα, leading to leukemia development. Its overexpression is linked to increased BCL2 expression and resistance to chemotherapy drugs like doxorubicin and daunorubicin (MayoralVaro2021The; Link2015Tribbles). However, TRIB2 can also function as a tumor suppressor in AML, with its downregulation associated with certain patient samples (MayoralVaro2021The; Gilby2010Tribbles1).

In melanoma, TRIB2 is overexpressed and correlates with disease stage and treatment response, acting as a repressor of FOXO proteins and promoting cell growth and survival. Its knockdown reduces tumor growth, highlighting its role in cancer progression (MayoralVaro2021The; Link2015Tribbles). TRIB2 is also involved in drug resistance in various cancers, including glioblastoma and lung cancer, by disrupting pathways such as AKT/FOXO and AKT/MDM2/p53 (MayoralVaro2021The).

In gastric cancer, TRIB2 exhibits a tumor-suppressive role, particularly in chromosomal instability subtype tumors, where its downregulation is associated with tumor progression (Foscarini2023Tribbles). These diverse roles underscore TRIB2's complex involvement in cancer biology.

## Interactions
TRIB2 (tribbles pseudokinase 2) is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It interacts with multiple signaling pathways and proteins, including MAPK, AKT, and C/EBPα, affecting cell cycle regulation, senescence, pluripotency, protein degradation, and cell survival (MayoralVaro2021The). TRIB2 can inhibit the MAPK signaling pathway through direct interaction with MEK1 and MKK7 (MayoralVaro2021The). It also interacts with AP4 in colorectal cancer, leading to reduced p21 expression and decreased senescence and apoptosis (MayoralVaro2021The).

TRIB2 forms complexes with E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as COP1, TRIM21, and β-TRCP, which are involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of proteins like C/EBPα and CDC25C (Fang2021Tribbles; MayoralVaro2021The). In liver cancer, TRIB2 modulates proteasome function by interacting with PCBP2 and PSMB5, reducing ubiquitin stability and protecting cells against oxidative stress (Guo2021TRIB2).

TRIB2 also interacts with mTOR regulatory subunits RICTOR and RAPTOR, implicating it in mTOR signaling regulation (HernándezQuiles2021Comprehensive). These interactions highlight TRIB2's role as a scaffold or adaptor protein, facilitating various cellular processes and contributing to its involvement in cancer progression and therapy resistance.
