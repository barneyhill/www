# IGFBP3

## Overview
The IGFBP3 gene encodes the protein Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3, which is a key regulator of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in human physiology. As the most abundant IGF binding protein in circulation, IGFBP3 plays a crucial role in modulating IGF activity by forming a ternary complex with IGFs and the acid-labile subunit (ALS), thereby extending the half-life of IGFs and regulating their bioavailability (Ranke2015Insulinlike). Structurally, IGFBP3 is characterized by a three-domain configuration, including N-terminal, linker, and C-terminal domains, with the N- and C-terminal domains being essential for high-affinity IGF binding (Vorwerk2002Binding; Forbes2012Insulin-Like). Beyond its IGF-dependent functions, IGFBP3 is involved in IGF-independent pathways, influencing cellular processes such as apoptosis and transcription regulation (Varma2020InsulinLike). It interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, acting as a transcription factor or regulator, and is implicated in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription (Bhardwaj2021InsulinLike). Clinically, alterations in IGFBP3 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Cai2020IGFBP3IGFBP3; Le2021InsulinLike).

## Structure
IGFBP3 is a protein that binds insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and is characterized by a three-domain structure: N-terminal, linker, and C-terminal domains. The N-terminal domain contains a conserved cysteine-rich region with a GCGCC motif, crucial for high-affinity IGF binding (Vorwerk2002Binding). The C-terminal domain of IGFBP3 includes a thyroglobulin type-1 fold and is involved in forming complexes with IGFs and the acid-labile subunit (ALS), which increases the half-life of IGFs in circulation (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). Both the N- and C-terminal domains are necessary for high-affinity binding, as isolated domains show significantly lower affinities (Forbes2012Insulin-Like).

The structure of IGFBP3 is described as globular, with the N and C domains heavily cross-linked by disulfide bonds, suggesting a stable configuration (Martin1995A). The intermediate linker domain lacks homology and disulfide bonds, implying some flexibility (Martin1995A). IGFBP3 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can alter its interactions and functions (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). Glycosylation sites are identified in IGFBP3, affecting its binding properties (Forbes2012Insulin-Like). The protein can also localize to the nucleus, where it influences cell signaling and gene expression (Forbes2012Insulin-Like).

## Function
IGFBP3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3) is a critical regulator of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in human physiology. It is the most abundant IGF binding protein in circulation and forms a ternary complex with IGFs and the acid-labile subunit (ALS), which prevents IGFs from leaving the circulation, thus regulating their availability for receptor interaction (Ranke2015Insulinlike). IGFBP3 modulates IGF activity by binding IGFs with high affinity, preventing their degradation, and facilitating their transport through body compartments (Ranke2015Insulinlike).

IGFBP3 also plays significant roles in IGF-independent pathways. It can interact with various proteins in the extracellular matrix and serum, influencing cellular processes like apoptosis and transcription regulation (Varma2020InsulinLike). IGFBP3 is involved in mediating apoptosis, particularly in an IGF-independent manner, by interacting with pro-apoptotic proteins and influencing cell survival (Varma2020InsulinLike). It can also bind to cellular structures and influence gene expression through interaction with the retinoid acid X receptor alpha (Ranke2015Insulinlike).

In skeletal muscle, IGFBP3 supports myoblast differentiation and may play a role in skeletal muscle homeostasis (Foulstone2003Role). It is secreted by muscle cell cultures and its levels increase with myotube formation, suggesting a role in controlling the transition from proliferation to differentiation (Foulstone2003Role).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IGFBP3 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In glioma, lower IGFBP3 expression is associated with better survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Cai2020IGFBP3IGFBP3). Similarly, in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, reduced IGFBP3 expression correlates with improved survival, particularly in the 'race-black or African-American' subgroup, highlighting the importance of the IGFBP3/TMEM219 system in this context (Cai2020IGFBP3IGFBP3).

In gastric cancer, IGFBP3 expression is elevated in tumor tissues and is associated with advanced pathological stages, suggesting a role in tumor progression. However, its expression does not correlate with overall survival in stomach adenocarcinoma patients (Liu2021Comprehensive). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), hypermethylation of the IGFBP3 promoter is linked to poorer survival outcomes, indicating that epigenetic modifications of IGFBP3 can influence cancer prognosis (Perks2015Epigenetic; Le2021InsulinLike).

IGFBP3 also plays a role in inhibiting metastasis in NSCLC and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by destabilizing vimentin, a key protein in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, thereby reducing cancer cell migration and invasion (Le2021InsulinLike). These findings underscore the potential of IGFBP3 as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
IGFBP3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It binds to histone 3 (H3) in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting a role in chromatin remodeling and gene transcription regulation (Bhardwaj2021InsulinLike). IGFBP3 also interacts with nuclear hormone receptors such as RXR-α, RAR-α, VDR, PPAR-γ, and THR, functioning as a transcription factor or regulator (Bhardwaj2021InsulinLike). It binds with RNA polymerase binding subunit 3 (Rpb3), supporting its involvement in transcription regulation (Varma2020InsulinLike).

IGFBP3 interacts with fibronectin (FN) and forms IGF-I/IGFBP-3/FN ternary complexes in human plasma, modulating the bioavailability and activity of IGF-I (Gui2001InsulinLike). It also binds to fibrinogen and fibrin, which are involved in wound healing, through its heparin-binding domain (Campbell1999Insulinlike). Additionally, IGFBP3 binds to type Ia collagen, influencing cell adhesion and migration (Liu2003Type). These interactions highlight IGFBP3's multifaceted role in cellular functions and its potential impact on diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders.
