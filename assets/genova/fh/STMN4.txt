# STMN4

## Overview
STMN4 is a gene that encodes the protein stathmin 4, a member of the stathmin family of phosphoproteins, which are integral to the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Stathmin 4 is characterized by its stathmin-like domain (SLD), which facilitates interactions with tubulin heterodimers, playing a pivotal role in microtubule remodeling. This protein is particularly significant in neuronal development and plasticity, where it contributes to synaptic plasticity and neuronal differentiation. Unlike other stathmin family members, STMN4 is uniquely regulated, not being controlled by the NRSE/NRSF system, which suggests distinct functional roles in the brain (Chauvin2015Neuronal). The protein's involvement in microtubule dynamics also extends to cell cycle regulation, highlighting its importance in both neuronal and cellular processes (Jing2024Deficiency).

## Structure
STMN4, or stathmin 4, is a member of the stathmin family of phosphoproteins involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. The protein contains a C-terminal stathmin-like domain (SLD) that interacts with tubulin heterodimers, crucial for its role in microtubule remodeling (Cao2020Molecular; Chauvin2015Neuronal). The SLD includes two tubulin binding repeats (TBR1 and TBR2) and a proline-rich domain (PRD), which may serve as interaction sites with regulatory partners (Chauvin2015Neuronal).

STMN4 also features an N-terminal extension that is palmitoylated, targeting the protein to the Golgi and intracellular membranes. This extension includes a conserved consensus sequence (AYKEMKEL) and cysteine residues critical for palmitoylation (Cao2020Molecular; Lin2016Stathminlike). The phosphorylation of specific serine residues within the SLD regulates the protein's interaction with tubulin, affecting its microtubule depolymerizing activity (Lin2016Stathminlike).

STMN4 has several isoforms generated by alternative splicing, with some variants possessing additional domains, such as domain A0, separated from domain A by domain A00 (Chauvin2015Neuronal). These structural features and modifications are essential for STMN4's function in neuronal development and plasticity.

## Function
STMN4, or stathmin 4, is a member of the stathmin family of phosphoproteins that play a crucial role in regulating microtubule dynamics, which is essential for neuronal development, plasticity, and regeneration. In healthy human cells, STMN4 is involved in synaptic plasticity, particularly in the hippocampus, where it is rapidly induced in the dentate gyrus granular layer following long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. This suggests its role in structural remodeling during the consolidation period of synaptic changes, potentially through the regulation of microtubule dynamics (Chauvin2015Neuronal).

STMN4 is expressed in specific regions of the adult brain and is involved in neuronal differentiation and maintenance of synaptic plasticity. Unlike other stathmins, its expression is not controlled by the NRSE/NRSF system, indicating a unique regulatory mechanism (Chauvin2015Neuronal). The protein possesses a stathmin-like domain that interacts with tubulin to regulate microtubule dynamics, a process that is crucial for neuronal differentiation and function (Chauvin2015Neuronal).

STMN4's role in microtubule dynamics is also linked to its involvement in cell cycle progression and mitosis, acting as a destabilizer of microtubules, which is essential for proper spindle assembly and cell cycle exit (Jing2024Deficiency).

## Clinical Significance
STMN4 (stathmin 4) has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in microtubule dynamics. In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), high expression of STMN4 is significantly correlated with lower overall survival probability, suggesting that its dysregulation may serve as an independent prognostic factor for COAD patients (Wang2022Identification). In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), genetic variants in the genomic region containing STMN4 have been associated with restricted and repetitive behaviors. These variants, particularly certain SNPs, are thought to regulate STMN4 expression, potentially linking it to ASD-related behaviors (Tao2016Evidence).

STMN4 is also involved in neuronal homeostasis and brain function. Its downregulation, along with STMN3, is associated with axonal swellings and dendrite retraction, which may contribute to neurodegenerative processes (Tapias2021HAT). The deletion of Trrap, a cofactor involved in regulating STMN4, leads to reduced neurite length and branching, indicating that STMN4 is crucial for preventing neuropathy (Tapias2021HAT). These findings highlight the clinical significance of STMN4 in both cancer progression and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
STMN4, or stathmin 4, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics and neuronal processes. It interacts with tubulin to regulate microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, forming a T2S complex with two tubulin heterodimers. This interaction is modulated by phosphorylation, which affects STMN4's ability to bind tubulin and influence microtubule stability (Chauvin2015Neuronal).

STMN4 also interacts with a range of other proteins, which can regulate its activity or be regulated by it. These include p27, Stat3, RGS, Rnd1, BRI3, Calmyrin1, Pcdhg-b1, Clusterin, TRPC5, and RasGRF1. These interactions highlight the diverse functional roles of STMN4 in neuronal development and plasticity (Chauvin2015Neuronal).

In zebrafish, STMN4 is involved in maintaining neural progenitor cells, and its expression is regulated by Wnt signaling. This regulation is crucial for controlling the G2/M transition in the cell cycle, which is important for cell fate determination and preventing premature differentiation (Lin2016Stathminlike). STMN4's interactions with cell cycle regulators, such as Cdc25a, further emphasize its role in cell cycle progression and neurogenesis (Lin2016Stathminlike).
