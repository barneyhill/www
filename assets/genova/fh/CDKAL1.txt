# CDKAL1

## Overview
CDKAL1 is a gene that encodes the protein CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1 like 1, which is a tRNA-modifying enzyme involved in the methylthiolation of tRNA Lys(UUU). This modification is crucial for maintaining translational fidelity and proper insulin secretion, particularly in pancreatic β-cells. The protein is characterized by its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a tail-anchored protein, featuring a TRAM domain and a radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) domain, which are conserved in the methylthiotransferase (MTTase) family (Wei2011Functional; Watanabe2013Functional). CDKAL1 plays a significant role in glucose homeostasis and is implicated in various metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), due to its influence on insulin processing and secretion (Ghosh2022Involvement; Li2013CDKAL1). The gene's polymorphisms have been associated with increased susceptibility to these conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Wang2019Single; Verma2020CDKAL1).

## Structure
The CDKAL1 protein is characterized by several specific domains that contribute to its function as a tRNA-modification enzyme. It contains a TRAM domain, which is a predicted RNA-binding domain, and a radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) domain characterized by a CXXXCXXC motif. These domains are conserved in the methylthiotransferase (MTTase) family, similar to bacterial proteins like MiaB and YqeV, which are known for their role in tRNA modification (Wei2011Functional; Watanabe2013Functional). The protein has two [4Fe-4S] clusters; the first cluster is chelated by three cysteines in the radical SAM domain, while the second cluster is involved in the thiolation step, chelated by cysteines in the N-terminal UPF0004 domain (Wei2011Functional).

CDKAL1 is a tail-anchored protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with a hydrophobic domain at the C-terminus that aids in its membrane association. This domain suggests that CDKAL1 is a tail-anchored (TA) protein, characterized by a single transmembrane domain (TMD) that anchors it to intracellular membranes (Brambillasca2012CDK5). The insertion of its C-terminal transmembrane domain into the ER is facilitated by the TRC40/Get3-assisted pathway (Brambillasca2012CDK5). The protein's enzymatic activity is linked to its role in maintaining translational fidelity and proper insulin secretion (Wei2011Functional).

## Function
CDKAL1 is a tRNA-modifying enzyme that plays a crucial role in protein translation by catalyzing the methylthiolation of tRNA Lys(UUU). This modification is essential for the accurate decoding of lysine codons during protein synthesis, which is critical for proper insulin processing and secretion in pancreatic cells (Takesue2019Regulation). CDKAL1 is involved in the post-translational modification and proper folding of the insulin hormone in response to glucose stimulation, particularly during the first phase of insulin synthesis (Ghosh2022Involvement). 

The protein is a tail-anchored protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of insulin-producing cells, where it is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and is crucial for the proper translation and folding of proteins destined for secretion, such as proinsulin (Brambillasca2012CDK5). CDKAL1 also acts as an endogenous inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), preventing disruptions in insulin synthesis by affecting PDX1 translocation (Ghosh2022Involvement). 

In healthy human cells, CDKAL1's function is vital for maintaining glucose homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of misfolded insulin, which can lead to oxidative and ER stress in pancreatic β-cells (Ghosh2022Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the CDKAL1 gene are significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Variants such as rs7756992, rs10946398, and rs35612982 have been linked to T2DM susceptibility, with these polymorphisms affecting insulin secretion and β-cell function (Tian2019A; Li2013CDKAL1; Verma2020CDKAL1). The G allele of rs7756992, in particular, is associated with increased T2DM risk, especially in Caucasian and Asian populations (Li2013CDKAL1). 

CDKAL1 is also implicated in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), with certain SNPs like rs9295478 and rs6935599 linked to elevated GDM risk in Chinese populations (Wang2019Single). Beyond diabetes, CDKAL1 variants have been associated with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P), with SNP rs9356746 showing a significant association (Gaczkowska2018Association).

Alterations in CDKAL1 expression can lead to the accumulation of misfolded insulin, causing oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress in pancreatic β-cells, contributing to their destruction and exacerbating diabetes (Ghosh2022Involvement). These genetic variations highlight CDKAL1's role in metabolic disorders and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
CDKAL1 is primarily involved in tRNA modification, specifically the methylthiolation of tRNA Lys (UUU), which is crucial for translation fidelity and proper insulin secretion. The protein contains a TRAM domain, a predicted RNA-binding domain, and a radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) domain, which are conserved in the methylthiotransferase (MTTase) family, indicating its primary interaction is with tRNA rather than other proteins (Wei2011Functional; Watanabe2013Functional).

CDKAL1 is localized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to its C-terminal hydrophobic domain and is inserted into the ER membrane via the TRC40/Get3-assisted pathway. This suggests an interaction with components of the TRC40/Get3 pathway during its insertion into the ER membrane (Brambillasca2012CDK5).

While CDKAL1 shares structural homology with Cdk5rap1, it does not directly interact with Cdk5 or affect its kinase activity (Wei2011Functional; Watanabe2013Functional). However, CDKAL1 acts as an endogenous inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) by preventing the formation of the cdk5-P25 active complex, which is crucial for maintaining insulin synthesis (Ghosh2022Involvement).
