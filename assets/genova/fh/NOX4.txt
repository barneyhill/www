# NOX4

## Overview
NOX4, or NADPH oxidase 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the NADPH oxidase family of enzymes, which are integral membrane proteins involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The protein product of NOX4, NADPH oxidase 4, is characterized by its constitutive activity and is primarily responsible for producing hydrogen peroxide, a type of ROS, within cells. This enzyme is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in cellular signaling and maintaining redox balance. NOX4 is involved in various physiological processes, including angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and migration, and is essential for vascular homeostasis. Its activity is modulated through interactions with other proteins, such as the p22phox subunit and Poldip2, which enhance its enzymatic function. NOX4's role in disease contexts, such as cancer and pulmonary disorders, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Schröder2012Nox4; Cheng2001Homologs; Helmcke2009Identification).

## Structure
NOX4 (NADPH oxidase 4) is a member of the NADPH oxidase family, characterized by its ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The primary structure of NOX4 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which is predicted to encode a protein of approximately 65 kDa (Cheng2001Homologs). The secondary structure of NOX4 features 5-6 conserved predicted transmembrane alpha-helices, which contain putative heme-binding regions essential for its function in electron transfer and ROS generation (O’Neill2018Quantitative; Cheng2001Homologs).

The tertiary structure of NOX4 involves the 3D folding of the protein, which includes a flavoprotein homology domain with predicted binding sites for FAD and NADPH, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Cheng2001Homologs). NOX4's quaternary structure is defined by its interaction with the p22 phox subunit, forming a heterodimer essential for its function (O’Neill2018Quantitative; Ambasta2004Direct).

NOX4 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as heme incorporation, which is crucial for its heterodimerization and catalytic activity (O’Neill2018Quantitative). The protein's structure allows it to be constitutively active, primarily producing hydrogen peroxide, which is attributed to its subcellular localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (Helmcke2009Identification).

## Function
NOX4 (NADPH oxidase 4) is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), particularly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in endothelial cells. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular signaling and redox balance (Schröder2012Nox4; Ago2004Nox4). NOX4 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and migration. It enhances receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway, which are crucial for angiogenic responses (Datla2007Important).

In endothelial cells, NOX4-derived ROS are essential for maintaining vascular homeostasis and promoting angiogenesis. The enzyme's activity supports the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which are important for vasodilation and anti-inflammatory responses (Schröder2012Nox4). NOX4 also plays a protective role by reducing endothelial cell apoptosis and supporting cell survival under stress conditions (Schröder2012Nox4). Its function in generating ROS is crucial for the physiological processes that maintain vascular health and facilitate tissue repair (Schröder2012Nox4).

## Clinical Significance
NOX4 (NADPH oxidase 4) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NOX4 expression is higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal liver tissues. Interestingly, higher NOX4 mRNA levels are associated with prolonged overall survival in HCC patients, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role. This indicates that NOX4 could serve as a prognostic biomarker in HCC (Eun2017Gene).

In cancer progression, NOX4 is linked to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, and angiogenesis. Its expression is modulated by TP53 mutation status, being protective in wild-type TP53 tumors but promoting cancer progression in mutant TP53 tumors. This dual role highlights the complexity of NOX4's involvement in cancer, where it can either suppress or enhance tumorigenesis depending on the genetic context (Ma2021PanCancer).

NOX4 is also implicated in pulmonary diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis. It contributes to oxidative stress and tissue remodeling, with its expression being influenced by factors like hypoxia and TGF-β. These interactions suggest NOX4 as a potential therapeutic target in fibrotic and respiratory conditions (Katsuyama2011Physiological; Li2020The).

## Interactions
NOX4 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes through these interactions. It directly interacts with the p22phox subunit, which is essential for forming a functionally active NADPH oxidase complex. This interaction is necessary for superoxide generation and is dependent on a specific histidine residue in NOX proteins (Ambasta2004Direct). NOX4 also interacts with Poldip2, a novel positive regulator that enhances NOX4's enzymatic activity and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This interaction is crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity in vascular smooth muscle cells (Lyle2009Poldip2).

NOX4 is involved in the regulation of stress signaling pathways by interacting with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and GADD34. This interaction inhibits PP1 activity, leading to increased phosphorylation of eIF2α, which is important for stress response signaling (Santos2016Targeted). NOX4 also interacts with mitochondrial complex I subunits, although this interaction does not significantly contribute to basal reactive oxygen species production (Hirschhäuser2015NOX4). These interactions highlight NOX4's role in redox signaling and cellular stress responses.
