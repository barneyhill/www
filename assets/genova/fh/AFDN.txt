# AFDN

## Overview
The AFDN gene encodes the protein afadin, which is a critical component in the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions (AJs) in epithelial tissues. Afadin is a multidomain scaffold protein that plays a significant role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling. It is characterized by its interaction with various proteins, including nectins, and its ability to link these proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby facilitating the organization of AJs and tight junctions (TJs) (Goudreault2022Afadin; Takai2003Nectin). Afadin exists in two main isoforms, long (l-afadin) and short (s-afadin), with the former containing an F-actin binding domain that is crucial for its function in linking nectins to the actin cytoskeleton (Huxham2020Afadin). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of cell polarity, migration, and signaling pathways, and its dysregulation has been implicated in cancer progression (Marques2018Afadin; Goudreault2022Afadin).

## Structure
Afadin (AFDN) is a multidomain scaffold protein involved in cell adhesion and signaling. It contains several key domains, including two Ras-association (RA) domains, a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, a dilute (DIL) domain, a PSD-95-Dlg-ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, and three proline-rich regions (PRR) (Huxham2020Afadin; Mandai2013AfadinAF6). The RA domains interact with activated Ras and suppress downstream Ras signaling, while the PDZ domain is crucial for signal transduction and adherens junction formation (Huxham2020Afadin). The FHA domain, although lacking the typical residues for phosphothreonine binding, interacts with the SCRIB PDZ1 domain in a phospho-independent manner (Goudreault2022Afadin).

Afadin exists in two main isoforms: long (l-afadin) and short (s-afadin). The l-afadin isoform includes a carboxyterminal F-actin binding (FAB) domain, which is absent in s-afadin (Huxham2020Afadin). This FAB domain allows l-afadin to bind actin, linking nectin to the actin cytoskeleton (Huxham2020Afadin). The s-afadin variant lacks the third proline-rich domain and the F-actin-binding domain, and is specifically expressed in the brain (Sakakibara2018Requirement).

Afadin's quaternary structure is characterized by its ability to form multimers, although it is unclear if this occurs in vivo (Mandai2013AfadinAF6). The protein's interactions and functions are regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions (Goudreault2022Afadin).

## Function
AFDN, also known as afadin, is a protein that plays a critical role in the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions (AJs), which are essential for cell-cell adhesion in epithelial tissues. It interacts with nectins and other junctional proteins to regulate cell polarity, migration, and signaling pathways (Takai2008The; Marques2018Afadin). Afadin is active at the cell membrane, particularly in areas of cell-cell contact, and is involved in maintaining the integrity of the epithelial apical junctional complex, which includes both tight and adherens junctions (Marques2018Afadin).

Afadin interacts with RAS GTPases through its N-terminal RA domains and forms a complex with the polarity protein SCRIB, which is important for maintaining cell polarity and adhesion (Goudreault2022Afadin). This interaction is crucial for regulating RAS signaling pathways, specifically the MAPK and PI3K pathways, which are important for cell proliferation and survival (Goudreault2022Afadin). Afadin's role in cell adhesion is further supported by its binding to actin through its C-terminal helical region, which is critical for regulating cell adhesion (Goudreault2022Afadin). The protein's interaction network includes partners involved in the cell adhesion apparatus, such as Nectins, JAM-A, Eph receptors, and the tight junction protein ZO-1 (Goudreault2022Afadin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the AFDN gene, which encodes the protein afadin, have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, mutations in AFDN are considered potential drivers of the disease, contributing to increased cell migration and invasion (Goudreault2022Afadin). The loss of AFDN from cell-cell contacts is associated with enhanced migratory and invasive capabilities in endometrial, pancreatic, and breast cancers, as well as glioblastomas (Goudreault2022Afadin).

In gastric cells, downregulation of afadin, often induced by Helicobacter pylori infection, leads to the delocalization of junctional proteins and the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This process is characterized by increased cell motility and invasiveness, which are hallmarks of cancer progression (Marques2018Afadin). The downregulation of afadin in gastric cells results in decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and increased permeability, further promoting EMT and potentially contributing to gastric carcinogenesis (Marques2018Afadin).

The interaction between afadin and the polarity protein SCRIB is crucial for maintaining cell polarity and adhesion. Disruption of this interaction can lead to metastatic evolution in RAS-transformed cells, highlighting its significance in cancer biology (Goudreault2022Afadin).

## Interactions
Afadin (AFDN) is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion and signaling through its interactions with various proteins. It interacts with transmembrane adhesive proteins such as nectins, linking them to the actin cytoskeleton and facilitating the organization of adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs) (Takai2003Nectin). Afadin is known to bind to p120-catenin and ZO-1, mediating their interactions and enhancing endothelial barrier function, particularly in response to oxidized phospholipids (Birukova2012Afadin).

Afadin also interacts with the small GTPase Rap1, forming a complex with p120-catenin and ZO-1, which is essential for the enhancement of endothelial barrier function (Birukova2012Afadin). It binds to several RAS subfamily GTPases, including HRAS, RAP1A, and RAP2A, through its RA domains, and interacts with the polarity protein Scribble (SCRIB) via its FHA domain (Goudreault2022Afadin). The interaction with SCRIB is crucial for maintaining cell polarity and is enhanced by the presence of activated KRAS (Goudreault2022Afadin).

Afadin's interaction network includes other proteins such as PLEKHA7, vinculin, and ponsin, which are involved in cytoskeletal regulation and cell adhesion (Takai2003Nectin). It also associates with EphA2 in keratinocytes, suggesting a role in regulating tight junctions in epithelial tissues (Perez2016EphA2). These interactions highlight afadin's role in maintaining the integrity and function of cell-cell junctions.
