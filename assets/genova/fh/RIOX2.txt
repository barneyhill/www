# RIOX2

## Overview
RIOX2 is a gene that encodes the protein ribosomal oxygenase 2, which is a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing family of proteins. This protein functions as a Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenase, primarily involved in the hydroxylation of ribosomal proteins, a critical post-translational modification that influences ribosome biogenesis and function (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). The RIOX2 protein is characterized by its structural domains, including a central dimerization domain and a C-terminal winged-helix (WH) domain, which are conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in cellular processes (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). RIOX2 is localized in the nucleus, with a strong presence in the nucleoli, suggesting its involvement in ribosomal RNA processing and assembly (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). The gene's expression is notably upregulated in various cancers, implicating it in cell growth, differentiation, and immune response regulation (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

## Structure
RIOX2, also known as ribosomal oxygenase 2, is a protein that features a Jumonji C (JmjC) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain contains the active site and iron-coordinating residues essential for its function as an Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent oxygenase, primarily involved in ribosomal protein hydroxylation (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). The protein also includes a central dimerization domain responsible for homo-oligomerization and a C-terminal winged-helix (WH) domain (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). These structural features are conserved across species, indicating a consistent enzymatic activity (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

The human RIOX2 protein is composed of 465 amino acids and is encoded by ten exons located on chromosome 3 (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). The JmjC domain is encoded by exons 2-4 and part of exon 5, the dimerization domain by exons 5, 6, and part of 7, and the WH domain by exons 7, 8, 9, and part of 10 (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). RIOX2 is a nuclear protein with a strong accumulation in nucleoli (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). The protein's structure and domain architecture are conserved, suggesting a consistent function across different taxa (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

## Function
RIOX2, also known as ribosomal oxygenase 2, is primarily involved in the hydroxylation of ribosomal proteins, a crucial post-translational modification that affects ribosome biogenesis and function. In healthy human cells, RIOX2 hydroxylates histidine 39 in the ribosomal protein RPL27a, which is essential for the proper organization of the peptidyl transferase center in the ribosome, thereby facilitating efficient protein synthesis (Bundred2018The; Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). This enzymatic activity is highly conserved across species, indicating its fundamental role in cellular processes (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

RIOX2 is a Fe(II) and 2OG-dependent dioxygenase, and its activity is linked to the regulation of cell proliferation and immune responses. It acts as a transcriptional co-repressor of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene, influencing T helper 2 (Th2) cell responses, which are important in immune regulation and atopic pulmonary inflammation (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). The protein is localized in the nucleus, with strong accumulation in the nucleoli, suggesting a role in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome assembly (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). RIOX2's expression is upregulated in several cancers, indicating its involvement in cell growth and differentiation (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

## Clinical Significance
The RIOX2 gene, also known as ribosomal oxygenase 2, is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), RIOX2 is highly expressed, correlating negatively with its methylation levels. Despite its high expression, RIOX2 is not considered an independent prognostic biomarker for these cancers, though its methylation status may have clinical significance in predicting patient outcomes (Sun2021The).

In prostate cancer, RIOX2 overexpression is associated with advanced disease stages, higher Gleason scores, and worse survival outcomes. It is considered a significant prognostic factor for disease-specific survival, particularly in certain patient subgroups (He2023Jumonji). The gene's expression is also linked to androgen receptor activity in castration-resistant prostate cancer, suggesting a role in treatment resistance (He2023Jumonji).

RIOX2 is also involved in gastric cancer, where it can function as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor, depending on the cancer type and stage. Its overexpression is linked to cell proliferation and survival, influencing cell cycle gene expression and histone methylation (Aziz2020Molecular).

## Interactions
RIOX2, also known as MINA53, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in ribosome biogenesis and gene regulation. RIOX2 primarily acts as a ribosomal oxygenase, hydroxylating specific histidyl residues in ribosomal proteins, such as His-39 of the ribosomal protein Rpl27a. This hydroxylation is essential for ribosome biogenesis and affects the orientation of rRNA within the ribosome (Bundred2018The; Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).

In the context of cancer, RIOX2 is highly expressed in various cancers, including glioblastoma, where it influences the expression of genes related to DNA replication and damage response pathways. Knockdown of RIOX2 in glioblastoma cells leads to decreased expression of the CDC45-MCM-GINS complex genes, causing DNA replication stress and apoptosis (Xuan2018MINA53).

RIOX2 also acts as a transcriptional co-repressor of the interleukin-4 (Il4) gene, impacting immune responses and T helper 2 cell polarization (Bräuer2018Phylogenetic). Despite its potential role in histone demethylation, the primary activity of RIOX2 is ribosomal protein hydroxylation, and its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not well-documented (Bundred2018The; Bräuer2018Phylogenetic).
