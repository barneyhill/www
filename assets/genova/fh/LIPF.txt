# LIPF

## Overview
The LIPF gene encodes the enzyme lipase F, gastric type, which is a member of the lipase family of proteins. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the gastric mucosa and plays a crucial role in the digestion of dietary fats by catalyzing the hydrolysis of triglycerides into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Lipase F is particularly active in the acidic environment of the stomach, distinguishing it from other lipases that function optimally at neutral pH levels. The activity of this enzyme is essential for efficient lipid absorption and energy homeostasis. Mutations or dysregulation of the LIPF gene can have significant implications for digestive health and are associated with various gastrointestinal disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
