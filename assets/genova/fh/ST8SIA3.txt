# ST8SIA3

## Overview
ST8SIA3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase 3, a member of the sialyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids, a process critical for various cellular functions, particularly in the brain. ST8SIA3 is characterized as an oligo-sialyltransferase, responsible for the synthesis of oligosialic acid chains, and is distinct from polysialyltransferases due to its inability to synthesize polysialic acid chains (Huang2017The; Sato2019Sialic). The protein is a type II transmembrane enzyme localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in the sialylation of G-protein-coupled receptors, such as adenosine A2A and dopamine D1/D2 receptors, which are crucial for motor function and neurological signaling (Lin2019Functional). Alterations in ST8SIA3 expression have been linked to neurological disorders, including Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function and its potential as a therapeutic target (Sato2021Polysialylation; Desplats2007Glycolipid).

## Structure
The ST8SIA3 protein, encoded by the ST8SIA3 gene, is a member of the sialyltransferase family involved in the transfer of sialic acid residues to glycoproteins and glycolipids. It is characterized by a type II transmembrane topology, featuring a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a catalytic domain oriented towards the lumen of the Golgi apparatus (Huang2017The; Sato2019Sialic). The catalytic domain contains conserved sialyl motifs, including the Large Sialyl Motif (SML), Small Sialyl Motif (SMS), and Very Small Sialyl Motif (SMVS), which are crucial for substrate binding and catalytic activity (Huang2017The; Sato2019Sialic).

The tertiary structure of ST8SIA3 has been elucidated using X-ray crystallography, revealing a dimeric structure in solution with each monomer containing an active site facing the membrane (Huang2017The). The protein structure includes antiparallel β-sheets and disulfide bonds, contributing to its stability and activity (Huang2017The). ST8SIA3 is classified as an oligo-sialyltransferase, synthesizing oligosialic acid chains but not polysialic acid chains, due to the absence of specific sequences necessary for polysialylation (Huang2017The; Sato2019Sialic).

## Function
ST8SIA3 is a sialyltransferase enzyme involved in the sialylation of glycoproteins, particularly in the striatum of the brain. It catalyzes the addition of sialic acid residues to form di- and trisialylated structures on N- and O-glycans, which are crucial for the regulation of striatal functions (Lin2019Functional). This enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus and plays a significant role in the sialylation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as adenosine A2A and dopamine D1/D2 receptors, which are important for motor functions and are drug targets for diseases like Parkinson's and schizophrenia (Lin2019Functional).

ST8SIA3-mediated sialylation affects the biochemical properties of these receptors, influencing their distribution in membrane microdomains like lipid rafts, which is essential for proper receptor signaling and function (Lin2019Functional). In healthy human cells, ST8SIA3 is involved in the oligosialylation of certain receptors, affecting their localization and function, particularly in the context of motor function regulation (Sato2021Polysialylation). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining normal striatal signaling and receptor interactions, impacting neuronal development and motor function (Lin2019Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ST8SIA3 gene have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In Huntington's disease (HD), a progressive brain disorder characterized by uncontrolled movements and cognitive deficits, ST8SIA3 transcript levels are significantly reduced in the striatum of both HD patients and mouse models. This reduction may alter striatal signaling and affect responses to therapeutic drugs, potentially contributing to the disease's pathology (Sato2021Polysialylation; Desplats2007Glycolipid). The decreased expression of ST8SIA3 in HD is associated with changes in ganglioside metabolism, which may have significant consequences in the striatum, a brain region heavily impacted by the disease (Desplats2007Glycolipid).

ST8SIA3 is also involved in the regulation of dopamine D2 and adenosine A2A receptors in the striatum, which are critical in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The absence of ST8SIA3-mediated sialylation alters the distribution of these receptors, affecting their interactions and potentially contributing to the pathophysiology of these disorders (Lin2019Functional). Changes in ST8SIA3 activity could influence the pharmacological properties of drugs targeting its substrates, highlighting its potential as a drug target for diseases like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease (Lin2019Functional).

## Interactions
ST8SIA3 is involved in the sialylation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), which are significant for neurological signaling. The sialylation mediated by ST8SIA3 influences the distribution of these receptors in membrane microdomains, such as lipid rafts, which are crucial for their signaling functions. In the absence of ST8SIA3, there is an increased presence of A2AR and D2R in lipid rafts, facilitating the formation of A2AR-D2R heteromers. These heteromers are known to negatively regulate each other, impacting signaling pathways associated with movement disorders like Parkinson's disease (Lin2019Functional).

ST8SIA3 also affects the interactions between its substrates, such as the negative reciprocal regulation between A2AR and D2R. This regulation is significant for the modulation of receptor functions and signaling pathways in the brain (Lin2019Functional). The enzyme's role in sialylation does not alter the total levels or trafficking of these proteins but influences their localization and complex formation, which is essential for their functional interactions (Lin2019Functional).
