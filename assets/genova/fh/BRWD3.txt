# BRWD3

## Overview
BRWD3 is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein bromodomain and WD repeat domain containing 3. This protein is characterized by the presence of bromodomains and WD40 repeat domains, which are integral to its function in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. As a scaffold protein, BRWD3 facilitates protein-protein interactions and chromatin binding, playing a crucial role in gene expression by recognizing acetylated lysine residues on histone tails. The protein is involved in various cellular processes, including adipogenesis and neural development, through its interactions with chromatin-associated proteins and transcriptional complexes. Mutations in the BRWD3 gene have been linked to X-linked intellectual disability and other developmental disorders, underscoring its significance in human health and disease (Chen2015Intellectual; Wang2021DDB1; Kalla2004Translocation).

## Structure
The BRWD3 protein is characterized by the presence of bromodomains and WD40 repeat domains, which are crucial for its function. The protein is produced in multiple transcript variants through alternative splicing, with the two most abundant being variants A and B. These variants differ in the inclusion of the first 171 amino acids, resulting in predicted translation products of 1,802 and 1,631 amino acids, respectively (Kalla2004Translocation). The common structure of these variants includes an amino-terminal region with eight tandem WD40 repeats and a carboxy-terminal region containing two bromodomains (Kalla2004Translocation).

The WD40 repeats are involved in forming multiprotein complexes and play roles in signal transduction, cell division, and other cellular processes (Tenorio2019MRX93). The bromodomains are known for recognizing acetylated lysine residues, facilitating protein-protein interactions in chromatin-associated proteins (Kalla2004Translocation). Variants C-P of BRWD3 are alternatively spliced versions of A and B, resulting in amino-terminally truncated proteins that retain some WD40 repeats and both bromodomains (Kalla2004Translocation).

BRWD3 is also involved in the recruitment of DDB1 to acetylated histones, which is essential for transcriptional activation in adipogenesis (Wang2021DDB1). The molecular structure of BRWD3, with its dual bromodomains and WD40 repeats, is integral to its role in cellular processes and gene regulation.

## Function
BRWD3 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The BRWD3 protein contains bromodomains and WD40 repeats, which are structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions and chromatin binding. These domains allow BRWD3 to recognize acetylated lysine residues on histone tails, influencing gene expression by modulating chromatin structure (Wang2021DDB1; Kalla2004Translocation).

In healthy human cells, BRWD3 plays a role in regulating gene expression by interacting with chromatin-associated proteins. It is involved in the recruitment of the DDB1 protein to histones, which is crucial for the transcriptional activation of genes involved in adipogenesis, the process of fat cell development. This interaction facilitates the release of paused RNA polymerase II, promoting the transcriptional cascade necessary for adipocyte differentiation (Wang2021DDB1).

BRWD3 is also implicated in maintaining proper gene expression and chromatin structure, which are essential for neural development and function. Mutations in BRWD3 have been associated with X-linked intellectual disability, highlighting its importance in neural processes (Chen2015Intellectual; Morgan2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the BRWD3 gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID), specifically known as X-linked mental retardation syndrome with overgrowth (XMR93 syndrome) or XLID-BRWD3-related syndrome. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, macrocephaly, and dysmorphic facial features. Patients often exhibit neurodevelopmental delays, including motor and speech delays, and may display autistic traits or shyness. The syndrome is marked by a distinctive facial appearance, including a large forehead, deep-set eyes, large ears, and a prominent chin (Tenorio2019MRX93).

In addition to intellectual disability, BRWD3 mutations have been linked to other developmental disorders. For instance, a hemizygous mutation in BRWD3 was identified in a patient with West syndrome, a form of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (HinoFukuyo2015Genomic). Another case involved a 5.8 Mb interstitial deletion on chromosome Xq21.1, including the BRWD3 gene, which resulted in intellectual disability, cleft palate, hearing impairment, and growth hormone deficiency (Giordano2015A).

The BRWD3 gene is also implicated in regulating gene expression through its interaction with the HIRA/histone H3.3 pathway, affecting chromatin remodeling and potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of these disorders (Chen2015Intellectual).

## Interactions
BRWD3 is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in various biological processes. It acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the release of paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during adipogenesis by forming a transcriptional complex with DDB1, ELK1, the Mediator complex, Pol II, and P-TEFb. This complex is essential for the transcription of immediate early genes (IEGs) (Wang2021DDB1). BRWD3 recruits DDB1 to acetylated histones in the proximal promoters of IEGs, highlighting its role in marking genes for transcription (Wang2021DDB1).

BRWD3 also functions as a substrate receptor in the Cullin4-RING Finger E3 Ligase (CRL4) complex, mediating the light-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of Drosophila cryptochrome (dCRY). This interaction is crucial for the light-mediated resetting of the circadian clock in Drosophila (Ozturk2013Ramshackle). BRWD3 interacts with dCRY in a light-dependent manner, facilitating its ubiquitylation by the CRL4 complex, which includes DDB1, CUL4, and ROC1 (Ozturk2013Ramshackle).

In addition, BRWD3 is implicated in chromatin interactions, potentially involving the BRG1-containing chromatin-remodeling complex, as some components were identified as potentially interacting with DDB1 (Wang2021DDB1). These interactions underscore BRWD3's role in regulating gene expression and cellular processes.
