# ZBTB10

## Overview
ZBTB10 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 10 protein, which is a member of the zinc finger and BTB domain family. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger motifs and a BTB domain, which facilitate its role as a transcriptional repressor. The zinc finger motifs are essential for binding to specific DNA sequences, particularly telomeric variant repeats, while the BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions. ZBTB10 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional activity of target genes, although its impact on telomere homeostasis is minimal. The protein also plays a role in immune regulation by modulating NF-κB signaling pathways. Clinically, ZBTB10 has been associated with congenital heart defects and cancer, where it may function as a tumor suppressor by regulating Specificity protein transcription factors (Bluhm2019ZBTB10; Smita2021Zbtb10; Safe2015MicroRNASpecificity).

## Structure
ZBTB10 is a protein characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs and a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac) domain. The zinc finger motifs are crucial for DNA binding, specifically to telomeric sequences such as TTGGGG, with the strongest binding affinity observed at this sequence (Bluhm2019ZBTB10). The BTB domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and has been shown to form helical filaments, which may influence the clustering and function of ZBTB proteins (Mance2024Dynamic). 

The protein's structure includes two classical zinc fingers, which are necessary and sufficient for DNA binding, while the C-terminal region enhances binding affinity (Bluhm2019ZBTB10). Mutations in the zinc fingers, such as C551A or C579A, abolish DNA binding, indicating their essential role in the protein's function (Bluhm2019ZBTB10). 

ZBTB10 may undergo post-translational modifications, including sumoylation, which is affected during HSV-1 infection, leading to changes in protein abundance and function (Sloan2015Analysis). The protein's interaction with telomeric variant repeats and the TRF2/RAP1 complex suggests a role in telomere maintenance, particularly in ALT-positive cells (Bluhm2019ZBTB10).

## Function
ZBTB10 is a transcriptional repressor that plays a role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It is part of the zinc finger and BTB domain family and is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional activity of target genes. In cell biology, ZBTB10 has been shown to interact with telomeric variant repeats, specifically binding to the TTGGGG sequence found in telomeres of cells using the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. This binding is facilitated by its zinc finger domains, which are necessary for its DNA-binding ability (Bluhm2019ZBTB10).

Despite its binding to telomeric sequences, ZBTB10 does not significantly impact telomere homeostasis, as no notable differences in telomerase activity, telomere length, or ALT-associated phenotypes were observed between wild-type and knockout cells (Bluhm2019ZBTB10). ZBTB10 interacts with components of the shelterin complex, such as TRF2 and RAP1, but does not affect TRF2 protein stability or its role in telomere end protection (Bluhm2019ZBTB10). The protein's role in transcription regulation appears limited, with minimal changes in gene expression observed upon its knockout in certain cell lines (Bluhm2019ZBTB10).

## Clinical Significance
ZBTB10 has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In the context of congenital heart defects (CHD), ZBTB10 is located in a copy number variation (CNV) region associated with complete atrioventricular canal (CAVC) in Chinese children. It has also been linked to transposition of the great arteries (TGA) in a genome-wide association study involving Caucasian patients with CHD, suggesting its potential role in cardiac development and disease (Zhang2021Copy).

In cancer, ZBTB10 is involved in transcriptional repression and is regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). The suppression of ZBTB10 by miR-27a leads to increased expression of Specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors, which are associated with poor prognosis in various cancers. This suggests that ZBTB10 may act as a tumor suppressor by regulating Sp-regulated genes (Safe2015MicroRNASpecificity).

A novel fusion between ZBTB10 and NTRK3 has been identified in a high-grade glioneuronal tumor in the pineal region, indicating a potential role in tumorigenesis. This fusion results in the activation of NTRK3 signaling, highlighting the oncogenic potential of ZBTB10 alterations (Zanazzi2020Pineal).

## Interactions
ZBTB10 is known to interact with specific telomeric variant repeat sequences, particularly the TTGGGG repeat, through its zinc finger domains. This binding is crucial for its localization to a subset of telomeres in ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) cells, where it co-localizes with the telomeric protein TRF2 in about 19% of its foci (Bluhm2019ZBTB10). ZBTB10 interacts with the TRF2/RAP1 complex, specifically through the N-terminal region of TRF2, but does not interact with other components of the shelterin complex, indicating a selective interaction with the TRF2/RAP1 heterodimer (Bluhm2019ZBTB10).

In addition to its interactions with telomeric proteins, ZBTB10 is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathways. It plays a role in the activation of murine conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) by regulating the expression of Myd88 and other NF-κB signaling molecules. ZBTB10 depletion leads to reduced phosphorylation of IκBα and decreased nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits, affecting cytokine production and immune responses (Smita2021Zbtb10). These interactions highlight ZBTB10's role in both telomere biology and immune regulation.
