# RNF144B

## Overview
RNF144B is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 144B, a member of the RBR (RING between RINGs) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by its two RING finger domains and an in-between-ring (IBR) domain, which are crucial for its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Nakamura2011The). As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, ring finger protein 144B is involved in the regulation of protein degradation, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and DNA damage response (Abad2024The). It is activated by the tumor suppressor protein TP53 and contributes to maintaining genomic stability by targeting specific proteins for proteasomal degradation (Abad2024The). The protein's activity is essential for preventing chromosomal instability and mitotic defects, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor (Abad2024The). RNF144B's function and regulation are of particular interest in cancer research, where its expression levels and interactions with other proteins have significant implications for tumorigenesis and therapeutic strategies (Abad2023The).

## Structure
RNF144B is a member of the RBR (RING between RNFs) family of proteins, characterized by the presence of two RING finger domains linked by an in-between-ring (IBR) domain. The N-terminal RING (RING1) forms a canonical cross-brace structure, which is central to its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The C-terminal RING (RING2) has a different tertiary structure and binds one metal ion, suggesting functional diversity between the two RNF domains (Nakamura2011The). The IBR domain comprises two zinc-binding structures in a C6HC configuration, essential for mediating protein-protein interactions with E2 enzymes and substrate proteins (Nakamura2011The).

RNF144B is involved in various biological functions, including protein quality control, signaling, cell cycle, and apoptosis. It interacts with activated Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein, and translocates to mitochondria during apoptosis, a process requiring its transmembrane domain (Nakamura2011The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which is critical for its stability. Specifically, phosphorylation at serine residue S301 by GSK3β is crucial for maintaining its protein levels (Zhou2018Pir2Rnf144b). RNF144B may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
RNF144B is a TP53-activated E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability in healthy human cells. It is involved in the proteasomal degradation of proteins essential for cell cycle progression and DNA damage response, such as p21, TPX2, TOP2A, and RAD21 (Abad2024The). By regulating these proteins, RNF144B helps prevent chromosomal instability and mitotic defects, which are critical for maintaining genomic integrity (Abad2024The).

In healthy cells, RNF144B is implicated in regulating epithelial homeostasis and differentiation. It achieves this by degrading the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and modulating apoptosis, thereby contributing to the control of cell proliferation and transformation (Abad2024The). RNF144B's activity is crucial for the DNA damage response, as its deficiency leads to increased DNA double-strand breaks and chromosomal instability (Abad2024The).

RNF144B is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular homeostasis and stress responses. Its function as a tumor suppressor is linked to its ability to regulate the degradation of proteins involved in mitotic progression and DNA repair, thus supporting genomic stability and preventing tumorigenesis (Abad2024The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF144B gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. RNF144B is identified as a tumor suppressor gene that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability. Its downregulation is associated with chromosomal instability, leading to mitotic defects such as lagging chromosomes and anaphase bridges, which contribute to DNA damage in cancer cells (Abad2024The; Abad2023Thea). In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), low RNF144B expression correlates with higher aneuploidy scores and worsened prognosis, especially in patients with wild-type TP53 (Abad2023The; Abad2024The).

RNF144B deficiency enhances cellular proliferation and transformation, particularly in lung cancer cells, and is linked to resistance to certain anticancer therapies, including those targeting the cell cycle and DNA damage (Abad2023The; Abad2023Thea). This resistance is due to increased tolerance to DNA damage, as indicated by elevated γH2AX levels following treatment with cytotoxic drugs (Abad2023The). The mutual exclusivity of RNF144B and TP53 mutations in several cancers suggests their potential interaction in the same pathway, underscoring the importance of RNF144B in TP53-mediated tumor suppression (Abad2024The). These findings highlight the potential of RNF144B as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
RNF144B, a TP53-activated E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in maintaining genomic stability and tumor suppression. It interacts with proteins such as p21, TPX2, TOP2A, and RAD21, which are essential for cell cycle arrest, mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome condensation, and sister chromatid cohesion, respectively (Abad2023The; Abad2024The). These interactions facilitate the proteasomal degradation of target proteins, thereby regulating mitotic progression and the DNA damage response (Abad2023The; Abad2024The).

RNF144B deficiency has been shown to lead to increased DNA double-strand breaks and chromosomal instability, highlighting its role in DNA repair processes (Abad2023The). The protein also interacts with microtubule organization proteins, contributing to its function in maintaining ploidy and genomic integrity (Abad2023The). In endometrial cancer cells, RNF144B, also known as PIR2, is regulated by kinase pathways, with GSK3β identified as a kinase that influences its stability through phosphorylation (Zhou2018Pir2Rnf144b). These interactions underscore RNF144B's critical role in cellular stress responses and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.
