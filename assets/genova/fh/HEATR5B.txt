# HEATR5B

## Overview
HEATR5B is a gene that encodes the HEAT repeat-containing protein 5B, which is characterized by the presence of HEAT repeats—structural motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions and intracellular transport. The HEATR5B protein plays a significant role in vesicle trafficking within the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by interacting with the adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) and the dynein-dynactin motor complex, although it is not a canonical activating adaptor due to the absence of long coiled coils (Madan2023HEATR5B; Park2024Cargo). This protein is involved in the retrograde transport of endosomal membranes, crucial for maintaining cellular function and proper Golgi apparatus operation (Madan2023HEATR5B). Mutations in the HEATR5B gene have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and may also have implications in immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition, highlighting its clinical significance (Cavusoglu2024Evaluation; Ghosh2021Biallelic; Hunter2016Searching).

## Structure
HEATR5B is a protein characterized by the presence of HEAT repeats, which are structural motifs composed of tandemly repeated sequences that typically form alpha-helical structures. These repeats consist of 37-47 amino acid motifs with duplicated anti-parallel α-helices linked by flexible interunit loops, allowing for significant conformational flexibility (Marmorale2023Two; Ghosh2021Biallelic). The HEAT repeats in HEATR5B serve as scaffolds for protein interactions, facilitating its role in intracellular transport and protein-protein interactions (Ghosh2021Biallelic).

HEATR5B interacts with the adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) and is involved in vesicle trafficking within the trans-Golgi network (TGN). It is a component of the clathrin-coated vesicle machinery, promoting the membrane localization and motility of AP-1-positive structures (Park2024Cargo). Although HEATR5B enhances the motility of the dynein-dynactin complex, it is not considered a canonical activating adaptor due to the absence of long coiled coils typically required for such interactions (Park2024Cargo).

The protein also forms complexes with other proteins, such as aftiphilin and γ-synergin, which mediate its interaction with AP-1, although these interactions are thought to be indirect (Zysnarski2019Adaptor). The specific details of the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of HEATR5B are not fully detailed in the available literature.

## Function
HEATR5B is a protein that plays a crucial role in the trafficking of AP1-associated endosomal membranes in human cells. It is involved in the retrograde transport of these membranes from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to peripheral compartments, a process essential for maintaining proper cellular function (Madan2023HEATR5B). HEATR5B associates with the dynein-dynactin motor complex, selectively promoting the motility of AP1-bound endosomal membranes. This interaction facilitates microtubule-based transport, although HEATR5B does not act as a primary activating adaptor due to the absence of coiled-coil domains typical of such adaptors (Madan2023HEATR5B).

HEATR5B is concentrated on peripheral AP1-positive endosomal membranes, suggesting its role in modulating dynein-based transport. It promotes the association of AP1 with membranes, which is necessary for clathrin-mediated budding of post-Golgi membranes (Madan2023HEATR5B). Disruption of HEATR5B function can lead to misrouting of AP1 cargoes and increased size of the trans-Golgi compartment, highlighting its importance in maintaining proper AP1 trafficking and Golgi function (Madan2023HEATR5B). The protein's function is evolutionarily conserved, as its homologues in organisms like Drosophila and C. elegans are also implicated in AP1-based trafficking (Madan2023HEATR5B).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HEATR5B gene have been linked to a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH), a condition marked by reduced brain volume in the pons and cerebellum. This syndrome manifests with severe global motor and cognitive delays, neonatal-onset seizures, and other neurological impairments. Biallelic hypomorphic mutations in HEATR5B, such as those affecting splicing, have been identified in affected individuals, suggesting that these genetic alterations are likely the cause of the disease (Ghosh2021Biallelic). 

In addition to neurological symptoms, some patients with HEATR5B mutations also exhibit immunodeficiency and recurrent infections, indicating a broader impact on health (Cavusoglu2024Evaluation). The clinical significance of HEATR5B is further underscored by its potential involvement in prostate cancer predisposition, as a truncating mutation in the gene has shown partial segregation with the disease in familial cases (Hunter2016Searching). These findings highlight the importance of HEATR5B in various pathological conditions, making it a target for further research into therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
HEATR5B, a HEAT repeat-containing protein, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in vesicle trafficking within the trans-Golgi network (TGN). It interacts with the adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1), which is crucial for cargo selection and clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation. In HeLa cells, HEATR5B comigrates with AP-1-positive structures, promoting their membrane localization and motility. This suggests that HEATR5B enhances the motility of the dynein/dynactin complex, although it is not a canonical activating adaptor due to the absence of long coiled coils necessary for direct interaction with the dynein tail. Instead, HEATR5B may function as a scaffold for dynein-dynactin-cargo adaptors, similar to Ankyrin B (Park2024Cargo).

In humans, HEATR5B is predicted to interact with proteins such as Aftiphilin and Clba1, sharing a common molecular binding interface similar to that in yeast. These interactions are mediated by specific regions, HR2 and HR3, and mutations in these regions can disrupt the interactions (Marmorale2023Two). However, no high-confidence interactions were found between HEATR5B and γ-synergin (Marmorale2023Two).
