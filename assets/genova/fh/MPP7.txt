# MPP7

## Overview
MPP7, or membrane protein, palmitoylated 7, is a gene that encodes the MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 7, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining cell polarity and epithelial integrity, playing a crucial role in the formation of epithelial tight junctions. As a scaffolding protein, MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 7 facilitates protein-protein interactions essential for cell-cell contact and signaling pathways, including the regulation of autophagy through its interaction with YAP1, a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo pathway. The gene's expression and the protein's interactions have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer and glaucoma, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (New2019MDH1; Liao2021MPP7).

## Function
MPP7 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 7) is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which plays a significant role in maintaining cell polarity and epithelial integrity. In healthy human cells, MPP7 is primarily active at cell junctions, where it contributes to the structural organization and function of epithelial tissues. It is involved in the formation of epithelial tight junctions, which are crucial for maintaining the barrier and transport functions of epithelial layers (New2019MDH1).

MPP7 functions as a scaffolding protein, facilitating protein-protein interactions that are essential for cell-cell contact and signaling pathways. It is implicated in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular process that degrades and recycles cellular components, through its interaction with YAP1, a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo pathway. This interaction promotes autophagy, which is vital for cell survival under stress conditions (New2019MDH1).

The protein's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and integrity, particularly in epithelial tissues. MPP7's role in these pathways highlights its potential impact on cell proliferation and differentiation, contributing to the overall health and function of epithelial cells (New2019MDH1).

## Clinical Significance
The MPP7 gene has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, MPP7 expression is elevated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and high levels are associated with advanced tumor stages and poor disease-free survival. MPP7 overexpression enhances the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells, promoting metastasis, particularly to lung tissues. This oncogenic activity is linked to the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activation of the EGFR/AKT signaling pathway, making MPP7 a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer (Liao2021MPP7).

In primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a genome-wide association study identified a significant association between the SNP rs7916852 in the MPP7 gene and the disease, with an odds ratio of 1.70. MPP7 expression is downregulated in human trabecular meshwork cells under cyclic mechanical stress, a condition relevant to glaucoma pathology. This suggests that MPP7 may play a role in POAG through stress-mediated expression changes, contributing to the disease's progression (Vishal2016Genetic).

Additionally, MPP7 has been explored in the context of MODY-like diabetes, where a chromosomal translocation near the MPP7 gene was identified. Although no direct mutations were found, the study suggests a potential role for MPP7 in islet cell function and diabetes pathogenesis through its involvement in cell polarity (Bhoj2009MODYlike).

## Interactions
MPP7 (MAGUK p55 scaffold protein 7) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. MPP7 interacts with Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a transcriptional regulator involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis suppression. MPP7 is essential for the accumulation of YAP1 in the nucleus, where it becomes transcriptionally active. This interaction is significant for both basal and starvation-induced autophagy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, as MPP7 depletion leads to the accumulation of the inactive, cytoplasmic form of YAP1. Overexpression of YAP1 in MPP7-depleted cells can rescue autophagic flux, indicating that MPP7 positively regulates YAP1 activity (New2019MDH1).

MPP7 also plays a role in the regulation of autophagy through its involvement in the mTORC1 and ULK1 pathway. MPP7 depletion affects the initiation stage of autophagy, impacting PI3P levels and WIPI2 puncta formation, and results in a faster rate of ULK1 Ser757 dephosphorylation (New2019MDH1). These interactions highlight MPP7's role as a scaffolding protein that influences key signaling pathways and cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer cell survival and autophagy regulation.
