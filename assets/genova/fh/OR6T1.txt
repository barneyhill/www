# OR6T1

## Overview
The OR6T1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 6 subfamily T member 1, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a pivotal role in the olfactory system. As a transmembrane receptor, OR6T1 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants and initiates a signal transduction pathway that ultimately leads to the perception of smell. The evolutionary significance of OR6T1 is underscored by the presence of both ancestral and derived alleles in Neanderthals, indicating its potential adaptation in olfactory functions (PaixãoCôrtes2012Homo). Understanding the role of OR6T1 contributes to a broader comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying the human sense of smell and its evolutionary development.

## Function
The OR6T1 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are primarily expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (PaixãoCôrtes2012Homo). The OR6T1 receptor is involved in the molecular process of odorant detection, which triggers neuronal responses contributing to the sense of smell. This process involves the binding of odorant molecules to the receptor, activating a G-protein, which then initiates a cascade of intracellular events leading to the generation of an electrical signal in olfactory neurons. This signal is transmitted to the brain, where it is interpreted as a distinct smell. The presence of both ancestral and derived alleles of OR6T1 in Neanderthals suggests its evolutionary significance and potential adaptation in olfactory functions (PaixãoCôrtes2012Homo). Understanding the function of OR6T1 and other olfactory receptors is important for comprehending the complex mechanisms underlying the human sense of smell and its evolutionary history.
