# GLYR1

## Overview
GLYR1 (glyoxylate reductase 1 homolog) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an oxidoreductase, primarily involved in the reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate, a critical process for detoxifying glyoxylate and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein encoded by GLYR1 is active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in metabolic pathways essential for cellular function. Beyond its metabolic role, GLYR1 is implicated in the regulation of nuclear transport, interacting with proteins such as MLH1, which is involved in DNA repair, thereby contributing to genomic stability. Additionally, GLYR1 is involved in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation through interactions with various proteins, including transcription factors and histone demethylases. These interactions highlight its multifaceted role in cellular processes and underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and genomic integrity (GonzalezTeran2021Integration; Hu2020Downregulation).

## Structure


## Function
GLYR1 (glyoxylate reductase 1 homolog) is a gene encoding a protein that functions as an oxidoreductase, primarily involved in the reduction of glyoxylate to glycolate. This enzymatic activity is crucial for detoxifying glyoxylate, a byproduct of various metabolic processes, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic balance. The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it participates in metabolic pathways essential for cellular function (Hu2020Downregulation).

In healthy human cells, GLYR1 is presumed to play a role in regulating the nuclear transport of proteins, as evidenced by its interaction with the mismatch repair gene MLH1. This interaction is important for the nuclear expression of MLH1, which is involved in DNA repair processes. The regulation of nuclear transport by GLYR1 suggests its involvement in maintaining genomic stability (Hu2020Downregulation).

While the specific functions of GLYR1 in healthy cells are not fully detailed, its role in cellular metabolism and potential involvement in nuclear transport highlight its importance in maintaining cellular and genomic integrity. The protein's activity in these processes underscores its significance in normal cellular function and organismal health (Hu2020Downregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the GLYR1 gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of microsatellite instability colorectal cancer (MSI CRC). GLYR1 is frequently mutated in MSI CRC, with studies identifying a high mutation frequency, including biallelic mutations that lead to a loss of function through nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA. These mutations often involve insertions or deletions in the gene's coding regions, particularly in the G8 repeat, contributing to the inactivation of GLYR1 protein expression in tumors (Alhopuro2011Candidate).

Downregulation of GLYR1 in MSI CRC is associated with increased tumor proliferation and reduced differentiation, as well as decreased sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This downregulation affects the cell cycle by accelerating the G1/S transition and is linked to reduced expression of cell cycle inhibitors like p21 and p27. It also influences the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, contributing to chemoresistance (Hu2020Downregulation).

GLYR1 interacts with mismatch repair genes such as MLH1, and its downregulation alters the nuclear localization of MLH1, potentially affecting DNA repair processes. These interactions suggest that GLYR1 plays a role in maintaining genomic stability, and its alteration may contribute to the development and progression of MSI CRC (Hu2020Downregulation).

## Interactions
GLYR1, also known as NPAC, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that play crucial roles in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation. It interacts with the GATA4 protein, a transcription factor essential for cardiac development. This interaction is significant for the co-activation of cardiac developmental genes. A missense variant in GLYR1, specifically the P496L mutation, disrupts its interaction with GATA4, affecting their joint transcriptional regulation activity (GonzalezTeran2021Integration).

GLYR1 also forms a complex with LSD2, a histone demethylase, where it stimulates the nucleosome-demethylase activity of LSD2. This interaction is facilitated by GLYR1's AT-hook module, which binds and activates the MAPK p38a, and a linker segment that binds LSD2 with high affinity (Marabelli2019A).

In colorectal cancer, GLYR1 interacts with MLH1, a mismatch repair protein, regulating its nuclear expression. This interaction is crucial for maintaining proper mismatch repair function and is implicated in the pathogenesis of microsatellite instability colorectal cancer (Hu2020Downregulation).

GLYR1 is also part of a complex with KDM1B, where it enhances the demethylation of H3K4me1/2 by binding at the AOD/SWIRM interface of KDM1B (Burg2015KDM1).
