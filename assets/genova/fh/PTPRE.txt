# PTPRE

## Overview
PTPRE, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type E, is a gene that encodes a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, which are signaling molecules involved in regulating a variety of cellular processes. The protein product of PTPRE is a receptor-type PTP that plays a critical role in modulating signal transduction pathways by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins. This modulation is essential for the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases and various signaling pathways, including the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway, which influences cell proliferation, cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Zhang2021Protein; Han2019LncRNA). PTPRE is also involved in immune response regulation, particularly in macrophage activation, and is implicated in conditions such as allergic asthma (Han2019LncRNA). The protein is active in multiple cellular locations, including the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, where it affects cell adhesion and migration, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhang2021Protein).

## Function
PTPRE (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type E) is a crucial regulator of signal transduction pathways in healthy human cells. It functions by dephosphorylating tyrosine residues on target proteins, thereby modulating the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin receptor and PDGFRB (Zhang2021Protein). PTPRE is involved in the regulation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which plays a significant role in cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Han2019LncRNA). 

In the context of immune response, PTPRE is suggested to inhibit IL-4-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, thereby regulating macrophage functions and maintaining a balance in macrophage activation (Han2019LncRNA). This regulation is crucial for controlling inflammatory responses and is implicated in conditions such as allergic asthma (Han2019LncRNA).

PTPRE is active in various cellular locations, including the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, where it influences processes like cell adhesion and migration (Zhang2021Protein). Its ability to modulate signaling pathways helps maintain cellular homeostasis by preventing excessive activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, which is essential for normal cellular function and organismal health (Zhang2021Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PTPRE gene have been implicated in various diseases. In colorectal tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI-H), frameshift mutations in PTPRE and other protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) genes are common, affecting about 32% of these cancers. These mutations are believed to impair phosphatase activity, potentially impacting tumor suppressive functions and contributing to tumor progression (Korff2008Frameshift).

In the context of inflammatory diseases, the long noncoding RNA PTPRE-AS1 regulates PTPRE expression and is involved in modulating M2 macrophage activation. Reduced expression of PTPRE and PTPRE-AS1 has been observed in patients with allergic asthma, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis. PTPRE-AS1 deficiency can exacerbate conditions like asthma by promoting M2 macrophage activity (Han2019LncRNA).

PTPRE is also associated with chemoresistance in retinoblastoma, a common malignant eye cancer in children. Elevated PTPRE expression in etoposide-resistant retinoblastoma cell lines suggests an oncogenic role, contributing to chemotherapy resistance by enhancing cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Targeting PTPRE and its signaling pathways could offer new therapeutic strategies for retinoblastoma (Mohren2024Role).

## Interactions
PTPRE, also known as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type E, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. PTPRE interacts with Src family kinases, playing a role in modulating their activity. This interaction is significant in the context of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection, where PTPRE levels inversely correlate with HCV replication, suggesting that PTPRE may act as a viral restriction factor by promoting Src-kinase signaling (Bhattarai2017Hepatitis).

In prostate cancer cells, PTPRE is involved in the activation of the SRC and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways. The cytosolic isoform of PTPRE, in particular, has been shown to inhibit IL-6 triggered JAK/STAT signaling in leukemia cells, indicating its role in modulating these pathways (NunesXavier2019The).

PTPRE also participates in the regulation of signaling networks in red blood cells. In PTPRE knockout mice, differences in protein interaction networks were observed, with specific clusters such as the Fyn cluster showing increased phosphorylation. This suggests that PTPRE is crucial for the organization and regulation of these networks (De2008PTPϵ).
