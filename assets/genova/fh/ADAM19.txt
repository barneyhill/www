# ADAM19

## Overview
ADAM19 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 19, a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family of proteins. This protein is characterized by its multifunctional roles, including proteolysis, cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling, facilitated by its complex structure comprising several domains such as a metalloprotease domain, disintegrin domain, and a transmembrane domain (Shirakabe2001Roles; Kang2002Intracellular). ADAM19 is particularly significant in cardiovascular and neural development, where it is involved in the proteolytic processing of membrane-bound proteins, such as neuregulin I-β, which is crucial for heart morphogenesis and neural differentiation (Shirakabe2001Roles; Zhou2004Essential). The protein's enzymatic activity is regulated by metal chelators and specific inhibitors, underscoring its role as an active metalloproteinase with distinct substrate preferences (Chesneau2003Catalytic). ADAM19's interactions with other proteins, such as ArgBP1 and amyloid precursor protein, further highlight its diverse functional repertoire, with implications in diseases like Alzheimer's and congenital heart defects (Tanabe2007ADAM19; Huang2002ScreenandidentificationofproteinsinteractingwithADAM19cytoplasmictail).

## Structure
ADAM19, also known as meltrin β, is a member of the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein includes several distinct domains: a signal peptide, a prodomain, a catalytic metalloprotease domain, a disintegrin domain, a cysteine-rich domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Shirakabe2001Roles; Kang2002Intracellular). 

The metalloprotease domain contains an intact zinc-binding site, essential for its proteolytic activity (Kang2002Intracellular). The disintegrin domain is involved in cell adhesion and proteolytic activity, with antibodies against this domain inhibiting substrate cleavage (Kang2004Evidence). The cysteine-rich domain plays a crucial role in the protein's structural integrity, with disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (C605, C633, C639, and C643) maintaining the association between the N-fragment and C-fragment of ADAM19 (Kang2004Evidence).

Post-translational modifications of ADAM19 include glycosylation, with five potential glycosylation sites identified (Kang2002Intracellular). The protein is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, requiring furin-mediated cleavage for activation (Kang2002Intracellular). Alternative splicing may result in different isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context.

## Function
ADAM19, also known as meltrin β, is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including proteolysis, adhesion, and intracellular signaling. In healthy human cells, ADAM19 is involved in the proteolytic processing of membrane-bound proteins, which is crucial for their activation and function. This protein is particularly important in the cardiovascular system, where it is essential for proper heart development and morphogenesis. Mice lacking ADAM19 exhibit severe cardiac defects, such as ventricular septal defects and abnormal valve formation, indicating its critical role in cardiovascular development (Zhou2004Essential).

ADAM19 is also involved in the ectodomain shedding of neuregulin I-β, a ligand for the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which is important for neural differentiation and cardiac development (Shirakabe2001Roles; Zhou2004Essential). The protein is active in the extracellular matrix and is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, and lung (Wei2001Expression). Its enzymatic activity is regulated by metal chelators and specific inhibitors, highlighting its role as an active metalloproteinase with distinct substrate preferences (Chesneau2003Catalytic; Wei2001Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ADAM19 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly affecting cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. In cardiovascular development, ADAM19 is crucial for proper heart morphogenesis. Mice lacking functional ADAM19 exhibit severe cardiac defects, such as ventricular septal defects, abnormal valve formation, and defects in cardiac vasculature, which are similar to human congenital heart diseases like Tetralogy of Fallot (Zhou2004Essential; Horiuchi2005Evaluation). These defects are attributed to the gene's role in the ectodomain shedding of neuregulin I-β, essential for heart development (Duffy2009The).

In the context of pulmonary function, ADAM19 gene variants have been associated with lung function metrics and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Genome-wide association studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms in or near ADAM19 that correlate with lung function, with some variants linked to lower lung function and increased COPD risk (Li2024Adam19). Mouse models with ADAM19 deficiency show altered pulmonary function, supporting its role in lung health (Li2024Adam19). The gene's involvement in cleaving NEUREGULIN-1 and its non-proteolytic functions may affect lung development and neuromuscular functions (Li2024Adam19).

## Interactions
ADAM19, a member of the ADAM family of proteins, engages in several specific protein interactions that are crucial for its function. One notable interaction is with ArgBP1, which binds specifically to the SH3 binding sites in the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM19. This interaction is unique to ADAM19, as ArgBP1 does not bind to other ADAM proteins such as ADAM22, ADAM29, or ADAM9 (mouse) (Huang2002ScreenandidentificationofproteinsinteractingwithADAM19cytoplasmictail).

ADAM19 also interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP), functioning as an alpha-secretase. This interaction was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating a physical association between ADAM19 and APP, which is significant in the context of Alzheimer's disease (Tanabe2007ADAM19).

Another interaction involves cysteine-rich protein 2 (CRIP2), which binds to the disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains of ADAM19. This interaction is independent of ADAM19's catalytic activity and has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Tanabe2010ADAM19).

ADAM19 is also involved in the processing of neuregulin (NRG) proteins, particularly the β-type isoforms, through its protease activity. This interaction is crucial for the release of soluble NRGs, which play a role in neurogenesis and synaptogenesis (Shirakabe2001Roles).
