# GALP

## Overview
Galanin-like peptide (GALP) is a neuropeptide encoded by the GALP gene, which is primarily expressed in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. The GALP gene is responsible for producing the GALP protein, which shares structural similarities with the galanin family of peptides. GALP functions as a neuropeptide involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis, feeding behavior, and reproductive processes. It interacts with galanin receptors, particularly GalR2, and is influenced by metabolic hormones such as leptin and insulin, which modulate its expression in response to the body's energy state (Gundlach2002GalaninGALP; Lawrence2011Galaninlike). The peptide's role in modulating neuroendocrine functions and its interactions with other neuropeptides underscore its significance in maintaining physiological balance. Additionally, GALP's involvement in various physiological processes suggests its potential clinical relevance in metabolic disorders, cancer biology, and reproductive health (Dungan2008Altered; LANG2007The).

## Structure
The human GALP (galanin-like peptide) is a neuropeptide encoded by the GALP gene, sharing structural similarities with galanin. The mature human GALP consists of a signal sequence from amino acid residues 1-24, a mature peptide from residues 25-84, and a propeptide from residues 85-116 (Zhu2022Galanin). The primary structure of GALP includes a sequence that is conserved across species such as mouse, rat, pig, dog, and cat, indicating a conserved structural and functional relationship (Zhu2022Galanin).

Secondary structure analysis reveals that GALP contains five alpha helices and two beta strands, as predicted by the Phyre2 portal (Zhu2022Galanin). The 3D structure of GALP (residues 25-84) is predicted to resemble transportan, similar to galanin, and the full length of GALP is also predicted using the Alphafold web portal, showing consistent features with its secondary structure (Zhu2022Galanin).

Alarin is a differentially spliced form of the GALP gene, encoding a 25 amino acid neuropeptide, which suggests the presence of splice variant isoforms (Zhu2022Galanin). The molecular structure of GALP, including its secondary and tertiary structures, supports its role in neural activity modulation and its interaction with galanin receptors.

## Function
Galanin-like peptide (GALP) is a neuropeptide primarily expressed in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, where it plays a significant role in regulating energy homeostasis, feeding behavior, and reproduction. GALP interacts with galanin receptors, particularly GalR2, and is involved in the modulation of neuroendocrine functions (Gundlach2002GalaninGALP; Krasnow2003A). GALP expression is influenced by metabolic hormones such as leptin and insulin, which regulate its activity in response to the body's energy state. In leptin-deficient conditions, GALP expression is reduced, but can be restored with leptin treatment, indicating its role in energy balance (Lawrence2011Galaninlike).

GALP affects food intake and body weight, with varying effects depending on the species and context. In mice, GALP administration decreases food intake and body weight, suggesting an increase in energy expenditure, potentially through sympathetic nervous system activation and increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) in brown adipose tissue (Lawrence2011Galaninlike; Hansen2003Activation). GALP also influences reproductive functions by activating GnRH neurons and increasing luteinizing hormone levels, integrating metabolic and reproductive processes (Lang2014Physiology).

## Clinical Significance
The galanin-like peptide (GALP) gene is implicated in various physiological processes, and alterations in its expression or function can contribute to several health conditions. In the context of metabolic disorders, GALP plays a role in energy homeostasis and feeding behavior. Studies have shown that GALP knockout mice exhibit altered responses to metabolic challenges, such as fasting and high-fat diets, suggesting that GALP is involved in regulating energy balance and metabolism (Dungan2008Altered; Gundlach2013Galanin). 

In the realm of cancer biology, GALP mRNA has been detected in human gliomas, indicating a potential role in tumor pathology. GALP may act via galanin receptors, influencing tumor cell behavior and offering a target for diagnostic and therapeutic development (LANG2007The). 

GALP is also involved in the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction. Although GALP knockout mice are reproductively competent, they show some differences in reproductive organ size and hormonal responses, suggesting that GALP may modulate reproductive functions under certain conditions (Dungan2008Altered). 

Overall, GALP's involvement in these processes highlights its potential clinical significance in metabolic, oncological, and reproductive health.

## Interactions
Galanin-like peptide (GALP) interacts with several proteins and neuropeptides, primarily within the central nervous system. GALP is known to bind to galanin receptor subtypes GALR1, GALR2, and GALR3, with a higher affinity for GALR2 and GALR3 (Dong2006Galanin; Lang2005Pharmacological). These interactions influence synaptic transmission, as GALP modulates neuronal activities by inhibiting excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, suggesting a presynaptic action that reduces neurotransmitter release (Dong2006Galanin).

GALP also interacts with leptin receptors, as GALP neurons express these receptors and respond to leptin by increasing GALP mRNA expression (Gundlach2002GalaninGALP; LANG2007The). This interaction is significant in the regulation of feeding behavior and reproductive functions. GALP-containing neurons form synaptic contacts with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons, particularly in the medial preoptic area and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, suggesting GALP's role in stimulating LHRH release and influencing reproductive hormone levels (Takenoya2006Neural).

GALP also interacts with other neuropeptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and orexin, forming networks that regulate appetite and energy homeostasis (Takenoya2006Neural). These interactions highlight GALP's role in modulating various physiological processes through its complex network of interactions.
