# ACTA2

## Overview
The ACTA2 gene encodes the smooth muscle alpha-actin protein, a critical component of the cytoskeleton in smooth muscle cells. This protein belongs to the actin family, which is essential for various cellular functions, including maintaining cell structure, facilitating muscle contraction, and enabling cellular motility. Smooth muscle alpha-actin, specifically, plays a pivotal role in the contractile function of vascular smooth muscle cells, contributing to the structural integrity and force production of the vascular system (Liu2017Vascular). The protein's ability to polymerize into filaments is fundamental to its function, allowing it to interact with other proteins such as myosin and tropomyosin, which are crucial for muscle contraction and stability (Ojha2023Smooth; Arora2022Structural). Mutations in the ACTA2 gene have been linked to various vascular diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining vascular health (Regalado2015Aortic).

## Structure
The ACTA2 gene encodes smooth muscle alpha-actin, a crucial component of the cytoskeleton in smooth muscle cells. The primary structure of ACTA2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the actin protein. This protein is characterized by its ability to polymerize into filaments, a process essential for maintaining cell structure and facilitating muscle contraction (Ojha2023Smooth).

The secondary structure of ACTA2 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a three-dimensional shape, allowing for specific interactions with other proteins and cellular components (Arora2022Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, ACTA2 monomers assemble into filamentous structures, which are critical for their role in muscle contraction and cellular integrity (Arora2022Structural). The actin filaments are composed of G-actin protomers, each folding into four subdomains (SD1-SD4), forming inner and outer clefts. The inner cleft is part of the nucleotide-binding site, while the outer cleft serves as a major binding interface for myosins and actin-binding proteins (Arora2022Structural).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in ACTA2 and can influence its function and interactions with other proteins (Arora2022Structural). These modifications are crucial for the regulation of actin's role in cellular processes and its involvement in various diseases.

## Function
The ACTA2 gene encodes the smooth muscle-specific isoform of α-actin, known as smooth muscle α-actin (SM α-actin), which is a major component of the actin cytoskeleton in vascular smooth muscle cells. In healthy human cells, SM α-actin is abundantly expressed, comprising 50-70% of total actin in vascular smooth muscle, with the remainder composed of β-cytoplasmic and γ-actins (Liu2017Vascular). SM α-actin is crucial for the contraction of smooth muscle cells and plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of the contractile-elastic unit of the vascular system. It supports force production through its interaction with myosin filaments and facilitates force transmission via the actin cytoskeleton, which stabilizes adhesive structures connected to the elastin-extracellular matrix (Liu2017Vascular).

In addition to its role in contraction, SM α-actin is involved in the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions, which are essential for maintaining cell shape and enabling cellular contraction (Liu2017Vascular). It also modulates the transcription of vascular muscle contractile protein genes via interaction with MRTF-A (Liu2017Vascular). In nonmuscle cells, such as myofibroblasts, SM α-actin can be expressed and is involved in remodeling the extracellular matrix through cell traction forces (Liu2017Vascular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACTA2 gene are associated with a range of vascular diseases, most notably familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD). These mutations account for a significant proportion of familial TAAD cases, with a prevalence of 12-21% (Renard2013Novel; Regalado2015Aortic). Specific mutations, such as those affecting the Arg179 residue, are linked to a severe condition known as smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome (SMDS), characterized by vascular complications like patent ductus arteriosus, aortopulmonary window, and early-onset thoracic aortic disease (Kaw2022Expanding; van2019European).

ACTA2 mutations can also lead to non-vascular manifestations, including congenital mydriasis, hypotonic bladder, and gut hypoperistalsis (Kaw2022Expanding). The mutations may interfere with actin filament formation, impacting interactions with myosin or regulatory proteins, which is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity (Hoffjan2011Three). Additionally, ACTA2 mutations are associated with early-onset stroke, coronary artery disease, and Moyamoya-like cerebrovascular disease (Regalado2015Aortic; Kaw2022Expanding). The clinical presentation of these mutations is variable, with some individuals experiencing severe vascular events at a young age, necessitating comprehensive surveillance and management (Regalado2015Aortic).

## Interactions
The ACTA2 gene encodes smooth muscle α-actin, which is integral to the cytoskeleton of smooth muscle cells and interacts with several proteins to facilitate muscle contraction and maintain cellular integrity. One of the primary interactions is with myosin, a motor protein that works with actin to produce muscle contraction. The R258C mutation in ACTA2 disrupts this interaction, leading to impaired myosin binding and reduced force output in smooth muscle cells (Lu2015Vascular).

ACTA2 also interacts with tropomyosin, a regulatory protein that stabilizes actin filaments and modulates myosin binding. The R258C mutation causes tropomyosin to occupy a more inhibitory position on actin filaments, further impairing myosin interaction and reducing filament stability (Lu2015Vascular).

Profilin, another actin-binding protein, binds more tightly to the R258C mutant actin, increasing the pool of monomeric actin and affecting polymerization dynamics (Lu2015Vascular). Cofilin, which promotes actin filament disassembly, shows increased activity on R258C filaments, suggesting enhanced actin dynamics and cell migration (Lu2015Vascular). These interactions highlight the critical role of ACTA2 in maintaining actin filament stability and function.
