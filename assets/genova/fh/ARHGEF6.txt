# ARHGEF6

## Overview
ARHGEF6, also known as Rac/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by activating the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, which are integral to processes such as cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell motility, and cell cycle progression (Zhu2018Loss). The ARHGEF6 protein is characterized by several domains, including the Calponin-homology (CH) domain, Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, Dbl homology (DH) domain, and Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function in intracellular signaling (Nagy2015Cyclic; Rosenberger2003Interaction). It is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, particularly in the hippocampal formation, where it is involved in the regulation of dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic function (Ramakers2011Dysregulation). Mutations in the ARHGEF6 gene have been linked to X-linked intellectual disability and other neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Khimsuriya2018Pathogenic).

## Structure
ARHGEF6, also known as Rac/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6, is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in intracellular signaling. The molecular structure of ARHGEF6 includes an N-terminal Calponin-homology (CH) domain, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a Dbl homology (DH) domain, a Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a GIT1-binding domain (GBD), and a coiled-coil (CC) domain (Nagy2015Cyclic; Rosenberger2003Interaction). The CH domain is involved in mediating interactions with other proteins, such as PARVB, and is necessary for proper localization within the cell (Rosenberger2003Interaction). The coiled-coil domain facilitates dimerization, which is crucial for interactions with proteins like PARVB and ARHGEF7 (Rosenberger2003Interaction).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating ARHGEF6 activity. Phosphorylation at specific sites, such as Ser-640 and Ser-684, by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases like PKA and PKG, influences the formation of protein complexes and signaling pathways (Nagy2015Cyclic). Although splice variant isoforms of ARHGEF6 are known, the context does not provide detailed information on these variants.

## Function
ARHGEF6, also known as Rac/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6, is a member of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) family that specifically activates the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. These GTPases act as molecular switches involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal rearrangements, cell motility, and cell cycle progression (Zhu2018Loss). In healthy human cells, ARHGEF6 plays a crucial role in regulating the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, which forms the structural framework of dendrites, axons, and dendritic spines. This regulation is essential for processes such as neurite outgrowth, axon pathfinding, and dendritic spine morphogenesis (Ramakers2011Dysregulation).

ARHGEF6 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in the neuropil regions of the hippocampal formation, indicating its localization in dendritic and synaptic compartments (Ramakers2011Dysregulation). It colocalizes with PSD-95 in spine heads of excitatory synapses, highlighting its important synaptic function (Ramakers2011Dysregulation). The protein is also involved in vesicular trafficking, which may affect neuronal connectivity (Ramakers2011Dysregulation). Beyond the nervous system, ARHGEF6 is essential for lymphocyte development and immune functions, indicating its broader role in cellular processes (Ramakers2011Dysregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARHGEF6 gene are associated with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and other neurodevelopmental disorders. ARHGEF6 is the third identified gene responsible for XLID, following Oligophrenin 1 (OPHN1) and P21-protein activated kinases 3 (PAK3) (Khimsuriya2018Pathogenic). These mutations can lead to significant structural and functional alterations in the ARHGEF6 protein, impacting neuronal connectivity and synaptic function, which are critical for cognitive processes (Khimsuriya2018Pathogenic).

The study by Khimsuriya and Chauhan identified 47 non-synonymous variants in the ARHGEF6 gene predicted to be deleterious, with 21 classified as customarily pathogenic. These mutations can affect the size, charge, and hydrophobicity of amino acids, altering protein conformation and function (Khimsuriya2018Pathogenic). Computational analyses revealed that these mutations result in decreased protein stability, as indicated by negative free energy change (DDG) values, potentially disrupting normal protein function (Khimsuriya2018Pathogenic).

The ARHGEF6 protein contains several functional domains, including the Calponin Homology (CH) domain and the RhoGEF domain, which are crucial for protein interactions and signaling pathways. Mutations affecting these domains can lead to significant structural changes, further contributing to disease conditions (Khimsuriya2018Pathogenic).

## Interactions
ARHGEF6, also known as Rac/Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor 6, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics. It interacts with the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP, which is essential for actin cytoskeleton regulation (Zhu2018Loss; Ramakers2011Dysregulation). ARHGEF6 forms complexes with GIT1 and GIT2, which are GTPase-activating proteins, and this interaction is part of the PIX-GIT complex that integrates signaling among Arf, Cdc42, and Rac proteins (Mamula2021Arhgef6; Khimsuriya2018Pathogenic).

ARHGEF6 is phosphorylated by protein kinases PKA and PKG, which enhances its interaction with the 14-3-3 adaptor protein, forming a complex with GIT1 in platelets (Nagy2015Cyclic). This phosphorylation does not significantly affect global Rac1-GTP levels but influences interactions with binding partners (Nagy2015Cyclic). ARHGEF6 also interacts with PAK3, a p21-activated kinase, and this interaction is crucial for dendritic spine morphogenesis, as ARHGEF6 acts upstream of PAK3 in regulating spine morphology (NodéLanglois2006Sequential). These interactions highlight ARHGEF6's role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways.
