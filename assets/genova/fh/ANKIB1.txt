# ANKIB1

## Overview
ANKIB1 is a human gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and IBR domain containing 1, which is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is part of the RBR (RING-between-RING) family of E3 ligases, known for their role in ubiquitination, a process critical for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. The ANKIB1 protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and an IBR domain, which is associated with its ubiquitin ligase activity. These structural features enable ANKIB1 to participate in intracellular signaling pathways and maintain cellular homeostasis. While its precise functions in healthy human cells are not fully understood, ANKIB1 is implicated in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and cell cycle regulation, and has been associated with neurological and cardiovascular disorders (Li2023Circular; auer2021impact; Cristobal2005Assessment).

## Structure
ANKIB1 is a human gene encoding a protein that features ankyrin repeat and IBR (in-between RING fingers) domains. The ankyrin repeats are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are crucial for the protein's functional role in cellular processes. The IBR domain is typically involved in ubiquitination processes, suggesting a role in protein degradation pathways. The presence of these domains indicates that the protein's structure is likely to include regions that mediate specific interactions and modifications.

The protein's structure may be influenced by post-translational modifications, which can alter its activity and localization within the cell. These modifications are essential for regulating the protein's function and ensuring its proper integration into cellular pathways. Additionally, splice variants of ANKIB1 could result in isoforms with distinct structural and functional properties, potentially affecting the protein's interaction capabilities and biological roles.

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of the ANKIB1 protein are not provided, the presence of ankyrin repeats and IBR domains suggests a complex structure that supports its involvement in critical cellular functions. The structural characteristics of these domains are integral to the protein's role in mediating interactions and participating in ubiquitination processes.

## Function
ANKIB1 (ankyrin repeat and IBR domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is part of the RBR (RING-between-RING) family of E3 ligases, which includes other ligases like Parkin. ANKIB1 operates through a two-step mechanism involving the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 enzyme to a RING domain and then to the substrate, a process crucial for protein degradation and regulation within the cell (auer2021impact).

The ANKIB1 protein contains ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and an IBR domain associated with ubiquitin ligase activity. These domains suggest its involvement in intracellular signaling pathways and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Cristobal2005Assessment). ANKIB1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it potentially influences processes such as protein degradation and cell cycle regulation (Li2023Circular).

Despite its known molecular activities, the specific function of ANKIB1 in healthy human cells remains not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise roles and organismal outcomes (Muscarella2010Small).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ANKIB1 gene have been associated with several neurological disorders, including intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders. These conditions may arise due to changes in the interactions of the ANKIB1 protein, which can impact cellular signaling pathways and contribute to disease pathogenesis. The stability and regulatory roles of circular RNAs derived from ANKIB1, such as circANKIB1, have been studied in the context of cardiovascular diseases. Specifically, circANKIB1 has been shown to alleviate hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury by modulating the miR-452-5p/SLC7A11 axis, which is relevant to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and ferroptosis, a form of cell death linked to iron accumulation (Li2023Circular). The protective role of circANKIB1 in cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions suggests its potential therapeutic implications for AMI treatment. Overexpression of circANKIB1 in cardiomyocytes has been found to restore cell viability, reduce iron levels, and decrease reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, which are key factors in ferroptosis (Li2023Circular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ANKIB1 in both neurological and cardiovascular contexts, emphasizing its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ANKIB1 is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role as a partner of E3 ubiquitin ligase. It interacts with several E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, including UbcH8, UbcH10, and UbcH13, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions suggest that ANKIB1 can associate with both class I and class III E2s, indicating its adaptability in ubiquitination processes (Xie2021ANKIB1).

ANKIB1 exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, capable of self-ubiquitination and assembling polyubiquitin chains, with stronger activity observed in vivo compared to in vitro (Xie2021ANKIB1). This activity is crucial in the ubiquitination of Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions, where ANKIB1 is identified as the only E3 ligase involved in synthesizing K48 and K63 ubiquitin chains around the inclusion of the mutant Ctr Tn-cdu1 in both human and mouse cells (auer2021impact).

ANKIB1's interactions are facilitated by its unique structural features, including ankyrin-repeat and UIM domains, which are not found in other RBR proteins. These domains, along with a coiled-coil motif, enable protein-protein interactions, contributing to its role in cellular processes (Xie2021ANKIB1).
