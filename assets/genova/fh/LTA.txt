# LTA

## Overview
LTA, or lymphotoxin alpha, is a gene that encodes a cytokine protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. The protein, lymphotoxin alpha, is primarily involved in immune regulation and inflammatory responses. It can form both soluble homotrimers and membrane-bound heterotrimers, the latter in association with lymphotoxin beta, which are crucial for its biological functions. These structural forms allow lymphotoxin alpha to interact with various receptors, influencing processes such as lymphoid organ development and immune cell homeostasis (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin; Borelli2021Lymphotoxin:). The gene's expression is tightly regulated and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Huang2013Four; Bolstad2012Association; Asselbergs2007Effects).

## Structure
Lymphotoxin alpha (LTA) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and is primarily known for forming a soluble homotrimer (LTα3) (Borelli2021Lymphotoxin:). The protein consists of specific homology regions that are crucial for its structure and function. These regions include HR-1 (29-34; A), HR-2 (43-45; A'), HR-3 (71-81; C), HR-4 (136-147; F), and HR-5 (165-171; H), which are involved in trimer formation (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin). The trimeric structure of LTA is essential for its stability and biological activity, as it does not dissociate as easily as TNF, allowing it to maintain its function across various conditions (Schuchmann1995Functional).

LTA can also form a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin beta (LTβ), resulting in a membrane-bound heterotrimer (LTα1β2) that binds exclusively to the LTβ receptor (LTβR) (Borelli2021Lymphotoxin:). This complex is involved in immune regulation and is expressed on the surface of lymphoid cells (Borelli2021Lymphotoxin:). LTA undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which contribute to its stability and function (Schuchmann1995Functional). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its role in immune responses and inflammation.

## Function
Lymphotoxin alpha (LTA) is a cytokine that plays a significant role in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. It is part of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and is involved in various molecular processes within the immune system. LTA is primarily active in immune cells, such as T cells and monocytes, where it contributes to the formation and maintenance of secondary lymphoid tissues (Jasenosky2020Identification).

In T cells, LTA expression is regulated by specific chromatin modifications and the presence of a distal enhancer element, hHS-8, which is crucial for its inducible expression. This enhancer facilitates the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the LTA promoter, enhancing transcription upon cellular activation (Jasenosky2020Identification). The expression of LTA in T cells is associated with increased transcriptional induction upon stimulation, indicating its role in immune response activation (Jasenosky2020Identification).

LTA is also involved in the induction of adhesion molecules and cytokines from vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, contributing to inflammatory processes and potentially influencing cardiovascular health (Asselbergs2007Effects). These activities highlight LTA's role in cellular communication and its impact on organismal outcomes related to immune function and inflammation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the lymphotoxin alpha (LTA) gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke, specific polymorphisms in the LTA gene, such as rs909253, have been studied for their potential role in stroke risk. Although initial findings suggested differences in genotype frequencies, these were not significant after adjustments. However, the GAT haplotype was found to be more common in control groups, indicating a possible protective effect against LAA stroke (Fasihi2020Association).

LTA polymorphisms have also been linked to cancer risk. A meta-analysis identified significant associations between certain LTA polymorphisms, such as rs2229094, and increased cancer susceptibility, including adenocarcinoma and hematological malignancies (Huang2013Four). In autoimmune diseases, the LTA gene has been implicated in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), with specific SNPs like rs909253 showing associations with the disease, particularly in antibody-positive patients (Bolstad2012Association).

Additionally, LTA gene variations have been associated with migraine and cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). The rs2071590 polymorphism in the LTA gene has been linked to WMHs in migraine patients, suggesting a genetic predisposition to pro-inflammatory states that may contribute to these conditions (Ferroni2022Association).

## Interactions
Lymphotoxin alpha (LTA) is a cytokine that participates in various protein interactions, primarily forming complexes that influence immune responses. LTA can form a heteromeric complex with lymphotoxin beta (LTB) on the cell surface, creating a trimeric structure distinct from the homotrimeric forms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and LTA itself. This LTA-LTB complex interacts uniquely with receptors, as it does not bind to the known TNF receptors, suggesting a role in cell-cell contact-specific signaling (BROWNING1993Lymphotoxin).

LTA also forms a soluble homotrimer (LTα3) that binds to TNFR1, TNFR2, and HVEM. When co-expressed with LTB, it forms a cell surface-bound heterotrimer (LTα1β2) that exclusively binds to the LTβ receptor (LTβR). This interaction is crucial for lymphoid organ development and immune cell homeostasis (Borelli2021Lymphotoxin:).

In the context of Hodgkin lymphoma, LTA is involved in activating both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways and promotes JAK2/STAT6 signaling. It also engages in a feedback loop with its receptor TNFRSF14, influencing the expression of various cytokines and immune checkpoint ligands (von2019Autocrine).
