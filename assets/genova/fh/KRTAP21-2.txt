# KRTAP21-2

## Overview
KRTAP21-2 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 21-2, a member of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) family. These proteins are integral to the structural integrity and mechanical properties of hair fibers, primarily through their interaction with keratin intermediate filaments. The KRTAP21-2 protein is characterized by a high content of glycine and tyrosine, as well as significant levels of cysteine and serine, which contribute to its unique structural properties and function in hair keratinization (Rogers2006Human). Although the expression of KRTAP21-2 is generally low and heterogeneous, it is primarily localized in the cortex/matrix cell region of the hair follicle, suggesting a role in influencing hair texture and quality (Rogers2006Human). The gene's promoter activity has been observed in cell arrays, but the absence of detectable transcripts indicates potential regulatory complexities (Warnatz2010Functional).

## Structure
The KRTAP21-2 protein is part of the high glycine-tyrosine keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) and is characterized by its high content of glycine and tyrosine, with a molecular weight of approximately 8.5 kDa (Rogers2006Human). The primary structure of KRTAP21-2 includes a high glycine (35.3 mol%) and tyrosine (19.3 mol%) content, along with significant amounts of cysteine and serine (Rogers2006Human). The protein features repetitive dimeric and trimeric glycine and/or tyrosine-containing repeat structures throughout its central portions, a common feature among high glycine-tyrosine KAPs (Rogers2006Human).

The secondary structure of KRTAP21-2 likely includes these repetitive units, contributing to its unique properties. The tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds, facilitated by the high cysteine content, which is typical for KAPs (Rogers2006Human). The quaternary structure involves interactions with keratin filaments, forming a matrix that contributes to the mechanical properties of hair fibers (Rogers2002Characterization).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, although specific details for KRTAP21-2 are not provided in the context. The protein's expression is weak in the hair follicle's cortex/matrix cell region (Rogers2006Human).

## Function
The KRTAP21-2 gene encodes keratin-associated protein 21-2, which plays a role in the structure and function of human hair. This protein is involved in the keratinization process, interacting with keratin intermediate filaments to contribute to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers. KRTAP21-2 is characterized by a high content of glycine and tyrosine, as well as significant levels of cysteine and serine, which are crucial for forming the protein's structure and function (Rogers2006Human).

The expression of KRTAP21-2 is generally low and heterogeneous, primarily occurring in the cortex/matrix cell region of the hair follicle. It is also associated with cuticular expression, with varying degrees of cortical expression (Rogers2006Human). Despite its low expression levels, the protein's presence in these regions suggests a role in influencing hair texture and quality through its interaction with keratin filaments.

The promoter activity of KRTAP21-2 has been studied, revealing that while its promoter is active in cell arrays, no transcripts were detected, indicating potential regulatory complexities or chromatin structures affecting its expression (Warnatz2010Functional). However, specific functional details of KRTAP21-2 in healthy human cells remain unclear.
