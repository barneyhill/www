# KLRD1

## Overview
The KLRD1 gene encodes the killer cell lectin-like receptor D1 (CD94), a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in the function of natural killer (NK) cells. CD94 forms heterodimers with members of the NKG2 family, such as NKG2A, NKG2C, and NKG2E, to create receptor complexes on NK cells and some T cells. These receptor complexes are involved in the recognition of HLA-E molecules on target cells, which can lead to either activation or inhibition of NK cell activity, depending on the specific NKG2 partner involved (Carretero1997The; Orr2010Development). The CD94/NKG2A complex typically acts as an inhibitory receptor, while CD94/NKG2C and CD94/NKG2E are associated with activating signals (Lanier1998Association). The expression of KLRD1 is linked to NK cell numbers and cytotoxic capabilities, and its modulation is significant in the context of viral infections and autoimmune diseases (Bongen2018KLRD1expressing; Nakata2013Low).

## Function
The KLRD1 gene encodes the CD94 protein, which is a component of the natural killer (NK) cell receptor complex. In healthy human cells, CD94 forms heterodimers with members of the NKG2 family, such as NKG2A, NKG2C, and NKG2E, to create receptors on NK cells and some T cells. These receptors are crucial for the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to infected or malignant cells (Bongen2018KLRD1expressing; Orr2010Development).

The CD94/NKG2 receptor complex interacts with HLA-E molecules on target cells. This interaction can either activate or inhibit NK cell activity, depending on the specific NKG2 family member involved. For instance, CD94-NKG2A acts as an inhibitory receptor, while CD94-NKG2C and CD94-NKG2E are associated with activating signals (Orr2010Development). This regulation is essential for maintaining NK cell tolerance to self and for modulating immune responses to infections (Orr2010Development).

KLRD1 expression is associated with NK cell numbers and is linked to cytotoxic granule-associated genes, suggesting a role in enhancing cytotoxic capabilities. This expression is inversely correlated with symptom severity in influenza infection, indicating a protective role against viral infections (Bongen2018KLRD1expressing).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the KLRD1 gene, which encodes the CD94 protein, have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of influenza, lower baseline levels of KLRD1 expression in the blood are linked to increased symptom severity, suggesting that KLRD1-expressing natural killer (NK) cells may provide a protective effect against influenza infection (Bongen2018KLRD1expressing). The expression of KLRD1 is also correlated with cytotoxic granule-associated genes, indicating a potential role in enhancing NK cell cytotoxic capabilities (Bongen2018KLRD1expressing).

In patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes, low expression levels of KLRD1 and KLRC3 (NKG2E) have been observed, which may impair NK cell function and contribute to the disease's pathogenesis. This reduced expression suggests a diminished amount of the NKG2E-CD94 heterodimer, crucial for NK cell activation and immune response to viral infections (Nakata2013Low).

In mice, a spontaneous mutation in the Klrd1 gene, resulting in a lack of CD94 expression, has been studied. This mutation does not affect susceptibility to the Influenza A virus PR8 strain, indicating that the Klrd1/CD94 locus may not be critical for influenza resistance in this model (Shin2015Segregation).

## Interactions
KLRD1, also known as CD94, is a protein that forms heterodimers with members of the NKG2 family, such as NKG2A, NKG2B, and NKG2C, to create functional natural killer (NK) cell receptor complexes. These complexes are involved in the recognition of HLA class I molecules, particularly HLA-E, on target cells. The CD94/NKG2A complex acts as an inhibitory receptor, containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that recruit SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, leading to the down-regulation of NK cell activity (Braud1998HLA-E; Carretero1997The).

In contrast, the CD94/NKG2C complex is an activating receptor that associates with the transmembrane adaptor protein DAP12, which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM). This interaction is crucial for NK cell activation and requires charged residues in the transmembrane domains of both DAP12 and NKG2C (Lanier1998Association). In rodents, CD94 itself contains a unique lysine residue in its transmembrane region, allowing direct association with DAP12 and DAP10, which is essential for activating NK cell cytotoxicity (Saether2011Rat). These interactions highlight the dual role of CD94 in modulating NK cell responses through its association with different NKG2 family members.
