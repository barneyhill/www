# ADAT1

## Overview
ADAT1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme adenosine deaminase tRNA-specific 1, which is a member of the deaminase family of proteins. This enzyme is crucial for the post-transcriptional modification of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, specifically catalyzing the conversion of adenosine to inosine at position 37 in the anticodon loop of tRNA Ala. This modification is essential for maintaining the accuracy of protein synthesis by ensuring proper codon-anticodon pairing during translation (Maas1999Identification). Unlike other adenosine deaminases, ADAT1 lacks double-stranded RNA-binding domains, indicating a unique structural configuration that facilitates its specific interaction with tRNA substrates (Maas1999Identification). The gene is ubiquitously expressed across various human tissues, with particularly high expression in the heart, brain, and pancreas, underscoring its broad functional significance in cellular processes (Maas1999Identification).

## Structure
The human ADAT1 protein is characterized by a 1,509 bp open reading frame (ORF) predicting a polypeptide of 502 amino acids with a molecular mass of 55.3 kDa (Maas1999Identification). The primary structure includes a unique 90-amino acid stretch within the deaminase catalytic domain, which does not resemble any known sequences in databases (Maas1999Identification). This stretch is not a result of alternative splicing and may serve as a protein-protein interaction domain (Maas1999Identification).

The secondary and tertiary structures of ADAT1 are not detailed in the available context. However, the protein lacks the double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) found in other ADAR proteins, suggesting a different structural configuration (Maas1999Identification). The RNA-binding domain of hADAT1 may overlap with the catalytic deaminase region, similar to APOBEC-1 (Maas1999Identification).

ADAT1 does not naturally undergo alternative splicing, as demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR analysis (Maas1999Identification). The protein's enzymatic activity is specific to deaminating adenosine 37 to inosine in eukaryotic tRNA Ala, with a higher efficiency in higher eukaryotes compared to lower eukaryotes (Maas1999Identification).

## Function
The ADAT1 gene encodes a tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase that plays a crucial role in the modification of tRNA molecules, specifically converting adenosine (A) at position 37 to inosine (I) in the anticodon loop of tRNA Ala. This enzymatic activity is essential for maintaining translational accuracy and preventing frameshifting during protein synthesis (Maas1999Identification). The modification of A37 to I37 is the first step in a unique tRNA modification process, which is conserved across eukaryotes and is vital for proper tRNA function (Maas2001Genomic).

ADAT1 is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, with the highest levels observed in the heart, brain, and pancreas, indicating its broad role in cellular function (Maas1999Identification). The enzyme is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to the fidelity of genetic code translation and overall protein synthesis in cells (Maas1999Identification). The ADAT1 gene is located on chromosome 16q22.2-22.3, clustered with two tRNA synthetase genes, suggesting potential evolutionary relatedness or shared regulatory mechanisms (Maas2001Genomic).

## Interactions
The human ADAT1 protein, a tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase, is involved in the conversion of adenosine to inosine at position 37 in tRNA Ala. While ADAT1 is related to the ADAR family of pre-mRNA editing enzymes, it lacks the double-stranded RNA-binding domains typical of ADAR proteins. Instead, ADAT1 contains a unique 90 amino acid domain within its catalytic region, which may serve as a protein-protein interaction domain. This domain is suggested to facilitate interactions with other tRNA modifying enzymes, such as the methylase involved in the subsequent conversion of inosine to m1-I37, although it is not involved in alternative splicing (Maas1999Identification).

The RNA-binding activity of ADAT1 is likely conferred by regions overlapping with its catalytic deaminase domain, similar to the mechanism observed in APOBEC-1. This suggests that ADAT1's interaction with tRNA substrates is highly dependent on the tRNA's tertiary structure, as synthetic tRNA constructs with altered structures are not efficiently deaminated (Torres2014A‐to‐I). The interaction with tRNA is crucial for its function, but specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond its enzymatic activity on tRNA substrates have not been detailed (Maas1999Identification).
