# CALCR

## Overview
The CALCR gene encodes the calcitonin receptor, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a pivotal role in calcium and bone metabolism. This receptor is primarily expressed in bone, kidney, and brain tissues, where it mediates the physiological effects of the hormone calcitonin. The calcitonin receptor is integral to the regulation of bone resorption and formation, acting predominantly on osteoclasts to inhibit their activity and thus reduce bone turnover. Structurally, the receptor is characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain, a hallmark of GPCRs, and features multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which contribute to its functional diversity. The receptor's interaction with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) further modulates its ligand specificity and signaling pathways, influencing its role in calcium homeostasis and bone health (Purdue2002Molecular; Zaidi2002Molecular; Christopoulos1999Multiple).

## Structure
The calcitonin receptor (CALCR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with a complex molecular structure. It consists of approximately 500 amino acids, featuring a seven-transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs (Purdue2002Molecular). The primary structure includes a long extracellular N-terminal domain, which is crucial for ligand binding, and an intracellular C-terminal domain (Zaidi2002Molecular; Purdue2002Molecular). The receptor's secondary structure is characterized by an amphipathic α-helix, important for high-affinity ligand binding (Purdue2002Molecular).

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices within the transmembrane domain, and the receptor can form quaternary structures through dimerization (Nag2007Headless). The receptor contains multiple hydrophobic domains flanked by charged residues, with six cysteine residues in the extracellular loops forming disulfide bridges, and two to four N-linked glycosylation sites essential for high-affinity binding (Zaidi2002Molecular; Purdue2002Molecular).

CALCR exists in several isoforms due to alternative splicing, with the most common human subtypes differing by a 16-amino-acid insert in the first intracellular domain (Zaidi2002Molecular; Pham2005Insights). These isoforms exhibit variations in ligand binding and signaling pathways, contributing to the receptor's functional diversity (Shyu1996The).

## Function
The CALCR gene encodes the calcitonin receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in calcium and bone metabolism. This receptor is primarily active in bone, kidney, and brain tissues, where it plays a crucial role in regulating bone formation and resorption. In bone tissue, the calcitonin receptor is expressed in osteoclasts and osteocytes, but not in osteoblasts, suggesting that calcitonin affects osteoblasts indirectly through these cells (Xie2020Calcitonin). The receptor mediates the inhibitory effects of calcitonin on osteoclastic bone resorption, thereby reducing bone turnover and maintaining bone mass (Davey2008Calcitonin).

Calcitonin binding to its receptor leads to a rise in intracellular cAMP levels, a key signaling event that inhibits osteoclast activity and bone resorption (pondel2000calcitonin). The receptor also plays a role in calcium homeostasis by decreasing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys and regulating the production of 1α,25(OH)2D3, a form of vitamin D (Davey2008Calcitonin). In the context of bone remodeling, the calcitonin receptor limits bone formation by inhibiting the release of sphingosine 1-phosphate from osteoclasts, which is crucial for osteoclast-osteoblast communication (Keller2014Calcitonin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CALCR gene, which encodes the calcitonin receptor, have been associated with several clinical conditions, particularly those related to calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. One significant condition linked to CALCR gene polymorphisms is urolithiasis, a disease characterized by the formation of kidney stones. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CALCR gene, such as rs1801197, which are associated with an increased risk of calcium stone urolithiasis in various populations, including those in Taiwan, India, and Egypt (Mitra2017Association; Ali2022Association; Xing2019Association).

The expression of the CALCR protein is also found to be reduced in kidney tissues affected by stones, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of urolithiasis (Mitra2021Attenuation). Additionally, the CALCR gene polymorphisms have been implicated in pediatric nephrolithiasis, with studies indicating that these genetic variations may contribute to the development of calcium oxalate stones in children (Bid2005Association). These findings highlight the importance of CALCR gene variants as potential genetic markers for susceptibility to kidney stone disease.

## Interactions
The calcitonin receptor (CALCR) interacts with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) to form various receptor phenotypes. These interactions are crucial for modulating the receptor's ligand specificity and signaling pathways. RAMPs, particularly RAMP1 and RAMP3, can form stable complexes with CALCR, significantly influencing its binding affinity and activation by peptide ligands such as amylin and calcitonin (Christopoulos1999Multiple; Kotliar2022Elucidating). 

When CALCR is co-transfected with RAMP1 or RAMP3, it results in high-affinity binding to amylin, forming distinct amylin receptor phenotypes. The RAMP1-derived receptor shows high affinity for salmon calcitonin and moderate affinity for rat amylin and human CGRPα, while the RAMP3-derived receptor has similar affinities for amylin and calcitonins but reduced efficacy for human CGRPα (Christopoulos1999Multiple). 

These interactions are not merely for trafficking purposes but also modulate the receptor's phenotype and function, affecting ligand selectivity and downstream signaling. The presence of RAMPs alters the conformation and dynamics of CALCR, particularly in the extracellular domain, which influences G protein coupling efficiency (Kotliar2022Elucidating).
