# SP100

## Overview
The SP100 gene encodes the SP100 nuclear antigen, a multifunctional protein primarily associated with nuclear bodies, specifically promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. This protein plays a significant role in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation, acting as both a transcriptional coactivator and repressor depending on the cellular context. The SP100 nuclear antigen is characterized by several structural domains, including a high-mobility group (HMG) box, a PHD finger, and a bromodomain, which facilitate its interaction with chromatin and other nuclear proteins (Seeler2001Common; Seeler1998Interaction). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which influence its stability and functional interactions, particularly with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) (Seeler2001Common). SP100 is involved in cellular defense mechanisms against viral infections and has been implicated in various diseases, including acute promyelocytic leukemia, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli (Berscheminski2014Sp100; Seeler2001Common).

## Structure
The SP100 nuclear antigen is a protein associated with nuclear bodies and involved in chromatin organization. It contains several domains that contribute to its function. The SP100 protein includes a high-mobility group (HMG) box domain, which facilitates DNA binding, and is present in the SP100-HMG variant (Seeler2001Common; Seeler1998Interaction). The protein also features a PHD finger and a bromodomain, motifs commonly found in chromatin-associated proteins, which are present in the SP100C variant (Seeler2001Common). These domains suggest a role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin interaction.

SP100 is subject to post-translational modification by SUMO-1, which enhances its interaction with HP1 proteins and affects its subnuclear localization (Seeler2001Common). The protein forms homodimers through an HSR homodimerization interface, and its interaction with HP1 is mediated by a specific region within the protein (Seeler2001Common; Seeler1998Interaction). SP100 has several splice variants, including SP100A, SP100B, SP100C, and SP100-HMG, each with distinct structural features and functions (Seeler2001Common).

## Function
The SP100 nuclear antigen is a key component of PML nuclear bodies (NBs), which are involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. SP100 interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family members, suggesting a role in linking NBs to the chromatin compartment. This interaction is crucial for chromatin dynamics, potentially influencing chromatin architecture and transcriptional repression (Seeler1998Interaction). 

SP100 has several isoforms, such as SP100A and SP100B, which have distinct roles. SP100A is constitutively expressed and acts as a transcriptional regulator, while SP100B is expressed in response to stress or interferon exposure and represses gene expression, particularly in the context of viral infections (Wilcox2005SP100B). The protein is also modified by SUMO-1, which enhances its stability and interaction with HP1, further implicating it in chromatin organization and transcriptional repression (Seeler2001Common).

SP100 can also act as a transcriptional coactivator, enhancing the activity of transcription factors like ETS-1, thereby influencing gene expression and nuclear architecture (Wasylyk2002Sp100). These functions highlight SP100's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SP100 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. SP100 is a key component of nuclear bodies involved in gene regulation and chromatin organization. Its dysfunction is associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), where the integrity of nuclear bodies is compromised (Seeler2001Common). In the context of viral infections, SP100 acts as a restriction factor against viral replication. For instance, during human adenovirus 5 infection, the depletion of SP100 enhances viral progeny production, indicating its role in antiviral defense (Berscheminski2014Sp100). Adenoviruses and other DNA viruses, such as human cytomegalovirus, target SP100 for degradation to evade host defenses (Berscheminski2014Sp100).

SP100 also interacts with the ETS-1 transcription factor, enhancing its transcriptional activity, which may have implications in cancer pathogenesis (Wasylyk2002Sp100). The interaction between SP100 and ETS-1 affects nuclear body morphology, potentially influencing gene expression regulation in cancer and immune responses (Wasylyk2002Sp100). Although the specific clinical significance of SP100 gene mutations is not fully addressed, its involvement in critical cellular processes suggests potential implications in disease pathogenesis, particularly in cancer and immune responses (Wasylyk2002Sp100).

## Interactions
SP100, a nuclear antigen, is involved in various protein interactions that influence transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization. It interacts with ETS-1, a transcription factor, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction involves specific domains of ETS-1 and requires the C-terminal domain of SP100, which induces a conformational change in ETS-1, exposing its activation domain (Wasylyk2002Sp100). SP100 also interacts with HP1 proteins, particularly HP1α, through a domain spanning residues 287-334. This interaction is implicated in transcriptional repression and chromatin organization, as SP100 and HP1 colocalize in nuclear bodies (Seeler1998Interaction).

SP100 is part of the ND10 nuclear domains, interacting with PML and Daxx, and plays a role in cellular defense against viral infections. It stabilizes PML and maintains ND10 structures, particularly during herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection (Negorev2009Differential). SP100 also interacts with the viral protein ICP0, protecting PML from degradation (Negorev2009Differential). Additionally, SP100 interacts with Rep78, a protein involved in Rep-dependent integration, where Rep78 mediates the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of SP100 (Xue2012Role). These interactions highlight SP100's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and cellular defense mechanisms.
