# KRTAP2-4

## Overview
KRTAP2-4 is a gene that encodes the keratin-associated protein 2-4, a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically the KAP2 family. This protein is characterized by its high sulfur and cysteine content, which is essential for forming disulfide bonds that contribute to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human). The KRTAP2-4 protein is primarily active in the hair cortex, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments, playing a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of hair (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Despite its importance in hair structure, the specific functional details of KRTAP2-4 in healthy human cells remain largely unexplored, with ongoing research focusing on its interaction patterns and structural characteristics.

## Function
KRTAP2-4 is a member of the keratin-associated protein (KAP) family, specifically the KAP2 family, which is characterized by high sulfur content and significant cysteine levels, ranging from 27.3-28.1 mol %. These proteins are approximately 13.5 kDa in size and are smaller than those in the KAP1 family. KRTAP2-4, like other KAP2 proteins, contains high levels of proline and serine-threonine residues, and features dimeric cysteine-containing pentameric repeat structures. These structural characteristics suggest a role in forming disulfide bonds, which contribute to the mechanical strength and resilience of hair fibers (Rogers2006Human).

KRTAP2-4 is primarily active in the hair cortex, where it interacts with keratin intermediate filaments. This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of hair, influencing its texture and quality. The protein's involvement in protein-protein interactions, particularly with other KAPs and late cornified envelope proteins, indicates its role in forming complex protein networks essential for hair structure (Siddiqui2018Chromosome). Despite its structural importance, specific functional details of KRTAP2-4 in healthy human cells remain largely unexplored, with current research focusing on its interaction patterns and structural characteristics.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
KRTAP2-4, a member of the keratin-associated protein family, is involved in protein-protein interactions that are crucial for the structural integrity of hair fibers. These interactions primarily occur through disulfide bonds with keratin intermediate filaments, which contribute to the mechanical properties and texture of hair. The protein is part of a family known for its high cysteine content, which facilitates these disulfide linkages (Rogers2006Human).

While specific interactions involving KRTAP2-4 are not extensively detailed, the keratin-associated proteins, including KRTAP2-4, are generally known to interact with each other and with late cornified envelope proteins. These interactions are often identified using protein-protein interaction data, such as those from yeast two-hybrid assays, which are effective in detecting proteins that are challenging to identify through mass spectrometry due to solubility issues or lack of tryptic sites (Siddiqui2018Chromosome).

The KAP2 family, to which KRTAP2-4 belongs, is characterized by a high degree of homology and a significant cysteine content, which supports the formation of dimeric cysteine-containing pentameric repeat structures. These structural features are essential for the protein's role in hair fiber formation and stability (Rogers2006Human).
