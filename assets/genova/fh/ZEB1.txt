# ZEB1

## Overview
ZEB1, or zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell differentiation, and proliferation. The protein encoded by ZEB1 is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate DNA binding and protein-protein interactions, and a homeodomain that contributes to its regulatory functions. ZEB1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and tissue repair, particularly in the cornea, where it is essential for stem cell maintenance and preventing fibrosis and angiogenesis. It is also implicated in cancer progression, acting as a key regulator of EMT by repressing epithelial markers and promoting mesenchymal traits, thereby facilitating metastasis. Mutations and dysregulation of ZEB1 are associated with various diseases, including corneal dystrophies and aggressive cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhang2023Zeb1; Gheldof2012Evolutionary; Lehmann2016ZEB1).

## Structure
ZEB1 is a transcription factor characterized by several important domains that contribute to its functionality. It contains a homeodomain, which is primarily involved in protein-protein interactions rather than DNA binding due to alterations in the canonical DNA-binding sequence. This homeodomain is flanked by zinc fingers, which are crucial for DNA-binding capabilities and also mediate protein-protein interactions. The zinc fingers are located at both the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the protein. The C-terminal zinc fingers have been observed to interact with the upstream homeodomain, potentially causing conformational changes that allow additional cofactors to interact with ZEB1 (Gheldof2012Evolutionary).

ZEB1 also includes a Smad-binding domain (SBD), which shows divergence between ZEB1 and ZEB2, suggesting different functions (Gheldof2012Evolutionary). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications such as sumoylation, which affects its molecular weight and function, as well as phosphorylation, which may influence its interaction with other proteins like CtBP (Gheldof2012Evolutionary). The PLDLSL motif in ZEB1 binds to corepressor proteins CtBP1 and CtBP2, and mutations in this motif can lead to derepression (Gheldof2012Evolutionary). These structural features and modifications highlight the complex regulatory role of ZEB1 in transcriptional processes.

## Function
The ZEB1 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process essential for cell differentiation, proliferation, and migration. In healthy human cells, ZEB1 is involved in maintaining corneal epithelial cell viability and mobility, which are crucial for effective wound healing. It achieves this by repressing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as p21, p19, and p27, thereby promoting cell proliferation (Zhang2023Zeb1). ZEB1 also facilitates cell migration by regulating EMT, which involves the repression of E-cadherin (CDH1) and the promotion of vimentin (VIM) expression, indicating a switch to a mesenchymal phenotype (Zhang2023Zeb1).

ZEB1 is expressed in various tissues, including the cornea, where it is present in the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium. It is essential for maintaining corneal stem cell homeostasis and preventing apoptosis, stromal fibrosis, and angiogenesis (Zhang2021Expression). In the corneal endothelium, ZEB1 mutations are linked to endothelial dystrophies, highlighting its role in maintaining corneal transparency and endothelial cell density (Zhang2021Expression). ZEB1's activity in the nucleus involves binding to E-box sequences in DNA, regulating gene expression critical for cellular homeostasis and tissue repair (Zhang2021Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ZEB1 gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and corneal dystrophies. In cancer, ZEB1 plays a significant role in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for tumor invasiveness and metastasis. It is associated with poor prognosis and therapy resistance in aggressive cancers such as breast, pancreatic, and lung cancer (Lehmann2016ZEB1). ZEB1 also contributes to chemoresistance in breast cancer and radioresistance in prostate cancer (Zhang2019The). In glioblastoma, loss of ZEB1 is linked to decreased patient survival and increased tumor stemness (Edwards2019ZEB1).

In corneal diseases, ZEB1 mutations are linked to conditions such as posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD), Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), and keratoconus. Missense mutations in ZEB1 are associated with FECD and keratoconus, while protein truncating mutations result in PPCD (Lechner2013Mutational). These mutations lead to downregulation of collagen genes, affecting corneal structure and function (Zhang2021Expression).

In Sézary syndrome, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, ZEB1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its loss contributing to disease pathogenesis (Caprini2018Loss).

## Interactions
ZEB1 is a transcription factor that interacts with various proteins and complexes, playing a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. It is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by suppressing epithelial genes and activating mesenchymal genes, facilitating metastasis in cancers such as breast, lung, and colorectal cancer (Perez-Oquendo2022Regulation). ZEB1 interacts with co-repressors like CtBP and BRG1 to repress CDH1 transcription, a process linked to tumor progression (Perez-Oquendo2022Regulation). It also recruits the NuRD complex to suppress miR-200c, miR-141, and TBC1D2b, enhancing invasiveness (Perez-Oquendo2022Regulation).

ZEB1's interaction with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, NuRD, and LSD1-CtBP-CoREST transcription corepressor complexes is influenced by the p53 tumor suppressor and stemness factors like Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog (Parfenyev2023p53). The presence of p53 affects ZEB1's binding with proteins such as CTBP1, CTBP2, and LSD1, impacting its role in cancer stemness (Parfenyev2023p53).

ZEB1 also interacts with YAP, a transcriptional co-activator, to activate YAP target gene expression, which is significant in aggressive breast cancer types (Lehmann2016ZEB1). This interaction involves indirect binding to TEAD factors, highlighting ZEB1's role as both a transcriptional repressor and activator.
