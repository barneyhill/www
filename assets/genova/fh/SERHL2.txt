# SERHL2

## Overview
The SERHL2 gene encodes the protein serine hydrolase like 2, which is part of the serine hydrolase family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of ester, amide, or thioester bonds, playing crucial roles in various biological processes, including metabolism and signal transduction. The specific functions and interactions of the SERHL2-encoded protein remain to be fully elucidated, but it is believed to be involved in pathways that regulate cellular homeostasis and response to environmental changes. Understanding the role of SERHL2 and its protein product is important for uncovering potential implications in human health and disease, as alterations in serine hydrolase activity have been linked to various pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
