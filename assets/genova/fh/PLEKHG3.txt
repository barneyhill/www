# PLEKHG3

## Overview
PLEKHG3 is a gene that encodes the protein pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G3, also known as ARHGEF43. This protein is categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and plays a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell migration and polarity. It achieves this by modulating the activity of small GTPases, specifically Rac1 and Cdc42, which are integral to actin filament dynamics and cell motility (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3). The PLEKHG3 protein contains a tandem DH-PH domain catalytic cassette, which is essential for its function in signaling pathways and interactions with regulatory proteins (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3). Additionally, PLEKHG3 is involved in lysosomal trafficking, influencing cell motility and morphology through its interactions with actin filaments and lysosomal proteins (Ettelt2023Interplay).

## Structure
The PLEKHG3 protein, also known as ARHGEF43, is a 1,219-amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 134 kDa. It contains a tandem DH-PH domain catalytic cassette in the N-terminal sequence, which is crucial for its function (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3). The DH (Dbl homology) and PH (pleckstrin homology) domains are typical of proteins involved in signaling pathways and interactions with other regulatory proteins (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3). These domains facilitate the modulation of Rho family GTPases, influencing cytoskeletal dynamics.

A specific region of PLEKHG3, encompassing residues 910-940, is responsible for its colocalization with F-actin, indicating a direct interaction with actin filaments. This region does not exhibit sequence similarity to any known actin-binding domains (ABDs) such as those found in PDZ-RhoGEF, TEM4, FLJ00018, or Frabin (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3). The protein's ability to localize at the leading edge of migrating cells and its role in enhancing polarized cell migration are attributed to its interaction with actin filaments and small GTPases like Rac1 and Cdc42 (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3). The study does not provide specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of PLEKHG3.

## Function
PLEKHG3, also known as pleckstrin homology and RhoGEF domain containing G3, is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell migration and polarity. It functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, which are essential for actin filament dynamics and cell motility (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3). PLEKHG3 localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells, where it binds to newly polymerized actin filaments, promoting further actin polymerization and enhancing cell polarity and directional motility (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3).

The protein contains a Dbl-homology (DH) domain for RhoGEF activity, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for binding to phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane, and an actin-binding domain (ABD) (Ettelt2023Interplay). PLEKHG3's activity is regulated by PI3K signaling, which facilitates its translocation to the cell's leading edge, thereby guiding directed cell migration (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3).

In addition to its role in actin dynamics, PLEKHG3 is involved in lysosomal trafficking, where it colocalizes with peripheral lysosomes at focal adhesion sites, influencing cell motility and morphology (Ettelt2023Interplay). This interplay between actin dynamics and lysosomal positioning is crucial for the regulation of cellular processes such as shape regulation and motility (Ettelt2023Interplay).

## Interactions
PLEKHG3 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in actin dynamics and cell motility. It is identified as an actin-binding Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) that colocalizes with actin filaments, particularly at sites of membrane remodeling (Ettelt2023Interplay). PLEKHG3 binds directly to F-actin, as demonstrated by a high-speed actin cosedimentation assay, which confirmed its interaction with a specific region of PLEKHG3 (amino acids 890-950) (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3).

PLEKHG3 also interacts with small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, activating them to promote actin polymerization at the leading edge of migrating cells. This interaction is crucial for enhancing polarized cell migration and maintaining cell polarity (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3). The activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 by PLEKHG3 was confirmed through FRET imaging and pull-down assays (Nguyen2016PLEKHG3).

Additionally, PLEKHG3 is involved in lysosomal trafficking, interacting with lysosomal proteins such as L3. It colocalizes with peripheral lysosomes at focal adhesion sites, influencing its distribution and impacting cell motility (Ettelt2023Interplay). The interaction between PLEKHG3 and lysosomes is dynamic, with lysosomal trafficking affecting PLEKHG3's localization (Ettelt2023Interplay).
