# USHBP1

## Overview
USHBP1, or Usher syndrome type-1C protein-binding protein 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neuronal development and sensory functions. The protein, categorized as a component of the USH1 protein network, plays a significant role in axon growth, cytoskeletal regulation, and neuronal morphology, primarily through its interaction with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) during the maturation of GABAergic neurons (Molina‐Holgado2021Cannabinoid). USHBP1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of Usher syndrome, a condition marked by sensory impairments, including hearing loss and vision problems, underscoring its importance in sensory functions (Molina‐Holgado2021Cannabinoid). Additionally, the protein is involved in axon guidance pathways crucial for brain development and the formation of specialized circuits, which may impact speech and language functions (Lei2017Axon). Despite its associations with various conditions, the precise mechanisms of USHBP1's involvement in these processes remain an active area of research.

## Structure


## Function
USHBP1, or Usher syndrome type-1C protein-binding protein 1, is involved in several cellular processes, particularly in the context of neuronal development and sensory functions. It is associated with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) during the maturation of GABAergic neurons, suggesting a role in axon growth, cytoskeletal regulation, and neuronal morphology (Molina‐Holgado2021Cannabinoid). USHBP1 is specifically identified as an interacting partner of CB1 at 12 days in vitro (DIV), indicating its involvement in synapse and axonal maturation, as well as mitochondrial and calcium-related pathways during early neuronal development (Molina‐Holgado2021Cannabinoid).

In addition to its role in neuronal development, USHBP1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of Usher syndrome, a condition characterized by retinal damage and defective neuronal development, which underscores its importance in sensory functions (Molina‐Holgado2021Cannabinoid). The protein is also involved in axon guidance pathways, which are crucial for brain development and the formation of specialized circuits, potentially impacting speech and language functions (Lei2017Axon). These interactions highlight USHBP1's role in maintaining cellular architecture and signaling pathways, which are essential for proper sensory and neuronal function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the USHBP1 gene have been implicated in several disorders, particularly those affecting speech and language functions. USHBP1 is associated with Usher syndrome, a ciliopathy characterized by hearing loss and progressive vision impairment. This condition is linked to impaired speech and language symptoms, highlighting the gene's role in these functions (Lei2017Axon). 

In the context of cancer, the USHBP1 gene has been studied for its potential association with breast cancer risk. However, studies have shown a non-significant association between USHBP1-related SNPs and breast cancer, indicating that while it may be involved in cancer pathways, its direct impact on breast cancer risk remains unclear (Campa2015Genetic).

Additionally, USHBP1, also known as MCC2, is noted for its involvement in pathways related to colorectal cancer, although its specific function in this context is not well understood (Kubick2023Investigation). Despite these associations, the precise mechanisms by which USHBP1 mutations contribute to these conditions require further investigation to establish definitive clinical significance.
