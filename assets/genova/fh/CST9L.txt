# CST9L

## Overview
CST9L, or cystatin 9 like, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cystatin superfamily, which functions primarily as cysteine protease inhibitors. These proteins are integral to the regulation of proteolytic activity, influencing processes such as protein degradation, immune response, and inflammation. The CST9L gene is expressed in various tissues, with notable activity in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and tissue remodeling. The protein encoded by CST9L is particularly significant in testicular development, playing a role in tissue reorganization and maintaining the structural integrity of the testicular niche, which is crucial for normal spermatogenesis. Additionally, CST9L is involved in the regulation of adherens junctions, essential for cell-cell adhesion and communication within the testis. Alterations in CST9L expression have been linked to various conditions, including colorectal cancer and Borderline Personality Disorder, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Bayne2008Molecular; Hofmann2022Sertoli; Mohammadzadeh2019Identification; Gescher2018Epigenetics; Louvandini2020Gestational).

## Structure


## Function
CST9L (cystatin 9 like) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cystatin superfamily, which are known as cysteine protease inhibitors. These proteins play a crucial role in regulating proteolytic activity, impacting processes such as protein degradation, immune response, and inflammation. CST9L is typically active in the cytoplasm and extracellular space, contributing to cellular homeostasis and tissue remodeling (Hofmann2022Sertoli).

In the context of testicular development, CST9L is involved in tissue reorganization during early testis development and is present in adult Sertoli cells. It is considered important for maintaining the structural integrity of the testicular niche, which is essential for normal spermatogenesis and testicular function (Louvandini2020Gestational; Hofmann2022Sertoli). The protein is also associated with the regulation of adherens junctions, which are critical for cell-cell adhesion and communication within the testis (Bayne2008Molecular).

CST9L expression is influenced by various factors, including maternal exposure to certain compounds and hormonal treatments, which can alter its expression and potentially impact testicular function and development (Louvandini2020Gestational; Bayne2008Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
CST9L has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels. In colorectal cancer (CRC), CST9L is part of a gene signature model that helps stratify patients into low- and high-risk groups for mortality and recurrence. This model, which includes CST9L among 19 genes, demonstrates significant prognostic value, suggesting that CST9L expression levels may be associated with tumor staging and survival outcomes in CRC patients (Mohammadzadeh2019Identification).

In the context of gonadotropin suppression and progestogen treatment, CST9L expression was found to be increased in the human testis. This alteration in expression is linked to the regulation of adherens junctions, which may affect spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis, potentially impacting male fertility during contraceptive regimens (Bayne2008Molecular).

Additionally, CST9L has been associated with epigenetic changes in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Hypomethylated CpG sites near CST9L were identified in BPD subjects, indicating potential involvement in the disorder's pathophysiology (Gescher2018Epigenetics). These findings suggest that CST9L may play a role in various conditions through its altered expression and epigenetic modifications.
