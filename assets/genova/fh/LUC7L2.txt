# LUC7L2

## Overview
LUC7L2 is a gene that encodes the LUC7 like 2, pre-mRNA splicing factor, a protein integral to the process of pre-mRNA splicing in human cells. This protein is a component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is essential for the early stages of spliceosome assembly and the selection of 5' splice sites. LUC7L2 is characterized by conserved domains, including zinc finger domains and arginine-serine-rich (RS) domains, which facilitate its interactions with other spliceosomal proteins and its localization in nuclear speckles (Daniels2021Functional). Beyond its role in splicing, LUC7L2 also influences cellular energy metabolism by modulating the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), acting as a repressor of OXPHOS (Jourdain2021Loss). Mutations in LUC7L2 have been implicated in hematological disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance in disease pathogenesis (Daniels2021Functional; Visconte2019Mutations).

## Structure
The LUC7L2 protein is a member of the human LUC7-like splicing factor family, characterized by several conserved domains that are crucial for its function in pre-mRNA splicing. The protein consists of 392 amino acids and is located on chromosome 7q34 (Daniels2021Functional). It shares structural similarities with the yeast splicing factor Luc7p, including a conserved N-terminal alpha helix and two zinc finger domains (ZnF1 and ZnF2), which are separated by a coiled coil domain (Daniels2021Functional). These zinc finger domains are highly conserved, with ZnF1 showing 36% conservation and ZnF2 showing 50% conservation with yeast Luc7p (Daniels2021Functional).

The C-terminal region of LUC7L2 contains arginine-serine-rich (RS) domains, which are not present in yeast Luc7p. These RS domains are important for nuclear localization and facilitate protein-protein interactions, particularly with SR proteins, which are involved in spliceosome assembly (Daniels2021Functional). LUC7L2 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and stability within the spliceosome (Daniels2021Functional). The protein can exist in multiple splice variant isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions (Daniels2021Functional).

## Function
The LUC7L2 gene encodes a protein that is a subunit of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing in human cells. LUC7L2 is localized in nuclear speckles, areas enriched with splicing machinery, indicating its active role in the splicing process (Jourdain2021Loss). It interacts with core spliceosomal proteins and is involved in early spliceosomal complexes, suggesting its participation in the regulation of alternative splicing events (Daniels2021Functional). LUC7L2 is particularly enriched for binding to U1 snRNA, which is essential for the early stages of spliceosome assembly and the selection of the 5' splice site (5'SS) (Daniels2021Functional).

In addition to its role in splicing, LUC7L2 influences cellular energy metabolism. It modulates the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), acting as a repressor of OXPHOS. The loss of LUC7L2 shifts energy metabolism from glycolysis to OXPHOS, affecting the expression and splicing of metabolic genes such as PFKM and SLC7A11 (Jourdain2021Loss). This regulation of energy metabolism is crucial for maintaining cellular function and viability, particularly under glucose-limiting conditions (Jourdain2021Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LUC7L2 gene are implicated in several hematological disorders, particularly myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). LUC7L2 mutations, often resulting in loss of function through frameshift or nonsense mutations, are associated with myeloid neoplasms. These mutations lead to dysregulation of 5′ splice sites and increased splicing of normally retained introns, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Daniels2021Functional). 

In MDS, LUC7L2 mutations or haploinsufficiency, often due to deletions on chromosome 7q, correlate with reduced patient survival and impaired hematopoietic stem cell differentiation (Daniels2021Functional; Visconte2019Mutations). The gene's involvement in energy metabolism is also significant, as its depletion shifts cellular metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), a change linked to cancer progression (Jourdain2021Loss).

In AML, LUC7L2 mutations are acquired during disease progression, as observed in patients with cytogenetically normal AML evolving from MDS (Singh2013Putative). These findings suggest that LUC7L2 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies through its effects on splicing and metabolism.

## Interactions
LUC7L2 is a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing and interacts with various components of the spliceosome complex. It is known to associate with the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, particularly binding to the U1-70K protein (SNRNP70) and Sm core proteins, which are crucial for spliceosome assembly and function (Daniels2021Functional; Jourdain2021Loss). LUC7L2 also shows a strong interaction with U1 snRNA, particularly at the 5′ end, which is essential for the recognition of 5′ splice sites (Daniels2021Functional; Kenny2022LUC7).

The protein interacts with SR family proteins, likely through its unique RS domains, and binds mainly to exons near 5′ and 3′ splice sites (Daniels2021Functional). LUC7L2 is involved in the transition from U1 to U6 snRNA in the spliceosome's B complex, indicating its role in early spliceosome assembly (Daniels2021Functional). It also interacts with U11 snRNA, suggesting a role in both U2- and U12-dependent splicing (Daniels2021Functional).

LUC7L2's interactions extend to metabolic regulation, where its depletion shifts cellular energy metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, highlighting its broader biological roles (Jourdain2021Loss).
