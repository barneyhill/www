# SMU1

## Overview
SMU1 is a gene that encodes the SMU1 DNA replication regulator and spliceosomal factor, a protein integral to various cellular processes, including DNA replication and RNA splicing. The SMU1 protein is a member of the WD40-repeat protein family, characterized by its WD40 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions and plays a role in signal transduction and pre-mRNA processing (Qian2023SMU1). This protein is crucial for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression, acting as a spliceosome factor that promotes spliceosome activation and regulates the expression of certain viral proteins (Qian2023SMU1). Additionally, SMU1 is involved in the ubiquitination of histone H2B and the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis, contributing to chromosome integrity (Qian2023SMU1). Its interactions within the spliceosome and with other proteins underscore its role in regulating splice site choice and alternative splicing, impacting gene expression and cellular function (Keiper2019Smu1).

## Structure
The SMU1 protein is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function in splicing and DNA replication. The primary structure of SMU1 includes 511 amino acids, with notable domains such as the N-terminal LisH (lissencephaly type 1-like homology) motif and the C-terminal WD40 domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Ulrich2016Structural; Kanno2017A). The secondary structure of SMU1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, as seen in the interaction with the RED protein, where the RED mid subdomain forms a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with the N-terminal β-strand of SMU1 (Ashraf2019Destabilization).

In terms of tertiary structure, the SMU1 N-terminal region (NTR) forms dimers through a hydrophobic interface involving the LisH motif, which is crucial for its interaction with RED (Ulrich2016Structural; Ashraf2019Destabilization). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a hetero-tetrameric complex with RED, where the SMU1 NTR dimer provides binding sites for RED (Ulrich2016Structural).

The SMU1 protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The structural flexibility and interaction capabilities of SMU1 are essential for its role in the spliceosome and other cellular processes.

## Function
The SMU1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in several molecular processes within healthy human cells. It is involved in DNA replication and RNA splicing, essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cell cycle progression (Qian2023SMU1). SMU1 is part of the WD40-repeat protein family and contains a WD40 domain, which is involved in signal transduction and pre-mRNA processing. This domain acts as a receptor/regulator module in cytoskeleton assembly, forming a closed-loop propeller structure that regulates interactions with other proteins (Qian2023SMU1).

SMU1 functions as a spliceosome factor, promoting spliceosome activation and controlling the expression of certain viral proteins. It is involved in the ubiquitination of histone H2B, maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis, and ensuring chromosome integrity (Qian2023SMU1). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the assembly and function of the spliceosome, influencing gene expression and cellular function (Qian2023SMU1).

SMU1 also plays a significant role in mitotic spindle integrity, as its depletion leads to spindle defects, including aberrant microtubule organization and abnormal centrosomal numbers, indicating its role in maintaining spindle integrity during mitosis (Rines2008Whole).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the SMU1 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in cancer. In gastric cancer (GC), SMU1 is significantly upregulated, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. This upregulation promotes GC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, while SMU1 knockdown suppresses these processes and induces G0/G1 phase arrest in GC cells, indicating its role in carcinogenesis and GC progression (Qian2023SMU1).

SMU1 is also involved in the splicing of ATM pre-mRNA, which is crucial for the DNA damage response. Depletion of SMU1 leads to improper splicing of ATM pre-mRNA, resulting in genomic instability. This instability can contribute to increased chromosome breakage and decreased DNA synthesis, which are factors in cancer development (Ka2020Deubiquitinase).

Additionally, the interaction between SMU1 and the RED protein is important for the stability of the splicing complex. Disruption of this interaction has been explored as a potential antiviral strategy, suggesting that alterations in SMU1's normal interactions could have therapeutic implications (Ashraf2019Destabilization). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SMU1 in maintaining genomic stability and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
SMU1 is involved in several critical interactions within the spliceosome, a complex essential for pre-mRNA splicing. It forms a dimer with the RED protein, and this interaction is crucial for the activation of spliceosomal B complexes, particularly those assembled on short introns (Keiper2019Smu1). SMU1 and RED act as binding platforms for other spliceosomal proteins, facilitating the recruitment of proteins necessary for spliceosome activation. They specifically bridge Brr2 and the U2 protein SF3B3 in the B complex, with SMU1 directly contacting the N-and C-terminal helicase cassettes of Brr2, which is important for U4/U6 unwinding (Keiper2019Smu1).

The SMU1-RED complex also interacts with several other spliceosomal proteins, including hLIN1, LSm4, LSm8, MFAP1, and YB-1, through SMU1's C-terminal WD40 domain (Ulrich2016Structural). This domain is a known protein-protein interaction element, suggesting a scaffolding role for SMU1 in various cellular contexts. SMU1's interaction with RED is stabilized by specific hydrophobic interactions, and mutations in these residues can disrupt the complex (Ulrich2016Structural). These interactions highlight SMU1's role in regulating splice site choice and alternative splicing, impacting gene expression and cellular processes.
