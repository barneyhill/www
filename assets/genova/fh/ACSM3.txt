# ACSM3

## Overview
ACSM3, or acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 3, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. The protein product of ACSM3 is an acyl-CoA synthetase, which plays a pivotal role in the activation of medium-chain fatty acids by converting them into acyl-CoA thioesters. This conversion is essential for the beta-oxidation pathway, a critical process for fatty acid degradation and energy production within mitochondria (Gopal2017Integrative). The enzyme is integral to maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and metabolic balance, particularly in the liver, where it is regulated by the transcription factor HNF4α (Gopal2017Integrative). ACSM3's involvement in various metabolic pathways underscores its importance in normal physiological functions and its potential implications in pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Zheng2023ACSM3; Junková2021Hepatic).

## Function
ACSM3 (acyl-CoA synthetase medium chain family member 3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the activation of medium-chain fatty acids. This activation process involves converting fatty acids into acyl-CoA thioesters, which are essential substrates for the beta-oxidation pathway in mitochondria, facilitating fatty acid degradation and energy production (Gopal2017Integrative). In healthy human cells, ACSM3 is involved in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis by enabling the efficient breakdown of fatty acids, which is crucial for energy production and metabolic balance (Gopal2017Integrative).

The enzyme is part of the acyl-CoA synthetase family and is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to the bioactive pool of fatty acids necessary for various metabolic processes (Gopal2017Integrative). ACSM3 expression is positively regulated by the transcription factor HNF4α, which is involved in lipid and bile acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism, indicating its role in broader metabolic pathways (Gopal2017Integrative). The regulation of ACSM3 by HNF4α underscores its importance in normal liver function and lipid metabolism, highlighting its role in maintaining metabolic health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACSM3 gene have been linked to several types of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ACSM3 expression is significantly reduced, particularly in advanced stages of the disease. This downregulation is associated with poor survival rates and is often observed in patients with high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, large tumors, and multiple nodules. The reduced expression of ACSM3 in HCC is linked to the activation of the TGFβ/WNT and AKT/MYC signaling pathways, suggesting a role in deregulated fatty acid oxidation processes (Gopal2017Integrative).

In cutaneous melanoma, lower ACSM3 expression is associated with a worsened prognosis, particularly in Asian patients. Overexpression of ACSM3 has been shown to inhibit melanoma growth and enhance the efficacy of BRAF inhibitors, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2020Loss).

In ovarian cancer, ACSM3 overexpression suppresses tumor progression by inhibiting the Integrin β1/AKT signaling pathway. Its low expression is linked to poorer overall survival, highlighting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Yan2021The).

In metabolic conditions, the absence of ACSM3 expression in polydactylous rats on a high-fat diet is associated with hypertriglyceridemia and visceral fat accumulation, suggesting a link to metabolic syndrome (Junková2021Hepatic).

## Interactions
ACSM3 interacts with IGF2BP2, a protein that regulates mRNA stability. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, IGF2BP2 binds to ACSM3 mRNA, reducing its stability and leading to downregulation of ACSM3 expression. This interaction was confirmed through a RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, which demonstrated the binding of IGF2BP2 protein with ACSM3 mRNA. The regulatory relationship between ACSM3 and IGF2BP2 affects cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression in AML cells. Overexpression of IGF2BP2 can reverse the effects of ACSM3 overexpression, increasing cell proliferation and decreasing apoptosis (Zheng2023ACSM3).

In melanoma, ACSM3 is transcriptionally regulated by KLF10, a transcription factor that binds to the ACSM3 promoter. This interaction was confirmed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, which demonstrated KLF10's binding to the ACSM3 promoter. KLF10 upregulates ACSM3 expression, which is associated with inhibition of melanoma progression through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Silencing ACSM3 reverses the inhibitory effects of KLF10 on melanoma cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration (Zhao2022KLF10).
