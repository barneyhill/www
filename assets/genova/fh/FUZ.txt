# FUZ

## Overview
The FUZ gene encodes the fuzzy planar cell polarity protein, a crucial component in cellular processes such as ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity. This protein is categorized as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and is integral to the CPLANE complex, which is essential for the assembly and function of primary cilia. FUZ plays a significant role in intraflagellar transport, particularly retrograde transport, and is involved in several signaling pathways, including Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor, and Wnt signaling, which are vital for embryonic development and tissue organization. Mutations in the FUZ gene are linked to various developmental disorders, including skeletal ciliopathies and craniosynostosis, due to its critical role in cilia formation and function (Singh2024Biallelic; Barrell2021Identification). Additionally, FUZ has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in non-small-cell lung cancer, where it acts as an oncogene, promoting cell proliferation and migration (He2018In).

## Structure
The FUZ protein, also known as the fuzzy planar cell polarity protein, is involved in several cellular processes, including ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity. The human FUZ protein consists of 418 amino acids and shares a high degree of sequence homology with its mouse counterpart, specifically 86.364% (Barrell2021Identification). FUZ contains three putative longin domains, which are typically associated with membrane and vesicular trafficking functions (Barrell2021Identification). These longin domains are characteristic of the Mon1-Ccz1 family of Rab GEFs, suggesting a role in guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity, particularly for Rab23 (Gerondopoulos2019Planar).

The FUZ protein is predicted to have secondary structures such as alpha helices and beta sheets, as modeled using PHYRE2, although specific details on its tertiary or quaternary structures are not provided (Barrell2021Identification). The protein interacts with various other proteins, forming part of the CPLANE complex, which is crucial for ciliogenesis (Barrell2021Identification). A novel missense mutation, p.(Arg284Pro), located near the C-terminal longin domain, has been identified and is associated with craniosynostosis, affecting the protein's function in ciliogenesis and osteogenesis (Barrell2021Identification). However, detailed information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of FUZ is not available in the provided context.

## Function
The FUZ gene encodes the Fuzzy Planar Cell Polarity Protein, which plays a critical role in ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity. In healthy human cells, FUZ is part of the CPLANE complex, which is essential for the assembly and function of primary cilia, non-motile cellular protrusions that are crucial for cell signaling and development (Singh2024Biallelic). FUZ is involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT), particularly in retrograde IFT, which is necessary for the proper functioning and maintenance of cilia (Barrell2021Identification).

FUZ interacts with proteins such as Inturned and WDPCP in the CPLANE complex and with IFT-A subunits, facilitating the transport of components to the primary cilium (Barrell2021Identification). It also forms a complex with Intu, acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab23, which is crucial for cilium formation and planar cell polarity (Gerondopoulos2019Planar). The FUZ protein localizes to centrioles and the basal region of cilia, indicating its role in the early stages of cilium formation (Gerondopoulos2019Planar).

FUZ is also involved in several signaling pathways, including Hedgehog (Hh), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and Wnt signaling, which are important for embryonic development and craniofacial formation (Singh2024Biallelic; Barrell2021Identification). Its role in these pathways highlights its importance in cellular orientation and signaling processes that affect tissue organization and development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FUZ gene are associated with a range of developmental disorders, primarily due to its role in ciliogenesis and signaling pathways. FUZ mutations can lead to skeletal ciliopathies, which are characterized by defects in cilia formation or function. These conditions manifest in various phenotypes, including short ribs, short limbs, polydactyly, and craniofacial, cardiac, and other systemic abnormalities. Specifically, biallelic loss of function variants in FUZ have been linked to orofaciodigital syndrome, a subtype of skeletal ciliopathies that includes digital anomalies, orofacial clefts, short ribs, and cardiac defects (Singh2024Biallelic).

FUZ is also implicated in craniosynostosis, a condition characterized by the premature fusion of cranial bones. A novel variant, p.(Arg284Pro), has been identified in individuals with craniosynostosis, suggesting that FUZ acts as a negative regulator of osteogenesis. This variant partially restores cilia numbers but is less effective in Hedgehog signaling, contributing to the pathogenesis of ciliopathies (Barrell2021Identification).

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), FUZ acts as an oncogene. Overexpression of FUZ promotes cell proliferation and activates signaling pathways such as Erk1/2 and STAT3, which are associated with cancer progression. FUZ also influences cell motility and induces epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a process critical for cancer metastasis (He2018In).

## Interactions
The FUZ protein is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in ciliogenesis and planar cell polarity. FUZ is a component of the CPLANE complex, which includes proteins such as Inturned (INTU) and WDPCP. This complex is essential for retrograde intraflagellar transport in primary cilia, interacting with the chaperonin/CCT complex to facilitate the assembly of protein complexes necessary for ciliary function (Singh2024Biallelic; Barrell2021Identification).

FUZ also interacts with the small GTPase RSG1, which is crucial for cilium formation. This interaction is part of the CPLANE complex and is noted for its unusually tight association, which is atypical for GTPase-GEF interactions (Gerondopoulos2019Planar). Additionally, FUZ forms a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) complex with INTU, specifically targeting Rab23, a GTPase involved in cilium formation and planar cell polarity (Gerondopoulos2019Planar).

In the context of non-small-cell lung cancer, FUZ interacts with Bcl-2/E1b-19 kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), influencing cell proliferation and migration. This interaction stabilizes BNIP3 protein levels, suggesting a role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition processes (He2018In).
