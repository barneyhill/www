# RB1CC1

## Overview
RB1CC1, also known as RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in critical cellular processes such as autophagy and tumor suppression. The protein, often referred to as FIP200, is a key component of the ULK1 kinase complex, which is essential for the initiation of autophagy, a cellular degradation and recycling process. Structurally, RB1CC1 features a C-terminal region with a claw-shaped domain that facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as the cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62, to mediate autophagic processes (Turco2019How). Functionally, RB1CC1 plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by activating the RB1 pathway and interacting with chromatin-remodeling factors to promote the expression of tumor suppressor genes (Chano2011RB1CC1; Ikebuchi2009RB1CC1). Clinically, alterations in RB1CC1 expression or mutations are associated with various cancers and muscle-related diseases, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Chen2021RB1CC1; Li2021ATG14).

## Structure
The RB1CC1 protein, also known as FIP200, is characterized by a complex molecular structure that plays a crucial role in autophagy. It contains a C-terminal region (CTR) with a claw-shaped domain essential for its function. This domain is a parallel dimer composed of an N-terminal helix and a C-terminal globular domain. The claw domain features a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by positively charged amino acids, which serves as the binding site for the LIR motif of the cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62. This interaction is vital for recruiting the autophagy machinery to ubiquitin-positive condensates (Turco2019How).

The RB1CC1 protein is also a key component of the ULK1 complex, which is essential for the initiation of autophagy. It interacts with proteins such as ATG13, ATG101, and kinases ULK1 and ULK2, forming a complex that regulates autophagosome formation (Towers2020Autophagydependent). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, enhance the binding affinity of RB1CC1 to its interacting partners, indicating a regulatory mechanism for its activity (Turco2019How). The protein's structure and interactions underscore its critical role in cellular processes related to autophagy and cell growth regulation.

## Function
RB1CC1, also known as RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1, plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. It activates the RB1 pathway by binding to the RB1 promoter, enhancing its transcriptional activity, which is crucial for cell cycle control and tumor suppression (Ikebuchi2009RB1CC1). RB1CC1 also interacts with hSNF5, a chromatin-remodeling factor, to activate the p16 promoter, which inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases and arrests cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Chano2011RB1CC1).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, RB1CC1 is involved in autophagy, a cellular process for degrading and recycling cellular components. It interacts with the cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62 to facilitate the degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates through aggrephagy. This interaction is crucial for recruiting the autophagy machinery to ubiquitin-positive condensates, supporting the conjugation of Atg8-family proteins to the phagophore (Turco2019How). RB1CC1 is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with its nuclear localization being more pronounced upon its introduction into cells (Ikebuchi2009RB1CC1). These functions highlight RB1CC1's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the RB1CC1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and muscle-related diseases. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), RB1CC1 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting PYK2 activity, which reduces TAZ protein activity and decreases PDL1 transcription. Loss of RB1CC1 expression is associated with a worse prognosis in RCC, as it leads to increased PYK2 activity, promoting cancer cell survival and proliferation (Chen2021RB1CC1). 

In breast cancer, RB1CC1 is involved in regulating the RB1 pathway, enhancing the expression of tumor suppressor genes such as RB1, p16, and p21. Its nuclear expression is crucial for tumor suppression, while its cytoplasmic form is linked to autophagy regulation. Alterations in RB1CC1 expression or mutations can disrupt these pathways, contributing to cancer progression (Chano2010RB1CC1).

RB1CC1 also plays a role in muscle homeostasis through its involvement in autophagy. Deficiency in RB1CC1 can lead to autophagic vacuolar myopathy and inclusion body myositis, characterized by muscle weakness and the accumulation of specific proteins and inclusions in muscle tissue (Li2021ATG14). These findings highlight the gene's importance in both cancer biology and muscle-related conditions.

## Interactions
RB1CC1, also known as FIP200, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes such as autophagy and tumor suppression. It interacts with the cargo receptor SQSTM1/p62, which is essential for autophagy, specifically in the degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. This interaction is mediated by the LIR motif of SQSTM1 and is crucial for recruiting the autophagy machinery to ubiquitin-positive condensates (Turco2019How).

RB1CC1 is a part of the ULK1 kinase complex, interacting with ULK1 and ULK2, which are essential for autophagosome formation. This interaction is necessary for the stability and phosphorylation of ULK1, highlighting RB1CC1's role in the early steps of autophagy (Hara2008FIP200).

In the context of tumor suppression, RB1CC1 interacts with hSNF5, a chromatin-remodeling factor, to activate the p16 promoter. This interaction is crucial for the transcriptional activation of tumor suppressor genes such as p16, RB1, and p21, forming a complex with hSNF5 and p53 (Chano2011RB1CC1; Chano2010RB1CC1).

RB1CC1 also interacts with PYK2 in renal cell carcinoma, inhibiting its activity and affecting the stability of TAZ, a transcriptional co-activator involved in PDL1 transcription (Chen2021RB1CC1).
