# SHANK3

## Overview
SHANK3 is a gene that encodes the SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 protein, a crucial scaffolding protein predominantly located in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses in neurons. This protein plays a significant role in synaptic organization and function by interacting with various synaptic proteins and receptors, including AMPA, NMDA, and metabotropic glutamate receptors, as well as cytoskeletal elements. The SHANK3 protein is characterized by several conserved domains, such as the Shank/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain, ankyrin repeats, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a PDZ domain, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, which facilitate its interactions and functional roles in synaptic signaling and plasticity (Kursula2019Shanks; Uchino2013SHANK3). Mutations in the SHANK3 gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and Phelan-McDermid syndrome, highlighting its importance in normal neurological development and function (Yi2016Autismassociated; De2018Delineation).

## Structure
The SHANK3 protein is a multidomain scaffolding protein found in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neurons. It comprises several conserved domains, including the Shank/ProSAP N-terminal (SPN) domain, ankyrin repeats, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, a PDZ domain, a proline-rich region, and a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain (Delling2021Comparison; Kursula2019Shanks; Uchino2013SHANK3). The SPN domain is structurally similar to the F0 motif in the FERM domain of talin and folds in a ubiquitin-like manner (Woike2023The; Hassani2018Functional). The ankyrin repeats facilitate interactions with proteins like Sharpin and α-fodrin (Woike2023The).

The SH3 domain of SHANK3 is non-canonical, lacking the typical proline-rich peptide binding site, but it interacts electrostatically with the cytoplasmic domain of the Ca V 1.3 channel (Kursula2019Shanks). The PDZ domain binds class I ligands with high affinity and can dimerize, potentially affecting the oligomeric state of SHANK3 (Kursula2019Shanks). The SAM domain binds zinc and forms homo-oligomeric structures, contributing to the molecular assembly of the PSD (Kursula2019Shanks).

SHANK3 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can regulate its function. Mutations in SHANK3, particularly in the SPN and ankyrin domains, are associated with autism spectrum disorders and can disrupt synaptic function (Woike2023The).

## Function
The SHANK3 gene encodes a scaffolding protein that is crucial for synaptic function and neuronal communication. In healthy human cells, SHANK3 is primarily active in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses, where it plays a vital role in organizing receptor signaling and maintaining synaptic structure. It interacts with various synaptic proteins, including components of AMPA, metabotropic glutamate, and NMDA glutamate receptors, as well as cytoskeletal elements, to assemble functional synapses (Yi2016Autismassociated; Bozdagi2010Haploinsufficiency).

SHANK3 is involved in regulating intracellular signaling pathways, such as Wnt signaling and extracellular matrix signaling, which are essential for transcription and neural differentiation (Liu2022SHANK). It also binds to β-catenin, facilitating its translocation to the nucleus to activate target genes, impacting synaptic function and stem cell behavior (Liu2022SHANK). The protein's interaction with HCN channels is crucial for maintaining proper neuronal excitability and synaptic integration, as it helps organize these channels at postsynaptic sites (Yi2016Autismassociated).

SHANK3's role extends to the maturation of neuromuscular junctions and striated muscles, where it acts as a scaffolding protein that stabilizes sarcomeres and influences muscle development (Lutz2020Autismassociated). Its proper function is essential for normal neurological development and function, contributing to synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SHANK3 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and Phelan-McDermid syndrome. SHANK3 mutations can lead to intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, hypotonia, epilepsy, and motor skills deficits. Individuals with these mutations often experience significant delays in language development and motor skills, as well as sensory processing issues such as increased pain tolerance and sensory hyporeactivity (De2018Delineation). 

SHANK3 haploinsufficiency, where one functional copy of the gene is lost, is a frequent cause of ASDs and is a significant factor in the pathology of Phelan-McDermid syndrome. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia, delayed speech, and autistic features (Soorya2013Prospective; Yi2016Autismassociated). 

In addition to ASDs, SHANK3 mutations are linked to schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. These mutations impair Ih currents in neurons, leading to increased neuronal excitability and impaired synaptic transmission, which are crucial for proper synaptic function and neuronal development (Yi2016Autismassociated). 

Research suggests that SHANK3 mutations disrupt synaptic signaling and organization, affecting both postsynaptic and presynaptic functions, which contributes to the neurological symptoms observed in these disorders (Hassani2018Functional).

## Interactions
SHANK3 is a scaffolding protein that interacts with a variety of proteins at postsynaptic sites, playing a crucial role in synaptic function and plasticity. It interacts with CaMKIIα, a protein kinase, through a specific tribasic residue motif (Arg-Arg-Lys) in SHANK3, which is essential for the binding. This interaction is important for neuronal signaling pathways that lead to CREB phosphorylation and c-Fos expression, which are critical for synaptic plasticity and memory (Perfitt2020Neuronal).

SHANK3 also interacts with L-type calcium channels (LTCCs), specifically the CaV1.3 subunit, through its PDZ domain. This interaction is necessary for efficient excitation-transcription coupling, which affects gene expression related to learning and memory (Perfitt2020Neuronal).

Additionally, SHANK3 binds to δ-catenin via its Ank domain, a connection that is crucial for the postsynaptic targeting of δ-catenin. This interaction is not significantly affected by posttranslational modifications of δ-catenin, but an ASD-associated mutation in SHANK3 can enhance this binding (Hassani2020Targeting).

SHANK3 also forms complexes with proteins like Homer and GKAP, contributing to the clustering of NMDA receptor-associated complexes, which are important for synaptic signaling (Tu1999Coupling).
