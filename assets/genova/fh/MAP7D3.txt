# MAP7D3

## Overview
MAP7D3 is a gene that encodes the protein MAP7 domain containing 3, which is a member of the microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7) family. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, playing a critical role in promoting microtubule polymerization and stability. The MAP7D3 protein contains a MAP7 domain near its C-terminus, which is essential for its interaction with microtubules, as well as two coiled coil motifs at the N-terminus that contribute to its microtubule binding region. The protein's function is crucial for maintaining cellular structure and facilitating processes such as cell division and intracellular transport. MAP7D3's interactions with microtubules are characterized by electrostatic binding, and it also plays a role in enhancing the interaction between kinesin and nesprin-2G, which is important for microtubule-actin crosstalk (Yadav2014CTerminal; Sahabandu2024Active).

## Structure
The MAP7D3 protein is characterized by its involvement in microtubule dynamics, primarily through its MAP7 domain, which is crucial for microtubule interaction and stabilization. The protein contains two coiled coil motifs at the N-terminus, which form its microtubule binding region, and the MAP7 domain is located near the C-terminus, spanning residues 580 to 738 (Yadav2014CTerminal). This domain is hypothesized to have microtubule binding activity and is involved in enhancing microtubule assembly in vitro (Yadav2014CTerminal).

The C-terminal region of MAP7D3, known as MDCT, includes the MAP7 domain and the C-terminal tail, which is characterized by three short alpha helices and two beta strands, contributing to its secondary structure (Yadav2014CTerminal). This region is positively charged, with a pI of 9.5, and interacts with microtubules through electrostatic interactions at the C-terminal tail of tubulin (Yadav2014CTerminal). The MDCT fragment has a higher percentage of alpha helices (48%) compared to its individual components, MD (38%) and CT (31%) (Yadav2014CTerminal).

The tertiary structure of MDCT may involve intramolecular interactions that enhance its binding and polymerization activity, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided (Yadav2014CTerminal). The protein's interaction with microtubules is weaker than that of tau, with a dissociation constant of 3.06 mM (Yadav2014CTerminal).

## Function
MAP7D3 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics within healthy human cells. The protein is part of the microtubule-associated protein 7 (MAP7) family and is involved in promoting microtubule polymerization and stability. It achieves this by binding to the C-terminal tails of tubulin subunits, which enhances the assembly and stability of microtubules, crucial for maintaining cellular structure and function (Yadav2014CTerminal).

The C-terminal region of MAP7D3, known as the MDCT region, is particularly important for its function. This region includes the MAP7 domain and the C-terminal tail, which together form a novel microtubule-binding region. The binding is primarily electrostatic, and the presence of both the MAP7 domain and the C-terminal tail significantly increases the protein's ability to promote microtubule polymerization compared to either region alone (Yadav2014CTerminal).

MAP7D3 is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with microtubules to influence their dynamics. This interaction is essential for various cellular processes, including cell division and intracellular transport, by stabilizing microtubules against disassembly and maintaining their structural integrity (Yadav2014CTerminal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAP7D3 gene have been implicated in several types of cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MAP7D3 is significantly overexpressed in highly metastatic cells, contributing to the aggressive nature of this cancer subtype. High MAP7D3 expression is associated with increased cell migration, invasion, and chemoresistance, leading to poorer survival outcomes. Depletion of MAP7D3 in TNBC cells reduces these metastatic traits and increases sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs like docetaxel and gemcitabine, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Kuo2023MAP7D3).

In pediatric Wilms tumor, high MAP7D3 expression is linked to a higher risk of death, with studies identifying it as part of a five-mRNA signature that serves as a prognostic biomarker. This signature has shown promising sensitivity and specificity in predicting survival outcomes (Lin2019Identification).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MAP7D3 expression is associated with better overall survival and is linked to the immune response, as measured by the Immunophenoscore (Luo2021Expression). These findings highlight the diverse roles of MAP7D3 in cancer progression and its potential as a prognostic marker across different cancer types.

## Interactions
MAP7D3 interacts with microtubules through its C-terminal region, which promotes microtubule polymerization by binding to the C-terminal tails of tubulin subunits. This interaction is primarily electrostatic, as evidenced by the inhibitory effect of NaCl on tubulin assembly induced by MAP7D3. The binding affinity of MAP7D3 to microtubules is characterized by an apparent dissociation constant of 3.0 ± 0.5 µM, indicating a specific interaction (Yadav2014CTerminal). MAP7D3 shares a binding site on microtubules with tau, a known microtubule-associated protein, and tau can displace MAP7D3 from microtubules, suggesting that tau has a higher affinity for the binding site (Yadav2014CTerminal).

MAP7D3 also plays a role in enhancing the interaction between kinesin and nesprin-2G (N2G), a giant KASH protein. The C-terminal domain of MAP7D3 enhances the recruitment of kinesin to F-actin and increases the binding of N2G to microtubule-bound kinesin, suggesting a feedback mechanism that augments the binding of cargo-adapter molecules to kinesin light chain (KLC) (Sahabandu2024Active). This interaction is crucial for active microtubule-actin crosstalk mediated by the N2G-kinesin complex (Sahabandu2024Active).
