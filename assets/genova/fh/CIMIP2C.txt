# CIMIP2C

## Overview
CIMIP2C is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary microtubule inner protein 2C, which plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of cilia. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells that are involved in movement and sensory functions. The protein encoded by CIMIP2C is categorized as a structural protein, specifically associated with the inner microtubule arrangement of cilia, contributing to their stability and motility. Mutations or dysregulation of CIMIP2C can lead to defects in ciliary function, which are implicated in a range of ciliopathies, disorders characterized by abnormal cilia function (Qiu2020aarFDC).
