# YBEY

## Overview
The YBEY gene encodes the ybeY metalloendoribonuclease, a protein that plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. As a metalloendoribonuclease, ybeY is involved in the maturation and assembly of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (SSU), which is essential for mitochondrial translation and cellular respiration. The protein localizes to the mitochondrial matrix, where it interacts with various proteins, including p32 and ERAL1, to form complexes crucial for ribosomal stability and function. YBEY's activity is vital for maintaining mitochondrial morphology and function, and its dysregulation has been linked to several diseases, including cancer and mitochondrial disorders (Liao2021YbeY; Summer2020YBEY; Shidal2021Functional).

## Function
The YBEY gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of mitochondrial ribosomes in human cells. It is essential for the proper assembly of the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit (SSU), particularly by facilitating the incorporation of the mitoribosomal protein uS11m. This process is vital for mitochondrial translation and cellular respiration (Summer2020YBEY). YBEY localizes to the mitochondrial matrix and interacts with proteins such as p32 and ERAL1, forming complexes that are important for the assembly and stabilization of the mitochondrial ribosome (Summer2020YBEY).

In healthy cells, YBEY is involved in the hierarchical assembly of both the SSU and the large subunit (LSU) of the mitochondrial ribosome. Its absence leads to defects in mitoribosome assembly, particularly affecting the SSU, and results in impaired mitochondrial translation and oxidative phosphorylation (Summer2020YBEY). YBEY's role extends to maintaining the stability of 12S rRNA, a component of the SSU, which is crucial for mitochondrial gene expression (Summer2020YBEY). The protein's function is critical for maintaining normal mitochondrial morphology and function, as its knockout results in significant growth delays, abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and impaired respiration (Summer2020YBEY).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the YBEY gene, which encodes the ybeY metalloendoribonuclease, have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In humans, elevated expression of YBEY is associated with breast cancer, where it plays a role in cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of YBEY in breast cancer cell lines results in reduced cell proliferation and colony formation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment (Shidal2021Functional).

YBEY is also crucial for mitochondrial function, particularly in mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis and translation. Its dysfunction can lead to mitochondrial diseases due to impaired ribosome assembly and mitochondrial translation. In YBEY knockout cells, significant mitochondrial dysfunction is observed, including growth delays and reduced ATP production, indicating its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial respiration and morphology (Summer2020YBEY).

Additionally, a loss-of-function variant of YBEY has been identified as a candidate driver of Lynch syndrome, a hereditary condition associated with a high risk of colon cancer and other cancers (Liao2021YbeY). These findings highlight the clinical significance of YBEY in both cancer and mitochondrial-related disorders.

## Interactions
The YBEY protein, a metalloendoribonuclease, is involved in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. YBEY interacts directly with ribosomal protein uS11, which is part of the small subunit (SSU) platform of ribosomes. This interaction is crucial for proper ribosome assembly and function, as mutations disrupting uS11 binding lead to phenotypes similar to YBEY deletion (Liao2021YbeY). YBEY also forms a significant interaction with the assembly GTPase Era, which is involved in SSU assembly. The interaction between YBEY and Era is essential, as Era depletion mimics the effects of YBEY loss (Liao2021YbeY).

In mitochondria, YBEY forms a stable complex with the eukaryotic protein p32, which is essential for mitochondrial translation and cellular respiration. This complex can recruit uS11m, and p32's interaction with YBEY is thought to enhance YBEY's solubility and facilitate its interactions with other proteins (Liao2021YbeY). These interactions highlight YBEY's role in ribosome assembly and its potential involvement in broader RNA processing pathways.
