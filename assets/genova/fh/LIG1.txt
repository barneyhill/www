# LIG1

## Overview
LIG1 is a gene that encodes DNA ligase 1, an essential enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair. DNA ligase 1 is a key player in the maintenance of genomic stability, functioning primarily to join Okazaki fragments during DNA replication and to seal nicks in the DNA backbone during various repair processes, including base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair. As a ligase, it catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds, a critical step in DNA synthesis and repair. The enzyme's activity is regulated by interactions with other proteins, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and by post-translational modifications like phosphorylation. Mutations in the LIG1 gene can lead to severe immunodeficiencies and increased cancer susceptibility, highlighting its clinical significance (Alajlan2024Severe; Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic).

## Structure
DNA ligase 1 (LIG1) is a crucial enzyme in DNA replication and repair, characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of LIG1 is a 919 amino acid polypeptide with a highly asymmetric shape, which influences its behavior in density gradient sedimentation and gel filtration experiments (Howes2012DNA). The enzyme's secondary structure includes an adenylation/guanylylation domain and an oligomer binding-fold (OB) domain, forming the catalytic core essential for its function (Howes2012DNA).

The tertiary structure of LIG1 is organized into three main domains: the DNA binding domain (DBD), the adenylation domain (AdD), and the OB-fold domain. These domains form an extended structure in the absence of DNA but transition into a compact ring structure upon engaging a DNA nick (Howes2012DNA). The DBD spans residues 262-534 and interacts with the DNA backbone in a sequence-independent manner, while the OB-fold domain features a β-barrel structure that interacts with the DNA minor groove (Howes2012DNA).

LIG1's activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interaction with other proteins like PCNA and replication factor C (Howes2012DNA). The enzyme also has splice variant isoforms that may alter its function or localization (Howes2012DNA).

## Function
DNA ligase 1 (LIG1) is a crucial enzyme in human cells, primarily involved in DNA replication and repair processes. During DNA replication, LIG1 plays a vital role in joining Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand, ensuring the continuity of the DNA molecule. This function is facilitated by its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which helps localize LIG1 to replication sites (Sallmyr2020Human; Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic). LIG1 is also active in several DNA repair pathways, including long-patch base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair, where it seals nicks in the DNA backbone (Hindi2021The; Liddiard2018DNA).

In addition to its role in replication and repair, LIG1 is involved in non-homologous end-joining, particularly in the context of telomere fusions during the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Liddiard2018DNA). The enzyme's activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are necessary for its proper targeting and function within the nucleus (Ellenberger2008Eukaryotic). LIG1's ability to encircle and partially unwind nicked DNA is essential for its function in sealing DNA nicks, maintaining genomic stability, and facilitating proper cell division (Pascal2004Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LIG1 gene are associated with a range of immunodeficiencies, including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and Omenn syndrome. These conditions are characterized by symptoms such as leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, macrocytic anemia, and increased susceptibility to infections (Alajlan2024Severe; DabrowskaLeonik2022Case). Specific mutations, such as p.A624T, R771W, and R641L, affect the enzyme's catalytic activity and its interaction with magnesium ions, leading to impaired DNA repair and increased genomic instability (Maffucci2018Biallelic; Alajlan2024Severe).

Patients with LIG1 mutations often exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, which can exacerbate the underlying immunodeficiency (Prigent1994Aberrant). The mutations can lead to a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including hypogammaglobulinemia, severe anemia, and susceptibility to viral infections (Maffucci2018Biallelic). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used as a treatment for LIG1 deficiency, showing potential for immune reconstitution, although challenges such as B-cell lymphopenia may persist (Silva2020Haematopoietic; DabrowskaLeonik2022Case).

Excessive expression of LIG1 is often observed in cancer cells, indicating its role in cell survival and proliferation, which suggests that alterations in LIG1 expression levels may contribute to oncogenesis (Alajlan2024Severe).

## Interactions
DNA ligase 1 (LIG1) interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a critical component in DNA replication and repair processes. LIG1 binds to PCNA through its N-terminal region, which contains a replication factory targeting sequence (RFTS) essential for its recruitment to replication sites. This interaction is mediated by specific motifs within the N-terminal 118 amino acids of LIG1, including a high-affinity PIP motif that initially tethers LIG1 to PCNA (Blair2022Mechanism; Montecucco1998DNA).

The interaction between LIG1 and PCNA is crucial for the maturation of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication. LIG1 seals nicks between Okazaki fragments, facilitated by its binding to PCNA, which forms a sliding clamp around DNA. This process involves a handoff mechanism where LIG1 captures the nicked DNA product generated by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) (Blair2022Mechanism).

LIG1 also interacts with the Cul4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex, where it is targeted for degradation. This interaction is mediated by DCAF7, a specificity factor that enhances LIG1 ubiquitylation, marking it for proteasome-mediated degradation (Peng2016Human). These interactions highlight LIG1's role in maintaining genomic stability and its regulation through protein-protein interactions.
