# CIC

## Overview
CIC (Capicua) is a gene that encodes the capicua transcriptional repressor, a protein that plays a pivotal role in gene regulation by acting as a transcriptional repressor. The CIC protein is characterized by its high-mobility group (HMG) box domain, which is essential for DNA binding, and a C1 domain that enhances DNA binding specificity. As a transcriptional repressor, CIC is integral to the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, where it modulates gene expression by interacting with co-repressors and chromatin remodeling complexes. CIC's activity is regulated through phosphorylation, which affects its nuclear localization and stability. The gene is implicated in various cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders, with mutations often leading to dysregulation of oncogenic pathways and developmental processes (Wong2020Making; Lu2017Disruption; Ahmad2019Capicua).

## Structure
The CIC protein, encoded by the human gene CIC, is a transcriptional repressor characterized by its high-mobility group (HMG) box domain, which is crucial for DNA binding. The HMG-box domain of CIC forms an L-shaped structure composed of three α-helices, with a kink in the first helix. These helices interact through hydrophobic interactions, creating a three-way hydrophobic junction that stabilizes the domain (Lee2019The). The domain binds to the minor groove of DNA, causing a 90° bend and widening the distance between phosphates, a common feature of HMG-box domains (Lee2019The).

The CIC protein also contains a C1 domain, which cooperates with the HMG-box to enhance DNA binding specificity. This bipartite structure is necessary for binding specific DNA sequences, distinguishing CIC from other HMG-box proteins (Forés2017A). Mutations in the HMG-box and C1 domains are associated with various cancers, as they disrupt DNA binding and transcriptional repression (Lee2019The; Forés2017A).

CIC undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity (Forés2017A). The protein may also be subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and interactions.

## Function
The CIC (capicua transcriptional repressor) protein functions as a transcriptional repressor in human cells, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression. It is primarily involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, where it acts as a sensor and regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling. CIC represses target genes by binding to DNA, a process that is modulated by phosphorylation events mediated by the ERK pathway. Phosphorylation of CIC by ERK leads to its nuclear exclusion and degradation, thereby relieving its repressive effects on target genes (Wong2020Making; Jiménez2012The).

CIC interacts with several co-repressors, including ATXN1 and ATXN1L, which stabilize CIC and facilitate the repression of its target genes. The SIN3/HDAC complex is also involved in mediating the repression of CIC target genes, suggesting a role in chromatin architecture and epigenomic regulation (Wong2020Making). In mammals, CIC forms complexes with proteins such as NCOR2 and histone deacetylases, further indicating its role as a transcriptional repressor (Jiménez2012The).

CIC is active in the nucleus, where it binds to the promoters of target genes, including oncogenic E-Twenty Six (ETS) transcription factors like ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, which are often elevated in cancers with CIC aberrations (Wong2020Making). Through these interactions, CIC influences cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, contributing to its role as a tumor suppressor (Ahmad2019Capicua).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CIC gene are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders. In oligodendrogliomas, a type of brain tumor, CIC mutations are frequently observed, especially in tumors with 1p/19q co-deletions. These mutations often occur in the HMG-box DNA-binding domain and are associated with poor prognosis (Eisenreich2013Novel; Yip2011Concurrent). CIC mutations are also linked to Ewing-like sarcomas, where the CIC-DUX4 fusion transforms CIC from a repressor to an activator, contributing to tumorigenesis (KawamuraSaito2006Fusion; Miele2020DNA).

CIC dysregulation is associated with several cancer hallmarks, including sustaining proliferative signals and activating invasion and metastasis. It modulates the expression of oncogenic target genes, notably the ETS factors ETV1/4/5, which are involved in cell growth and metastasis (Wong2020Making). In neurodevelopmental disorders, heterozygous truncating mutations in CIC are linked to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its role in brain development (Lu2017Disruption).

CIC mutations also contribute to cerebral folate deficiency by downregulating FOLR1 expression, affecting folate transport and metabolism (Cao2020CIC). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CIC in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CIC (capicua transcriptional repressor) is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function as a transcriptional repressor. CIC forms complexes with ataxin 1 (ATXN1) and its related factor BOAT1, which associate with other co-repressors such as NCOR2 and histone deacetylases. These interactions are essential for its role in transcriptional repression in mammals (Jiménez2012The).

CIC also interacts with the MAPK signaling pathway, which influences its activity and stability. In Drosophila, CIC requires the Groucho (GRO) co-repressor for the repression of its targets, although direct interactions between CIC and GRO have not been demonstrated (Jiménez2012The). The MAPK docking site, known as the C2 motif, is critical for CIC's interaction with the MAPK Rolled, which is involved in the Torso and EGFR RTK pathways. This interaction is necessary for the downregulation of CIC in response to these pathways, affecting gene expression during Drosophila development (Astigarraga2007A).

CIC's repression of target genes is also modulated by its binding to specific DNA sequences in enhancers and promoters, a process that is relieved by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling (Ahmad2019Capicua).
