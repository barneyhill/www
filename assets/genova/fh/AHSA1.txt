# AHSA1

## Overview
AHSA1 is a gene that encodes the protein known as activator of HSP90 ATPase activity 1, a co-chaperone that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the HSP90 chaperone machinery. This protein is crucial for enhancing the ATPase activity of HSP90, thereby facilitating the proper folding, stabilization, and degradation of a wide array of client proteins. AHSA1 is characterized by its two-domain structure, which allows it to bind asymmetrically to the HSP90 complex, promoting the chaperone's functional cycle. Beyond its interaction with HSP90, AHSA1 also functions independently as a chaperone for specific proteins, such as SULT1A1, underscoring its versatile role in maintaining cellular proteostasis (Koulov2010Biological; Schopf2017The). The protein's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it influences various signaling pathways, contributing to cell growth and survival. AHSA1's involvement in critical cellular processes and its implications in diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders highlight its biological and clinical significance (Liu2022Aha1; Shelton2017Hsp90).

## Structure
The AHSA1 protein, also known as the activator of HSP90 ATPase activity 1, is composed of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain (residues 1-162) and a C-terminal domain (residues 163-338), connected by a flexible linker (Koulov2010Biological). These domains are independently folded and maintain the same secondary structure as the full-length protein, which includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets (Koulov2010Biological). The N-terminal domain binds to the middle domain of HSP90, while the C-terminal domain has a higher binding affinity for HSP90 and is involved in ATPase stimulation (Koulov2010Biological).

The full-length AHSA1 protein is necessary for robust stimulation of HSP90 ATPase activity, indicating the importance of its intact structure for function (Koulov2010Biological). The interaction between AHSA1 and HSP90 involves the N-terminal and middle domains of HSP90, with AHSA1 binding in a nucleotide-dependent manner (Retzlaff2010Asymmetric). The stoichiometry of one AHSA1 molecule per HSP90 dimer is sufficient to stimulate ATPase activity, suggesting a quaternary interaction that stabilizes the ATPase-competent conformation of the HSP90 dimer (Retzlaff2010Asymmetric). The protein's structure and interaction with HSP90 are crucial for its role in maintaining proteostasis, particularly in the context of diseases like cystic fibrosis (Koulov2010Biological).

## Function
AHSA1, also known as activator of HSP90 ATPase activity 1, is a co-chaperone protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of the HSP90 chaperone machinery. It enhances the ATPase activity of HSP90, which is essential for the proper folding, stabilization, and degradation of client proteins. AHSA1 binds asymmetrically to both the middle domain and the N-terminal domain of HSP90, promoting the formation of the closed 1 state of HSP90 and accelerating its chaperone cycle (Schopf2017The). This interaction is vital for the maturation and stabilization of various client proteins, impacting cellular processes such as protein homeostasis and stress responses (Schopf2017The).

AHSA1 also functions independently of HSP90 as an autonomous chaperone for certain proteins, such as SULT1A1, a phase-II xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme. It is involved in the proper folding and stability of SULT1A1, highlighting its role in maintaining the functional homeostasis of substrate chemicals and hormones in the liver (Liu2022Aha1). AHSA1's activity is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where it influences various signaling pathways, contributing to cell growth and survival.

## Clinical Significance
AHSA1 is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AHSA1 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor survival outcomes and advanced tumor stages. Its knockdown in HCC cell lines reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, highlighting its role in tumor progression (Li2022The). AHSA1 is also overexpressed in multiple myeloma (MM), where it promotes cell proliferation and resistance to proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib. This resistance is mediated through its interaction with HSP90, enhancing the activity of proteins such as CDK6 and PSMD2, which are crucial for MM cell survival and drug resistance (Gu2022AHSA1).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, AHSA1, as a co-chaperone of HSP90, is involved in the aggregation of tau proteins, which are associated with tauopathies like Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of AHSA1 increases tau aggregation, leading to neuronal loss and cognitive deficits. Targeting AHSA1 with specific inhibitors has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce tau pathology (Shelton2017Hsp90). These findings underscore AHSA1's clinical significance in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
AHSA1, known as the activator of HSP90 ATPase activity 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions. It interacts with the HSP90 protein complex, which is essential for the stabilization and folding of various client proteins. This interaction is crucial in multiple myeloma (MM), where AHSA1 promotes cell proliferation and resistance to proteasome inhibitors by interacting with proteins such as CDK6 and PSMD2. CDK6 is a key factor in cell proliferation, while PSMD2 is associated with drug resistance (Gu2022AHSA1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AHSA1 interacts with HSP90AA1, stimulating its ATPase activity, which is vital for protein maturation and stabilization. AHSA1 also interacts with proteins like AMD1 and is involved in pathways such as RNA transport and HIF-1a signaling, contributing to tumor progression (Li2022The).

AHSA1's interaction with ERK1/2 and CALD1 in HCC promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell proliferation. It enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which in turn increases CALD1 phosphorylation, affecting cell migration and proliferation (Zhang2022AHSA1).

AHSA1 is also identified as a specific interactor of mutant huntingtin (mHtt) in the brain cortex of mice, suggesting a potential role in neurodegenerative processes (Sap2021Identification).
