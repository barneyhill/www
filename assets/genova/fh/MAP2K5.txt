# MAP2K5

## Overview
MAP2K5, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5, is a gene that encodes a dual-specificity kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. The protein product, MEK5, plays a pivotal role in phosphorylating and activating MAPK7 (ERK5), which is crucial for regulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and stress response (Drew2012MEK5ERK5). MEK5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell growth, angiogenesis, and motility, and is implicated in maintaining vascular integrity and neuronal cell survival under stress (Lu2022Fine; Drew2012MEK5ERK5). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in both normal physiological functions and various pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and restless legs syndrome (Jo2017Yeast; Yang2011Association).

## Function
MAP2K5, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a critical role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. It specifically phosphorylates and activates MAPK7 (ERK5), which is involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and stress response (Drew2012MEK5ERK5). The MEK5/ERK5 pathway is implicated in cell differentiation and survival, with ERK5 translocating to the nucleus upon activation to influence transcription factors like Sap1, c-FOS, c-Myc, and MEF2, which are crucial for cell survival and differentiation (Drew2012MEK5ERK5).

MAP2K5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cellular responses to stress and contributes to the regulation of cell growth cycles, angiogenesis, and motility (Drew2012MEK5ERK5). It is also involved in maintaining vascular integrity and may play a role in VEGF-mediated neovascularization (Drew2012MEK5ERK5). In the context of neuronal cells, MAP2K5 is associated with survival responses under stress conditions, highlighting its importance in protecting cells from stress-induced apoptosis (Lu2022Fine). The pathway's involvement in these processes underscores its significance in both normal cellular functions and potential pathological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MAP2K5 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), MAP2K5 has been identified as a potential drug target due to its role in modulating protein aggregation and autophagy processes. Inhibition of MAP2K5 has been shown to reduce protein aggregates and increase autophagy flux, which may alleviate motoneuron damage in ALS models (Jo2017Yeast). 

In the central nervous system, MAP2K5 deficiency in mice has been associated with dopamine deficiency, leading to phenotypic and pathological changes. These include decreased dopaminergic cell survival and reduced tyrosine hydroxylase levels, which are critical for dopamine synthesis. Such deficiencies are linked to motor dysfunctions and may contribute to conditions like Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome (Huang2021Map2k5Deficient).

Additionally, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in MAP2K5, rs1026732, has been associated with an increased risk of restless legs syndrome in a U.S. population, suggesting that alterations in MAP2K5 gene expression may confer a significant risk for this condition (Yang2011Association). These findings highlight the clinical significance of MAP2K5 in various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.

## Interactions
MAP2K5, also known as MEK5, is a dual-specificity kinase that plays a crucial role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. It primarily interacts with MAPK7 (ERK5), phosphorylating and activating it, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell survival, apoptosis, and differentiation (Jo2017Yeast). MAP2K5 is also known to interact with proteins like 14-3-3, which can regulate its activity. These interactions may involve the formation of complexes with scaffold proteins to facilitate signaling (English1995Isolation).

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), MAP2K5 has been shown to interact with ALS-associated proteins such as optineurin (OPTN) and angiogenin (ANG). Inhibition of MAP2K5 reduces protein aggregation in mammalian cells, suggesting a role in modulating the aggregation process of these proteins (Jo2017Yeast). This interaction is significant in the pathogenesis of ALS, as MAP2K5 inhibition has been found to attenuate the formation of protein aggregates, providing neuroprotection in various models, including yeast, mammalian cells, and zebrafish (Jo2017Yeast). These findings highlight the potential of MAP2K5 as a therapeutic target in ALS.
