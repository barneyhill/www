# ANGPT4

## Overview
ANGPT4 is a gene that encodes the protein angiopoietin 4, a member of the angiopoietin family involved in angiogenesis and vascular development. Angiopoietin 4 is a secreted protein that primarily functions as a ligand for the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, playing a significant role in the maturation and stability of blood vessels, particularly veins (Elamaa2018Angiopoietin4dependent). The protein is characterized by its ability to form disulfide-linked dimers and higher-order multimers, which are crucial for its interaction with the TIE2 receptor and subsequent activation of angiogenic signaling pathways (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4; Lee2004Biological). ANGPT4 is implicated in various physiological processes, including venous maturation in the retina and tumor angiogenesis, and its dysregulation is associated with several pathological conditions, such as cancer and glaucoma (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4; Kapiainen2022Cooperation).

## Structure
The ANGPT4 protein is a member of the angiopoietin family and is involved in angiogenesis and vascular development. It is encoded by the ANGPT4 gene located on chromosome 20p13. The protein has a predicted molecular mass of 56.8 kDa, but experimental data shows a molecular weight of approximately 72 kDa, likely due to its configurational characteristics (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4; Lee2004Biological).

Structurally, ANGPT4 consists of several distinct domains: an N-terminal superclustering domain, a central coiled-coil domain responsible for ligand homo-oligomerization, a linker region, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain necessary for binding to the TIE2 receptor (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4). The fibrinogen-like domain contains a signature cysteine-based motif with three closely spaced cysteines, a feature shared with other angiopoietins (Valenzuela1999Angiopoietins).

In terms of quaternary structure, ANGPT4 predominantly forms disulfide-linked dimers under non-reducing conditions, although it can occasionally form higher-order multimers (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4; Lee2004Biological). The protein's ability to form dimers is crucial for its function in binding to the TIE2 receptor and inducing downstream signaling pathways (Lee2004Biological).

## Function
ANGPT4, or angiopoietin 4, is a protein involved in vascular biology, particularly in the development and maturation of veins. It functions as a ligand for the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, playing a crucial role in venous maturation and fluid drainage, especially in the peripheral retina. ANGPT4 induces TIE2 phosphorylation in endothelial cell junctions, which is important for angiogenic remodeling and vascular stability (Elamaa2018Angiopoietin4dependent).

In the context of the retina, ANGPT4 is essential for the maturation of venous smooth muscle cells and the development of venous structures, contributing to proper venous function and fluid homeostasis. Its expression is regulated by oxygen levels, with increased expression under low oxygen conditions, which are typical of peripheral and venous locations (Elamaa2018Angiopoietin4dependent).

ANGPT4 also shares some functional characteristics with other angiopoietins, such as promoting lumen formation in endothelial cells, although it has a lower binding affinity to TIE2 compared to ANGPT1. This suggests a unique but overlapping role in vascular development and signaling (Elamaa2018Angiopoietin4dependent).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ANGPT4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. ANGPT4 is overexpressed in several human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, and colorectal adenocarcinoma. This overexpression is associated with increased tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis, leading to poor clinical outcomes in certain cancers like pancreatic cancer (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4). ANGPT4's role in promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis makes it a potential target for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4).

In the context of eye health, ANGPT4, along with ANGPT2, plays a role in maintaining Schlemm's Canal (SC), which is crucial for aqueous humor drainage and intraocular pressure regulation. Alterations in ANGPT4 expression, particularly when combined with ANGPT2 deletion, can lead to significant morphological changes in SC and glaucomatous changes in the eye, indicating a potential link to glaucoma (Kapiainen2022Cooperation).

In the retina, ANGPT4 is essential for venous maturation and fluid drainage. Deficiency in ANGPT4 leads to defective venous development and impaired venous drainage, which can result in secondary neuronal cell damage (Elamaa2018Angiopoietin4dependent).

## Interactions
ANGPT4 interacts primarily with the TIE2 receptor, a key component of the angiopoietin signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for its role in angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. ANGPT4 induces TIE2 phosphorylation, although it has a lower binding affinity to TIE2 compared to other angiopoietins like ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 (Elamaa2018Angiopoietin4dependent). Despite this lower affinity, ANGPT4 is capable of activating TIE2, which is essential for its function in angiogenic remodeling (Elamaa2018Angiopoietin4dependent).

ANGPT4's interaction with TIE2 is influenced by its oligomerization state. Monomeric or dimeric forms of ANGPT4 do not activate TIE2, whereas higher-order multimers are required for effective activation (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4). This oligomerization is important for its role in tumor angiogenesis, where aggregated ANGPT4 promotes angiogenesis, while monomeric or dimeric forms inhibit it (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4).

ANGPT4 may also interact with the integrin family, similar to other angiopoietins, suggesting diverse functional pathways (Zhou2024Angiopoietin4). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond these pathways are not detailed in the provided context.
