# GLIPR1

## Overview
GLIPR1, or GLI pathogenesis related 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the cysteine-rich secretory protein, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 (CAP) superfamily. The GLIPR1 protein is characterized by a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, and a conserved CAP domain, which is involved in various cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation, and immune response (Awasthi2013Variable; Asojo2011Structural). It is predominantly expressed in tissues such as the lung, testis, bone marrow, prostate, bladder, and kidney, and plays a significant role in modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis-related gene expression (Gibbs2008The; Friend2020GLIPR1). The protein's structure, featuring a Zn2+-binding cavity, suggests its involvement in inflammation modulation and potential roles in cancer and reproduction (Asojo2011Structural). GLIPR1's expression and activity are regulated by the tumor suppressor protein p53, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing malignancy (Gibbs2008The).

## Structure
The GLIPR1 protein is synthesized as a 255-amino-acid precursor, featuring a signal peptide and a transmembrane domain that localizes it to the cell membrane in glioblastoma cells (Asojo2011Structural). The recombinant soluble form, sGLIPR1, includes amino acids 22-220 and is expressed with a Pichia pastoris signal peptide and an added linker sequence (Asojo2011Structural). The structure of sGLIPR1 comprises an N-terminal loop, a CAP domain, and a cysteine-rich C-terminal region. The CAP domain is characterized by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet sandwiched between two layers of α-helices, with one layer containing two parallel α-helices and the other a solitary α-helix (Asojo2011Structural).

The protein contains five disulfide bonds, with all cysteines involved except Cys37 (Asojo2011Structural). There is a predicted N-linked glycosylation site at Asn92, although the glycans were not modeled due to insufficient electron density (Asojo2011Structural). The GLIPR1 protein lacks a catalytic serine, instead having Asn80, which is oriented away from His79, making it incapable of forming a conventional serine protease catalytic triad (Asojo2011Structural). The central cavity of GLIPR1 serves as a major Zn2+ binding site, similar to other CAP proteins (Asojo2011Structural). The protein's structure suggests roles in inflammation modulation and potential involvement in cancer and reproduction (Asojo2011Structural).

## Function
GLIPR1, a member of the CAP superfamily, is involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, cell proliferation, and immune response. In healthy human cells, GLIPR1 is expressed in multiple tissues, with the highest expression in the lung, testis, bone marrow, prostate, bladder, and kidney (Gibbs2008The). The protein is characterized by a signal peptide, a conserved cysteine-rich CAP domain, and a transmembrane domain, suggesting it is a secreted or surface-exposed protein (Awasthi2013Variable).

GLIPR1 is involved in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, primarily through the modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis-related gene expression (Friend2020GLIPR1). It is also implicated in cell cycle arrest by decreasing the expression of oncogenic factors such as MYC (Friend2020GLIPR1). The protein's role in immune defense is suggested by its structural similarity to plant pathogenesis-related proteins, indicating a potential link between human immune responses and plant defense mechanisms (Szyperski1998Structure).

GLIPR1 is active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences cell signaling pathways and contributes to cellular homeostasis (Asojo2011Structural). Its expression and activity are regulated by p53, a key tumor suppressor protein, highlighting its role in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing malignancy (Gibbs2008The).

## Clinical Significance
GLIPR1 (GLI pathogenesis related 1) is implicated in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions playing significant roles in disease progression. In multiple myeloma (MM), GLIPR1 expression is significantly reduced in plasma cells from patients compared to healthy donors, suggesting a potential role in the disease's development. However, its reduced expression does not appear to impact overall survival in MM patients, and it is not considered a tumor suppressor in this context (Friend2020GLIPR1).

In prostate cancer, GLIPR1 is identified as a tumor suppressor gene that is often inactivated by methylation. Its overexpression can induce apoptosis and suppress colony growth in prostate cancer cell lines, indicating its potential role in inhibiting cancer progression (Ren2004RTVP1). Conversely, in prostate cancer brain metastasis, GLIPR1 is upregulated and associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is relevant to cancer progression and metastasis (OliveiraBarros2021GLIPR1).

In bladder cancer, GLIPR1 overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inducing apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. It is regulated by p53 and interacts with TPX2, forming a regulatory circuitry that influences tumor growth (Yan2017TPX2‐p53‐GLIPR1).

## Interactions
GLIPR1 interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. In bladder cancer, GLIPR1 is up-regulated by wild-type p53 but not by mutated p53. It inhibits TPX2 expression and interacts with heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70), disrupting its chaperone protection and stabilization of transcription factors SP1 and c-Myb. This interaction leads to the suppression of AURKA and TPX2 transcription, mediated by SP1 and c-Myb, and results in reduced SP1 and c-Myb protein levels (Yan2017TPX2‐p53‐GLIPR1).

In glioma cells, GLIPR1 is involved in the TIMP1-CD63-ITGB1-AKT signaling pathway. It colocalizes with CD63 on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, suggesting a physical interaction supported by co-immunoprecipitation assays. GLIPR1 regulates CD63 expression, which is crucial for activating the signaling pathway. This interaction promotes cell growth and invasion by increasing AKT expression (Li2022GLIPR1).

Structurally, GLIPR1 is characterized by a Zn2+-binding cavity, similar to other CAP proteins, which may allow it to bind various ligands on the cell surface or in the extracellular environment (Asojo2011Structural).
