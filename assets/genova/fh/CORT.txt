# CORT

## Overview
CORT is a gene that encodes the neuropeptide cortistatin, which is primarily expressed in the central nervous system. Cortistatin is a multifunctional peptide that shares structural similarities with somatostatin but exhibits distinct physiological roles. It is categorized as a neuropeptide and is involved in various processes, including the regulation of the blood-brain barrier, modulation of immune responses, and maintenance of glucose-insulin homeostasis. Cortistatin interacts with multiple receptors, such as the growth hormone secretagogue receptors and somatostatin receptors, influencing neurotransmitter release and other neurophysiological activities (CórdobaChacón2011Cortistatin; Criado1999Structural). Its unique interactions and functions underscore its importance in neuroprotection, immune regulation, and metabolic processes (CastilloGonzález2023Cortistatin).

## Structure


## Function
Cortistatin (CORT) is a neuropeptide primarily expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in maintaining the integrity and function of the brain endothelium, crucial for the blood-brain barrier (BBB). CORT regulates the permeability and integrity of the brain vascular endothelium, particularly after injury, by modulating tight junctions and the actin cytoskeleton, which are essential for BBB stability (CastilloGonzález2023Cortistatin). In cortistatin-deficient conditions, there is increased endothelial permeability, disrupted tight junction and adherens junction assembly, and exacerbated immune activation, leading to impaired BBB integrity (CastilloGonzález2023Cortistatin).

CORT also influences immune responses by downregulating proinflammatory factors and modulating immune cell migration, which helps maintain a healthy brain endothelial barrier (CastilloGonzález2023Cortistatin). It interacts with specific receptors, such as the ghrelin receptor, which somatostatin does not, indicating its unique physiological roles (CórdobaChacón2011Cortistatin). CORT's involvement in glucose-insulin homeostasis is evident, as its deficiency can lead to insulin resistance in male mice, highlighting its role in metabolic processes (CórdobaChacón2011Cortistatin). These functions underscore CORT's importance in neuroprotection, immune regulation, and metabolic balance.

## Interactions
Cortistatin (CORT) is a neuropeptide that interacts with several receptors and proteins, influencing various physiological processes. CORT binds to growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHS-R) in the human pituitary gland, suggesting it may act as an endogenous ligand for these receptors. This interaction indicates a potential role for CORT in modulating GHS-R activity, similar to known ligands like ghrelin and hexarelin (Deghenghi2001Cortistatin).

CORT also binds to all five somatostatin receptors (SSTR1-5), sharing many properties with somatostatin but exhibiting distinct effects. The binding affinity of CORT to these receptors is similar to that of somatostatin, except for SSTR4, where its affinity is lower (Criado1999Structural). The N-terminal proline and C-terminal lysine amide residues in CORT's structure are crucial for its activity and interactions with these receptors (Criado1999Structural).

CORT's interaction with the human orphan G-protein coupled receptor MrgX2 has been identified, although the functional significance of this interaction remains unclear due to the receptor's promiscuous nature (de2008Cortistatin—Functions). These interactions highlight CORT's role in modulating neurotransmitter release and influencing sleep, locomotor activity, and hippocampal function.
