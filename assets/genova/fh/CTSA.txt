# CTSA

## Overview
The CTSA gene encodes the protein cathepsin A, a lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase that plays a pivotal role in the degradation and processing of proteins and peptides within lysosomes. As a member of the MEROPS S10 family, cathepsin A is integral to the lysosomal multienzyme complex (LMC), where it interacts with β-galactosidase and neuraminidase-1, serving as a protective protein that stabilizes these enzymes and prevents their degradation (Bonten2013Lysosomal; Ketterer2017Inherited). The protein exhibits various enzymatic activities, including carboxypeptidase, deamidase, and esterase functions, which are essential for physiological processes such as blood pressure regulation and cellular homeostasis (Timur2016Lysosomal). Mutations in the CTSA gene are associated with lysosomal storage disorders, notably galactosialidosis, and other conditions like Cathepsin-A related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy (CARASAL) (Annunziata2016Galactosialidosis:; Budhdeo2022A).

## Structure
Cathepsin A (CTSA) is a serine carboxypeptidase encoded by the CTSA gene, primarily located in lysosomes. The primary structure of CTSA consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a serine carboxypeptidase domain, which is characteristic of the MEROPS S10 family (Ketterer2017Inherited). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its catalytic core domain and a cap domain insertion (Gorelik2021Structure).

The tertiary structure of CTSA involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its enzymatic activity, with the active site located deep within its catalytic domain, approximately 30 Å away from the interface with other proteins in the lysosomal multienzyme complex (LMC) (Gorelik2021Structure). CTSA undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are common for lysosomal enzymes and may affect its stability and function.

In terms of quaternary structure, CTSA forms homodimers and is a crucial component of the LMC, where it interacts with β-galactosidase (GLB1) and neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) to form a multienzyme complex. This complex is stabilized by a unique polar interface between CTSA and GLB1, involving hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Gorelik2021Structure). CTSA plays a protective role in this complex, preventing the proteolytic degradation of GLB1 and facilitating the activation and stability of NEU1 (Gorelik2021Structure; Ketterer2017Inherited).

## Function
Cathepsin A (CTSA) is a lysosomal serine carboxypeptidase that plays a crucial role in the processing and degradation of proteins and peptides within lysosomes. It is part of a lysosomal multienzyme complex (LMC) that includes β-galactosidase and neuraminidase-1, where it acts as a protective protein, stabilizing these enzymes and preventing their degradation (Bonten2013Lysosomal; Ketterer2017Inherited). CTSA exhibits carboxypeptidase activity at acidic pH and deamidase and esterase activities at neutral pH, which are involved in the deamination of peptides (Timur2016Lysosomal).

In healthy human cells, CTSA is involved in the regulation of bioactive peptides by removing amino acid residues from their carboxyl-terminal end, which is often blocked by an amide bond, making them less susceptible to degradation (Timur2016Lysosomal). This activity is significant in the regulation of physiological processes, such as blood pressure regulation, through the inactivation of peptides like bradykinin (Timur2016Lysosomal).

CTSA also plays a role in the formation and function of elastic fibers on the cell membrane and is involved in the processing of vasoactive peptides outside cells (Ketterer2017Inherited). Its activity is crucial for cellular homeostasis and proper lysosomal function, impacting processes like protein turnover and cellular waste management.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTSA gene, which encodes the lysosomal protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA), are primarily associated with galactosialidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in cathepsin A, leading to secondary deficiencies in neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) and β-galactosidase (β-GAL) activities. The resulting enzymatic deficiencies cause the accumulation of sialylated glycoproteins and oligosaccharides in tissues and body fluids, manifesting in a range of clinical symptoms (Annunziata2016Galactosialidosis:; Ketterer2017Inherited; Prada2014Clinical).

Galactosialidosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is classified into three clinical subtypes based on age of onset: early infantile, late infantile, and juvenile/adult. The early infantile form is the most severe, often resulting in early death due to systemic complications. The late infantile form presents with milder symptoms, while the juvenile/adult form, more common in Japanese patients, can include severe neurological manifestations (Annunziata2016Galactosialidosis:; Cadaoas2021Galactosialidosis:).

In addition to galactosialidosis, mutations in CTSA have been linked to Cathepsin-A related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy (CARASAL), a rare monogenic cause of cerebral small vessel disease (Budhdeo2022A).

## Interactions
Cathepsin A (CTSA) is a key component of the lysosomal multienzyme complex (LMC), where it interacts with neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) and beta-galactosidase (GLB1). This complex is crucial for the degradation of glycoproteins and glycolipids within lysosomes. CTSA acts as a stabilizing and activating factor for NEU1 and GLB1, preventing their premature activity in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Gorelik2021Structure; Bonten2013Lysosomal). 

CTSA forms a triangular architecture with three CTSA dimers and three GLB1 dimers, connected through a unique polar interface that involves specific residues forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. This interaction is essential for the stability of the LMC, as mutations in these residues can disrupt the complex and increase GLB1's susceptibility to proteolysis (Gorelik2021Structure). 

CTSA also interacts directly with NEU1, facilitating its lysosomal transport, activation, and stability. A proposed model suggests that NEU1 forms a dimer that bridges two copies of the core LMC via CTSA-NEU1 interfaces (Gorelik2021Structure). These interactions highlight CTSA's role in maintaining the functional integrity of the LMC and its involvement in lysosomal storage disorders (Bonten2013Lysosomal).
