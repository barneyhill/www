# EDEM1

## Overview
EDEM1 (ER degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase like protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. The protein encoded by EDEM1 is categorized as a mannosidase-like protein, although it functions independently of its mannosidase activity in certain contexts. It plays a pivotal role in the recognition and targeting of misfolded glycoproteins for degradation, facilitating their extraction from the calnexin folding cycle and directing them towards proteasomal degradation. EDEM1 is also involved in the mannose trimming process, which is essential for the quality control of glycoproteins, and has a backup role in autophagy, promoting the degradation of protein aggregates when proteasomal activity is compromised (Chiritoiu2020EDEM1; Shenkman2018Mannosidase). The protein's interactions with various ERAD and autophagy components underscore its importance in maintaining ER homeostasis and protein quality control (Chiritoiu2020EDEM1).

## Function
EDEM1 (ER degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase like protein 1) is a crucial component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis in cells. It plays a significant role in the recognition and targeting of misfolded glycoproteins for degradation. EDEM1 facilitates the extraction of terminally misfolded proteins from the calnexin folding cycle and directs them towards proteasomal degradation by associating with other ERAD components (Chiritoiu2020EDEM1).

EDEM1 is involved in the mannose trimming process, which is critical for the quality control of glycoproteins. It trims mannose residues from N-glycans, aiding in the dislocation of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol for degradation (Hosokawa2010EDEM1; Shenkman2018Mannosidase). This activity is modulated by the folding state of the glycoprotein substrate, and EDEM1 can function independently of its mannosidase domain (Chiritoiu2020EDEM1; Shenkman2018Mannosidase).

EDEM1 also has a backup role in autophagy, promoting the formation of aggregates that are degraded by the autophagy machinery when proteasomal activity is impaired (Chiritoiu2020EDEM1). This dual functionality highlights its importance in maintaining ER homeostasis and protein quality control in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
EDEM1 (ER degradation enhancing alpha-mannosidase like protein 1) plays a significant role in the regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and amyloid-β (Aβ) production, which are critical in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). EDEM1 facilitates the retrotranslocation of APP from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cytosol, promoting its degradation and potentially reducing Aβ production. Chronic ER stress can lead to decreased efficiency of the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, resulting in increased APP accumulation and Aβ production, which may exacerbate AD pathology (NowakowskaGołacka2021EDEM1).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), EDEM1 is identified as a downstream target of the LINC00485/miR-581 axis. LINC00485 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating miR-581, which targets EDEM1 mRNA, leading to its downregulation. EDEM1 expression is significantly lower in CRC tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with tumor stage and patient prognosis. The LINC00485/miR-581/EDEM1 regulatory axis is implicated in CRC progression, with alterations in EDEM1 expression contributing to increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells (Li2021Long).

These findings suggest that alterations in EDEM1 expression or function can contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and colorectal cancer.

## Interactions
EDEM1 interacts with various proteins involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. It forms complexes with canonical ERAD proteins such as SEL1L, OS-9, ERLEC1/XTP3-B, GRP94/HSP90B1, and DNAJB12. These interactions are facilitated by detergents like Digitonin and Triton X-100, and are reduced in a mutant version of EDEM1 lacking its intrinsically disordered region (∆-EDEM1) (Chiritoiu2020EDEM1). EDEM1 also associates with ERdj5, a disulphide reductase, which is crucial for preventing the formation of covalent multimers of misfolded proteins by cleaving disulphide bonds (SłomińskaWojewódzka2015The).

EDEM1 interacts with components of the autophagy machinery, including ATG2A, ATG2B, ATG3, ATG7, ATG9A, Beclin1, VMP1, and p62/SQSTM1, suggesting a role in facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins through autophagy when ERAD is impaired (Chiritoiu2020EDEM1). It also co-fractionates with proteins involved in protein folding, such as calnexin, BiP, and GRP94, and ERAD proteins like SEL1L, OS-9, and HRD1 (Chiritoiu2020EDEM1).

EDEM1's interactions are not solely dependent on its mannosidase domain, as it also involves protein-protein interactions facilitated by its intrinsically disordered region (Chiritoiu2020EDEM1). The protein's interaction with TXNDC11 is particularly strong, enhancing its mannosidase activity on denatured glycoproteins (Shenkman2018Mannosidase).
