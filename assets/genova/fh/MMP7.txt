# MMP7

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), also known as matrilysin, is a gene that encodes a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family, which are zinc-dependent endopeptidases involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix components. Unlike other MMPs, the protein encoded by MMP7 lacks a hemopexin-like domain, which is typically involved in substrate specificity and interaction with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (Massova1998Matrix; Browner1995Crystal). MMP7 is primarily expressed in epithelial cells and plays a crucial role in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and immune response by degrading various extracellular matrix proteins and modulating signaling pathways (Loffek2010Biological; Rodríguez2010Matrix). Its dysregulation is implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer and inflammatory diseases, making it a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Lertudomphonwanit2017Largescale; Ii2006Role).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), also known as matrilysin, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family characterized by its unique structural features. The primary structure of MMP7 includes a signal peptide, a propeptide, and a catalytic domain. Unlike other MMPs, MMP7 lacks the hemopexin-like domain, which is typically involved in substrate binding and interactions with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (Massova1998Matrix; Browner1995Crystal).

The secondary structure of MMP7 consists of three α-helices and a β-sheet formed by four parallel and one antiparallel strand (Terp2000Structural; Browner1995Crystal). The catalytic domain is an open-face, alpha-beta sandwich with a five-stranded beta-sheet (Browner1995Crystal). The tertiary structure is stabilized by a catalytic zinc ion coordinated by three histidine residues and a water molecule, with additional structural stabilization provided by calcium ions (Terp2000Structural; Meng2016Biochemical).

MMP7 undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic activation through a 'cysteine switch' mechanism, where the pro-domain is cleaved to activate the enzyme (Meng2016Biochemical). The enzyme's structure is further characterized by a 'Met-turn', a conserved methionine essential for stabilizing the zinc-binding motif (Meng2016Biochemical). MMP7's compact structure and lack of a hemopexin domain distinguish it from other MMPs, contributing to its unique functional properties (Massova1998Matrix).

## Function
MMP7, also known as matrilysin, is a matrix metalloproteinase that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is crucial for tissue repair and cellular migration. MMP7 facilitates the degradation of ECM components such as laminin-332 and fibronectin, aiding in wound healing and tissue remodeling (Loffek2010Biological).

In the context of immune response, MMP7 is essential for the chemotactic recruitment of neutrophils by cleaving syndecan-1, which releases cytokines and forms a chemoattractant gradient necessary for neutrophil guidance in damaged lung epithelia (Loffek2010Biological; Rodríguez2010Matrix). This function underscores its role in maintaining healthy tissue repair and immune defense mechanisms.

MMP7 also modulates signaling pathways by shedding E-cadherin, promoting lung epithelial cell migration and repair, and influencing angiogenesis by regulating the bioavailability of angiogenic factors like VEGF (Rodríguez2010Matrix). These activities highlight MMP7's involvement in maintaining normal cellular functions and tissue homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In biliary atresia (BA), MMP7 serves as a valuable biomarker, with elevated levels distinguishing BA from other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis. Its expression in cholangiocytes and release upon epithelial injury suggest a role in disease pathogenesis, and pharmacological inhibition of MMP7 has been shown to reduce experimental BA phenotypes in mice (Lertudomphonwanit2017Largescale). MMP7 expression is also linked to the outcome of the Kasai portoenterostomy procedure in BA, with higher levels associated with failed procedures and end-stage liver disease, indicating its involvement in liver fibrosis progression (Ramachandran2019RNAseq).

In cancer, MMP7 is frequently overexpressed and associated with tumorigenesis, promoting processes such as cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. It is linked to poorer prognosis in several cancers, including gastric, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers (Meng2022A; Ii2006Role). MMP7's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and regulation of non-ECM proteins, affecting cellular proliferation and apoptosis (Ii2006Role). In melanoma, MMP7 expression correlates with reduced T-cell infiltrates and worse patient outcomes, highlighting its potential as a survival-related biomarker (Zaman2019MMP7).

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) is involved in various interactions with proteins that influence its role in cancer progression and tissue remodeling. MMP7 interacts with insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), degrading IGFBP-3 to exert anti-apoptotic and mitotic effects (Liao2021Roles). It also regulates the expression and activation of Fas, generating soluble Fas by cleaving its membrane form, which inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis and promotes tumor growth (Liao2021Roles).

MMP7 interacts with the cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) molecule, facilitating the recruitment of active MMP7 and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) precursors on tumor cell surfaces. This interaction leads to the activation of HB-EGF and stimulation of its receptor ErbB4, promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Liao2021Roles). MMP7 also cleaves perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, generating bioactive fragments that may facilitate cancer metastasis by destabilizing the basement membrane and stromal matrix (Grindel2014Matrilysinmatrix).

In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, MMP7 degrades the tight junction protein Claudin-7, increasing intestinal permeability and contributing to inflammation (Xiao2022Matrix). MMP7 also sheds syndecan-1, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, from the epithelial cell surface, enhancing cell migration and wound closure by affecting integrin activation (Chen2009MMP7).
