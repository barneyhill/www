# MEI1

## Overview
The MEI1 gene encodes the meiotic double-stranded break formation protein 1, a critical component in the process of meiosis. This protein is primarily involved in the initiation of meiotic recombination by facilitating the formation of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) during the early stages of meiotic prophase I. As a nuclear protein, it plays a pivotal role in ensuring the proper alignment and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, which is essential for genetic diversity and accurate chromosomal segregation during gamete formation (Dong2021Novel; Libby2003Positional). Mutations in the MEI1 gene can lead to significant reproductive issues, including infertility due to meiotic arrest, as evidenced in both human and murine studies (Dong2021Novel; Libby2003Positional). The gene's specific expression in reproductive tissues and its critical function in meiosis highlight its importance in reproductive health and its potential as a target for genetic counseling in infertility cases (Dong2021Novel).

## Function
The MEI1 gene encodes the meiotic double-stranded break formation protein 1, which plays a crucial role in meiosis, particularly during the early stages of meiotic prophase I. In healthy human cells, MEI1 is essential for the proper alignment and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, facilitating the formation of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) necessary for meiotic recombination. This process is vital for genetic diversity and proper chromosomal segregation during gamete formation (Dong2021Novel; Libby2003Positional).

MEI1 is predominantly active in the nucleus during prophase I of meiosis, where it ensures the initiation of meiotic recombination. The protein's activity is crucial for the progression of meiosis, as it acts upstream of other meiotic proteins, such as Dmc1, in mice, indicating a similar function in humans (Dong2021Novel). The gene exhibits low expression levels in human ovaries and oocytes, highlighting its specific function during early meiosis (Dong2021Novel).

Mutations in MEI1 can lead to infertility due to defects in spermatogenesis and oogenesis, as observed in both human and murine models. These defects result from the disruption of normal meiotic processes, leading to meiotic arrest and impaired gamete development (Dong2021Novel; Libby2003Positional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MEI1 gene are associated with several reproductive health issues. In females, novel biallelic mutations in MEI1 have been linked to early embryonic arrest, recurrent implantation failure, and recurrent pregnancy loss. These mutations can lead to poor-quality embryos and failed implantation of viable embryos, contributing to infertility (Dong2021Novel). In males, MEI1 mutations are associated with azoospermia, a condition characterized by the absence of sperm in semen due to meiotic arrest. This condition has been observed in various populations, with specific polymorphic alleles of MEI1 linked to azoospermia in European American patients (Sato2006Polymorphic).

The MEI1 gene is crucial for meiotic double-stranded break formation and chromosome synapsis during meiosis. Deficiencies in MEI1 can lead to meiotic arrest, as seen in both male and female mice, and similar effects are observed in humans (Dong2021Novel; Libby2003Positional). The gene's role in reproductive health underscores its potential as a diagnostic marker for genetic counseling in cases of infertility (Dong2021Novel).
