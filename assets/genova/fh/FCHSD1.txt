# FCHSD1

## Overview
FCHSD1, or FCH and double SH3 domains 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and function. The FCHSD1 protein is characterized by an F-BAR domain and two SH3 domains, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins and cellular membranes. As a member of the BAR/F-BAR protein family, FCHSD1 plays a significant role in membrane dynamics and cytoskeletal organization. It is particularly noted for its interaction with Sorting Nexin 9 (SNX9), enhancing SNX9's ability to stimulate F-actin polymerization in a WASP-Arp2/3-dependent manner (Cao2013FCHSD1). FCHSD1 is expressed in various tissues, including the cortex and the organ of Corti, where it may contribute to auditory cell function (Cao2013FCHSD1). The gene has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including portosinusoidal vascular disease and Parkinson's disease, highlighting its potential significance in human health and disease (Giri2023Noncirrhotic; MartínFlores2018MTOR).

## Structure
The FCHSD1 protein is characterized by an amino-terminal F-BAR domain and two SH3 domains near the carboxyl-terminus. These domains are well conserved between species, with the F-BAR domain showing over 40% amino-acid identity and the SH3 domains over 50% identity between fly and mouse orthologs (Cao2013FCHSD1). The F-BAR domain is known for its ability to bind plasma membranes and couple with the actin cytoskeleton, a common feature of the BAR/F-BAR protein family (Cao2013FCHSD1). 

In terms of quaternary structure, FCHSD1 can form both homo- and hetero-oligomers with FCHSD2 (Cao2013FCHSD1). Despite its structural similarities with FCHSD2, FCHSD1 does not significantly interact with WASP or N-WASP and does not promote increased actin polymerization in vitro, unlike FCHSD2 (Cao2013FCHSD1). FCHSD1 interacts with Sorting Nexin 9 (SNX9) to enhance WASP-Arp2/3-dependent F-actin polymerization, mediated by the F-BAR domain of FCHSD1 and the SH3 domain of SNX9 (Cao2013FCHSD1). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with abundant expression in the cortex and detectable presence in the cuticular plate of the organ of Corti (Cao2013FCHSD1).

## Function
FCHSD1 is involved in the regulation of F-actin polymerization, a critical process for maintaining cell structure and function. Although FCHSD1 does not directly bind to WASP or N-WASP, proteins typically involved in actin assembly, it regulates F-actin assembly through interactions with other proteins. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified Sorting Nexin 9 (SNX9) as a binding partner of FCHSD1. SNX9 is known to stimulate F-actin polymerization in a WASP-Arp2/3-dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction between FCHSD1 and SNX9, specifically through the F-BAR domain of FCHSD1 and the SH3 domain of SNX9. While FCHSD1 alone does not affect F-actin polymerization, it enhances SNX9's activity in stimulating this process (Cao2013FCHSD1).

FCHSD1 is expressed in hair cell stereocilia and the cuticular plate, where it may play a role in modulating F-actin assembly or maintenance, potentially contributing to the development and maintenance of the F-actin cytoskeleton in these organelles (Cao2013FCHSD1). In the organ of Corti, FCHSD1 is mainly detected in the cuticular plate, suggesting a specific role in auditory cell function (Cao2013FCHSD1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FCHSD1 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. A study identified a heterozygous deleterious variant (c.547C > T, p.R183W) in the FCHSD1 gene in a Lebanese family with portosinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD). This variant was associated with hyperactivation of the mTOR signaling pathway, and when introduced into mice, 60% developed features of portal hypertension suggestive of PSVD. The authors of the study proposed that mTOR pathway antagonists might offer therapeutic benefits for PSVD (Giri2023Noncirrhotic).

In Parkinson's disease, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FCHSD1 gene have been associated with the severity of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). An epistatic interaction involving the FCHSD1 rs456998 SNP was linked to increased LID severity, suggesting that genetic variations in the mTOR pathway, including those in FCHSD1, may influence susceptibility to LID in Parkinson's disease patients (MartínFlores2018MTOR).

Additionally, the FCHSD1 gene has been implicated in methamphetamine dependence. The SNP rs14251, associated with increased FCHSD1 expression, was linked to a higher risk of methamphetamine dependence, highlighting the gene's potential role in this condition (Xiao2022The).

## Interactions
FCHSD1 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its F-BAR and SH3 domains. It does not bind to WASP or N-WASP, proteins involved in F-actin assembly, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Cao2013FCHSD1). Instead, FCHSD1 interacts with Sorting Nexin 9 (SNX9), a member of the BAR protein family involved in intracellular trafficking and F-actin assembly. This interaction is mediated by the F-BAR domain of FCHSD1 and the SH3 domain of SNX9. Functionally, FCHSD1 enhances SNX9's activity in stimulating WASP-Arp2/3-mediated F-actin polymerization in vitro (Cao2013FCHSD1).

In T lymphocytes, the C-terminal SH3 domain of FCHSD1 interacts with dynamin, a large GTPase involved in cellular processes such as vesicle budding and cytokinesis. This interaction likely occurs through the proline-rich domain of dynamin, which serves as a binding site for SH3 domains (Linkermann2009Identification). FCHSD1 is also associated with intersectin, which accelerates endocytosis, although this role is primarily noted in neuronal cells (Linkermann2009Identification). These interactions highlight FCHSD1's role in cellular processes related to cytoskeletal organization and membrane dynamics.
