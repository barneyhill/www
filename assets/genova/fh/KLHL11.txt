# KLHL11

## Overview
KLHL11 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch like family member 11, which is part of the BTB-Kelch family of proteins. This family is characterized by the presence of BTB/POZ, BACK, and Kelch domains, which facilitate the protein's role as an adaptor in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These complexes are essential for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, a process crucial for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular pathways (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike). The KLHL11 protein is involved in forming a cullin-RING-based BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination of specific substrate proteins (Clemen2021N471D). KLHL11 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a role in processes such as cell cycle regulation and response to cellular stress (Clemen2021N471D). Additionally, KLHL11 has clinical significance due to its association with autoimmune conditions, particularly paraneoplastic encephalitis, where anti-KLHL11 autoantibodies are linked to neurological disorders in patients with testicular cancer (Shi2019Kelchlike).

## Structure
The KLHL11 protein is a member of the BTB-Kelch family, characterized by specific structural domains that contribute to its function. The protein includes a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and multiple Kelch motifs. The BTB domain is involved in dimerization and binding to Cullin3, forming part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Dhanoa2013Update; Canning2013Structural). The BACK domain, also known as the intervening region, contains eight helices and forms a 3-box motif that binds the BTB domain in an antiparallel four-helix bundle configuration, which is crucial for Cul3 recognition (Canning2013Structural).

The Kelch motifs form a β-propeller structure, which is important for substrate recognition and binding (Canning2013Structural). The KLHL11 protein forms a homodimer with an elongated shape, and its BTB domain resembles the common BTB fold of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (Canning2013Structural). The protein's quaternary structure allows it to bind two Cul3 molecules, supporting a two-site model for substrate recognition (Canning2013Structural). KLHL11 may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and produce multiple splice variant isoforms, which can affect its function and localization.

## Function
KLHL11 (kelch like family member 11) encodes a protein that is part of the BTB-Kelch family, which functions as an adaptor in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. These complexes are crucial for the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular pathways (Dhanoa2013Update; Shi2019Kelchlike). The KLHL11 protein is involved in the formation of a cullin-RING-based BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, which mediates the ubiquitination of specific substrate proteins (Clemen2021N471D). This activity is vital for processes such as signal transduction, immune response, and transcription regulation (Shi2019Kelchlike).

KLHL11 is active in the cytoplasm, where it may influence processes such as cell cycle regulation and response to cellular stress (Clemen2021N471D). The protein's role in protein quality control is suggested by its involvement in the ubiquitination process, which is critical for the stability and localization of specific proteins, thereby influencing the development of human diseases (Shi2019Kelchlike). However, the specific function of KLHL11 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Clemen2021N471D).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL11 (kelch like family member 11) is associated with several neurological disorders, particularly paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS). The presence of antibodies against KLHL11 is a biomarker for paraneoplastic encephalitis, which is often linked to testicular germ cell tumors. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as ataxia, diplopia, vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and dysarthria, and is predominantly observed in men (Dubey2020Expanded; Maudes2020Clinical). 

KLHL11 encephalitis involves a T cell-predominant immune response, with CD8 T-cell infiltration and activation, suggesting a cytotoxic T-cell mediated pathogenesis (Dubey2020Expanded). The disease is often associated with testicular cancer, particularly seminoma, and can lead to severe neurological disability or death, not directly due to cancer (Vogrig2021Immunopathogenesis). 

The immunopathogenesis of KLHL11 antibody encephalitis includes chronic inflammation and significant loss of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, with a predominance of CD3+ T cells, particularly CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Vogrig2021Immunopathogenesis). Despite treatment efforts, outcomes are generally poor, with only a minority of patients showing neurological improvement (Dubey2020Expanded).

## Interactions
KLHL11 is known to interact with various proteins, often as part of ubiquitin ligase complexes. It contains a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and Kelch motifs, which facilitate protein binding and dimerization, forming β-propeller structures for protein interactions (Dhanoa2013Update). KLHL11 interacts with the E3 ligase cullin 3, playing a role in ubiquitination processes (Canning2014New; Dhanoa2013Update). This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the CRL3 complex, which is involved in tagging proteins for degradation (Canning2014New).

KLHL11 has been identified as a substrate for ubiquitination by the LNX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. This interaction is mediated through the PDZ2 domain of LNX1, and KLHL11 specifically interacts with LNX1 but not LNX2 (Lenihan2017Proteomic). The ubiquitination of KLHL11 by LNX1 is enhanced by the LNX1p80 isoform, which contains a RING domain, while the LNX1p70 isoform, lacking the RING domain, promotes ubiquitination to a lesser extent (Lenihan2017Proteomic).

KLHL11 is also associated with autoimmune conditions, as anti-KLHL11 autoantibodies have been linked to paraneoplastic encephalitis in patients with testicular cancer (Shi2019Kelchlike). However, the specific mechanisms and interactions involved in this context are not fully understood.
