# GLYCTK

## Overview
GLYCTK is a gene that encodes the enzyme glycerate kinase, a critical component in the metabolic pathways of serine and fructose. This enzyme, categorized as a kinase, facilitates the conversion of D-glycerate to D-2-phosphoglycerate, an important intermediate in glycolysis, thereby playing a significant role in cellular energy production and metabolic homeostasis (Hirvonen2021Randomized; Sass2010Dglyceric). The GLYCTK gene is expressed in various tissues and produces multiple splice variants, which localize to both the cytosol and mitochondria, suggesting its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Hirvonen2021Randomized). Mutations in GLYCTK are linked to D-glyceric aciduria, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of D-glyceric acid, leading to a spectrum of clinical symptoms (Sass2010Dglyceric; Zehavi2019Severe).

## Function
GLYCTK (glycerate kinase) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the metabolism of serine and fructose by catalyzing the phosphorylation of D-glycerate to D-2-phosphoglycerate, a glycolytic intermediate. This reaction is essential for the glycolytic pathway, which is crucial for cellular energy production (Hirvonen2021Randomized). GLYCTK is expressed in various tissues and has several splice variants located in both the cytosol and mitochondria, indicating its involvement in multiple cellular processes (Hirvonen2021Randomized).

In healthy human cells, GLYCTK is involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by facilitating the conversion of D-glycerate, a product of serine catabolism, into a form that can enter the glycolytic pathway (Sass2010Dglyceric). This function is vital for energy metabolism, as it helps regulate the levels of metabolites involved in aerobic energy production and cellular energy balance (Hirvonen2021Randomized).

The enzyme's activity is crucial for preventing the accumulation of D-glyceric acid, which is normally undetectable in healthy individuals, thereby ensuring proper metabolic function and energy production (Sass2010Dglyceric). The role of GLYCTK in energy metabolism is further supported by its ability to modulate mitochondrial function and enhance cellular membrane integrity (Hirvonen2021Randomized).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLYCTK gene, which encodes the enzyme D-glycerate kinase, are associated with D-glyceric aciduria, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of D-glyceric acid due to impaired metabolism of serine and fructose, leading to a range of clinical manifestations from severe neurological impairments to asymptomatic cases (Sass2010Dglyceric; Zehavi2019Severe). Clinical symptoms can include progressive encephalopathy, hypotonia, psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, seizures, and metabolic acidosis (DIMER2015Dglyceric).

The disorder is caused by mutations in the GLYCTK gene, such as missense variants that result in amino acid changes, which are predicted to be disease-causing (Zehavi2019Severe). For instance, a homozygous missense mutation [p. Leu152Pro] has been identified in a patient with severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy (Zehavi2019Severe). Another mutation, p.Phe493Cys, was found in a patient with severe hypotonia and seizures, indicating its pathogenic role (Sass2010Dglyceric).

The condition may be underdiagnosed due to challenges in detecting glyceric acid in routine urine tests, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic methods (Sass2010Dglyceric).
