# PIAS4

## Overview
PIAS4 is a gene that encodes the protein inhibitor of activated STAT 4, a member of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family. This protein functions primarily as a SUMO E3 ligase, playing a critical role in the post-translational modification process known as SUMOylation. PIAS4 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, and maintenance of genomic stability. It facilitates the SUMOylation of key proteins such as RIF1 and PCNA, which are essential for DNA repair and replication fidelity. Additionally, PIAS4 interacts with several proteins, influencing pathways related to tumor suppression and immune response. Its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and genetic syndromes, making it a significant focus of biomedical research (Galanty2009Mammalian; Chien2013PIAS4; Rytinki2009PIAS).

## Structure
PIAS4 is a protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The primary structure of PIAS4 consists of 510 amino acid residues, making it the smallest member of the PIAS family (Rytinki2009PIAS). The protein includes a SAP domain at the N-terminus, which is involved in DNA binding and nuclear architecture, and is crucial for its recruitment to DNA damage sites (Galanty2009Mammalian). The PINIT motif is important for nuclear retention and protein-protein interactions (Conn2016Novel). PIAS4 also contains a RING-type zinc-binding structure, which is part of its SP-RING domain, essential for its E3 SUMO ligase activity (Rytinki2009PIAS).

The secondary and tertiary structures of PIAS4 are not detailed in the provided context, but the presence of alpha helices and beta sheets is typical for proteins with these domains. PIAS4 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with at least one variant lacking the PINIT motif (Rytinki2009PIAS).

Post-translational modifications of PIAS4 include SUMOylation, which is a key aspect of its function as a SUMO E3 ligase, influencing the protein's interactions and localization (Rytinki2009PIAS). The SIM (SUMO-interacting motif) allows PIAS4 to interact noncovalently with SUMO proteins, playing a significant role in its localization and function during viral infections (Conn2016Novel).

## Function
PIAS4 is a SUMO E3 ligase that plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating the SUMOylation of various proteins involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle progression. In healthy human cells, PIAS4 is primarily active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the SUMOylation of RIF1, a protein essential for efficient DNA break repair and the resolution of RIF1 from DNA damage sites. This process is vital for preventing replication stress and maintaining genomic integrity (Kumar2017Dynamics).

PIAS4 also regulates the SUMOylation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at Lys164, promoting template switching in DNA damage tolerance pathways. This activity helps maintain a balance between error-free and error-prone DNA repair mechanisms, thereby preventing mutagenesis (Mohiuddin2018SUMOylation).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, PIAS4 is involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. It enhances the SUMOylation of the Origin Recognition Complex subunit 2 (ORC2) during the G2/M phase, which is crucial for proper chromosome segregation and preventing polyploidy. This regulation ensures normal cell cycle progression and chromosomal stability (Wang2017Reversible). PIAS4's activity is essential for the recruitment and stabilization of DNA repair proteins like 53BP1 and BRCA1 at DNA damage sites, further highlighting its importance in genomic maintenance (Galanty2009Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PIAS4 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of proximal 19p13.3 microdeletion/microduplication syndrome, a nonsense variant in PIAS4 has been associated with macrocephaly, facial dysmorphic features, and intellectual disability. This variant was inherited from a parent with milder symptoms, suggesting a significant role for PIAS4 in head-size abnormalities and other clinical features of the syndrome (Tenorio2020Further; Nevado2015PIAS4).

In cancer, PIAS4 is frequently overexpressed, particularly in pancreatic cancer, where it promotes cell proliferation and invasion. PIAS4 interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, affecting hypoxia signaling pathways crucial for tumor growth. Silencing PIAS4 in pancreatic cancer cells reduces cell growth and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1a), indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Chien2013PIAS4).

PIAS4 is also involved in modulating immune responses in liver cancer, where its expression correlates with immune subtypes and chemotherapy sensitivity. Genetic alterations in PIAS4 are linked to poor disease-free survival in various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer prognosis and treatment (Zhang2024Integrative).

## Interactions
PIAS4, a member of the PIAS family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions, primarily through its role as a SUMO E3 ligase. It interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, leading to its sumoylation and oligomerization, which impairs VHL's tumor suppressor function against hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1a) in pancreatic cancer cells (Chien2013PIAS4). PIAS4 also interacts with AMPKα and NEMO proteins, mediating their SUMOylation, which is crucial for regulating mTORC1 signaling and promoting NF-κB activation in hepatocellular carcinoma (Liu2020PIAS4).

In the context of DNA damage response, PIAS4 is necessary for the ubiquitylation of histone H2A at damaged sites, a process mediated by RNF8 and RNF168, and it facilitates the sumoylation of BRCA1 and other DDR proteins (Galanty2009Mammalian). PIAS4 also plays a role in the SUMOylation of RIF1, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability, particularly during the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle (Kumar2017Dynamics).

During herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection, PIAS4 localizes to nuclear domains containing viral genomes and interacts with promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), contributing to the intrinsic antiviral immune response (Conn2016Novel).
