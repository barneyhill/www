# ATP8B4

## Overview
ATP8B4 is a gene that encodes the ATPase phospholipid transporting 8B4 (putative), a protein belonging to the P4-ATPase family, which is characterized by its role as a phospholipid-transporting ATPase. This protein is integral to cellular membrane dynamics, primarily functioning as part of a flippase complex that maintains phospholipid asymmetry across cell membranes. The ATP8B4 protein is predicted to have multiple transmembrane segments, which facilitate its role in transporting aminophospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of membranes, a process crucial for various cellular functions, including vesicle formation and lipid signaling (Gao2015Identification; Reddy2022Polygenic). Predominantly expressed in microglia within the brain, ATP8B4 is implicated in maintaining cellular membrane integrity and intracellular signaling pathways (Holstege2022Exome). While its specific functions are not fully elucidated, ATP8B4 shares structural and functional similarities with other P4-ATPases, such as ATP8B1, which is involved in phospholipid regulation (Gao2015Identification).

## Structure
ATP8B4 is a member of the P4-ATPase family, known for its role as a phospholipid-transporting ATPase. The primary structure of ATP8B4 consists of multiple transmembrane helices, which are characteristic of this protein family. These helices are integral to the protein's function in transporting phospholipids across cellular membranes. The secondary structure of ATP8B4 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and functional conformation.

In terms of tertiary structure, ATP8B4's helices and sheets are arranged into a specific conformation that is essential for its activity as a transporter. The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins or subunits, although specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context.

ATP8B4 contains a P-type ATPase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain is involved in the hydrolysis of ATP, providing the energy required for phospholipid transport. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the activity and function of ATP8B4. Additionally, splice variants of ATP8B4 can result in isoforms with different functional properties, potentially affecting the protein's role in cellular processes.

## Function
The ATP8B4 gene encodes a protein that is a component of a P4-ATPase flippase complex, which plays a crucial role in maintaining phospholipid asymmetry in cell membranes. This complex catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP, facilitating the transport of aminophospholipids from the outer to the inner leaflet of various membranes, a process essential for cellular functions such as vesicle formation and the uptake of lipid signaling molecules (Gao2015Identification; Reddy2022Polygenic). The ATP8B4 protein is predicted to have 10 transmembrane segments, forming the membrane domain, with nucleotide-binding, phosphorylation, and actuator domains. The binding of ATP to the nucleotide-binding domain and subsequent phosphorylation of an Asp residue in the phosphorylation domain induces conformational transitions described as E1 to E2-P in the Post-Albers catalytic cycle (Gao2015Identification).

ATP8B4 is predominantly expressed in microglia within the brain and is involved in maintaining cellular membrane integrity and facilitating intracellular signaling pathways (Holstege2022Exome). While the specific functions and mechanisms of ATP8B4 remain largely unexplored, it shares structural and functional similarities with ATP8B1, which is involved in phospholipid regulation (Gao2015Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATP8B4 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In Alzheimer's disease, rare damaging variants in ATP8B4 have been identified as risk factors. These variants are associated with both early-onset and late-onset forms of the disease, with a higher burden of damaging variants observed in individuals with an earlier age of onset (Holstege2022Exome). The ATP8B4 gene is involved in processes such as APP processing, lipid metabolism, and amyloid-β aggregation, which are critical in the pathophysiology of AD (Holstege2020Exome).

In systemic sclerosis, ATP8B4 variants have been associated with an increased risk of the disease, particularly in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). A specific missense variant, rs55687265, has shown a strong association with SSc, with a higher frequency in patients compared to controls (Gao2015Identification). The overexpression of ATP8B4 has also been observed in SSc patients, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for disease severity (Gao2015Identification). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ATP8B4 in both neurodegenerative and autoimmune conditions.

## Interactions
ATP8B4, a member of the P4-ATPase family, interacts with CDC50 proteins, which are essential for its proper localization and function. These interactions facilitate the transport of ATP8B4 from the endoplasmic reticulum to its final destinations, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi complex, and endosomes. Specifically, ATP8B4 interacts with CDC50A or CDC50B, which are necessary for the exit of P4-ATPases from the ER. Without these interactions, ATP8B4 accumulates in the ER, indicating the critical role of CDC50 proteins in its cellular trafficking (Shin2018Substrates).

While ATP8B4 is suggested to have potential links to Alzheimer's disease, specific details on its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not well-documented. The focus remains on its general function and importance in cellular processes rather than specific protein interactions (Folmer2009P4). Additionally, flippase activity toward any phospholipid was not detected in cells expressing ATP8B4, suggesting that it might transport other lipids or require activation via specific signaling pathways (Shin2018Substrates). However, no specific interactions with nucleic acids have been reported in the available literature.
