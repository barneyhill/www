# SLC9A3

## Overview
The SLC9A3 gene encodes the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3), a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in ion exchange and pH regulation across epithelial cells. NHE3 is primarily expressed in the apical membranes of epithelial cells in the kidney and intestine, where it facilitates the exchange of intracellular hydrogen ions for extracellular sodium ions, thus contributing to sodium absorption and acid-base homeostasis (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE; Xu2018SLC9). The protein's activity is intricately regulated by various mechanisms, including phosphorylation and interactions with scaffolding proteins, which modulate its localization and function (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE; Xu2018SLC9). Mutations in SLC9A3 have been linked to clinical conditions such as congenital sodium diarrhea and cystic fibrosis, highlighting its significance in human health (Janecke2015Reduced; Pereira2017Association).

## Structure
The SLC9A3 gene encodes the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3), a protein involved in ion exchange and pH regulation. NHE3 is composed of 834 amino acids and is primarily localized to the plasma membrane and endosomes in tissues such as the small intestine, colon, gallbladder, and kidney (Pedersen2019The). The protein structure includes multiple transmembrane domains, forming a channel for ion transport, although specific details about the molecular structure of SLC9A3 are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE).

The C-terminus of NHE3 acts as a scaffold for binding various proteins and phosphoinositides, which are crucial for its regulation. This region includes multiple helical domains, with one domain (amino acids 473-497) being highly homologous to a domain in the NHE1 C-terminus and interacting with CHP2 (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE). NHE3 is regulated by interactions with the cytoskeleton, involving NHERF proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, through a COOH-terminal PDZ binding motif and an internal motif (Pedersen2019The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a role in regulating NHE3 activity, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. The protein's regulation involves complex interactions with various signaling proteins, indicating its dynamic role in cellular processes (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE).

## Function
The SLC9A3 gene encodes the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) protein, which is crucial for maintaining intracellular pH and sodium balance by exchanging intracellular hydrogen ions for extracellular sodium ions. NHE3 is primarily active in the apical membrane of epithelial cells in the kidney and intestine, where it plays a significant role in sodium absorption and acid-base homeostasis (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE; Xu2018SLC9).

In the kidney, NHE3 is located on the apical membrane of the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, where it facilitates sodium and bicarbonate reabsorption, contributing to the regulation of blood volume and pressure (Fuster2013Traditional). In the intestine, NHE3 is involved in transepithelial sodium absorption, particularly in the ileum, and is essential for maintaining sodium balance and pH homeostasis (Xu2018SLC9).

NHE3 activity is regulated by various mechanisms, including phosphorylation by protein kinases such as PKA, CK2, and CaM KII, which modulate its activity by altering its phosphorylation state and plasma membrane abundance (Xu2018SLC9). The protein also interacts with scaffolding proteins like NHERF1 and NHERF2, which facilitate its regulation by anchoring kinases close to NHE3 (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE). These interactions are crucial for its function in processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis, which regulate its presence on the membrane (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SLC9A3 gene, which encodes the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3), are associated with several clinical conditions. Congenital sodium diarrhea (CSD) is a rare disorder linked to mutations in SLC9A3, characterized by intractable diarrhea and high fecal sodium loss. These mutations reduce the activity and surface expression of NHE3, impairing sodium absorption in the intestine (Janecke2015Reduced). Some patients with SLC9A3 mutations also develop inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), suggesting a potential link between NHE3 dysfunction and IBD (Janecke2015Reduced).

In cystic fibrosis (CF), SLC9A3 acts as a modifier gene, influencing the severity of lung disease and susceptibility to infections. Variants in SLC9A3, such as rs17563161, have been associated with digestive and pulmonary complications in CF patients, potentially through interactions with the CFTR gene (Pereira2017Association; Dorfman2010Modulatory).

SLC9A3 is also implicated in male reproductive health. Deficiencies in this gene can lead to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), a condition causing male infertility due to obstructive azoospermia. This is particularly noted in Taiwanese patients, where SLC9A3 deficiencies are more prevalent than CFTR mutations (Wang2017Loss; Wu2019SLC9A3).

## Interactions
The SLC9A3 gene encodes the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, which participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in its regulation and function. NHE3 interacts with the C-terminal PDZ motif of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a significant interaction in epithelial tissues such as the pancreatic duct and male reproductive tract (Wang2017Loss). This interaction is regulated by sodium-hydrogen exchange regulatory cofactor 2 in renal epithelial cells (Wang2017Loss).

NHE3 also forms complexes with NHERF proteins (NHERF1-4), which are involved in its regulation and localization. These interactions occur through a COOH-terminal PDZ binding motif and an internal motif, linking NHE3 to the actin cytoskeleton via proteins like ezrin (Pedersen2019The). The NHE3 C-terminus acts as a scaffold, binding multiple proteins and phosphoinositides, including CHP, ezrin, PIP2, PIP3, CaMKII, CaM, PLC, IRBIT, and megalin, forming major signaling complexes that influence its activity (Donowitz2013SLC9NHE).

NHE3 is also regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Protein kinase C (PKC), serum-and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase-1 (SGK1), and casein kinase 2 (CK2) activate NHE3, while protein kinase A (PKA) and calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) inhibit it (Pedersen2019The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory network involving NHE3 and its role in cellular processes.
