# PTPRG

## Overview
PTPRG, or protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G, is a gene that encodes a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes an extracellular region with a carbonic anhydrase-like domain, a fibronectin type III domain, and a Ser/Thr-rich region, as well as a single transmembrane segment and intracellular phosphatase domains. The protein plays a crucial role in cellular signal transduction by regulating phosphotyrosine levels on proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. PTPRG is widely expressed in human tissues, including the central nervous system, epithelial cells, and hematopoietic cells, and is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis. It interacts with the contactin family, which is important for neuronal development and motor function. Clinically, PTPRG is considered a tumor suppressor gene, with its downregulation linked to several cancers and neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (Barnea1993Identification; Boni2022The; Boni2022A).

## Structure
PTPRG (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G) is a receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein consists of an extracellular region, a single transmembrane segment, and intracellular phosphatase domains. The extracellular region includes a carbonic anhydrase-like (CAH) domain, a fibronectin type III (FN3) domain, and a Ser/Thr-rich region (Barnea1993Identification). The CAH domain shows significant sequence similarity to carbonic anhydrases, although it lacks the full complement of histidine residues necessary for zinc ion coordination, suggesting a non-catalytic role (Barnea1993Identification; Bouyain2010The).

The intracellular segment contains two tandem phosphatase domains, with the first domain (D1) being catalytically active and the second domain (D2) acting as a pseudophosphatase, potentially involved in stability and substrate specificity (Boni2022The). PTPRG can form a 'head-to-toe' dimer, where the D2 domain of one molecule blocks the active site of the D1 domain in the other, a mechanism thought to regulate its activity (El2024Analysis).

PTPRG is subject to post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, particularly in its extracellular spacer region (El2024Analysis). The protein is expressed in various isoforms across different tissues, attributed to alternative splicing (Boni2022The).

## Function
Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG) is a receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes by regulating the levels of phosphotyrosine on proteins. It plays a significant role in cellular signal transduction and is widely expressed in human tissues, including the central nervous system, epithelial cells, and hematopoietic cells (Boni2022A). PTPRG is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been associated with interactions with the contactins family, which are important for neuronal development and motor function (Boni2022A).

PTPRG acts as a CO2/HCO3- sensor in renal proximal tubules and arterioles, crucial for maintaining pH balance and regulating calcium sensitivity in vascular smooth muscle cells (Boni2022A). It is also implicated in the regulation of blood flow and pressure, as well as vascular relaxation through intracellular calcium response (Boni2022The). In the central nervous system, PTPRG is involved in differentiation and synaptic organization, potentially influencing learning and memory processes (Boni2022A).

PTPRG's enzymatic activity is highest in a peptide substrate panel, and it forms a stable dimer in solution, which is thought to regulate its catalytic activity (Boni2022A). It is also involved in the regulation of phosphorylation balance, which is crucial for normal cellular functions (Boni2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTPRG gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. PTPRG is considered a tumor suppressor gene, and its downregulation or inactivation is linked to several cancers, including colorectal, nasopharyngeal, ovarian, breast, lung, and gastric cancers, as well as hematopoietic diseases like lymphoma and leukemia (Boni2022The). In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), PTPRG expression is significantly reduced, correlating with increased clonogenic capability and disease progression. This downregulation is often due to promoter methylation, and restoring PTPRG expression through demethylating agents can inhibit cancer cell proliferation (Della2010Protein).

PTPRG is also implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Specific mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PTPRG have been linked to these conditions, suggesting its role in phosphatase regulatory functions and as a risk gene for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (Boni2022A). In metabolic disorders, PTPRG overexpression is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus, with certain SNPs linked to increased disease risk (Boni2022A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PTPRG in various diseases, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker.

## Interactions
PTPRG (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G) is known to interact with members of the contactin (CNTN) family, specifically CNTN3, CNTN4, CNTN5, and CNTN6. These interactions are mediated through the carbonic anhydrase-like (CA) domain of PTPRG, which binds to the Ig2-Ig3 domains of the contactins. The binding involves a β-hairpin loop in the CA domain, which is crucial for the interaction (Bouyain2010The; Nikolaienko2016Structural).

The interactions between PTPRG and CNTN family members are significant in neural tissues, where they are involved in cell adhesion and signaling. PTPRG forms complexes with CNTN3-6, which can occur in cis (on the same cell) or trans (between different cells) configurations. These complexes have been observed in the outer segments of rod photoreceptor cells in the retina, suggesting a role in phototransduction and neural network construction (Nikolaienko2016Structural).

The interaction sites on CNTN4, CNTN5, and CNTN6 with PTPRG are conserved, indicating a similar mode of interaction across these contactins. This conservation suggests functional similarities in their roles in neuritogenesis and neural development (Mercati2013Contactin).
