# CCPG1

## Overview
CCPG1, or cell cycle progression gene 1, encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular homeostasis by functioning as a non-canonical autophagy cargo receptor. The protein, also referred to as cell cycle progression 1, is integral to the process of ER-phagy, which is essential for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis. By interacting with ATG8 family proteins and FIP200, CCPG1 facilitates the selective degradation of dysfunctional ER components and protein aggregates, thereby preventing ER stress and maintaining cellular equilibrium. This function is particularly significant in the pancreas, where it supports the high biosynthetic demands of pancreatic acinar cells. The gene's expression is upregulated in response to ER stress, underscoring its role in the cellular stress response and its potential implications in conditions such as pancreatic inflammation and cancer (Smith2018CCPG1; Smith2018CCPG1a).

## Function
CCPG1 (cell cycle progression gene 1) functions as a non-canonical autophagy cargo receptor essential for ER-phagy, a process critical for maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis in healthy human cells. It is an ER-resident transmembrane protein that interacts with ATG8 family proteins and FIP200 through specific peptide motifs, facilitating the recruitment of ER material into autophagosomes for degradation. This interaction is crucial for the selective turnover of dysfunctional organelles and protein aggregates, thereby preventing the accumulation of insoluble proteins within the ER lumen and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Smith2018CCPG1a).

CCPG1 is particularly active in the pancreas, where it helps manage the high biosynthetic demands of pancreatic acinar cells by promoting ER turnover and remodeling. This function is vital for protecting against elevated unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling and tissue injury, as it prevents ER stress and inflammation (Smith2018CCPG1; Smith2018CCPG1a). The gene is upregulated in response to ER stress, indicating its role in the cellular stress response and its importance in maintaining ER homeostasis under stress conditions (Smith2018CCPG1a).

## Clinical Significance
CCPG1 has been implicated in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis, particularly in the exocrine pancreas. Alterations in CCPG1 expression can lead to ER stress and tissue injury. In CCPG1-deficient mice, there is a loss of polarized distribution of protein granules in acinar cells, resulting in ER dysfunction characterized by protein aggregates and distended rough ER. This dysfunction triggers elevated ER stress markers, such as BiP, Chop, Grp94, and spliced XBP1, indicating significant ER stress (Smith2018CCPG1). Despite these changes, there is no generalized defect in pancreatic exocrine function, although older mice show signs of tissue injury, such as sporadic inflammatory infiltrates and compensatory proliferation (Smith2018CCPG1).

CCPG1's role in ER-phagy is crucial for preventing protein accumulation and excessive unfolded protein response (UPR) activation, which can lead to tissue damage. The loss of CCPG1 function blocks ER-phagy, exacerbating ER stress and potentially contributing to pancreatic inflammatory states or cancer (Zhou2022ERphagy; Hübner2019ERphagy). While no direct link to human diseases has been established, manipulating CCPG1 function may offer therapeutic benefits in conditions involving ER stress, such as pancreatic cancer (Hübner2019ERphagy).

## Interactions
CCPG1 interacts with several proteins involved in autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. It binds directly to ATG8 family proteins, specifically GABARAP, through a canonical LIR motif located in its N-terminal domain. This interaction is crucial for linking the ER membrane to the immature autophagosome (Smith2018CCPG1). CCPG1 also interacts with FIP200, a component of the ULK complex, through two linear peptide motifs, FIR1 and FIR2, in its N-terminal domain. These motifs are essential for the direct binding of CCPG1 to FIP200, facilitating ER-phagy (Smith2018CCPG1).

The interaction between CCPG1 and FIP200 is enhanced by phosphorylation of the FIR2 motif, which increases the binding affinity to the FIP200 Claw domain. This interaction is crucial for selective autophagy initiation (Zhou2021Phosphorylation). CCPG1 also interacts with other proteins, such as ATG101, and is involved in the unfolded protein response, which is induced by ER stress (Smith2018CCPG1). These interactions highlight CCPG1's role as a non-canonical autophagy cargo receptor essential for ER-phagy and maintaining proteostasis in the pancreas (Smith2018CCPG1).
