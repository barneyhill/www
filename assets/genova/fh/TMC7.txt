# TMC7

## Overview
TMC7 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane channel-like 7 (TMC7) protein, which is part of the transmembrane channel-like protein family. This protein is primarily involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its role in various cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking and fusion. TMC7 is localized to the cis-Golgi and is crucial for the integrity and function of the Golgi apparatus, interacting with proteins such as GM130, P115, and GRASP65. These interactions are essential for processes like acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis, which is vital for male fertility (Wang2024TMC7). Clinically, TMC7 has been linked to conditions such as male infertility and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where its expression levels and alternative splicing events can influence disease progression and prognosis (Weng2023Identification; Wang2024TMC7).

## Clinical Significance
TMC7 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In mice, TMC7 deficiency leads to male infertility characterized by oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia (OAT), a condition marked by abnormal sperm morphology, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced numbers of elongating spermatids. This is due to defects in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis, which is crucial for sperm development and function (Wang2024TMC7).

In the context of cancer, TMC7 has been associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Alternative splicing events in TMC7, particularly involving exon 17, have been linked to enhanced invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. High expression levels of TMC7 correlate with poor prognosis in PDAC patients, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for treating pancreatic cancer metastasis (Weng2023Identification).

These findings highlight the significance of TMC7 in both reproductive health and cancer progression, indicating that alterations in its expression or function can lead to significant clinical outcomes.

## Interactions
TMC7, a member of the transmembrane channel-like protein family, is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for its function in cellular processes. TMC7 is localized to the cis-Golgi and interacts with GM130, a protein crucial for Golgi function. This interaction is significant for maintaining Golgi integrity and structure. TMC7 also interacts with GM130-interacting proteins such as P115 and GRASP65. The loss of TMC7 results in reduced levels of these proteins, indicating its role in maintaining Golgi structure and function (Wang2024TMC7).

In the context of spermatogenesis, TMC7 is essential for acrosome biogenesis, a process critical for male fertility. Its interactions with Golgi-associated proteins are vital for the proper formation and orientation of the Golgi apparatus toward the developing acrosome. TMC7 deficiency leads to fragmented and malformed acrosomes, highlighting its role in vesicle trafficking and fusion during acrosome development (Wang2024TMC7).

These interactions underscore the importance of TMC7 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role in various cellular signaling pathways. The disruption of these interactions can lead to significant cellular stress and apoptosis, particularly in spermatids (Wang2024TMC7).
