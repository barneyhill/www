Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins share similar domain structure, and associate with a variety of signaling molecules to alter the actin cytoskeleton. The encoded protein is highly expressed in neural tissues, and interacts with several proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, including cell division control protein 42 (CDC42) and the actin-related protein-2/3 (ARP2/3) complex. The encoded protein may be involved in the formation of long actin microspikes, and in neurite extension.
