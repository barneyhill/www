# MYBPH

## Overview
MYBPH (myosin binding protein H) is a gene that encodes the myosin binding protein H, a protein involved in muscle contraction and cellular motility. This protein is categorized as a myosin binding protein and shares structural similarities with myosin binding protein C (cMyBPC), particularly in its role within cardiac sarcomeres. MYBPH is expressed in both fast skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, where it contributes to the regulation of muscle contraction and cellular dynamics. The protein interacts with various cellular components, including non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC IIA) and Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), influencing processes such as actomyosin organization and autophagy. MYBPH's involvement in these pathways highlights its significance in maintaining cellular integrity and function, with implications in conditions such as lung adenocarcinoma and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Mouton2015Ascribing; Zhu2017MYBPH; Hosono2011MYBPH).

## Structure
MYBPH (myosin binding protein H) is a protein that shares structural similarities with myosin binding protein C (cMyBPC). Both proteins are involved in cardiac sarcomere contraction and consist of immunoglobulin (IgI) and fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains (Mouton2015Ascribing). The C-terminal of MYBPH shares 50% identity with cMyBPC and includes four protein modules: FnIII-IgI-FnIII-IgI, corresponding to domains C7-C10 of cMyBPC (Mouton2015Ascribing). The fibronectin type III domain is crucial for MYBPH's interaction with non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC IIA) and ROCK1, influencing cell motility and actomyosin organization (Hosono2012MYBPH; Hosono2011MYBPH).

MYBPH is approximately 55 kDa in size and is encoded by a single gene, expressed in both fast skeletal and cardiac muscle cells (Mouton2015Ascribing). It interacts with several proteins, including MYH7 (cardiac β-myosin heavy chain), ACTC1 (cardiac α-actin), and UBC9 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2I), suggesting a role in nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and other nuclear functions (Mouton2015Ascribing). The protein's interaction with the autophagosomal membrane protein LC3 indicates a potential involvement in autophagy (Mouton2015Ascribing).

## Function
MYBPH (myosin binding protein H) is involved in several key cellular processes, particularly in muscle contraction and cell motility. In cardiac muscle, MYBPH shares structural similarities with myosin binding protein C (cMyBPC) and is implicated in maintaining cardiac sarcomere function. It plays a role in cardiac contractility, potentially compensating for cMyBPC, as concurrent knockdowns of both proteins reduce contractility, suggesting a compensatory mechanism (Mouton2015Ascribing). MYBPH is also involved in the autophagy-lysosome pathway, co-localizing with the autophagosomal membrane protein LC3, indicating a role in autophagosomal membrane maturation (Mouton2015Ascribing).

In non-muscle cells, MYBPH interacts with ROCK1, inhibiting its kinase activity, which affects actomyosin organization. This interaction reduces cell motility and metastasis, highlighting MYBPH's role in maintaining cellular structure and dynamics (Hosono2011MYBPH). MYBPH is transactivated by TTF-1, which increases its expression and further influences cell motility by modulating actomyosin organization through ROCK1 inhibition (Hosono2011MYBPH). These functions suggest that MYBPH is crucial for both muscle and non-muscle cell processes, contributing to cellular integrity and function.

## Clinical Significance
The MYBPH gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma, MYBPH is identified as a transcriptional target of TTF-1 and plays a role in inhibiting ROCK1, a kinase involved in cell motility and metastasis. Its expression is associated with reduced cancer invasion and metastasis, suggesting a favorable prognosis. However, MYBPH can be epigenetically inactivated by promoter DNA methylation in some TTF-1 positive lung adenocarcinomas, which correlates with increased cancer progression (Hosono2011MYBPH).

In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), MYBPH acts as a genetic modifier influencing the severity of cardiac hypertrophy. Variations in MYBPH have been associated with hypertrophy traits in patients carrying specific mutations, such as the p.A797T mutation in the MYH7 gene, suggesting its role in modulating hypertrophy severity (Mouton2016MYBPH).

In vascular biology, MYBPH inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell migration and reduces neointimal hyperplasia, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing restenosis following vascular injury (Zhu2017MYBPH).

## Interactions
MYBPH (myosin binding protein H) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in muscle function and cell motility. It directly interacts with non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC IIA), specifically binding to its rod portion, which inhibits NMHC IIA assembly and reduces cell motility (Hosono2012MYBPH). This interaction is facilitated by the fibronectin type III domain of MYBPH (Hosono2011MYBPH).

MYBPH also interacts with Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), inhibiting its activity. This interaction prevents ROCK1-mediated phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain (RLC) of myosin, affecting actomyosin organization and reducing cell motility and metastasis (Hosono2011MYBPH). MYBPH does not bind directly to RLC but influences its phosphorylation through its interaction with ROCK1 (Hosono2011MYBPH).

In cardiac cells, MYBPH interacts with cardiac β-myosin heavy chain (MYH7), cardiac α-actin (ACTC1), and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2I (UBE2I), also known as UBC9. These interactions suggest a role in cardiac sarcomere contraction and potential involvement in autophagy and sumoylation processes (Mouton2015Ascribing).
