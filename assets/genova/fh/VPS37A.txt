# VPS37A

## Overview
VPS37A is a gene that encodes the VPS37A protein, a subunit of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-I (ESCRT-I), which is integral to cellular processes such as endosomal sorting and autophagy. The VPS37A protein is characterized by its involvement in the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the lysosomal degradation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Kolmus2020Concurrent; Bache2004The). Structurally, the protein comprises an N-terminal Ubiquitin E2 variant-like (UEVL) domain and a C-terminal Mod(r) domain, facilitating its interactions with other ESCRT-I components like TSG101 and VPS28 (Bache2004The; Ye2024Identification). VPS37A's function is critical for the regulation of growth factor receptors, and its dysregulation is associated with various cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Alfred2016When; Nan2019UBAP1).

## Structure
The VPS37A protein is a subunit of the ESCRT-I complex, crucial for autophagosome closure during autophagy. It consists of 397 amino acids and is divided into two main domains: the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain spans approximately the first 220 residues and includes a Ubiquitin E2 variant-like (UEVL) domain, which is structurally similar to other UEV domains but does not bind ubiquitin due to the absence of a ubiquitin-interacting region (Ye2022Curvature; Ye2024Identification). This domain also contains two hydrophobic motifs, WLFP and FPYL, which are essential for membrane binding and curvature sensing, facilitating the protein's localization to the phagophore (Ye2022Curvature; Ye2024Identification).

The C-terminal domain contains a Mod(r) domain, part of the core structure of the ESCRT-I complex, which includes TSG101, VPS28, and UBAP1 (Ye2024Identification). The VPS37A protein's structure is characterized by an α/β fold typical of UEV domains, as determined by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy (Ye2024Identification). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, affecting its interactions within the ESCRT-I complex.

## Function
VPS37A is a critical component of the ESCRT-I (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-I) complex, which plays a vital role in the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. This process is essential for the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are involved in the lysosomal degradation of membrane proteins, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. The proper functioning of VPS37A is crucial for the down-regulation of EGF receptors, which is important for controlling cell surface expression of growth factor receptors involved in cellular proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation (Bache2004The).

VPS37A interacts with other components of the ESCRT-I complex, such as Tsg101 and hVps28, and is necessary for the stability and function of this complex. It is active in the cytoplasm and endosomal membranes, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis and signaling pathways (Kolmus2020Concurrent; Bache2004The). The depletion of VPS37A can lead to destabilization of the ESCRT-I complex, resulting in cellular stress responses and affecting processes like cell migration, signaling, and growth (Kolmus2020Concurrent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the VPS37A gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly various forms of cancer. In hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and oral and oropharyngeal cancers, reduced expression of VPS37A is associated with increased tumor invasion, lower survival rates, and higher recurrence rates. This is linked to decreased degradation of the EGF receptor, activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), which collectively enhance tumor proliferation and invasion (Alfred2016When).

In colorectal cancer, VPS37A acts as a tumor suppressor, and its reduced expression is observed in advanced stages of the disease. The loss of VPS37A is associated with ESCRT-I destabilization, leading to cellular stress responses, inflammation, and impaired cell growth. This suggests that VPS37A depletion may promote tumor growth and resistance to chemotherapeutics in advanced colorectal cancer stages (Kolmus2020Concurrent).

VPS37A mutations are also linked to neurological conditions. A homozygous missense mutation in VPS37A is associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), specifically SPG53, a form of complex autosomal recessive HSP (Nan2019UBAP1). Additionally, a pathogenic variant in VPS37A has been identified in familial monophasic acute transverse myelitis, suggesting a genetic susceptibility to this condition (Mealy2018Familial).

## Interactions
VPS37A, a component of the ESCRT-I complex, interacts with several other proteins within this complex. It forms stable interactions with TSG101 and VPS28, which are crucial for its role in endosomal sorting and autophagosome closure (Bache2004The; Ye2024Identification). The interaction between VPS37A and TSG101 is mediated by the mod(r) domain, a conserved feature among several proteins, including hVps37B and hVps37C (Bache2004The). VPS37A also interacts with UBAP1, with evidence suggesting a preferential incorporation of UBAP1 in ESCRT-I complexes containing VPS37A (Kolmus2020Concurrent).

VPS37A's role extends to the recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to the phagophore, where it interacts with CHMP2A, facilitating the recruitment of VPS4 necessary for membrane closure (Takahashi2019VPS37A). Despite its involvement in these interactions, VPS37A does not bind to ubiquitin, distinguishing its function from other ESCRT components (Ye2024Identification). These interactions highlight VPS37A's critical role in both endosomal sorting and autophagic processes, underscoring its importance in cellular membrane remodeling activities.
