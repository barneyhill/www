# KCNK6

## Overview
KCNK6 is a gene that encodes the potassium two-pore domain channel subfamily K member 6, also known as TWIK-2. This protein is a member of the two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channel family, which is characterized by its unique structural topology featuring four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit (Goldstein2001Potassium; Lesage2000Molecular). The KCNK6 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability by contributing to background potassium currents (Mhatre2003Genomic; Talley2003TwoPoreDomain). It is expressed in various tissues, including the cochlea and peripheral nervous system, where it is involved in essential physiological processes such as potassium ion recycling and sensory transduction (Mhatre2003Genomic; Talley2003TwoPoreDomain). Additionally, alterations in KCNK6 expression have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including intellectual disability and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Ehtesham2022Characterizing; Williams2013Altered).

## Structure
KCNK6, also known as TWIK-2, is a member of the two-pore-domain potassium (K2P) channel family. The protein exhibits a 4TMS/2P topology, which is characteristic of K2P channels, featuring four transmembrane segments and two pore-forming domains per subunit (Goldstein2001Potassium; Lesage2000Molecular). This structural arrangement allows KCNK6 to form dimers, which are necessary for creating functional potassium channels (Hou2021Potassium).

The KCNK6 protein contains a Ca2+-binding EF hand motif, suggesting potential calcium sensor properties, although it remains in the endoplasmic reticulum without generating ion channel activity at the cell surface unless associated with an unidentified partner (Lesage2000Molecular). The protein is characterized by noninactivating currents and weak inward rectification, indicating its role in maintaining the resting membrane potential (Mhatre2003Genomic).

KCNK6 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity (Goldstein2001Potassium). Despite its expression in various tissues, including the cochlea and breast cancer cells, no splice variant isoforms or specific tertiary structural details are provided in the available context (Mhatre2003Genomic; Hou2021Potassium).

## Function
The KCNK6 gene encodes a tandem pore domain potassium channel known as TWIK-2, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. This channel is part of the two-pore domain potassium channel family, contributing to background potassium currents that are essential for stabilizing the cell membrane potential (Mhatre2003Genomic; Talley2003TwoPoreDomain). 

TWIK-2 is characterized by noninactivating currents and weak inward rectification properties, which suggest its involvement in maintaining the resting cell membrane potential (Mhatre2003Genomic). The channel is expressed in various tissues, including the cochlea, where it is involved in the potassium ion-recycling pathway. This pathway is critical for maintaining potassium concentration in the endolymph, which is essential for the mechanotransduction process in sensory hair cells (Mhatre2003Genomic). 

In the central nervous system, TWIK-2 is either absent or found at low levels, but it is present in dorsal root ganglia, indicating a role in peripheral nervous system functions (Talley2003TwoPoreDomain). The channel's activity is modulated by various physiological stimuli, contributing to homeostatic regulation processes such as controlling respiration and body temperature (Talley2003TwoPoreDomain).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNK6 gene have been identified as a novel cause of autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID). In a study involving a cohort of patients with intellectual disability, two siblings with KCNK6 mutations exhibited psychomotor delay, speech disorder, inability to walk, poor suck, and short stature, although they did not experience seizures or facial dysmorphism. This suggests that KCNK6 mutations may be associated with a specific set of developmental and physical challenges, although such cases are rare (Ehtesham2022Characterizing).

Alterations in the expression of KCNK6 have also been linked to various cancer types. In breast ductal carcinoma, KCNK6 is underexpressed, while in colorectal adenocarcinoma, it is overexpressed. These significant expression changes suggest a potential role for KCNK6 in cancer pathogenesis (Williams2013Altered). The gene's expression is significantly altered in several other cancers, indicating its potential importance in cancer biology (Williams2013Altered). In breast cancer, KCNK6 is upregulated, and alterations in KCNK genes are associated with worse clinical characteristics and higher tumor mutation burden, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Zou2022Integrative).
