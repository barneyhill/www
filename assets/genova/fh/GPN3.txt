# GPN3

## Overview
GPN3 is a gene that encodes the protein GPN-loop GTPase 3, a member of the GPN-loop GTPase family. This protein is characterized by a conserved glycine-proline-asparagine (GPN) motif, which is essential for its GTPase activity. GPN-loop GTPase 3 plays a critical role in the nuclear import and assembly of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), a key enzyme in the transcription process. The protein functions by forming a heterodimer with GPN1, facilitating the proper localization and assembly of RNAP II subunits within the nucleus. This interaction is vital for maintaining transcriptional activity and cellular proliferation. GPN3 is also implicated in various protein interactions, including those with the C-terminal domain of the RPB1 subunit of RNAP II, highlighting its importance in RNAP II biogenesis. Clinically, GPN3 has been associated with breast cancer, where its expression levels influence cell proliferation and patient prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based; LaraChacón2019Gpn3; Calera2011ParcsGpn3).

## Structure
The GPN3 protein, part of the GPN-loop GTPase family, is characterized by a conserved glycine-proline-asparagine (GPN) motif, which is crucial for its GTPase activity (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). The primary structure of GPN3 includes specific residues that are essential for its interaction with Gpn1, such as E112, which plays a significant role in heterodimer formation (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). 

In terms of secondary structure, GPN3, like its paralog Gpn1, is predicted to have a core fold consisting of a six-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by six alpha-helices, a common feature among GTPases (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D folding that allows GPN3 to interact with Gpn1, forming a heterodimer with a large interaction surface (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based).

The quaternary structure of GPN3 is defined by its ability to form a heterodimer with Gpn1, which is essential for the nuclear import of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). This interaction is crucial for the stability and function of both proteins, affecting the assembly of the RNAPII holoenzyme (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). The protein's interaction surfaces are characterized by electrostatic complementarity, with Gpn3 having a predominantly negatively charged surface (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based).

## Function
GPN3, a member of the GPN-loop GTPase family, plays a crucial role in the nuclear import and assembly of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) in human cells. This protein is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of RNAP II, a process essential for transcriptional activity. GPN3, along with its paralogs GPN1 and GPN2, is necessary for the proper localization of RNAP II subunits, such as Rpb1 and Rpb2, into the nucleus (Carré2011Human; Calera2011ParcsGpn3).

GPN3 functions as part of a complex with GPN1, forming a heterodimer that is critical for their stability and function. This interaction is essential for the nuclear targeting of RNAP II, as mutations that disrupt the GPN1-GPN3 interaction impair RNAP II nuclear import (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based). The protein is active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the assembly of RNAP II subcomplexes into the holoenzyme, a process that occurs in the cytoplasm before nuclear import (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based).

The depletion of GPN3 results in the cytoplasmic retention of RNAP II subunits, highlighting its essential role in RNAP II biogenesis and function (Liu2020Npa3). This function is vital for maintaining proper gene expression and cellular proliferation, particularly in non-tumorigenic cells (Calera2011ParcsGpn3).

## Clinical Significance
The GPN3 gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of breast cancer. Alterations in GPN3 expression levels are associated with the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells. Studies have shown that GPN3 is essential for the proliferation of various breast cancer cell lines, including BT-474, SK-BR3, BT-20, and MCF7A. Suppression of GPN3 expression using shRNA leads to blocked proliferation and reduced cell numbers, indicating its critical role in cell growth (LaraChacón2019Gpn3). High GPN3 expression is linked to decreased overall survival in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and HER2-positive subtypes, suggesting its relevance for patient prognosis (LaraChacón2019Gpn3).

GPN3 also influences the subcellular distribution of the RNA polymerase II subunit Rpb1, with its suppression causing partial cytoplasmic retention of Rpb1. This effect is consistent across different cell transformation levels, although it is not the primary reason for its essentiality in cell proliferation (LaraChacón2019Gpn3). The gene's role in breast cancer stem cell proliferation is critical for tumor initiation and drug resistance, making it a potential target for cancer therapies (LaraChacón2019Gpn3). These findings highlight the potential of GPN3 as a molecular target for developing new antiproliferative therapies in breast cancer treatment.

## Interactions
GPN3, a member of the GPN-loop GTPase family, is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). GPN3 directly interacts with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RPB1 subunit of RNAPII, as well as with the RPB4 and RPB7 subunits. These interactions were confirmed through GST pulldown experiments, demonstrating that recombinant Flag-GPN3 can associate with GST-RPB4 and GST-RPB7 (Carré2011Human).

GPN3 also forms homo- or heterodimers with GPN1, which is consistent with their structural similarity. This dimerization is crucial for the assembly and nuclear localization of RNAPII. The Gpn1-Gpn3 heterodimer has been shown to form a dominant-negative protein complex, which can affect the assembly of RNAPII from intermediate subcomplexes, thereby preventing its nuclear import (Cristóbal‐Mondragón2019FRET‐based).

In addition to its interactions with RNAPII, GPN3 is involved in a multiprotein complex with Npa3 and Rba50, which is essential for RNAPII biogenesis. The stability of GPN3 and Npa3 protein levels is mutually dependent, highlighting their close functional relationship (Liu2020Npa3). These interactions underscore the critical role of GPN3 in the assembly and function of RNAPII.
