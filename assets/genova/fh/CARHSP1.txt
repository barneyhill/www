# CARHSP1

## Overview
CARHSP1, or calcium-regulated heat stable protein 1, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly under stress conditions. The protein belongs to the cold shock protein family and is characterized by its cold shock domain, which facilitates binding to RNA and DNA. This binding is crucial for its role in mRNA stability and regulation, especially in the context of inflammatory signaling pathways. CARHSP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it stabilizes tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA, thereby influencing mRNA degradation, transcription termination, and ribosomal translation. It is also a substrate for the calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin, linking it to calcium signaling pathways. The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating gene expression in response to environmental changes (Zhu2021Genomewide; Lindquist2018Cold).

## Function
CARHSP1, also known as calcium-regulated heat stable protein 1, is a multifunctional protein involved in mRNA stability and regulation, particularly under stress conditions. It is a member of the cold shock protein family and contains a cold shock domain that enables it to bind RNA and DNA, specifically targeting polypyrimidine regions of single-stranded RNA and DNA (Zhu2021Genomewide; Lindquist2018Cold). CARHSP1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA within P-bodies and exosomes, contributing to the regulation of mRNA stability and cellular stress responses (Lindquist2018Cold).

In healthy human cells, CARHSP1 is involved in the regulation of transcription termination, mRNA degradation, and ribosomal translation, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation (Zhu2021Genomewide). It is also implicated in calcium signaling pathways, as it was originally identified as a substrate of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin (Lindquist2018Cold). Through these molecular activities, CARHSP1 contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and modulating gene expression in response to environmental changes.

## Clinical Significance
CARHSP1 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in regulating mRNA stability and its interactions with inflammatory pathways. In glioblastoma (GBM), CARHSP1 is associated with radiation resistance. High expression levels of CARHSP1 correlate with poor survival outcomes in GBM patients undergoing radiotherapy. This resistance is thought to be mediated through the CARHSP1/TNF-α pathway, where CARHSP1 enhances the stability of TNF-α mRNA, promoting tumor progression and resistance to treatment (Zhu2021Genomewide).

In atherosclerosis, CARHSP1 is targeted by miR-155, which acts as an anti-inflammatory factor. miR-155 downregulates CARHSP1, leading to decreased TNF-α expression and reduced inflammation and foam cell formation. This interaction suggests that CARHSP1 plays a role in the inflammatory processes associated with atherosclerosis, and its regulation by miR-155 is crucial for modulating these effects (Li2016miR155).

Additionally, CARHSP1 has been identified in gene fusion events in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, specifically the USP7-CARHSP1 fusion, which has been observed in long-term survivors, although its clinical implications require further investigation (Garsed2022The).

## Interactions
CARHSP1, also known as calcium-regulated heat stable protein 1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, primarily focusing on mRNA stabilization. It binds to the AU-rich element (ARE) of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) 3′-untranslated region (UTR) through its cold shock domain (CSD), enhancing the stability of TNF-α mRNA. This interaction is crucial for mRNA translation, degradation, and stability (Zhu2021Genomewide; Li2016miR155).

CARHSP1 is also a substrate for the Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin (PP2B), which suggests its involvement in calcium signaling pathways (Lindquist2018Cold; Li2016miR155). In glioblastoma, CARHSP1 interacts with the 3′UTR of TNF-α, facilitating irradiation resistance by promoting TNF-α expression (Zhu2021Genomewide).

In the context of atherosclerosis, miR-155 targets CARHSP1, inhibiting its function and thereby reducing TNF-α mRNA stability. This interaction was validated using luciferase reporter assays, demonstrating that miR-155 binding to the 3′-UTR of CARHSP1 reduces luciferase activity, indicating a direct interaction (Li2016miR155). These interactions highlight CARHSP1's role in inflammatory signaling and its potential as a therapeutic target in related diseases.
