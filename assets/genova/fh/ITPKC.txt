# ITPKC

## Overview
The ITPKC gene encodes the enzyme inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase C, a kinase that plays a pivotal role in cellular calcium signaling pathways. This enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) to form inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), thereby modulating the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and influencing various cellular processes (Schell2010Inositol). ITPKC is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, spleen, and testis, and is particularly important in immune cells, where it regulates T-cell activation and immune responses (Scoumanne2016Specific). Genetic variations in ITPKC have been linked to Kawasaki disease, highlighting its clinical significance in immune regulation and disease susceptibility (Liu2023ITPKC; Alphonse2016InositolTriphosphate).

## Function
The ITPKC gene encodes the enzyme inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase C, which plays a crucial role in regulating calcium signaling pathways by phosphorylating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) to produce inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) (Schell2010Inositol). This conversion is essential for modulating the signaling functions of Ins(1,4,5)P3, effectively terminating its signal and thus regulating calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (Schell2010Inositol). 

In healthy human cells, ITPKC is involved in immune signaling, particularly in T cells, where it helps modulate their activation by influencing the levels of inositol phosphates. This regulation is vital for maintaining balanced immune responses and preventing excessive activation that could lead to autoimmune disorders (Schell2010Inositol). ITPKC's activity is crucial for proper immune function, as it prevents hyperactivation of calcineurin, a phosphatase that activates the transcription factor NFAT, which can lead to inappropriate immune responses (Schell2010Inositol).

ITPKC is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, spleen, and testis, where it may play roles in specialized cellular structures such as multicilia and microvilli (Scoumanne2016Specific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ITPKC gene are significantly associated with Kawasaki disease (KD), a condition characterized by acute vasculitis primarily affecting children. The ITPKC gene plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular calcium levels, which are essential for immune cell activation. Variations in this gene, particularly the presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs28493229 and rs7251246, have been linked to increased susceptibility to KD and the formation of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) (Liu2023ITPKC; Alphonse2016InositolTriphosphate).

The CC genotype of the rs28493229 SNP is associated with higher basal intracellular calcium levels and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1b and IL-18, contributing to inflammasome activation and poor response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in KD patients (Alphonse2016InositolTriphosphate). Similarly, the rs7251246 polymorphism is linked to CAA development and thrombosis risk, particularly in male children with KD (Liu2023ITPKC). These genetic variations in ITPKC affect T-cell activation and cytokine production, highlighting the gene's role in the pathogenesis and severity of Kawasaki disease (Onouchi2007ITPKC).
