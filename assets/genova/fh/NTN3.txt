# NTN3

## Overview
NTN3 is a gene that encodes the protein netrin-3, which is a member of the netrin family of proteins. Netrin-3 is primarily involved in axon guidance and cell migration, playing a pivotal role in the development of the nervous system. As a guidance cue, netrin-3 interacts with specific receptors such as DCC and UNC5, which mediate axonal attraction and repulsion, respectively, thereby influencing the direction of axonal growth and neuronal positioning (Wang1999Netrin3; Moore2024Netrins). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including sensory ganglia and mesenchymal cells, indicating its role in guiding peripheral axons to their targets (Wang1999Netrin3). Although netrin-3 shares functional similarities with netrin-1, it requires higher concentrations to exert its effects due to its lower affinity for the DCC receptor (Wang1999Netrin3). The expression patterns and receptor interactions of netrin-3 underscore its significance in neural development and the establishment of neural networks (Wang1999Netrin3).

## Function
Netrin-3 (NTN3) is a protein involved in axon guidance and cell migration, playing a crucial role in neural development. It is part of the netrin family, which is highly conserved across species and is known for directing cell and axon migration during development (Moore2024Netrins). Netrin-3 interacts with netrin receptors such as DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) and UNC5, which are involved in mediating axonal attraction and repulsion, respectively (Wang1999Netrin3; Moore2024Netrins). 

In the peripheral nervous system, netrin-3 is expressed in sensory ganglia and mesenchymal cells, suggesting its role in guiding peripheral axons to their targets (Wang1999Netrin3). It promotes axon outgrowth and exhibits chemorepulsive activity, similar to netrin-1, although it requires higher concentrations due to its lower affinity for DCC (Wang1999Netrin3). Netrin-3's expression in dorsal root ganglia and mesodermal cells indicates its involvement in axon guidance to peripheral targets (Moore2024Netrins). 

The protein's expression patterns and receptor interactions suggest that netrin-3 plays a significant role in axon guidance and neuronal development, contributing to the formation and maintenance of neural networks (Wang1999Netrin3).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
Netrin-3 (NTN3) is known to interact with several netrin receptors, including DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer), neogenin, and members of the UNC5 family (UNC5H1, UNC5H2, and UNC5H3). These interactions are crucial for its role in axon guidance and neural development. Netrin-3 binds to these receptors with varying affinities, showing a lower affinity for DCC compared to other receptors, which suggests a differential role in signaling pathways (Wang1999Netrin3). 

The binding of netrin-3 to these receptors can lead to the formation of signaling complexes that influence axonal growth and positioning. The interaction with DCC and UNC5 receptors is particularly significant, as these receptors mediate chemoattractive and chemorepulsive responses, respectively, which are essential for guiding axons to their correct targets during development (Moore2024Netrins). 

Netrin-3's ability to mimic some of the biological activities of netrin-1, such as promoting the outgrowth of spinal commissural axons and exhibiting chemorepulsive activity for trochlear motor axons, further underscores its functional interactions with these receptors (Wang1999Netrin3). However, specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature.
