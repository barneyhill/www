# VDAC2

## Overview
VDAC2, or Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 2, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This protein is integral to cellular homeostasis, primarily through its role in the transport of ions and metabolites across the mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for energy metabolism (Maurya2016Mitochondrial). VDAC2 is distinguished by its 19-stranded β-barrel structure and an N-terminal α-helical region, which contribute to its functional and structural properties (Maurya2016Mitochondrial; Gattin2014Solidstate). The protein is involved in regulating apoptosis by interacting with pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAK, and plays a role in calcium homeostasis, particularly in cardiac cells (Naghdi2016VDAC2specific; Cheng2003VDAC2). VDAC2's interactions and post-translational modifications are crucial for its function in neutralizing reactive oxygen species and maintaining mitochondrial integrity (Maurya2016VDAC‐2:). Its involvement in various cellular processes underscores its significance in health and disease, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Structure
VDAC2 is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein characterized by a 19-stranded β-barrel structure with an N-terminal α-helical region. This β-barrel forms the primary structural framework, facilitating the transport of ions and metabolites across the membrane (Maurya2016Mitochondrial; Gattin2014Solidstate). The N-terminal region of VDAC2 is 11 amino acids longer than that of VDAC1, contributing to its structural stability and potentially affecting protein interactions (Maurya2016VDAC‐2:; Gattin2014Solidstate).

The tertiary structure of VDAC2 involves the folding of the β-sheets into a stable cylindrical form, with the N-terminal α-helix positioned inside the pore, playing a crucial role in regulating metabolite flux (Schredelseker2014High). VDAC2 can form homo-oligomers, with evidence of dimer formation through specific β-strands, indicating a quaternary structure (Schredelseker2014High).

VDAC2 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as cysteine oxidation, which is significant for its role in neutralizing reactive oxygen species (Maurya2016VDAC‐2:). The gene encoding VDAC2 has multiple predicted splice variants, though their functional presence remains to be fully validated (Naghdi2016VDAC2specific).

## Function
VDAC2 (Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 2) is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating apoptosis in healthy human cells. It facilitates the transport of ions and metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane, which is essential for cellular energy metabolism (Maurya2016Mitochondrial). VDAC2 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis by interacting with pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAK. In healthy cells, VDAC2 binds to BAK, maintaining it in an inactive state and preventing its oligomerization, which is crucial for inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Maurya2016Mitochondrial; Cheng2003VDAC2).

VDAC2 also plays a role in calcium homeostasis, particularly in cardiac cells, where it facilitates the transfer of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria, thus maintaining proper cardiac function and preventing arrhythmic contractions (Naghdi2016VDAC2specific). Additionally, VDAC2 is involved in the neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS), protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage (Maurya2016Mitochondrial). These functions highlight VDAC2's importance in cellular processes and its role in preventing unnecessary cell death, thereby contributing to overall organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
VDAC2 is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in apoptosis and mitochondrial function. Alterations in VDAC2 expression or mutations can contribute to cancer development. In particular, VDAC2 is essential for BAX-mediated apoptosis, and its absence can lead to resistance against certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as venetoclax, used in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Chin2018VDAC2). In acute myeloid leukemia, the deletion of VDAC2, especially when combined with Bak deletion, accelerates tumor development, highlighting its tumor-suppressive role (Chin2018VDAC2).

VDAC2 is also involved in neurodegenerative disorders. In Alzheimer's disease, elevated VDAC2 levels are observed in the temporal cortex, potentially affecting apoptosis and ion transport (Maurya2016Mitochondrial). In Parkinson's disease, VDAC2 serves as a docking site for Parkin, a protein involved in mitophagy, and its deregulation can hinder Parkin's function, contributing to disease progression (Maurya2016Mitochondrial).

Additionally, VDAC2 is implicated in conditions like epilepsy, where altered levels contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased apoptosis (Maurya2016Mitochondrial). In familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), post-translational modifications of VDAC2 affect mitochondrial morphology and apoptosis (Maurya2016Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
VDAC2, a protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, is involved in various interactions that influence apoptosis and other cellular processes. It forms complexes with pro-apoptotic proteins Bak and Bax, which are part of the Bcl-2 family. VDAC2 is implicated in the recruitment and insertion of Bak into the outer mitochondrial membrane, a critical step in apoptosis. The interaction between VDAC2 and Bak is influenced by specific amino acid residues, such as Thr168 and Asp170, which are crucial for Bak recruitment and cell death (Naghdi2016VDAC2specific). 

VDAC2 also interacts with the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (stAR) to facilitate cholesterol transport for steroidogenesis and is involved in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, particularly in the heart (Naghdi2016VDAC2specific). Under oxidative stress, VDAC2 mediates the translocation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) to the outer mitochondrial membrane, promoting mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation (Naghdi2016VDAC2specific).

Mutations in VDAC2, such as VDAC2A172C, can stabilize the BAK–VDAC2 complex, thereby limiting BAK dissociation and apoptosis. This stabilization is evidenced by the enriched complex and reduced monomeric BAK on blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) (Yuan2024Key). These interactions highlight VDAC2's role in modulating apoptotic activity and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.
