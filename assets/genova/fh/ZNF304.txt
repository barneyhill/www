# ZNF304

## Overview
ZNF304 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 304, a transcription factor characterized by its Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and multiple C2H2 zinc finger motifs. This protein is primarily involved in transcriptional regulation, acting as a repressor by binding to specific DNA sequences and modulating the expression of target genes (Sabater2002Identification). ZNF304 is expressed in various human tissues, with notable activity in lymphoid tissues, where it may play a role in immune response regulation by influencing cytokine production and mRNA stability (Sabater2002Identification). Additionally, ZNF304 is implicated in the transcriptional silencing of HIV-1, interacting with proteins such as TRIM28 to recruit repressive complexes to the HIV promoter, thereby maintaining viral latency (Krasnopolsky2020Genomewide). The gene's expression and interactions have clinical significance, particularly in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and HIV latency, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Aslan2015The; Krasnopolsky2020Genomewide).

## Function
ZNF304 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcription factor, primarily active in the nucleus where it modulates transcriptional activity. It contains a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and multiple C2H2 zinc finger units, which enable it to bind DNA and influence the expression of target genes (Sabater2002Identification). The KRAB domain is known to act as a potent repressor, suggesting that ZNF304 may play a role in transcriptional repression (Sabater2002Identification).

In healthy human cells, ZNF304 is expressed in various tissues, with notably higher expression in lymphoid tissues. Its expression is low in certain cell lines but increases significantly in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) when stimulated, paralleling the expression of cytokines such as IFN-c, IL-4, and IL-10. This pattern suggests that ZNF304 may be involved in regulating lymphocyte activation and potentially plays a role in early cytokine production or induction at the transcriptional level (Sabater2002Identification). The presence of class II AU-rich elements in ZNF304, which are common in cytokine mRNAs, indicates a role in influencing mRNA stability, further supporting its involvement in immune response regulation (Sabater2002Identification).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF304 has been implicated in several diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), ZNF304 is upregulated and associated with poor patient survival. High expression levels of ZNF304 correlate with increased cancer cell invasion and resistance to anoikis, a form of programmed cell death. Patients with elevated ZNF304 expression have significantly lower median overall survival compared to those with low expression levels, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker in ovarian cancer (Aslan2015The).

In the context of HIV, ZNF304 plays a crucial role in maintaining viral latency by silencing HIV gene transcription. It achieves this by recruiting repressive complexes to the HIV promoter, leading to the deposition of repressive histone marks. Depletion of ZNF304 results in increased HIV transcription, suggesting its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies aimed at reactivating latent HIV (Krasnopolsky2020Genomewide).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of ZNF304 in both cancer and viral latency, suggesting that targeting its expression or interactions could offer new therapeutic avenues (Aslan2015The).

## Interactions
ZNF304 is a KRAB-containing zinc finger protein that plays a significant role in the transcriptional silencing of HIV-1 by interacting with various proteins. It recruits the host repressive complex to the HIV promoter, leading to the enrichment of histone heterochromatin marks such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119Ub, which are associated with transcriptional repression (Krasnopolsky2020Genomewide). ZNF304 interacts with TRIM28, a protein that serves as a scaffold for recruiting heterochromatin-inducing lysine histone methyltransferases like SETDB1, facilitating the recruitment of repressive complexes such as the polycomb repression complex (PRC) to the HIV promoter (Krasnopolsky2020Genomewide). 

ZNF304's interaction with TRIM28 has been demonstrated through immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells, confirming the association between ZNF304 and TRIM28, as well as between TRIM28 and EZH2, a component of the PRC2 complex (Krasnopolsky2020Genomewide). The depletion of ZNF304 results in reduced occupancy of TRIM28 and SETDB1 on the HIV promoter, indicating that ZNF304 is crucial for recruiting these proteins to mediate silencing (Krasnopolsky2020Genomewide; Srivastava2023Genomewide). These interactions underscore the functional significance of the ZNF304-TRIM28-PRC protein network in maintaining HIV latency (Krasnopolsky2020Genomewide).
