# KMO

## Overview
Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is a gene that encodes the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the kynurenine pathway, which is the primary metabolic route for tryptophan catabolism in mammals. KMO is categorized as a Class A flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylase and is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, with notable expression in the brain's microglia and infiltrating macrophages (Hughes2022The; Smith2016Kynurenine3monooxygenase:). The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of L-kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine, a reaction that is crucial for regulating immune responses and maintaining the balance of neuroactive metabolites. KMO's activity is linked to various physiological and pathological processes, including mitochondrial dynamics and neurodegenerative diseases, making it a significant target for therapeutic interventions (Maddison2020A; Wilson2016Overexpression).

## Structure
Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent monooxygenase involved in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism. The primary structure of KMO includes a sequence of amino acids that form a polypeptide chain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Smith2016Kynurenine3monooxygenase:). The secondary structure of KMO consists of alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to its overall stability and function (Mimasu2021Fulllength).

The tertiary structure of KMO is characterized by a three-dimensional folding that includes a Rossmann fold, essential for FAD binding, and a substrate-binding pocket located at the bottom of a deep groove (Gao2018Biochemistry). This structure is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity, as it facilitates the binding of substrates and inhibitors (Amaral2013Structural).

KMO forms a quaternary structure as a dimer, with dimerization being essential for its catalytic activity. Mutations at the dimer interface can abolish enzyme function, indicating the importance of this structural arrangement (Mimasu2021Fulllength). The enzyme is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, and its activity is linked to various neurodegenerative diseases (Amaral2013Structural).

## Function
Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is a crucial enzyme in the kynurenine pathway, which is the primary route for tryptophan metabolism in mammals. KMO catalyzes the conversion of L-kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine, a process that is significant for regulating inflammation and the immune adaptive response (Wilson2016Overexpression). This enzyme is a flavin-dependent hydroxylase and is characterized as a Class A flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylase (Hughes2022The). KMO is primarily expressed in the liver and kidney, with lower expression levels in the brain, particularly in microglia and infiltrating macrophages (Smith2016Kynurenine3monooxygenase:).

In healthy human cells, KMO plays a role in maintaining the balance of kynurenine pathway metabolites, which can have neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects depending on their concentrations (Smith2016Kynurenine3monooxygenase:). The enzyme's activity is crucial for cellular protection against 3-hydroxykynurenine-mediated cytotoxicity, which can lead to apoptosis through mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibition (Wilson2016Overexpression). KMO's function is also linked to mitochondrial dynamics, where it influences mitochondrial fission processes, potentially through interactions with proteins like DRP1 (Maddison2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in the kynurenine pathway. Alterations in KMO expression or function are linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. In these conditions, increased KMO activity leads to elevated levels of neurotoxic metabolites like quinolinic acid, contributing to neurodegeneration and excitotoxicity (Lu2020Kynurenine‐3‐monooxygenase:; Amaral2013The). KMO inhibitors have shown potential in reducing neurodegeneration by modulating these metabolite levels (Amaral2013The).

In psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, KMO polymorphisms are associated with decreased gene expression and increased kynurenic acid concentrations, which may contribute to cognitive disruptions (Parrott2015Kynurenine). KMO is also linked to cancer, particularly breast cancer, where high KMO expression correlates with poor prognosis and increased tumor growth and metastasis (Lai2021Surface; Tsang2021Integrated).

In autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, KMO expression changes are associated with chronic inflammation, as seen in diabetes-related proteinuria and ischemia-reperfusion injury (Boros2019Immunomodulatory). These findings highlight KMO as a potential therapeutic target across a range of diseases.

## Interactions
Kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is involved in several interactions that influence mitochondrial dynamics and function. KMO is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and interacts with dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a key regulator of mitochondrial fission. KMO modulates the phosphorylation status of DRP1, particularly at serine residues Ser616 and Ser637. Phosphorylation at Ser616 enhances DRP1 activity, promoting mitochondrial fission, while phosphorylation at Ser637 inhibits it. Overexpression of KMO in HEK 293T cells decreases phosphorylation at Ser637, thereby promoting mitochondrial fission (Maddison2020A).

KMO also interacts genetically with Parkinson's disease-associated genes Pink1 and parkin, as well as the mitochondrial fission gene Drp1. These interactions suggest that KMO is involved in mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, crucial for maintaining mitochondrial health (Maddison2020A). In Drosophila, KMO overexpression can rescue phenotypes associated with Pink1 and parkin mutations, indicating a role in the PINK1/PRKN-mediated mitophagy pathway (Maddison2020A).

These interactions highlight KMO's potential as a therapeutic target for diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction, such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases (Maddison2020A).
