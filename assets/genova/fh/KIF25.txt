# KIF25

## Overview
KIF25 is a gene that encodes the protein kinesin family member 25, which is part of the kinesin-14 family of motor proteins. This protein is characterized by its unique C-terminal motor domain, which facilitates its role in intracellular transport and spindle orientation by enabling ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding (Decarreau2017The; Camlin2017Motoring). Kinesin family member 25 is a tetrameric protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining centrosome integrity and proper spindle orientation during cell division by suppressing premature centrosome separation (Decarreau2017The). It is involved in various cellular processes, including antagonizing the activity of Eg5, a motor protein that promotes centrosome separation, and interacting with proteins such as CEP170 and WDR62 at the centrosomes (Decarreau2017The; Liu2019Epistatic). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to several diseases, including cancer and Kawasaki disease, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Buda2021Association; Park2022Comprehensive).

## Structure
KIF25 is a tetrameric kinesin-14 motor protein with a molecular weight of 404 kDa, indicating its quaternary structure as a tetramer (Decarreau2017The). The protein is characterized by a bipolar tetramer structure, similar to kinesin-5 motors, as revealed by electron microscopy (Decarreau2017The). KIF25 contains a C-terminal motor domain, which is a distinctive feature of the kinesin-14 family, contrasting with other kinesins that typically have an N-terminal motor domain (Camlin2017Motoring). This motor domain is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding, essential for its function in intracellular transport and spindle orientation (Decarreau2017The).

KIF25's ability to crosslink microtubules and translocate toward the minus-end of microtubules is crucial for its role in suppressing premature centrosome separation during interphase (Decarreau2017The). The protein forms a ring-like structure at the centrosome, suggesting a structural role in centrosome linkage (Decarreau2017The). While specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variants of KIF25 are not provided, its unique function in centrosome tethering distinguishes it from other kinesin-14 family members (Decarreau2017The).

## Function
KIF25, a tetrameric kinesin motor protein, plays a critical role in maintaining proper spindle orientation during cell division by suppressing premature centrosome separation. This function is essential for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and maintaining genomic stability. KIF25 is localized at the centrosome throughout the cell cycle and is involved in tethering duplicated centrosomes together during interphase, a process dependent on microtubules (Decarreau2017The). By antagonizing the activity of Eg5, a motor protein that promotes centrosome separation, KIF25 maintains centrosome coupling and prevents eccentric nuclear positioning, which is crucial for the symmetrical establishment of the cortical force generation machinery (Decarreau2017The).

KIF25's activity is necessary to keep the nucleus centered, ensuring stable spindle orientation at the onset of mitosis. Loss of KIF25 results in increased centrosome separation, spindle oscillations, and misorientation, which can lead to errors in cell division (Decarreau2017The). KIF25 functions independently of the canonical centrosome separation signaling pathway, highlighting its unique role in centrosome integrity and spindle orientation (Decarreau2017The). This protein is expressed at low levels in various human tissues and is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the mitotic spindle (Decarreau2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KIF25 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of cancer, KIF25 is involved in microtubule-dependent intracellular transport and chromosome movement during cell division. Its activity has been observed in various cancer types, where it is associated with chromatid segregation and cancer cell proliferation (Park2022Comprehensive). In glioma, KIF25 is one of the kinesin family members found to have decreased expression in tumor samples compared to normal samples, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression (Pan2023Identification).

KIF25 has also been linked to Kawasaki disease, a condition characterized by inflammation of blood vessels and presenting oral features such as redness and swelling of the lips and tongue. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the KIF25 gene, rs146732504, was found to be more common in children with Kawasaki disease, although its specific function in the disease context remains undetermined (Buda2021Association). Despite these associations, the precise clinical significance of KIF25 mutations in these diseases requires further investigation to fully understand its role and potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
KIF25, a member of the kinesin superfamily, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It is known to antagonize Eg5, a motor protein that drives centrosome separation, by tethering duplicated centrosomes together, a process dependent on microtubules (Decarreau2017The). KIF25 also interacts with proteins at the centrosomes, such as CEP170 and WDR62, which are common binding partners (Liu2019Epistatic). These interactions are crucial for its role in suppressing Golgi fragmentation and maintaining Golgi structure, particularly in the context of CATCHR-dependent and independent Golgi trafficking events (Liu2019Epistatic).

KIF25's role in centrosome tethering is distinct from other kinesin-14 functions, highlighting its unique function in maintaining spindle orientation during cell division (Decarreau2017The). The protein's ability to crosslink microtubules and translocate toward the minus-end with specific run length and velocity further supports its involvement in microtubule dynamics (Decarreau2017The). While specific interactions with nucleic acids are not detailed in the provided context, KIF25's interactions with other proteins underscore its significance in cellular organization and function.
