# ABTB3

## Overview
The ABTB3 gene encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and BTB domain containing 3, which is a member of the BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-Ã -brac) domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions, and a BTB domain, which is involved in protein complex formation and regulation of various cellular processes. The ABTB3 protein plays a role in cellular signaling pathways and may be implicated in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Its function and interactions suggest potential involvement in oncogenic processes, although further research is needed to fully elucidate its role in cancer biology (Qiu2020aarFDC).
