# GUK1

## Overview
Guanylate kinase 1 (GUK1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme guanylate kinase 1, a crucial component in guanine nucleotide metabolism. This enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP), a reaction essential for maintaining the balance of guanine nucleotides within the cell. As a kinase, GUK1 plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes, including DNA and RNA synthesis, and is involved in the metabolic activation of nucleoside analog prodrugs used in treating diseases such as leukemia and viral infections (Panayiotou2014The; Khan2024Biochemical). The enzyme is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is integral to the cGMP cycle, which is vital for signal transduction pathways (Fitzgibbon1996Human). GUK1's structural features, including its guanylate kinase domain, facilitate its catalytic function and interaction with therapeutic agents, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular functions and clinical applications (Jain2015Insights).

## Structure
The human guanylate kinase 1 (GUK1) protein is an enzyme involved in guanine nucleotide metabolism, specifically catalyzing the conversion of GMP to GDP. The primary structure of GUK1 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the enzyme's stability and function (Jain2015Insights).

The tertiary structure of GUK1 is characterized by a guanylate kinase domain, which is crucial for its catalytic activity. This domain includes a phosphate-binding loop (P-loop), an NMP-binding domain (NMP-BD), a LID domain, and a CORE domain, all interconnected by dynamic hinges. These structural features allow for significant conformational changes upon substrate binding, transitioning from an open to a closed form (Jain2015Insights).

GUK1 does not exhibit a quaternary structure as it remains monomeric across different conformations (Jain2015Insights). The enzyme's structural plasticity is essential for its catalytic function and interaction with therapeutic agents, such as antiviral and anticancer prodrugs (Jain2015Insights). There is no specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms in the provided context.

## Function
Guanylate kinase 1 (GUK1) is an essential enzyme involved in guanine nucleotide metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) using ATP as a phosphate donor (Panayiotou2014The; Khan2024Biochemical). This reaction is crucial for maintaining the balance of guanine nucleotides, which are vital for various cellular processes, including DNA and RNA synthesis, impacting cell proliferation and growth (Panayiotou2014The; Khan2024Biochemical). GUK1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a significant role in the cGMP cycle, which is essential for signal transduction pathways (Fitzgibbon1996Human; Khan2024Biochemical).

GUK1 is also involved in the metabolic activation of nucleoside analog prodrugs, which are used in the treatment of various diseases, including leukemia and viral infections (Khan2024Biochemical). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the phosphorylation of these prodrugs, enabling their incorporation into nucleic acids and enhancing their therapeutic efficacy (Khan2024Biochemical). The ubiquitous expression of GUK1 mRNA reflects its role as a housekeeping gene, essential for maintaining cellular nucleotide pools and supporting normal cellular functions (Panayiotou2014The).

## Clinical Significance
GUK1 (guanylate kinase 1) has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in nucleotide metabolism. In sepsis, low expression levels of GUK1 have been associated with improved survival rates, suggesting that reduced GUK1 expression may be beneficial for sepsis prognosis. This finding highlights its potential as a biomarker for targeted therapy and prognostic prediction in sepsis patients (ShilinLi2024Identification).

In the context of aging, studies on yeast have shown that mutations in GUK1, which lower its enzymatic activity, can extend the replicative lifespan. This suggests that reduced GDP levels, resulting from decreased GUK1 activity, may contribute to lifespan extension, indicating a potential therapeutic target for aging-related diseases (Liu2020Characterization).

GUK1 has also been identified as a hub gene in bladder cancer, with differential expression observed between normal and cancerous tissues. This suggests its potential role as a prognostic marker in bladder cancer, although specific clinical implications of GUK1 mutations or expression changes in this context remain to be fully elucidated (Wu2023Development).
