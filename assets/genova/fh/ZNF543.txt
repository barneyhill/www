# ZNF543

## Overview
ZNF543 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 543, a member of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger protein family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, characterized by its zinc finger motifs that facilitate binding to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. ZNF543 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it plays a crucial role in modulating the transcriptional activity of various target genes, influencing cellular processes such as DNA transcription regulation, cell differentiation, and development. The gene has garnered interest for its potential involvement in the regulation of the TRIM28 gene, particularly in the context of Parkinson's disease, where it may impact mitochondrial function and contribute to disease pathogenesis (Jansen2017Discovery; Hashemabadi2022CRISPRCas9Mediated).

## Function
ZNF543, a member of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor in healthy human cells. These proteins are characterized by zinc finger motifs that enable them to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby regulating gene expression. ZNF543 is typically active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcriptional activity of target genes, impacting various cellular processes such as DNA transcription regulation, cell differentiation, and development (Hashemabadi2022CRISPRCas9Mediated).

The role of ZNF543 in gene expression is particularly significant due to its potential regulatory function. It is hypothesized to act as a transcription factor for the TRIM28 gene, a relationship explored in the context of Parkinson's disease. In studies using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out the ZNF543 gene in human neuroblastoma cells, a significant increase in TRIM28 gene expression was observed, suggesting that ZNF543 may regulate TRIM28 expression (Hashemabadi2022CRISPRCas9Mediated). This regulatory activity highlights the importance of ZNF543 in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in disease mechanisms. However, specific details about its function in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated (Hashemabadi2022CRISPRCas9Mediated).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF543 has been identified as a candidate gene potentially involved in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although direct evidence of its function in PD is lacking, its genetic location and effects on PD pathogenesis suggest a possible role. Research indicates that ZNF543 may act as a transcription factor for the TRIM28 gene, which is implicated in PD. In a study using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out the ZNF543 gene in a human neuroblastoma cell line, a significant increase in TRIM28 gene expression was observed, suggesting a regulatory relationship. This finding provides insight into how ZNF543 mutations might contribute to PD pathogenicity (Hashemabadi2022CRISPRCas9Mediated).

Additionally, knocking down ZNF543 results in a decrease in mitochondrial number per cell, indicating its role in PD pathology. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a known factor in PD, and ZNF543 has been identified to significantly modify Parkin translocation, which is related to mitochondrial function in PD (Jansen2017Discovery). These findings suggest that alterations in ZNF543 expression or mutations could impact mitochondrial health and contribute to the development of PD. The research highlights the potential clinical significance of ZNF543 in understanding and potentially targeting PD mechanisms (Hashemabadi2022CRISPRCas9Mediated).
