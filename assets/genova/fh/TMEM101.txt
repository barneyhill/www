# TMEM101

## Overview
TMEM101 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 101, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, indicating its role in spanning the cellular membrane and potentially participating in signaling pathways or transport mechanisms. The precise functions of TMEM101 are still under investigation, but it is known to play a role in cellular signaling and may be implicated in certain pathways, such as the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the interactions and clinical significance of TMEM101 could provide insights into its potential roles in health and disease.
