# BTNL9

## Overview
BTNL9, or butyrophilin-like 9, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the butyrophilin family, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The protein, also referred to as butyrophilin-like 9, is primarily involved in immune regulation and is categorized as a transmembrane protein due to its localization in the cell membrane. It shares structural similarities with B7-like molecules, which are known to play crucial roles in modulating T cell immune responses (Xu2021Prognostic; Malinowska2017Butyrophilins:). BTNL9 is expressed in various immune cells and epithelial tissues, where it contributes to immune cell interactions and signaling pathways. Its expression levels and functional roles have been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its potential as a tumor suppressor and prognostic biomarker (Zhang2023Comprehensive; Ma2021Butyrophilinlike).

## Structure


## Function
BTNL9, or butyrophilin-like 9, is a protein that plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly through its involvement in T cell modulation. It is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and shares structural similarities with B7-like molecules, which are known to regulate T cell immune responses (Malinowska2017Butyrophilins:; Xu2021Prognostic). BTNL9 is expressed in various immune cells, including B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, and is predominantly located in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (Zhang2023Comprehensive; Xu2021Prognostic).

In healthy human cells, BTNL9 is involved in modulating immune responses, potentially through interactions with immune checkpoints and influencing immune cell infiltration (Xu2021Prognostic). It is thought to activate γδT cells, which have tumor-suppressive effects by producing cytokines and chemokines, presenting and regulating antigens, and exerting direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells (Xu2021Prognostic). The protein's expression is generally lower in pancreatic acinar cells, indicating a specific role in certain epithelial tissues (Xu2021Prognostic). BTNL9's involvement in immune-related pathways suggests its significance in maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing malignant transformations (Zhang2023Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BTNL9 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), BTNL9 expression is significantly lower in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. High expression of BTNL9 is associated with improved overall survival, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor. BTNL9 is negatively correlated with tumor mutation burden and tumor purity, while positively correlated with immune scores and the presence of immune cells such as B cells and CD4+ T cells. This indicates that BTNL9 may promote an antitumor immune response in LUAD (Ma2020Butyrophilinlike; Ma2021Butyrophilinlike).

In breast cancer, BTNL9 is frequently downregulated, and its low expression is linked to early progression, poor overall survival, and relapse-free survival. BTNL9 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and metastasis, and inducing apoptosis through pathways involving P53/CDC25C and P53/GADD45 (Mo2021BTNL9).

In thyroid cancer, BTNL9 expression is downregulated and associated with poorer progression-free intervals. It is involved in immune-related pathways, and its expression correlates with immune cell infiltrations and immune checkpoint genes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Zhang2023Comprehensive).
