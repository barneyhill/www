# SMIM17

## Overview
SMIM17, or small integral membrane protein 17, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular processes that occur across the cell membrane. Transmembrane proteins like SMIM17 often play critical roles in signaling pathways, transport, and cellular communication. While the specific functions and interactions of SMIM17 are still under investigation, its structural characteristics imply a potential role in maintaining cellular integrity and facilitating communication between the intracellular and extracellular environments. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise biological functions and clinical significance of SMIM17.
