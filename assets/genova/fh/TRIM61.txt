# TRIM61

## Overview
TRIM61, or tripartite motif containing 61, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, which is characterized by the presence of a RING finger, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. The TRIM61 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and immune response modulation. It has been implicated in several diseases, notably in cancer and autoimmune disorders, due to its role in cellular signaling pathways and gene regulation. The protein's involvement in these processes makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions and a candidate for biomarker development in disease prognosis and treatment (Brčić2019Genomewide; Han2019Monitoring; Hu2022Comprehensive).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TRIM61 has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in gene expression and mutation. In hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TRIM61 is upregulated and identified as a mutation driver gene, suggesting its involvement in HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. This upregulation is linked to immune response regulation and cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in HBV-positive HCC (Hu2022Comprehensive).

In lung squamous cell cancer (LUSC), TRIM61 is identified as a methylation-driven gene with significant prognostic implications. The methylation status of TRIM61 correlates with patient survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Alterations in its methylation and expression levels are associated with clinical outcomes, suggesting that TRIM61 could serve as a target for future therapies in LUSC (Han2019Monitoring).

Additionally, genetic variants near TRIM61 have been associated with thyroid autoimmunity in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, indicating a possible link between TRIM61 and autoimmune conditions. These variants are also connected to other complex traits, such as insulin resistance and female-specific cancers, suggesting a broader role for TRIM61 in various disease processes (Brčić2019Genomewide).
