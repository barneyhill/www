# PLA2G6

## Overview
The PLA2G6 gene encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group VI, also known as calcium-independent phospholipase A2 beta (iPLA2β), which is a crucial component of phospholipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a phospholipase and is involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids, playing a significant role in membrane remodeling and signal transduction (Engel2010Catalytic). iPLA2β is characterized by a catalytic domain and ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate its interaction with membrane proteins and regulate its enzymatic activity (Khan2023The; Malley2018The). The enzyme is essential for maintaining phospholipid homeostasis and is implicated in various cellular processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation, and neuronal survival (Nadalin2019Association; Iannello2017A). Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene are associated with a range of neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Guo2018PLA2G6Associated).

## Structure
The PLA2G6 gene encodes the calcium-independent phospholipase A2 beta (iPLA2β), which is involved in phospholipid metabolism. The protein structure is characterized by a catalytic domain and ankyrin repeat domains. The catalytic domain forms a dimer with a large hydrophobic interface, crucial for its enzymatic activity (Khan2023The; Malley2018The). The active site contains a Ser465/Asp598 dyad, and the dimerization interface involves three α-helices, several loops, and part of the central β-sheet (Khan2023The; Malley2018The).

The ankyrin repeat domains, consisting of nine repeats, are oriented to interact with membrane proteins and contain an ATP-binding site, which may regulate the enzyme's activity (Khan2023The; Malley2018The). These repeats form a helix-turn-helix structure, contributing to the protein's L-shaped conformation (Malley2018The).

iPLA2β lacks transmembrane domains but is enriched in protein-interaction motifs, including proline-rich loops (Malley2018The). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its function and localization (Malley2018The). Multiple splice variants of iPLA2β exist, affecting its functional roles in cellular processes (Malley2018The).

## Function
The PLA2G6 gene encodes the enzyme phospholipase A2 group VI, also known as calcium-independent phospholipase A2 beta (iPLA2β), which plays a critical role in maintaining phospholipid homeostasis in healthy human cells. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl chain of phospholipids, leading to the production of free fatty acids and lysophospholipids, essential for membrane remodeling and signal transduction (Engel2010Catalytic). The enzyme's activity is crucial for converting phosphatidylcholine (PC) to free fatty acids and glycerophosphocholine (GPC), maintaining constant PC levels even when synthesis is increased (Engel2010Catalytic).

PLA2G6 is also implicated in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism, which is vital for lipid synthesis and catabolic pathways like fatty acid beta-oxidation (Engel2010Catalytic). It plays a significant role in the nervous system, particularly in maintaining membrane homeostasis and ensuring neuronal survival, thus preventing axonal degeneration (Iannello2017A). The enzyme is active in the cytosol and associated with cellular membranes, impacting processes such as inflammation and cell proliferation (Nadalin2019Association). Proper functioning of PLA2G6 is essential for preventing the accumulation of phospholipid substrates and ensuring adequate production of fatty acids, which are vital for various cellular processes (Engel2010Catalytic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLA2G6 gene are linked to a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN). These disorders include infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy (ANAD), dystonia-parkinsonism (DP), and autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism (AREP) (Guo2018PLA2G6Associated; Wan2022Novel). INAD is characterized by early onset, typically within the first two years of life, and presents with progressive motor and mental deterioration, cerebellar atrophy, and abnormal iron deposition in the brain (Khateeb2006PLA2G6). ANAD manifests later in childhood with slower progression and variable symptoms, including cerebellar signs and gait abnormalities (Wan2022Novel; Gregory2008Neurodegeneration).

In adults, PLA2G6 mutations can lead to dystonia-parkinsonism, characterized by parkinsonian symptoms such as bradykinesia and tremors, without cerebellar atrophy or iron deposition (Guo2018PLA2G6Associated). These mutations are also associated with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA), where excessive iron deposition in the brain leads to symptoms like rigidity and sensorimotor impairment (Dastsooz2017Novel). The clinical variability in PLAN is significant, with age of onset and clinical manifestations being key distinguishing factors (Guo2018PLA2G6Associated).

## Interactions
PLA2G6, also known as phospholipase A2 group VI, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with retromer subunits Vps35 and Vps26, enhancing their function in protein and lipid recycling. The loss of PLA2G6 impairs retromer function, leading to increased ceramide levels and neurodegeneration (Lin2018Phospholipase; Murakami2020Updating). PLA2G6 can form a complex with Vps26 and Vps35, as shown by immunoprecipitation assays, indicating an evolutionarily conserved interaction (Lin2018Phospholipase).

PLA2G6 also interacts with calmodulin, which can allosterically inhibit its activity by altering the conformation of the dimer interface (Murakami2020Updating). This interaction highlights its regulatory role in cellular signaling pathways. Additionally, PLA2G6 is involved in the generation of arachidonic acid, which is crucial for the activation of NADPH oxidases and subsequent superoxide production, especially in diabetic conditions (Turk2019iPLA2β).

These interactions underscore the importance of PLA2G6 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and metabolic diseases.
