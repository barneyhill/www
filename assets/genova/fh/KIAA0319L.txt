# KIAA0319L

## Overview
KIAA0319L is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycosylated protein involved in neuronal development and function. The protein, characterized by its large extracellular domain and small cytosolic tail, resembles transmembrane receptors and contains immunoglobulin-like domains linked to cell adhesion (Guidi2018AU040320). It plays a crucial role in processes such as neuronal migration and axon guidance, interacting with proteins like the Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1) to influence axonal guidance within the cerebral cortex (Poon2010DyslexiaAssociated). KIAA0319L is expressed in various brain regions, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as developmental dyslexia and periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH) (Platt2013Embryonic). The gene's disruption can affect neuronal positioning and cognitive functions, underscoring its significance in maintaining normal brain development (Couto2008The).

## Structure
The KIAA0319L protein is a transmembrane glycosylated protein characterized by a large extracellular/luminal domain and a small C-terminal cytosolic tail, resembling transmembrane receptors (Guidi2018AU040320). It contains five immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains of the PKD family in its ectodomain, which are linked to cell adhesion (Guidi2018AU040320). These PKD domains are structurally significant, as they are involved in interactions with other proteins, such as the Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), which may have implications for axon guidance (Poon2010DyslexiaAssociated).

The protein is highly glycosylated, a common post-translational modification that can affect its function and localization (Guidi2018AU040320). KIAA0319L is also involved in intracellular trafficking, interacting with adaptor proteins AP-1 and AP-2 (Guidi2018AU040320). The protein's structure includes a MANEC domain and shares structural similarities with the cellular AAV receptor (AAVR), although KIAA0319L itself does not facilitate AAV2 transduction (Pillay2017Adeno-associated). The protein's molecular structure is highly conserved between humans and mice, as indicated by the high degree of identity in specific regions (Guidi2018AU040320).

## Function
KIAA0319L is a gene implicated in neuronal development and function, particularly in processes such as neuronal migration and axon guidance. The protein encoded by KIAA0319L is involved in cell adhesion and signaling pathways, which are crucial for proper brain development and cognitive functions. It interacts with the axon guidance protein Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), suggesting a role in axonal guidance within the cerebral cortex (Platt2013Embryonic). KIAA0319L is expressed in specific layers of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus, and olfactory bulb, indicating its involvement in neuronal migration (Platt2013Embryonic).

In healthy human cells, KIAA0319L is primarily active in the plasma membrane, where it may contribute to the structural and functional integrity of neuronal circuits. The gene's disruption has been associated with neuronal migration disorders, such as periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH), highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal positioning during brain development (Platt2013Embryonic). The protein's role in these processes underscores its potential impact on neurodevelopmental disorders, including developmental dyslexia, where it may influence reading abilities and related cognitive functions (Couto2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KIAA0319L gene have been implicated in developmental dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in reading. Studies have shown that disruptions in KIAA0319L can lead to neuronal migration disorders, such as periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH), which is associated with an increased incidence of dyslexia (Platt2013Embryonic). The gene's interaction with the axon guidance protein Nogo receptor 1 suggests a role in axonal guidance and neuronal migration, processes that are critical for proper brain development (Platt2013Embryonic).

Research has also identified associations between KIAA0319L genetic variants and reading disabilities. A study found a haplotype associated with reading disabilities and quantitative measures of reading components, although the results were not significant after correction for multiple testing (Couto2008The). Additionally, KIAA0319L variants have been linked to developmental dyslexia in a Chinese population, highlighting the gene's potential role in neural migration and neurite growth (Shao2015The). These findings suggest that KIAA0319L may contribute to the genetic basis of dyslexia and related cognitive disorders.

## Interactions
KIAA0319L, a gene associated with dyslexia, encodes a protein that interacts with the axon guidance receptor Nogo Receptor 1 (NgR1). This interaction was identified using yeast two-hybrid screens and confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation assays, demonstrating that KIAA0319L and NgR1 form a protein complex. These interactions predominantly occur in the cytoplasmic granules of cortical neurons in the human brain cortex, suggesting a functional role in axon guidance and neuronal plasticity (Poon2010DyslexiaAssociated).

The study of KIAA0319L's interactions with NgR1 provides insights into its potential involvement in axonal growth inhibition, a critical process in the development of the nervous system. Immunohistochemistry on human brain tissue showed colocalization of KIAA0319L and NgR1 in specific neuronal structures, supporting the hypothesis of their functional interaction in the human brain cortex (Poon2010DyslexiaAssociated).

These findings highlight the importance of understanding the molecular interactions of KIAA0319L to gain insights into its potential roles in dyslexia and other neurological conditions. The interaction with NgR1 suggests that KIAA0319L may play a role in modulating neuronal connectivity and plasticity, which are crucial for cognitive functions (Poon2010DyslexiaAssociated).
