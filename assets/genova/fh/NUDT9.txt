# NUDT9

## Overview
The NUDT9 gene encodes the protein nudix hydrolase 9, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, which is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose into AMP and ribose 5'-phosphate. This enzymatic activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic metabolites. Nudix hydrolase 9 is predominantly localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in regulating mitochondrial function and energy balance. The protein's activity is modulated by oxidative conditions and is essential for calcium signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with TRPM2 channels. NUDT9 has been implicated in various clinical contexts, including gout and cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target (Perraud2003NUDT9; Kulikova2020Role; Lee2019Integrative).

## Structure
The NUDT9 protein is a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, characterized by its ability to hydrolyze ADP-ribose into AMP and ribose 5'-phosphate. Structurally, NUDT9 consists of a 105-residue N-terminal domain and a 179-residue C-terminal catalytic domain, with an eight-residue extended coil at the C terminus (Shen2003The). The N-terminal domain features a novel protein fold with three β-hairpins and three single-turn helices within a network of loops, while the C-terminal domain forms a mixed α/β fold similar to other Nudix enzymes, containing a four-stranded β-sheet and a three-stranded β-sheet connected by a P-loop (Shen2003The). The catalytic domain includes a Nudix consensus sequence, forming a loop-helix-loop motif crucial for its enzymatic activity (Shen2003The).

NUDT9 is active as a monomer in solution, although it forms a non-physiological dimer in the crystal lattice (Shen2003The). The protein undergoes significant conformational changes upon ligand binding, leading to a more compact structure, as evidenced by a decrease in the maximum dimension from 8.0 nm to 7.2 nm (Gattkowski2021Analysis). NUDT9 exists in two splice variants, NUDT9K and NUDT9L, with NUDT9K having a potential mitochondrial targeting signal (Lin2002Cloning).

## Function
The NUDT9 gene encodes a mitochondrial ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of ADP-ribose in human cells. This enzyme specifically hydrolyzes ADP-ribose into AMP and ribose-5-phosphate, preventing the accumulation of free ADP-ribose, a potentially toxic metabolite (Perraud2003NUDT9; Carloto2006The). The enzymatic activity of NUDT9 is dependent on divalent metal ions, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, and an intact Nudix motif, functioning optimally at near-neutral pH (Perraud2003NUDT9; Carloto2006The).

NUDT9 is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis by regulating ADP-ribose levels, which is important for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy balance (Kulikova2020Role). The enzyme's activity is modulated by oxidative conditions, such as treatment with H2O2, which can alter its kinetic properties (Carloto2006The). NUDT9 also plays a role in regulating calcium transport through TRPM2 channels, influencing cellular responses to oxidative stress and hypoxia by modulating calcium signaling pathways (Kulikova2020Role). This regulation is significant as it prevents the release of ADP-ribose to the cytosol, thereby modulating calcium transport from the extracellular space (Kulikova2020Role).

## Clinical Significance
The NUDT9 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to gout and cancer. A genome-wide association study identified NUDT9 as significantly associated with gout risk in the Han Chinese population. This study highlighted NUDT9 as a novel locus for gout susceptibility, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease (Lee2019Integrative).

In the context of cancer, the expression of NUDT9 and other NUDT family genes has been studied in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Although specific mutations in NUDT9 were not detailed, the expression levels of NUDT family genes, including NUDT9, were analyzed for their prognostic value. The study suggested that altered expression of these genes might be associated with patient outcomes, although the precise role of NUDT9 in ccRCC remains unclear (Wang2017NUDT).

While the clinical significance of NUDT9 mutations is not fully understood, these findings indicate that NUDT9 may play a role in disease processes, warranting further investigation into its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NUDT9, a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, is primarily known for its role in hydrolyzing ADP-ribose (ADPR) and other substrates. It exhibits high substrate specificity for ADPR and 2'-deoxy-ADPR, which are hydrolyzed to AMP or 2'-deoxy-AMP and ribose 5-phosphate (Gattkowski2021Analysis). The protein undergoes significant conformational changes upon ligand binding, which is crucial for its function and potential development as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor for ADPR (Gattkowski2021Analysis).

NUDT9's interaction with the TRPM2 channel is of particular interest. The NUDT9 homology domain (NUDT9-H) in TRPM2 shares sequence identity with NUDT9 and is essential for TRPM2 channel activation by ADPR. This interaction is facilitated by a specific binding pocket in the NUDT9-H domain, which involves several key residues (Yu2017Identification). The interaction between the NUDT9H domain and the TRPM2 channel domain is functionally relevant, as it restores TRPM2 channel activity, as demonstrated by calcium imaging and electrophysiology experiments (Ehrlich2023The). These interactions highlight the importance of NUDT9 in cellular signaling pathways involving ADPR.
