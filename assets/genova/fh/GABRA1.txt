# GABRA1

## Overview
The GABRA1 gene encodes the alpha1 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA_A) receptor, a pivotal component of the central nervous system's inhibitory neurotransmission system. This gene is responsible for producing a protein that forms part of a ligand-gated ion channel, specifically a receptor that facilitates the passage of chloride ions across the neuronal membrane upon activation by the neurotransmitter GABA. The alpha1 subunit is integral to the receptor's structure and function, contributing to the receptor's pharmacological properties, including its interaction with benzodiazepines, which are commonly used in the treatment of anxiety and sleep disorders (Steudle2020A; Macdonald1994GABAA). The GABA_A receptor, with its pentameric assembly, plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain, thus ensuring proper neurological function and stability (Steudle2020A).

## Structure
The GABRA1 gene encodes the alpha1 subunit of the GABA A receptor, a member of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel family. This receptor is pentameric, typically composed of two alpha, two beta, and one gamma subunit, forming a central ion channel pore (Steudle2020A; Hernandez2019A). The primary structure of GABRA1 includes a sequence of amino acids that form the polypeptide chain, which is organized into several domains: an extracellular N-terminal domain, a transmembrane domain with four segments (TM1-4), and an intracellular domain (Steudle2020A).

The secondary structure features alpha helices and beta sheets, with the TM2 helix lining the ion pore (Mullins2010Fine). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of these domains, contributing to the receptor's functional conformation. The quaternary structure is characterized by the assembly of the subunits into a functional pentameric receptor (Mullins2010Fine).

Post-translational modifications of GABRA1 include N-glycosylation, which is crucial for receptor function and is altered in conditions like schizophrenia (Mueller2013NGlycosylation). Phosphorylation sites are also present, contributing to the regulation of receptor activity (Mullins2010Fine). The receptor's structure allows for the binding of GABA and benzodiazepines at specific interfaces, influencing its gating and desensitization properties (Hernandez2019A).

## Function
The GABRA1 gene encodes the alpha1 subunit of the GABA_A receptor, which is a crucial component in mediating fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. This receptor functions as a ligand-gated ion channel that allows chloride ions to pass through upon binding with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), leading to hyperpolarization of the neuron and reduced excitability (Steudle2020A; Macdonald1994GABAA). The alpha1 subunit is a major component of both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA_A receptors in the adult brain, playing a significant role in maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals, which is essential for normal neurological function (Steudle2020A).

The alpha1 subunit is involved in the formation of receptor subtypes with specific pharmacological properties, such as high affinity for benzodiazepines, which are used to modulate anxiety and induce sedation (Macdonald1994GABAA). The expression of the GABRA1 gene is regulated by transcription factors like Sp4, which influences its expression in neurons and is crucial for the receptor's role in inhibitory neurotransmission (Nair2016Specificity). The alpha1 subunit's presence is vital for the receptor's function in fast synaptic transmission, contributing to processes like anxiety regulation, sleep, and muscle relaxation (Olsen2008International).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GABRA1 gene, which encodes the alpha1 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, are associated with a range of epilepsy syndromes. These include both benign forms, such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and childhood absence epilepsy, and severe epileptic encephalopathies like Dravet syndrome and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE) (Bai2019Pathophysiology; Johannesen2016Phenotypic). The phenotypic spectrum of GABRA1 mutations is broad, with some mutations leading to treatment-resistant epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder (Bai2019Pathophysiology).

Functional studies have shown that these mutations often result in a loss of function of the GABA-A receptor, leading to decreased GABA sensitivity and impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission. This can cause increased neuronal excitability, contributing to the development of epilepsy (Hernandez2019Altered; Johannesen2016Phenotypic). Specific mutations, such as R214C, have been linked to decreased receptor expression and altered receptor function, further exacerbating the condition (Bai2019Pathophysiology).

The clinical heterogeneity observed in GABRA1-related epilepsies may be influenced by genetic background or modifying genes, highlighting the complexity of these disorders (Johannesen2016Phenotypic).

## Interactions
The GABRA1 gene encodes the alpha1 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which is involved in inhibitory neurotransmission. This subunit participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function. The alpha1 subunit interacts with gephyrin, a major inhibitory scaffolding protein, forming a complex with a molecular weight higher than 720 kDa. This interaction is significant for anchoring the receptor at synaptic sites (Choi2022Analyzing). The alpha1 subunit also associates with spectrin isoforms, such as Sptan1, Sptbn1, and Sptbn2, which are involved in cytoskeletal organization and contribute to the stabilization of the receptor in the plasma membrane (Choi2022Analyzing).

In addition to these interactions, the alpha1 subunit is part of a receptor complex that includes the β3 and γ2 subunits, forming a pentameric structure with a native molecular mass of 250 kDa (Choi2022Analyzing). The β3 subunit is enriched in both α1 and α4 subtypes, with phosphorylation of serines 408 and 409 playing a role in membrane trafficking and receptor segregation (Choi2022Analyzing). The alpha1 subunit also interacts with CaMKv, which colocalizes with it at inhibitory synapses, suggesting a role in synaptic regulation (Chen2024Proteome).
