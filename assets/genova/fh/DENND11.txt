# DENND11

## Overview
DENND11 is a gene that encodes the protein DENN domain containing 11, which is part of the DENN (differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells) domain family. This family of proteins is characterized by their role as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rab GTPases, which are critical regulators of intracellular membrane trafficking (Qiu2020aarFDC). The DENND11 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicle transport and signal transduction, by facilitating the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab proteins. Its function is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper organelle function. Mutations or dysregulation of DENND11 have been implicated in several diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in understanding and potentially treating these conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
