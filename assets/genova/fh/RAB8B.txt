# RAB8B

## Overview
RAB8B is a gene that encodes a member of the RAS oncogene family, specifically a small GTPase protein known as RAB8B. This protein plays a pivotal role in intracellular vesicle trafficking, influencing processes such as membrane transport, recycling, and cell signaling. RAB8B is particularly active in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, where it contributes to cell polarity, migration, and the formation of primary cilia, which are essential for sensory functions in various cell types (Peränen2011Rab8). The protein is also involved in cell morphogenesis by regulating actin dynamics and promoting the formation of cell protrusions (Peränen2011Rab8). Through its interactions with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), RAB8B plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal organization and vesicle movement within cells (Bhuin2014Rab). Its involvement in various cellular pathways and interactions with other proteins underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease pathology.

## Structure


## Function
RAB8B is a small GTPase involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking, playing a crucial role in regulating membrane transport and recycling. It is active in the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, influencing cell polarity, migration, and signaling. RAB8B is essential for the formation of primary cilia, sensory organelles present on nearly every cell type, and defects in ciliogenesis are linked to various developmental disorders (Peränen2011Rab8). It is involved in the transport of rhodopsin-containing vesicles to the connecting cilium in rod photoreceptors, and its activation is crucial for cilia formation (Peränen2011Rab8).

RAB8B also plays a significant role in cell morphogenesis by promoting the formation of cell protrusions and regulating actin dynamics. It is associated with vesicles, macropinosomes, and tubular structures, and is involved in a recycling pathway based on clathrin-independent endocytosis (Peränen2011Rab8). RAB8B interacts with various proteins, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which are essential for its role in cell morphogenesis and cytoskeletal dynamics (Peränen2011Rab8). Through these interactions, RAB8B contributes to the dynamic organization of the cytoskeleton and the directed movement of vesicles within cells (Bhuin2014Rab).

## Clinical Significance
RAB8B has been implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression and genetic mutations. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), RAB8B is downregulated, yet high transcript levels are paradoxically associated with reduced overall survival, suggesting a complex role in cancer progression. This indicates that RAB8B's expression levels may have prognostic significance in PDAC, potentially serving as a biomarker for patient outcomes (Anand2020Comprehensive).

In Parkinson's disease (PD), RAB8B is involved in intracellular trafficking mechanisms and is enriched in extracellular vesicles (EVs) following fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) treatment. This enrichment is linked to non-motor symptoms of PD, such as hearing loss, and suggests a role in the spread of PD pathology across brain regions. RAB8B interacts with proteins like Otoferlin, which are associated with hearing disorders, indicating its potential involvement in the molecular pathophysiology of dementia in PD patients (Kumar2020FGF2).

Overall, RAB8B's altered expression and interactions in these diseases highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention and as a marker for disease progression and prognosis.

## Interactions
RAB8B, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular vesicle trafficking. It interacts with Rab31, forming a Rab8b-Rab31 interactome (RRi) that is significant in Parkinson's disease pathology. This interactome is involved in pathways such as Golgi vesicle transport, exocytosis, and endocytosis (Kumar2020FGF2). RAB8B also interacts with proteins like Otoferlin, which is linked to non-motor symptoms such as hearing loss in Parkinson's disease (Kumar2020FGF2).

RAB8B is phosphorylated by LRRK2, a kinase that affects its function and leads to centrosomal cohesion deficits. This phosphorylation is crucial for the observed effects, as demonstrated by the reversal of these deficits with a LRRK2 kinase inhibitor (Lara2019RAB8). RAB8B also interacts with Rab3b and Rab23, with computational modeling and docking studies confirming these interactions. These interactions are significant in understanding Parkinson's disease pathology (Kumar2020FGF2).

RAB8B is associated with the exocyst complex, facilitating vesicle transport to the plasma membrane, and interacts with GTPase-activating proteins that regulate its activity. It also interacts with MICAL-L1 and EHBP1, which are involved in endocytic recycling (Peränen2011Rab8).
