# FAM222B

## Overview
FAM222B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 222 member B. This protein is categorized as a non-enzymatic protein, and its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. However, it is implicated in various cellular processes due to its interactions with other proteins and potential involvement in signaling pathways. The gene is expressed in multiple tissues, suggesting a role in diverse physiological contexts. Research into FAM222B is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its specific functions and potential implications in human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
