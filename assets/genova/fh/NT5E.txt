# NT5E

## Overview
The NT5E gene encodes the enzyme ecto-5'-nucleotidase, commonly referred to as CD73, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein. CD73 is a critical component of the purinergic signaling pathway, functioning primarily on the plasma membrane as a homodimer to catalyze the conversion of extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine. This enzymatic activity is essential for various physiological processes, including immune modulation, tissue homeostasis, and cardiovascular protection (Zimmermann2012Cellular; Alcedo2021The). The NT5E gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that can influence the protein's function and stability (Snider2014Alternative). CD73's role extends beyond its enzymatic activity, as it also participates in cell adhesion and signal transduction, interacting with various proteins and contributing to complex cellular processes (Kordaß2018Controlling). Mutations and altered expression of NT5E have significant clinical implications, including associations with arterial calcification and cancer progression, underscoring its importance in both health and disease (Chen2022NT5E; Unknownauthors2011NT5EMutationsandArterialCalcifications).

## Structure
The NT5E gene encodes the ecto-5'-nucleotidase protein, commonly known as CD73, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein. CD73 functions as a homodimer on the plasma membrane, which is essential for its enzymatic activity in catalyzing the conversion of extracellular AMP to adenosine (Rahimova2018Identification; Alcedo2021The). The protein structure includes an alpha/beta hydrolase fold and a zinc-binding site, crucial for its catalytic function. Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification that affects the stability and localization of CD73.

Alternative splicing of the NT5E gene results in two isoforms: CD73L (long) and CD73S (short). CD73L is the canonical form, while CD73S lacks amino acids 404-453, which are encoded by exon 7. This missing segment in CD73S includes three β-strands and two α-helices, as well as a critical catalytic residue (Phe-417), which are part of the substrate-binding domain and the interface necessary for forming the functional CD73 homodimer. Consequently, CD73S has different folding and dimerization properties, potentially compromising its activity as an AMPase (Snider2014Alternative). CD73S is primarily intracellular and does not form disulfide-linked homodimers, negatively regulating CD73L activity and expression (Snider2014Alternative).

## Function
The NT5E gene encodes the enzyme ecto-5'-nucleotidase, also known as CD73, which is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoprotein. CD73 is primarily located on the plasma membrane, where it functions as a dimer to catalyze the conversion of extracellular adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine. This enzymatic activity is crucial for purinergic signaling, a system that regulates various physiological processes through the action of extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides (Zimmermann2012Cellular; Alcedo2021The).

In healthy human cells, CD73-generated adenosine plays a significant role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and modulating immune responses. It supports epithelial cell transport and tissue barrier function, inhibits endothelial permeability, and modulates neuronal activity for antinociception. In the central nervous system, CD73 is involved in protecting against inflammatory damage and contributes to age-dependent decline in cortical plasticity (Minor2019Cell).

CD73 is also involved in cardioprotective functions during myocardial infarction and heart failure, and it provides protection under ischemia/reperfusion injury conditions in the liver and kidney. Its activity is crucial for normal physiology, and its inhibition is being explored as a cancer therapy due to adenosine's role in suppressing antitumor immunity (Minor2019Cell; Alcedo2021The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NT5E gene, which encodes the enzyme CD73, are linked to several clinical conditions. One notable condition is arterial calcification due to deficiency of CD73 (ACDC), characterized by painful calcifications in the extremities. This results from reduced CD73 activity, leading to dysregulated signaling pathways and increased tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) activity, which promotes ectopic calcification (Unknownauthors2011NT5EMutationsandArterialCalcifications; Alcedo2021The). Mutations in NT5E can cause intracellular mistrafficking of the protein, resulting in a loss of enzymatic activity at the cell surface, which is crucial for its function in purinergic signaling (Fausther2014NT5E).

Alterations in NT5E expression are also implicated in cancer progression. High NT5E expression is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme. In these cancers, NT5E contributes to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by facilitating the conversion of AMP to adenosine, which inhibits anti-tumor immune responses (Chen2022NT5E; Wang2019NT5ECD73). NT5E expression is also linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis, further promoting tumor growth and progression (Xue2022Pancancer). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NT5E in both vascular diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
The NT5E gene encodes the CD73 protein, which participates in various physical interactions with other proteins. CD73 interacts with src protein kinases, facilitating cellular signal transduction despite lacking intracellular signaling domains (Kordaß2018Controlling). It also mediates cell-cell adhesion between lymphocytes and endothelial cells and interacts with extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin, tenascin C, and collagen 1, independent of its enzymatic activity (Kordaß2018Controlling). 

CD73 is involved in forming complexes with its isoforms, such as CD73S and CD73L. CD73S, a shorter variant, interacts with CD73L, promoting its proteasomal degradation and acting in a dominant-negative manner (Minor2019Cell; Snider2014Alternative). This interaction suggests a regulatory mechanism where CD73S affects the stability and function of canonical CD73 (Snider2014Alternative).

CD73 also interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin, indicating a potential role in protein processing (Snider2014Alternative). These interactions highlight the complexity of CD73's role in cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer and immune regulation.
