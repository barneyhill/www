# ADGRL1

## Overview
ADGRL1, also known as latrophilin-1, is a gene that encodes the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L1, a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its large extracellular region and seven transmembrane alpha-helices, typical of GPCRs, and plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion and signaling processes. The protein undergoes autoproteolysis, resulting in two fragments that are essential for its function. ADGRL1 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it is involved in neuronal synapse formation and stabilization through interactions with various ligands. It also plays a role in regulating energy balance and metabolism, with dysfunctions in the gene linked to obesity and neurodevelopmental disorders (Morgan2019The; Dietzsch2024Dysfunction).

## Structure
ADGRL1, also known as latrophilin-1, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. It features a large extracellular region with multiple domains, including a lectin-like domain, an olfactomedin-like domain, and a hormone receptor motif. The transmembrane region typically forms seven alpha-helices, characteristic of GPCRs. The protein undergoes autoproteolysis within the conserved GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, resulting in two fragments: an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) (Rahman2019C‐terminal; Nazarko2018A). The NTF, which lacks a transmembrane domain, can anchor to the cell surface by forming a complex with the CTF, which is a classical GPCR with a short N-terminal ectodomain and a long cytosolic tail (Rahman2019C‐terminal).

The interaction between the NTF and CTF is crucial for receptor function, with phosphorylation of the CTF being a significant post-translational modification that affects this interaction (Rahman2019C‐terminal). The phosphorylated CTF has a high affinity for the NTF, forming stable complexes, while dephosphorylated CTF has a lower affinity and can exist separately (Rahman2019C‐terminal). The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which contributes to its functional diversity (Kuhn2024The).

## Function
ADGRL1, also known as latrophilin-1, is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) family, playing a crucial role in cell adhesion and signaling processes. In healthy human cells, ADGRL1 is primarily expressed in the brain, where it is involved in neuronal synapse formation by mediating cell adhesion. It stabilizes cell-cell contacts through interactions with endogenous ligands such as teneurins, neurexins, or FLRT proteins, which occur via its highly conserved N-terminal region (Morgan2019The).

ADGRL1 functions as a presynaptic receptor that, when activated by its exogenous agonist α-latrotoxin, triggers intracellular signaling cascades leading to neurotransmitter release. This receptor forms a trans-synaptic pair with Lasso/teneurin-2, influencing axonal growth cone behavior and potentially affecting cell morphology and growth cone dynamics (Morgan2019The).

Beyond its role in synaptogenesis, ADGRL1 is involved in controlling energy balance and food intake. It is present in adipocytes and neurons, contributing to the regulation of appetite, glucose and lipid metabolism, and hormone secretion. Dysfunction of ADGRL1 can lead to increased food consumption and obesity, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal metabolic processes (Dietzsch2024Dysfunction).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysfunctions in the ADGRL1 gene, also known as latrophilin 1 (LPHN1), have been associated with an increased risk of obesity. Studies have shown that LPHN1 knockout mice develop obesity due to increased food intake and altered energy balance, with a significant increase in fat mass rather than lean body mass (Dietzsch2024Dysfunction). The receptor is involved in regulating food intake and energy metabolism, and its dysfunction can lead to obesity through fat accumulation and altered metabolic processes (Dietzsch2024Dysfunction).

In humans, rare genetic variants of LPHN1 have been identified in individuals with obesity, including a child with obesity, suggesting that these variants may contribute to the condition. These variants show decreased functionality and reduced surface expression, potentially impacting energy balance and metabolism (Dietzsch2024Dysfunction). The study also notes that LPHN1 mutations are rare, and complete loss-of-function mutations are not compatible with healthy life (Dietzsch2024Dysfunction).

Additionally, LPHN1 dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Haploinsufficiency caused by several mutations in LPHN1 can lead to neurodevelopmental delays, indicating a broader impact of these mutations beyond metabolic conditions (Dietzsch2024Dysfunction).

## Interactions
ADGRL1, also known as latrophilin-1, is a presynaptic adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) that plays a significant role in mediating axonal attraction and synapse formation through its interactions with other proteins. One of the primary interactions of ADGRL1 is with Lasso/teneurin-2, a type 2 membrane receptor. Lasso/teneurin-2 is identified as the strongest endogenous ligand for ADGRL1, forming a trans-synaptic receptor pair that mediates cell adhesion. The interaction involves the binding of the extracellular N-terminal fragment (NTF) of ADGRL1 to the C-terminal domain of Lasso/teneurin-2, which contains EGF repeats. This interaction is crucial for synapse formation and cell adhesion (Morgan2019The).

The extracellular domain (ECD) of Lasso/teneurin-2 can be shed into the medium through regulated proteolytic cleavage, and the released fragment can bind to cell-surface ADGRL1 on distant cells and axonal growth cones, causing intracellular signaling. This suggests that the interaction of the shed ECD of Lasso/teneurin-2 with ADGRL1 may influence growth cone behavior (Morgan2019The).

ADGRL1 also interacts with α-latrotoxin, a neurotoxin that binds to the NTF of ADGRL1 but requires the C-terminal fragment (CTF) for signaling. This interaction facilitates or induces the formation of NTF-CTF complexes, which are crucial for the signaling function of latrophilin (Volynski2004Latrophilin).
