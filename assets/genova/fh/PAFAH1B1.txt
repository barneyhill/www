# PAFAH1B1

## Overview
The PAFAH1B1 gene encodes the protein platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b regulatory subunit 1, commonly referred to as LIS1. This protein is a regulatory subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH) complex, which plays a pivotal role in brain development and neuronal migration. As a member of the WD40 repeat protein family, LIS1 is characterized by its seven-bladed beta-propeller structure, facilitating diverse protein-protein interactions essential for its function (Cardoso2001Clinical; Caspi2000Interaction). The protein is integral to the regulation of microtubule dynamics and is involved in critical cellular processes such as mitotic spindle orientation and nucleokinesis, which are vital for proper cortical development (Reiner2013LIS1). Mutations in PAFAH1B1 are linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, including lissencephaly, underscoring its importance in normal brain function (Kato2003Lissencephaly; Hirotsune1998Graded). Additionally, LIS1 is implicated in other physiological processes such as spermatogenesis and angiogenesis, highlighting its multifaceted role in human biology (Yao2015Role; Josipovic2016PAFAH1B1).

## Structure
The PAFAH1B1 gene encodes the LIS1 protein, which is crucial for brain development and neuronal migration. The primary structure of LIS1 consists of 410 amino acids (Cardoso2001Clinical). The protein features a coiled-coil domain at the N-terminus, which spans exons 2 to 4, allowing it to form homodimers and interact with proteins such as NUDE and NUDEL (Cardoso2001Clinical). The C-terminus contains seven WD40 repeats, which form a propeller-like structure involved in protein-protein interactions (Cardoso2001Clinical; Caspi2000Interaction). The second WD40 repeat is critical for interaction with the PAF-AH complex subunits PAFAH1B2 and PAFAH1B3, while the seventh WD40 repeat interacts with DCX (Cardoso2001Clinical; Caspi2000Interaction).

The tertiary structure of LIS1 is suggested to be a seven-bladed beta-propeller, similar to the β-subunit of G proteins, with each WD domain forming an anti-parallel β sheet (Caspi2000Interaction). In terms of quaternary structure, LIS1 functions as a regulatory subunit in a heterotrimeric complex with PAFAH1B2 and PAFAH1B3, regulating platelet activating factor levels in the brain (Cardoso2001Clinical).

## Function
The PAFAH1B1 gene encodes a regulatory subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1b enzyme complex, which plays a crucial role in several cellular and developmental processes. In healthy human cells, PAFAH1B1 is involved in regulating neuronal migration, a critical process for normal cortical development. It interacts with the molecular motor dynein, influencing microtubule dynamics, mitotic spindle orientation, and nucleokinesis, which are essential for the proper layering of neurons in the cerebral cortex (Reiner2013LIS1).

PAFAH1B1 is also significant in spermatogenesis and early embryonic development. It is expressed in dividing spermatocytes and elongating spermatids, where it is involved in microtubule-mediated events such as cell division and chromosome segregation. Its expression pattern suggests a role in sperm maturation and function, particularly in the midpiece and acrosomal regions of spermatozoa (Yao2015Role).

In endothelial cells, PAFAH1B1 is crucial for maintaining an angiogenic phenotype, supporting processes like VEGF-A-induced sprouting and capillary-like structure formation. It influences the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, such as Matrix Gla Protein, and is involved in endothelial cell quiescence and angiogenesis (Josipovic2016PAFAH1B1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAFAH1B1 gene, also known as LIS1, are associated with several severe neurodevelopmental disorders, most notably lissencephaly. Lissencephaly is characterized by a smooth brain surface due to abnormal neuronal migration, leading to a thickened cortex and disorganized cortical layers. This condition can manifest as isolated lissencephaly sequence (ILS) or Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), with the latter being more severe due to larger deletions that include additional genes (Liu2021Responsible; Kato2003Lissencephaly; Hirotsune1998Graded). 

Patients with these conditions often experience profound intellectual disabilities and seizures. The severity of lissencephaly correlates with the type of mutation in PAFAH1B1, with submicroscopic deletions and null mutations leading to more severe forms, while missense mutations generally result in milder phenotypes (Kato2003Lissencephaly). 

Alterations in PAFAH1B1 expression levels are also clinically significant. For instance, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection can lead to increased expression of PAFAH1B1, which is associated with brain abnormalities such as polymicrogyria and microcephaly in infected fetuses (Rolland2021Human). These findings underscore the critical role of PAFAH1B1 in brain development and its potential involvement in various neurological disorders.

## Interactions
The PAFAH1B1 gene encodes the LIS1 protein, which is a regulatory subunit of the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH) complex. LIS1 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in brain development and neuronal migration. It is part of a heterotrimeric complex with two other subunits, PAFAH1B2 and PAFAH1B3, which are essential for neuronal migration. Mutations in LIS1 can disrupt its interaction with these subunits, leading to brain malformations such as lissencephaly (Sweeney2000Lissencephaly).

LIS1 also interacts with the Reelin signaling pathway, particularly with the protein Dab1. This interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and is crucial for cortical development. The presence of Src kinase enhances the binding between Dab1 and LIS1, and this interaction is significantly reduced in Dab1 mutants lacking specific phosphorylation sites (Assadi2003Interaction). Additionally, LIS1 interacts with the dynein motor complex, which is important for microtubule dynamics and neuronal migration (Assadi2008Pafah1b2).

In endothelial cells, PAFAH1B1 is involved in angiogenesis, interacting with the Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) gene. It maintains the active histone mark H3K4me3 and RNA Polymerase II binding on the MGP promoter, which is necessary for endothelial angiogenic capacity (Josipovic2016PAFAH1B1).
