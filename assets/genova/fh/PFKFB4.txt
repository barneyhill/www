# PFKFB4

## Overview
PFKFB4 is a gene that encodes the protein 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4, which is a bifunctional enzyme involved in the regulation of glycolysis. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular metabolism by modulating the levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a key regulator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) activity, thereby influencing glycolytic flux and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (Pegoraro2015PFKFB4). PFKFB4 is categorized as a kinase due to its ability to phosphorylate substrates, and it also possesses phosphatase activity, allowing it to dephosphorylate fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. This dual functionality is crucial for maintaining energy homeostasis and redox balance, particularly under hypoxic conditions (Li2020The). The protein is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and fibrotic diseases, making it a significant target for therapeutic research (TROJAN2018Analysis; Lee2016Profibrotic).

## Structure
PFKFB4 is an enzyme encoded by the PFKFB4 gene, playing a crucial role in the regulation of glycolysis. The protein's primary structure includes conserved domains responsible for its bifunctional kinase and phosphatase activities. These domains are essential for its role in modulating the levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a key regulator of glycolysis.

The secondary structure of PFKFB4 is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the stability and functionality of the enzyme. These structural elements facilitate the proper folding and orientation of the active sites necessary for its enzymatic activities.

In terms of tertiary structure, PFKFB4 involves the folding of its kinase and phosphatase domains, allowing for the spatial arrangement required for its dual functionality. This folding is critical for the enzyme's ability to switch between its kinase and phosphatase roles, depending on cellular conditions.

The quaternary structure of PFKFB4 may involve dimerization, which can influence its enzymatic activity and stability. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to affect the activity and stability of PFKFB4, potentially altering its role in glycolysis regulation. These modifications can serve as regulatory mechanisms, fine-tuning the enzyme's function in response to cellular signals.

## Function
PFKFB4 is a bifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in regulating glycolysis by controlling the levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent activator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1). This regulation is essential for maintaining the balance between energy production and biosynthesis, particularly under hypoxic conditions (Pegoraro2015PFKFB4). PFKFB4 is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular metabolism by modulating glycolytic flux and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which are crucial for ATP synthesis and redox homeostasis (Li2020The).

In healthy human cells, PFKFB4's activity supports cell survival and proliferation by ensuring adequate energy supply and maintaining redox balance. It is involved in the production of ATP and lactic acid through glycolysis, and NADPH through the PPP, which is vital for lipid synthesis and managing oxidative stress (Li2020The). PFKFB4 also plays a role in embryonic development, where it influences cell survival and patterning through Akt signaling, independent of its glycolytic function (Pegoraro2015PFKFB4). This highlights its importance in both metabolic and non-metabolic cellular processes, contributing to proper cell signaling and survival.

## Clinical Significance
PFKFB4 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in enhancing glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, which are crucial for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Overexpression of PFKFB4 is associated with poor prognosis in malignant melanoma, as it is linked to increased glycolytic activity and worse distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival in patients (TROJAN2018Analysis). In melanoma, PFKFB4 expression can occur independently of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling, suggesting its role in disease progression beyond hypoxic responses (TROJAN2018Analysis).

In prostate cancer, PFKFB4 is identified as a significant regulator of cell survival, with increased expression in metastatic cases compared to primary tumors. Silencing PFKFB4 induces apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Ros2012Functional). In fibrous dysplasia, PFKFB4-mediated glycolytic reprogramming contributes to a pro-fibrotic environment, with its expression regulated by the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway. This suggests that PFKFB4 plays a role in the fibrotic process and could be targeted to reduce fibrosis (Lee2016Profibrotic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PFKFB4 in cancer and fibrotic diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
PFKFB4, a glycolysis regulator, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cancer cell behavior. In melanoma, PFKFB4 interacts with ICMT, a post-translational modifier of RAS GTPases. This interaction is crucial for the carboxyl methylation of RAS, facilitating its localization to the plasma membrane and activating the RAS/AKT signaling pathway, which enhances melanoma cell migration. The interaction between PFKFB4 and ICMT was validated through co-immunoprecipitation and a split-ubiquitin two-hybrid approach (Sittewelle2020The; Sittewelle2022PFKFB4).

In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), PFKFB4 interacts with the protein Etk. This interaction modulates chemoresistance by affecting autophagy and apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses confirmed the direct binding of Etk to PFKFB4, influencing the expression of autophagy-related proteins and impacting tumor response to chemotherapy (Wang2018Etk).

In lung adenocarcinoma, PFKFB4 interacts with the transcriptional coactivator SRC-2. This interaction, confirmed in various cell lines, suggests that PFKFB4 may promote cancer progression by activating SRC-2, influencing cell proliferation and migration (Meng2021PFKFB4).
