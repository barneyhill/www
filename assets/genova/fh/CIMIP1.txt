# CIMIP1

## Overview
CIMIP1 is a gene that encodes the protein ciliary microtubule inner protein 1, which is integral to the structure and function of cilia in human cells. Cilia are hair-like projections on the cell surface that play critical roles in cell movement and signaling. The protein encoded by CIMIP1 is involved in the assembly and stability of ciliary microtubules, which are essential for the proper functioning of cilia. These microtubules are located within the lumen of axonemal microtubules and are crucial for organizing the periodicity of ciliary motors and their regulatory components, indicating their importance in the later stages of cilia assembly (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional). CIMIP1 is part of a gene group involved in ciliogenesis, the process of cilia formation, which is vital for various cellular functions, including fluid movement across epithelial surfaces and sensory perception (Moffatt2024Microbiome).

## Function
CIMIP1 (ciliary microtubule inner protein 1) is involved in the structure and function of cilia, which are hair-like projections on the surface of cells. In healthy human cells, CIMIP1 plays a crucial role in the assembly and stability of ciliary microtubules, which are essential for the proper functioning of cilia. These microtubules are located in the lumen of axonemal microtubules and are believed to be important for organizing the periodicity of ciliary motors and their regulatory components, suggesting their significance in the later stages of cilia assembly (Koenitzer2024Transcriptional).

CIMIP1 is part of a group of genes that are involved in ciliogenesis, the process by which cilia are formed. This process is vital for cell movement and signaling, as cilia are responsible for various cellular functions, including fluid movement across epithelial surfaces and sensory perception (Moffatt2024Microbiome). The presence of CIMIP1 in gene modules associated with epithelial activities further supports its role in the formation and function of cilia within epithelial tissues, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal cellular processes and organismal health (Moffatt2024Microbiome).
