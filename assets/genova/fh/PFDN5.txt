# PFDN5

## Overview
PFDN5, or prefoldin subunit 5, is a gene that encodes a protein component of the prefoldin complex, a molecular chaperone involved in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin. The prefoldin complex is a heterohexameric assembly that stabilizes nascent polypeptides and delivers them to the chaperonin containing TCP1 (CCT) for proper folding (Lee2011Prefoldin). PFDN5, specifically, is categorized as a co-repressor protein due to its role in transcriptional regulation, where it interacts with the c-Myc transcription factor to modulate gene expression and promote protein degradation (PayánBravo2018Functional; MillánZambrano2014Nuclear). Beyond its chaperone function, PFDN5 is implicated in various cellular processes, including co-transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing and chromatin remodeling, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential involvement in disease pathologies such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (PayánBravo2020Human; Liang2020The).

## Structure
PFDN5, a subunit of the prefoldin complex, plays a crucial role in protein folding, particularly for tubulin and actin. The prefoldin complex is a heterohexameric assembly with a jellyfish-like structure, consisting of two α-like and four β-like subunits, including PFDN5 (Lee2011Prefoldin). The primary structure of PFDN5 includes a specific sequence of amino acids, with a notable missense mutation from leucine to arginine at position 110, which affects its function (Lee2011Prefoldin).

The secondary structure of PFDN5 likely includes coiled-coil tentacles, which are characteristic of prefoldin subunits and are involved in substrate binding (Lee2011Prefoldin). The tertiary structure involves the 3D arrangement of these coiled-coil regions, contributing to the flexibility and substrate accommodation of the prefoldin complex (Lee2011Prefoldin).

In terms of quaternary structure, PFDN5 assembles with other prefoldin subunits to form the functional prefoldin complex, which stabilizes nascent proteins and delivers them to the chaperonin containing TCP1 (CCT) for folding (Lee2011Prefoldin). PFDN5 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing.

## Function
PFDN5, also known as prefoldin subunit 5 or MM-1, is a component of the prefoldin complex, which plays a crucial role in protein folding by stabilizing unfolded proteins and preventing their aggregation. This complex is particularly involved in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, essential for maintaining cellular structure and function (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear; Liang2020The).

In healthy human cells, PFDN5 functions as a co-repressor of the c-Myc transcription factor, a key regulator of cell cycle and growth. It binds to the N-terminal region of c-Myc, recruiting the histone deacetylase HDAC1-mSin3 complex, which counteracts histone acetyltransferases and inhibits chromatin remodeling. This interaction helps regulate c-Myc's transcriptional activity and stability, promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (PayánBravo2018Functional; MillánZambrano2014Nuclear).

PFDN5 also plays a role in co-transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing. It is involved in maintaining RNA polymerase II phosphorylation, which is crucial for the recruitment of splicing factors and the PRP19 complex, thereby facilitating efficient splicing and enhancing gene expression (PayánBravo2020Human). These functions underscore PFDN5's importance in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PFDN5 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In cancer, PFDN5 acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing the c-MYC transcription factor. A specific amino acid substitution, A157R, results in the loss of this repression activity and is frequently observed in leukemia, lymphoma, and human tongue cancer cells (Hennecke2015Prevalence). In colorectal cancer, PFDN5 expression is inversely correlated with KDM5C expression, which suppresses PFDN5 transcription, leading to enhanced c-MYC activity and cancer progression (Yu2024Lysine). 

In endometriosis, PFDN5 expression is elevated in both eutopic and ectopic endometriotic epithelial cells, contributing to cell proliferation and migration. This is associated with a shift from cytoplasmic to nuclear localization in ectopic lesions, potentially influencing disease pathophysiology (Nothnick2024Prefoldin5). 

PFDN5 is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases. It plays a role in preventing protein aggregation, which is crucial in conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. Mutations in PFDN5 can lead to neurodegeneration, highlighting its clinical significance in these disorders (Liang2020The). 

In ankylosing spondylitis-associated uveitis, PFDN5 has a protective role against apoptosis in retinal cells, and its expression alterations may serve as a biomarker for the disease (Kwon2019Prefoldin).

## Interactions
PFDN5, also known as prefoldin subunit 5 or MM-1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence transcriptional regulation and cellular processes. It acts as a co-repressor of the E-box-dependent transactivation activity of c-Myc by binding to its N-terminal region. This interaction recruits the histone deacetylase HDAC1-mSin3 complex, which counteracts histone acetyltransferases and inhibits chromatin remodeling, thereby modulating c-Myc-dependent transactivation (PayánBravo2018Functional; MillánZambrano2014Nuclear). PFDN5 also promotes c-Myc degradation by recruiting an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex, leading to proteasomal degradation (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear).

PFDN5 interacts with the transcriptional co-repressor TIF1β, facilitating the recruitment of the HDAC1-mSin3 complex (MillánZambrano2014Nuclear). It also binds to the promoter region of the Wnt4 gene, downregulating its transcription, and cooperates with Egr1 to repress Wnt4, indirectly inhibiting c-Myc expression (PayánBravo2018Functional; MillánZambrano2014Nuclear).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, PFDN5 is part of the prefoldin complex, a chaperone that assists in the correct folding of proteins, particularly actin and tubulin, in the cytoplasm (Liang2020The). This complex interacts with the cytoplasmic chaperone protein TCP-1 (CCT) to facilitate protein folding (Liang2020The).
