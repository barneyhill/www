# WRAP73

## Overview
The WRAP73 gene encodes the protein WD repeat containing, antisense to TP73, which is involved in various cellular processes, including cell division and microtubule dynamics. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. WRAP73 plays a critical role in the SSX2IP:WRAP73 complex, essential for spindle anchoring at the mitotic centrosome, thereby ensuring proper cell division (Wu2023Identification). The gene's expression and function have been linked to cancer biology, particularly in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), where it serves as a potential prognostic biomarker due to its association with patient survival rates (Wu2023Identification). Additionally, WRAP73 is notable for its resistance to splicing alterations typically induced by SF3B1 mutations, setting it apart from other genes affected by such mutations (Alsafadi2016Cancerassociated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WRAP73 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. In the context of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), WRAP73 is identified as a microtubule-associated gene that is significantly associated with the overall survival rate of patients. Higher expression levels of WRAP73 have been observed in DLBCL samples compared to normal cells, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker for prognosis prediction in this type of cancer (Wu2023Identification).

WRAP73 is also involved in the SSX2IP:WRAP73 complex, which is crucial for spindle anchoring at the mitotic centrosome, a process essential for cell division. This function highlights its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and its potential impact on cancer progression when altered (Wu2023Identification).

In terms of genetic mutations, WRAP73 is noted for its insensitivity to SF3B1 mutations, as it does not exhibit significant changes in splicing patterns in response to these mutations. This characteristic distinguishes it from other genes that show altered splicing ratios due to SF3B1 mutations (Alsafadi2016Cancerassociated).
