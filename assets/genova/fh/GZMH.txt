# GZMH

## Overview
Granzyme H (GZMH) is a gene that encodes the serine protease enzyme granzyme H, which is predominantly expressed in natural killer (NK) cells. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the destruction of virus-infected and tumor cells through a caspase-independent pathway. Unlike other granzymes, such as granzyme B, granzyme H does not activate caspases, highlighting its unique mechanism of inducing cell death (Fellows2007Natural). Structurally, granzyme H is characterized by a complex arrangement of alpha-helices and beta-strands, forming a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic activity (Wang2012Structural). The enzyme's activity is tightly regulated by interactions with specific inhibitors, such as SERPINB1, which prevent excessive cytotoxicity and protect healthy cells (Wang2013Identification). Granzyme H also exhibits antiviral properties by cleaving viral proteins, thereby inhibiting viral replication and contributing to the host's defense mechanisms (Romero2008Cleavage).

## Structure
The molecular structure of human granzyme H (GzmH) has been elucidated, particularly focusing on the D102N mutant. The structure is characterized by two alpha-helices and 13 beta-strands, which form two juxtaposed beta-barrel domains. These domains are bridged by the catalytic triad, which includes His 57, Asp 102, and Ser 195, essential for the enzyme's hydrolytic activity (Wang2012Structural). The N-terminal residues of GzmH insert into a cleft, forming a strong internal salt bridge with Asp 194, contributing to the protein's structural rigidity and substrate binding (Wang2012Structural).

GzmH contains three intramolecular disulfide bridges (Cys 42-Cys 58, Cys 136-Cys 201, and Cys 168-Cys 182), which stabilize its structure. A free cysteine, Cys 166, protrudes into the solvent, making it unlikely for GzmH to form a homodimer (Wang2012Structural). The specificity of GzmH is defined by a triad in the S1 pocket, consisting of Thr 189, Gly 216, and Gly 226, which accommodates bulky aromatic residues like Tyr and Phe at the P1 position (Wang2012Structural). A unique RKR motif (Arg 39, Lys 40, Arg 41) forms a positive binding site crucial for substrate recognition (Wang2012Structural).

## Function
Granzyme H (GZMH) is a serine protease predominantly expressed in natural killer (NK) cells, playing a crucial role in the immune system's defense against virus-infected and tumor cells. It is involved in inducing cell death through a caspase-independent pathway, which includes mitochondrial depolarization, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA degradation, and chromatin condensation (Fellows2007Natural). Unlike granzyme B, GZMH does not activate caspases or cause cytochrome c release, indicating a distinct mechanism of action (Fellows2007Natural).

GZMH is active in the cytotoxic granules of NK cells and is released to target cells, where it cleaves specific substrates, such as the adenovirus DNA-binding protein and the adenovirus 100K assembly protein, thereby inhibiting viral replication (Wang2012Structural). It also cleaves the La protein, interfering with hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation, highlighting its role in antiviral responses (Romero2008Cleavage).

The activity of GZMH is regulated by SERPINB1, a physiological inhibitor that forms a stable complex with GZMH to suppress its proteolytic activity, preventing excessive cytotoxicity and protecting healthy cells from damage (Wang2013Identification).

## Interactions
Granzyme H (GZMH) is a serine protease that interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in immune responses. One of its key interactions is with SERPINB1, a physiological inhibitor of GZMH. SERPINB1 forms a stable, covalent complex with GZMH, inhibiting its proteolytic activity. This interaction is characterized by the cleavage of SERPINB1 at Phe 343 in the reactive center loop, which is crucial for the inhibitory effect. The formation of this complex is dependent on the enzymatic activity of GZMH, as inactive mutants do not form the complex (Wang2013Identification).

The interaction between GZMH and SERPINB1 is specific, as SERPINB1 does not inhibit other granzymes. Structural studies have shown that specific amino acid residues in SERPINB1 are critical for binding and inhibition, with mutations enhancing the inhibitory effect (Wang2013Identification).

GZMH also interacts with viral proteins, such as the adenovirus DNA-binding protein and the 100K assembly protein, contributing to its antiviral activity. These interactions result in the cleavage of viral proteins, reducing viral replication and preserving the activity of other granzymes like granzyme B (Andrade2007Granzyme).
