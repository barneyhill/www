# IREB2

## Overview
IREB2 is a gene that encodes the iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), a crucial RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of iron metabolism. IRP2 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis by interacting with iron-responsive elements (IREs) in the untranslated regions of specific mRNAs. This interaction modulates the translation and stability of mRNAs that encode proteins essential for iron uptake, storage, and export, such as ferritin and the transferrin receptor. The activity of IRP2 is tightly regulated by cellular iron levels; it binds to IREs under low iron conditions to promote iron uptake and is degraded when iron is abundant, allowing for increased iron storage. IRP2 is particularly important in erythropoiesis and is implicated in preventing iron overload and oxidative stress, which can lead to cellular damage and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases (Wang2011Regulation; Rouault2006The; Wilkinson2014The).

## Structure
IREB2 (iron responsive element binding protein 2) is a gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in iron metabolism. The primary structure of the IREB2 protein is composed of a sequence of amino acids that determine its specific functions. In terms of secondary structure, the protein includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its stability and functional conformation.

The tertiary structure of IREB2 forms a three-dimensional shape that is essential for its biological activity. This structure allows the protein to interact with other molecules and perform its role in iron metabolism effectively. IREB2 may contain specific domains, such as RNA-binding domains, which are critical for its function in regulating iron homeostasis.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are known to occur in IREB2, potentially influencing its activity and interactions. These modifications can alter the protein's function and are important for its regulation.

IREB2 also exhibits splice variant isoforms, which result in different functional forms of the protein. These isoforms can have distinct roles in cellular processes, contributing to the complexity of iron metabolism regulation. The presence of these variants highlights the versatility and adaptability of the IREB2 protein in response to cellular needs.

## Function
IREB2 encodes iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), which plays a crucial role in maintaining iron homeostasis in human cells. IRP2 functions as an RNA-binding protein that interacts with iron-responsive elements (IREs) located in the untranslated regions of mRNAs. This interaction regulates the translation and stability of mRNAs encoding proteins essential for iron uptake, storage, and export, such as ferritin and the transferrin receptor (TFRC) (LaVaute2001Targeted; Cairo2007Ironregulatory).

In conditions of low cellular iron, IRP2 binds to IREs, stabilizing mRNAs that promote iron uptake and inhibiting those that facilitate iron storage, thus ensuring adequate iron availability for cellular processes (Rouault2006The; Wilkinson2014The). Conversely, in iron-replete conditions, IRP2 is degraded, allowing for the translation of mRNAs that promote iron storage and reduce iron uptake (Wang2011Regulation).

IRP2 is particularly important in erythropoiesis, where it regulates the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ALAS2, crucial for iron acquisition and heme synthesis in erythroid cells (Wilkinson2014The). The proper function of IRP2 is essential to prevent iron overload and associated oxidative stress, which can lead to cellular damage and neurodegenerative conditions (LaVaute2001Targeted; Wang2011Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IREB2 gene have been implicated in several diseases, most notably chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and neurodegenerative disorders. IREB2 is associated with COPD susceptibility, with studies identifying specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene that correlate with the disease. These SNPs, such as rs2568494, have been linked to increased risk of COPD, suggesting that genetic variations in IREB2 may influence lung function and contribute to disease development (DeMeo2009Integration; Chappell2011The). The gene's expression is higher in lung tissues of COPD patients, indicating its potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease (DeMeo2009Integration).

In neurodegenerative diseases, the targeted deletion of IREB2 in mice leads to misregulation of iron metabolism, resulting in neurodegenerative symptoms such as tremor and uncoordinated gait. This is due to increased iron accumulation in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, which is associated with neuronal damage and loss (LaVaute2001Targeted). These findings suggest that IREB2 plays a critical role in maintaining iron homeostasis, and its dysregulation can contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative conditions.

## Interactions
IREB2, also known as iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2), is an RNA-binding protein that interacts with iron-responsive elements (IREs) in the untranslated regions of target mRNAs. This interaction is crucial for regulating the translation and stability of mRNAs involved in iron metabolism, such as those encoding ferritin and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) (Rouault2006The; Wilkinson2014The). IREB2 binds to IREs to control mRNA translation or stability, thereby playing a significant role in cellular iron homeostasis (Wilkinson2014The).

Mutations in IREB2 can disrupt its binding to IREs, as seen with the p.(Gly785Arg) and p.(Ser444del) variants, which affect the protein's ability to maintain high binding affinity with IREs. These mutations can lead to reduced binding affinity, potentially contributing to neurological symptoms in patients (Maio2019Reply:).

IREB2's interaction with IREs is also influenced by iron levels. Under high iron conditions, IREB2 undergoes degradation, reducing its association with IREs, while IRP1, another IRE-binding protein, shows reduced affinity for IREs under similar conditions (Ramanathan2018RNA–protein). This regulatory mechanism ensures proper iron utilization and storage within cells (Wilkinson2014The).
