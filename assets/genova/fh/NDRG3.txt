# NDRG3

## Overview
NDRG3, or N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3, is a gene that encodes the NDRG family member 3 protein, which is part of the NDRG family known for its involvement in various cellular processes. The NDRG3 protein is characterized by an α/β hydrolase fold, a structural motif common in the α/β hydrolase superfamily, and is primarily localized in the cytoplasm (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily). Functionally, NDRG3 is implicated in hypoxia response, where it activates the Raf-ERK signaling pathway, promoting angiogenesis and cell growth (Chen2021High). It also plays a crucial role in meiosis, particularly in double-strand break repair in male germ cells (Pan2017Ndrg3). NDRG3's interactions with various proteins, such as Src kinase and β-catenin, highlight its involvement in cancer progression and drug resistance (Li2018NDRG3; Wang2023NDRG3). Clinically, alterations in NDRG3 expression are associated with several diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, and osteoarthritis, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Jing2018NDRG3; Chen2021High; Estiar2017Clinical).

## Structure
The NDRG3 protein is encoded by the NDRG3 gene located on human chromosome 20q11. It is a member of the N-myc downstream-regulated gene family, which includes NDRG1, NDRG2, and NDRG4. The protein consists of 375 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 41.4 kDa (Yang2013NDRG3; Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily). NDRG3 is characterized by an α/β hydrolase fold, a common structural motif in the NDRG family, which is part of the α/β hydrolase superfamily (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily). This fold includes an esterase/lipase/thioesterase active site serine, which is typical for proteins in this superfamily (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily).

The NDRG3 protein contains various functional sites for post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites, which may influence its function and interactions (Yang2013NDRG3). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, as observed in studies using GFP-tagged fusion proteins (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily). The NDRG3 protein shares 62% identity with NDRG1, indicating a significant degree of homology within the family (Qu2002CharacterizationandexpressionofthreenoveldifferentiationrelatedgenesbelongtothehumanNDRGgenefamily).

## Function
NDRG3, a member of the N-myc downstream-regulated gene family, plays a significant role in cellular processes, particularly in the context of hypoxia. Under normal conditions, NDRG3 is degraded via the PHD2/VHL pathway, but in hypoxic conditions, it binds to lactic acid and c-Raf protein, activating the Raf-ERK signaling pathway. This activation promotes angiogenesis and cell growth, indicating NDRG3's involvement in cellular responses to low oxygen levels (Chen2021High).

In male germ cells, NDRG3 is crucial for double-strand break (DSB) repair during meiosis. It modulates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is activated by lactate, a key metabolite in these cells. This pathway is essential for DSB repair, and its impairment due to NDRG3 deficiency can lead to sub-infertility and disrupted spermatogenesis (Pan2017Ndrg3). NDRG3 is highly expressed in the testis, where it stabilizes the protein and activates ERK signaling, increasing RAD51 expression via CREB phosphorylation, which is vital for DSB repair (Pan2017Ndrg3).

NDRG3 is also expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and kidney, suggesting roles in both reproductive and neural functions (Yang2013NDRG3). Its expression pattern and involvement in key signaling pathways highlight its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NDRG3 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), NDRG3 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor disease-free survival and overall survival, making NDRG3 an independent predictor of prognosis in HCC patients (Jing2018NDRG3). The gene's expression is also linked to tumor size and pathological grade in HCC, suggesting a role in cancer progression (Jing2018NDRG3).

In breast cancer, NDRG3 expression is generally downregulated, especially in advanced stages and in triple-negative breast cancer subtypes. This downregulation correlates with poorer event-free survival rates, indicating a potential tumor-suppressive role for NDRG3 in breast cancer (Estiar2017Clinical). The gene's expression is also influenced by hormone receptor status, with correlations observed between NDRG3 and HER2, PR, and ER statuses (Estiar2017Clinical).

In osteoarthritis, NDRG3 is significantly overexpressed in patients compared to controls, suggesting a role in the disease's progression, potentially through hypoxia-mediated pathways (Chen2021High). These findings highlight the diverse roles of NDRG3 in different pathological conditions.

## Interactions
NDRG3 interacts with various proteins and plays a significant role in different cellular processes. In colorectal cancer, NDRG3 promotes metastasis by activating Src phosphorylation at Tyr 419, suggesting a direct interaction with Src kinase (Li2018NDRG3). In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), NDRG3 interacts with β-catenin, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus. This interaction is associated with increased cell proliferation and imatinib resistance, highlighting the role of NDRG3 in modulating β-catenin signaling pathways (Wang2023NDRG3).

In prostate cancer, NDRG3 acts as a feedback controller of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), particularly HIF-1α. It inhibits HIF-1α by interfering with the binding of the coactivator p300, thereby reducing HIF-driven transcription. This interaction suggests that NDRG3 negatively regulates HIF-1α activity, impacting cancer cell behavior under hypoxic conditions (Lee2018NDRG3). Additionally, NDRG3 is regulated by microRNA let-7f, which targets NDRG3 mRNA, leading to decreased protein expression. This regulatory interaction is significant in the context of cerebral ischemia (Yao2016Let7f). These interactions underscore NDRG3's role in various signaling pathways and its impact on cancer progression and drug resistance.
