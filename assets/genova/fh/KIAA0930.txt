# KIAA0930

## Overview
KIAA0930 is a human gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is characterized by the presence of a domain of unknown function, DUF2045. The protein KIAA0930 is implicated in intracellular signaling pathways, primarily through its interactions with 14-3-3 proteins, as identified in large-scale proteomic studies (Huttlin2015The). Although the precise biological role of KIAA0930 remains to be fully elucidated, it is part of the human interactome, with its interactions mapped through advanced techniques such as affinity purification-mass spectrometry (Huttlin2015The; Huttlin2017Architecture). Clinically, KIAA0930 has been associated with various carcinomas, including lung, liver, renal, and endometrial cancers, where its expression and mutations have been linked to cancer progression and patient prognosis (Ji2020Proteinaltering; Meng2019Identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
The KIAA0930 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, particularly through its overexpression and specific mutations. It is significantly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSQ), as evidenced by data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and an independent dataset from Harvard (Ji2020Proteinaltering). A notable mutation, rs150665432, results in a Q4X truncation, which shortens the protein from 409 to 3 amino acids. This mutation is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, with carriers showing a higher risk compared to non-carriers (Ji2020Proteinaltering). The mutation is considered a loss-of-function allele and is included in the full-length isoform of KIAA0930 (Ji2020Proteinaltering).

KIAA0930's expression also affects survival in patients with other carcinomas, such as liver, renal, and endometrial cancers, suggesting its broader role as a carcinoma-associated candidate gene (Ji2020Proteinaltering). In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), KIAA0930 is involved in alternative splicing events that are associated with prognosis, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and patient outcomes (Meng2019Identification).

## Interactions
The protein encoded by the KIAA0930 gene is involved in interactions with other proteins, notably with 14-3-3 proteins. This interaction suggests a potential role in intracellular signaling pathways, although the specific function of the DUF2045 domain within KIAA0930 remains unknown (Huttlin2015The). The BioPlex network, a comprehensive map of human protein interactions, has been instrumental in identifying these interactions. It uses affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to explore the human interactome, providing insights into the subcellular localization and functional domains of proteins, including KIAA0930 (Huttlin2015The).

The BioPlex 2.0 project has expanded the known human interactome by identifying over 56,000 candidate interactions involving 10,961 proteins, including KIAA0930. This project employs a robust AP-MS pipeline and a naïve Bayes classifier, CompPASS-Plus, to identify high-confidence candidate interacting proteins, thereby enhancing the understanding of protein communities and disease networks (Huttlin2017Architecture). These findings contribute to the broader understanding of the biological functions and potential regulatory roles of KIAA0930 within cellular processes.
