# CT45A3

## Overview
CT45A3 is a gene that encodes the protein cancer/testis antigen family 45 member A3, which is part of the cancer/testis antigen family. This family of proteins is characterized by its restricted expression pattern, typically limited to the testis, but with aberrant expression in various cancers. The CT45A3 protein is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it plays a significant role in cancer biology. Its expression is notably associated with epithelial ovarian cancer, where it is linked to promoter hypomethylation and increased mRNA and protein levels, correlating with disease progression and poor prognosis. CT45A3 is also recognized as a chemosensitivity mediator and a potential target for immunotherapy, as it enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy drugs like carboplatin and is recognized by cytotoxic T cells, making it a promising candidate for cancer treatment strategies (Coscia2018Multilevel; Zhang2015DNA).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
CT45A3, a member of the cancer/testis antigen family, is implicated in various cancers, including ovarian cancer. Its expression is typically restricted to the testis, but aberrant expression in tumors is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. In epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), CT45A3 expression is linked to promoter hypomethylation, which correlates with increased mRNA and protein levels. This hypomethylation is associated with advanced disease stages and reduced overall survival, suggesting that CT45A3 could serve as a biomarker for disease progression and prognosis in EOC (Zhang2015DNA).

In ovarian cancer, CT45A3 is identified as a chemosensitivity mediator and a potential target for immunotherapy. Its expression enhances chemosensitivity to carboplatin, a common chemotherapy drug, and is associated with better survival outcomes. CT45A3 acts as a tumor antigen recognized by cytotoxic T cells, indicating its potential as an immunotherapy target. High levels of CT45A3 in tumors correlate with increased formation of platinum-DNA adducts, which are linked to favorable outcomes (Coscia2018Multilevel). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CT45A3 in cancer treatment and its potential as a therapeutic target.
