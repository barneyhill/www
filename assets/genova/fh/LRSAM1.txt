# LRSAM1

## Overview
LRSAM1 is a gene that encodes the protein leucine-rich repeat and sterile alpha motif containing 1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it facilitates the tagging of proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Mishra2019LRSAM1; Mishra2020Ubiquitin). LRSAM1 is characterized by several domains, including leucine-rich repeats, a sterile alpha motif, and a RING finger domain, which are essential for its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Mishra2019LRSAM1; Palaima2021LRSAM1). The protein is predominantly expressed in motor neurons and the spinal cord, underscoring its importance in neurodevelopment and neurological health (Mishra2019LRSAM1). Mutations in the LRSAM1 gene are linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2P, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodegenerative disorders (Engeholm2014A; Reilich2021Location).

## Structure
The LRSAM1 protein is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It contains leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a coiled-coil (CC) region, an ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) domain, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), two Pro-Thr-Ala-Pro (PTAP) sites, and a RING finger domain (Mishra2019LRSAM1; Palaima2021LRSAM1). The LRR domain is involved in pathogen recognition, aiding in immune response activation through autophagy (Mishra2019LRSAM1). The SAM domain facilitates protein-protein interactions, while the RING domain is essential for ubiquitination, binding ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and facilitating the transfer of activated ubiquitin to target proteins (Palaima2021LRSAM1).

The RING domain contains a canonical RING-motif characterized by a sequence of cysteines and histidine, which bind two zinc ions crucial for maintaining the domain's three-dimensional structure (Palaima2021LRSAM1). LRSAM1 forms homodimers, a process critical for its auto-ubiquitination activity, regulated by the CC1 and LRR domains (Palaima2021LRSAM1). The protein exists in three isoforms, with the most commonly expressed form being 723 amino acids long (Mishra2019LRSAM1). The primary isoform has a molecular weight of 84 kDa and is composed of 26 exons (Mishra2019LRSAM1).

## Function
LRSAM1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis by tagging proteins for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (Mishra2019LRSAM1; Mishra2020Ubiquitin). It is involved in the endosomal sorting of receptors, a process essential for receptor recycling and degradation, which is critical for cellular homeostasis (Mishra2019LRSAM1). LRSAM1 interacts with TSG101, a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport-I (ESCRT-I), by polyubiquitinating its lysine residues, leading to its proteasomal degradation (Mishra2019LRSAM1).

LRSAM1 is also involved in immune responses, recognizing pathogens like Salmonella typhimurium and activating autophagy, a process that targets intracellular pathogens for degradation (Mishra2019LRSAM1). The protein is expressed mainly in motor neurons and the spinal cord, indicating its importance in neurodevelopment and neurological health (Mishra2019LRSAM1). LRSAM1's role in protein quality control is highlighted by its involvement in the degradation of misfolded proteins, which is crucial for preventing protein aggregation associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Mishra2020Ubiquitin). Its activity is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function during oxidative stress, providing cytoprotection against cellular stress (Mishra2020Ubiquitin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the LRSAM1 gene are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2P (CMT2P), a form of axonal neuropathy characterized by sensorimotor impairment. These mutations can follow either autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance patterns, with dominant mutations often exerting a dominant-negative effect on the protein function (Engeholm2014A; Reilich2021Location). The C-terminal RING domain of the LRSAM1 protein is particularly crucial, as mutations in this region can disrupt its ubiquitination activity, leading to neurodegenerative conditions (Mishra2019LRSAM1).

The clinical manifestations of LRSAM1 mutations include late-onset axonal neuropathy, muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Some mutations result in frameshifts or premature termination codons, which can lead to nonsense-mediated decay or altered protein function (Reilich2021Location; Guernsey2010Mutation). The variability in inheritance patterns and phenotypic expression poses challenges in genetic testing and variant interpretation (Reilich2021Location).

LRSAM1 mutations have also been implicated in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington's disease, where altered LRSAM1 expression can affect protein aggregation and endosomal sorting (Mishra2019LRSAM1). These findings highlight the gene's significant role in neurobiological processes and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
LRSAM1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with TSG101, a protein involved in endosomal sorting. LRSAM1 ubiquitinates TSG101, which affects TSG101's ability to sort endosomal receptor complexes, leading to disruptions in endolysosomal degradation (Mishra2019LRSAM1). This interaction is also significant in the context of HIV, where LRSAM1 inactivates TSG101, disrupting the formation of the ESCRT complex I and reducing HIV budding (Mishra2019LRSAM1).

LRSAM1 also interacts with Hsp70, a chaperone protein, co-localizing with it in misfolded protein inclusion bodies under stress conditions. This interaction is part of a cytoprotective mechanism that enhances cell survival by alleviating proteotoxic stress (Mishra2020Ubiquitin). Additionally, LRSAM1 is involved in the degradation of the E6-AP protein, another E3 ubiquitin ligase. LRSAM1 targets E6-AP for proteasomal degradation, affecting the turnover of substrates like p53 and p27, which are involved in cell cycle regulation (Mishra2021LRSAM1).

LRSAM1's role in xenophagy involves interactions with autophagic adaptor proteins such as NDP52 and p62, marking bacterial cell walls for degradation by the autophagic system (Mishra2019LRSAM1). These interactions highlight LRSAM1's multifaceted role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target.
