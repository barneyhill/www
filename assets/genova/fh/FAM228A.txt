# FAM228A

## Overview
FAM228A is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 228, member A. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions are not fully elucidated. The gene is notable for its role in sexually dimorphic DNA methylation and gene expression patterns, particularly in the human placenta, where it exhibits sex-specific expression differences (Gonzalez2024Sexually). Additionally, FAM228A has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through gene fusion events, such as the FAM228A--FAM228B fusion, which is significantly associated with the disease (Raghav2024Identification). These findings suggest that FAM228A may have important implications in both developmental biology and disease pathology.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The FAM228A gene has been implicated in several conditions through alterations in its expression and gene fusion events. In the context of sexually dimorphic DNA methylation and gene expression patterns in the human first trimester placenta, FAM228A shows a significant inverse correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression. This suggests that female-hypermethylation leads to male-upregulated expression, indicating that methylation sex differences can alter the expression of a subset of placental genes (Gonzalez2024Sexually). Although the clinical significance of FAM228A in this context is not fully detailed, the study highlights the potential impact of methylation patterns on gene expression in a sex-specific manner (Gonzalez2024Sexually).

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a study identified a significant gene fusion event involving FAM228A, specifically the FAM228A--FAM228B fusion. This fusion was found in 59 ALS samples and none in the control group, with an odds ratio of 20.01, indicating a strong association with ALS. The study suggests that such gene fusions may play a role in the pathology of ALS, although the clinical significance of FAM228A itself is not directly addressed (Raghav2024Identification). These findings suggest that FAM228A may be involved in disease mechanisms through its altered expression and gene fusion events.
