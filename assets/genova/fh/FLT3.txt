# FLT3

## Overview
FLT3, or Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, is a gene that encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase protein, which is a member of the RTKIII family. This protein, also known as Fetal liver kinase-2 (Flk-2), plays a pivotal role in hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation, by regulating the development and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Structurally, the FLT3 protein comprises an extracellular region with immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane helix, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, which are essential for its function as a receptor. Upon ligand binding, FLT3 undergoes dimerization and activation, triggering downstream signaling pathways that are crucial for maintaining normal blood cell homeostasis. Mutations in the FLT3 gene, particularly internal tandem duplications and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain, are frequently observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor clinical outcomes, making FLT3 a significant target for therapeutic intervention (Kindler2010FLT3; Pemmaraju2011FLT3; Rombouts2000Biological).

## Structure
The FLT3 protein, also known as Fetal liver kinase-2 (Flk-2), is a receptor tyrosine kinase that belongs to the RTKIII family. It is composed of 993 amino acids and includes several distinct structural components. The primary structure features an N-terminal signal peptide, an extracellular region with five immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a transmembrane helix, a juxtamembrane region, and a tyrosine kinase domain with a kinase insert region (Verstraete2011Structural).

The extracellular region of FLT3 is characterized by a β-sandwich structure formed by the Ig-like domains, which are common in RTKIII family members. These domains include a β-strand arrangement that forms intersheet disulfide bridges (Verstraete2011Structural). The tertiary structure involves a compact cytokine-binding epitope primarily contributed by the D3 domain, which is part of the "I-set" Ig domains (Verstraete2011Structural).

FLT3 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which affects its subcellular localization and activation of downstream signaling pathways (Liu2024Importance). Splice variant isoforms of FLT3 have been identified, including a fully functional isoform lacking the fifth Ig-domain in mice (Verstraete2011Structural). The quaternary structure involves dimerization upon ligand binding, which is crucial for receptor activation (Verstraete2011Structural).

## Function
The FLT3 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase that is crucial for the regulation of hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation. In healthy human cells, FLT3 is primarily expressed on multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and progenitor cells, playing a significant role in their development and differentiation (Rombouts2000Biological). The activation of FLT3 occurs through ligand-induced dimerization, which leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. This process is essential for the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, ensuring that immature hematopoietic cells mature properly and do not accumulate abnormally (Rombouts2000Biological).

FLT3 is involved in maintaining normal homeostatic processes in the bone marrow by regulating the balance and maturation of hematopoietic cells. It is part of the signaling pathways that control the proliferation and differentiation of these stem and progenitor cells, contributing to the normal development of blood cells (Rombouts2000Biological). The receptor's activity is crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system and the maintenance of normal blood cell counts (Rombouts2000Biological).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FLT3 gene, particularly internal tandem duplications (ITDs) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), are significant in the clinical context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in AML, occurring in approximately 30% to 35% of patients (Kindler2010FLT3; Pemmaraju2011FLT3). FLT3-ITD mutations are associated with constitutive activation of the receptor, leading to aberrant activation of downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and STAT5, which promote proliferation and survival of leukemic blasts (Kindler2010FLT3). These mutations are linked to poorer clinical outcomes, including lower complete response rates and shorter disease-free and overall survival (Pemmaraju2011FLT3; Thiede2002Analysis).

FLT3-TKD mutations, while less common, also result in constitutive activation of the receptor and are associated with poor disease-free survival (Whitman2008FLT3). The expression level of the FLT3 mutant allele affects prognosis, with higher mutant-to-wild-type allele ratios correlating with worse outcomes (Pemmaraju2011FLT3). FLT3 is also expressed in a high percentage of AML blasts, indicating its significant role in these hematologic malignancies (Kindler2010FLT3). The development of FLT3 inhibitors is a focus of research, although resistance remains a challenge (Ge2022Developments).

## Interactions
FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in hematopoiesis and its role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 interacts with several Src family kinases (SFKs), including LYN, FYN, and HCK. LYN is activated by FLT3 and binds to the Y589 site on FLT3, with mutations at this site reducing LYN activation. In AML cell lines expressing FLT3-ITD, LYN is constitutively phosphorylated and binds more strongly to FLT3-ITD than to wild-type FLT3. FYN associates with FLT3 in a ligand-dependent manner and constitutively with FLT3-ITD, enhancing STAT5 phosphorylation and transformation capacity. HCK associates with phosphorylated Y589 and Y591 in FLT3's juxtamembrane region, contributing to the upregulation of CDK6, which is crucial for FLT3-ITD's transforming capacity (Kazi2019The).

FLT3 also interacts with the SET protein, which is involved in its membrane trafficking. In FLT3 wild-type cells, SET co-localizes with FLT3 near the membrane, a process modulated by the CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 and the RAC1 inhibitor EHop-016. This interaction is significantly reduced in cells with the FLT3-ITD mutation (Marcotegui2023Set).
