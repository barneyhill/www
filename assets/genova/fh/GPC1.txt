# GPC1

## Overview
GPC1, or glypican 1, is a gene that encodes the glypican-1 protein, a member of the glypican family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These proteoglycans are characterized by their attachment to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, classifying them as GPI-anchored proteins. Glypican-1 is predominantly expressed in the human brain and plays a crucial role in modulating cell signaling pathways, particularly those involving heparan sulfate-binding growth factors. It acts as a co-receptor, enhancing the signaling of growth factors that are vital for cell growth, differentiation, and neural development. The protein's structure, featuring an elongated core protein with heparan sulfate chains, allows it to participate in various cellular interactions, influencing processes such as cell cycle regulation and neural precursor proliferation. GPC1's involvement in these pathways underscores its significance in both normal physiological functions and pathological conditions, including its emerging role as a biomarker in cancer diagnostics and therapeutics (Awad2015Structural; Litwack1998Expression; Qiao2013Glypican).

## Structure
Glypican-1 (GPC1) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan predominantly found in the human brain. Its molecular structure is characterized by a core protein with an N-terminal region (residues 24-474) and a C-terminal glycosaminoglycan (GAG) attachment region (residues 475-530), which ends with hydrophobic residues linking it to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Awad2015Structural). The core protein exhibits an elongated cylindrical form with an all α-helical fold and three major loops, including a Cys-rich lobe, a central lobe stabilized by hydrophobic cores, and a protease site lobe (Awad2015Structural).

GPC1 is decorated with two N-linked glycans at Asn-79 and Asn-116, and three heparan sulfate chains at Ser-486, Ser-488, and Ser-490 (Awad2015Structural). The N-glycans are highly heterogeneous, with core fucosylation and sialylation, and they play a role in preventing aggregation and limiting proteolysis (Awad2015Structural). The C-terminal region is highly flexible, extending approximately 35-40 Å from the core protein, with the GPI anchor adding additional length, positioning the core protein about 44-53 Å from the cell membrane (Awad2015Structural).

GPC1 can form dimers at higher concentrations, as indicated by shifts in elution peaks and changes in SAXS curves (Awad2015Structural). The presence of N-glycans, particularly at Asn-79, is crucial for preventing aggregation and degradation (Awad2015Structural). The protein's structure is conserved across various species, including humans, mice, and rats (Awad2015Structural).

## Function
Glypican 1 (GPC1) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface molecule that acts as a coreceptor for heparan sulfate-binding growth factors, amplifying their signals and influencing cell growth and differentiation (Qiao2013Glypican). GPC1 is involved in the regulation of the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, promoting DNA replication and cell cycle progression. It achieves this by upregulating cyclin E and CDK2, while downregulating Cip/Kip cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), leading to the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin A-CDK2 complexes (Qiao2013Glypican).

GPC1 is also implicated in the activation of signaling pathways such as Erk1/2 and Akt, although these alone do not fully account for its effects, suggesting the involvement of distinct signaling pathways (Qiao2013Glypican). In the nervous system, GPC1 is expressed in neurons and neuroepithelia, localizing to axons and synaptic terminal fields, indicating a role in neural development and axon targeting (Litwack1998Expression). Its expression is associated with the regulation of cellular responses to heparin-binding growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factors, which are crucial for neural precursor proliferation and neuronal survival (Litwack1998Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Glypican 1 (GPC1) is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), GPC1 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with poor prognosis and larger tumor sizes. GPC1-expressing exosomes have shown high sensitivity and specificity for early-stage PDAC detection, making it a promising diagnostic marker (Furini2021Expression; Lu2017Elevated). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GPC1 is upregulated, particularly in metastatic cases, and is associated with shorter recurrence-free and disease-specific survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic factor (Chen2020High).

GPC1 also plays a role in prostate cancer, where its expression varies across cell lines. Inhibition of GPC1 in certain prostate cancer cells can decrease growth and migration, while in others, it may increase these activities, suggesting a complex role in tumor progression (Quach2019Paradoxical). Additionally, GPC1 is involved in angiogenesis and metastasis in cancers like melanoma and pancreatic cancer, with its absence leading to reduced metastasis and angiogenesis (Aikawa2008Glypican1). These findings highlight GPC1's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
Glypican-1 (GPC1) is a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan that participates in various interactions with proteins and signaling pathways. GPC1 acts as a co-receptor for heparin-binding growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), enhancing their mitogenic effects in pancreatic cancer cells (Kleeff1998The). It facilitates the assembly and stabilization of FGF-2 and its receptor FGFR, promoting signal transduction in pathways like protein kinase B (PKB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Wang2019The).

GPC1 also interacts with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), playing a role in angiogenesis by modulating VEGF signaling (Lund2020The; Li2020The). In the context of the Wnt signaling pathway, GPC1 has been shown to interact with Wnt-3a, suggesting a potential role in influencing the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells (de2021The). These interactions highlight GPC1's involvement in critical signaling pathways that contribute to cancer progression and metastasis.
