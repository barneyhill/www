# TTC17

## Overview
TTC17 is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 17, which is involved in various cellular processes, including actin organization, ciliogenesis, and Golgi apparatus function. The protein is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions (Bontems2014C2orf62). TTC17 plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and is implicated in lipid metabolism through its interactions with proteins such as ENPP7 and NAAA (Bassaganyas2019New). Additionally, TTC17 is involved in the RAP1/CDC42 signaling pathway, which is significant in the context of breast cancer metastasis, where its loss leads to increased cell motility and invasiveness (Zhang2023Loss). The gene's expression levels have clinical significance, particularly in breast cancer, where its downregulation is associated with poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential (Zhang2023Loss).

## Clinical Significance
The TTC17 gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of breast cancer (BC). Alterations in TTC17 expression are associated with the progression and metastasis of BC. Specifically, TTC17 is downregulated in breast cancer tissues, and its low expression correlates with worse clinical outcomes, including increased malignancy and poorer prognosis (Zhang2023Loss). The loss of TTC17 function promotes metastatic properties in BC cells, enhancing their migration, invasion, and colony formation capabilities both in vitro and in vivo (Zhang2023Loss).

Mechanistically, the loss of TTC17 activates the RAP1/CDC42 signaling pathway, which is crucial for cancer metastasis. This activation leads to cytoskeletal disorganization in BC cells, facilitating their metastatic potential (Zhang2023Loss). Clinically, low TTC17 expression is linked to more aggressive clinicopathological features and higher histopathologic grades (Zhang2023Loss).

Additionally, TTC17 deficiency increases the sensitivity of BC cells to certain anticancer drugs, such as rapamycin and paclitaxel, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment response and a target for therapeutic intervention (Zhang2023Loss).

## Interactions
TTC17 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It has been identified as a partner of C2orf62, a protein involved in actin organization and ciliogenesis. This interaction was confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and GST pull-down assays, indicating that TTC17 and C2orf62 may contribute to similar biological functions, particularly in ciliogenesis (Bontems2014C2orf62). 

TTC17 is also involved in the RAP1/CDC42 signaling pathway, which is crucial for breast cancer metastasis. The loss of TTC17 activates this pathway, leading to increased cell motility and invasiveness. This interaction is characterized by an inverse correlation between TTC17 expression and the expression of key components of the pathway, such as RAP1A, RAP1B, and CDC42 (Zhang2023Loss).

In the context of the Golgi apparatus, TTC17 interacts with proteins involved in maintaining Golgi structure and function. Its depletion disrupts the polarized organization of Golgi cisternae, affecting glycosylation processes. TTC17 is suggested to interact with proteins involved in sphingomyelin metabolism, such as ENPP7 and NAAA, indicating a role in lipid production and distribution (Bassaganyas2019New).
