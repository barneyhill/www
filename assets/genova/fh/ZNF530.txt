# ZNF530

## Overview
ZNF530 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 530, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of zinc finger domains, which are known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger protein 530 is categorized as a transcriptional regulator, and it is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression modulation and epigenetic regulation. The protein's function is particularly significant in the context of cancer, where it is part of the KRAB-ZNF factors that interact with the TRIM28/KRAB complex, contributing to the epigenetic repression of target genes (Machnik2019The). Additionally, ZNF530 has been implicated in other conditions such as steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, where it is thought to play a role in immune response regulation (Stone2021Comprehensive). Despite its involvement in these processes, the full spectrum of ZNF530's biological functions and clinical implications remains an active area of research.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF530 has been implicated in various diseases through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, ZNF530 is part of a group of KRAB-ZNF factors that are commonly upregulated in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. This upregulation is associated with the TRIM28/KRAB complex, which is involved in the epigenetic repression of specific target genes, potentially contributing to cancer cell alterations (Machnik2019The). In ovarian cancer with somatic BRCA2 mutations, ZNF530 is upregulated, suggesting its involvement in pathways related to carcinogenesis and cancer progression (Arakelyan2021Transcriptome).

ZNF530 is also associated with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). It is identified as a transcriptional regulator with enriched binding at SSNS risk loci, indicating its potential involvement in the disease's genetic etiology. This suggests a role in immune response regulation, although the specific clinical significance of ZNF530 in SSNS remains to be fully elucidated (Stone2021Comprehensive).

In familial chronic megacolon, ZNF530 was considered as a candidate gene, but it was found to have no known association with gastrointestinal or neurological diseases, and its variants were predicted to be benign (Camilleri2019Familial).
