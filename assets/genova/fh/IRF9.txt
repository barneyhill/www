# IRF9

## Overview
IRF9 is a gene that encodes the protein interferon regulatory factor 9, a transcription factor integral to the immune response, particularly in mediating the effects of type I interferons (IFNs). The IRF9 protein is a member of the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and is characterized by its DNA-binding domain and IRF-associated domain, which facilitate its role in forming the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex with STAT1 and STAT2. This complex is essential for the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are crucial for antiviral defense (Platanitis2019A; Paul2018Interferon). IRF9 also forms a STAT2-IRF9 complex that can function independently of STAT1, contributing to basal ISG expression and prolonged antiviral responses (Blaszczyk2015STAT2IRF9). The protein's interactions and post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and phosphorylation, are vital for its regulatory functions in immune signaling pathways (Paul2018Interferon; Paul2023Phosphorylation).

## Structure
IRF9, a member of the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), has a distinct molecular structure characterized by specific domains. It contains a DNA-binding domain (DBD) at the N-terminus, which is a helix-turn-helix motif with five conserved tryptophan residues crucial for DNA interaction (Sobhkhez2014Structural; Paul2018Interferon). The IRF-associated domain (IAD) at the C-terminus is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly with STAT2, forming part of the ISGF3 complex (Paul2018Interferon). The IAD retains a crescent shape similar to the Mad-homology 2 domain fold found in other IRFs (Paul2018Interferon).

IRF9 lacks an autoinhibitory domain, which is present in other IRFs, suggesting it may be constitutively active (Paul2018Interferon). The protein also features a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), facilitating its shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus (Paul2018Interferon). Post-translational modifications include acetylation at Lys81, essential for DNA binding and ISGF3 complex formation, and phosphorylation at serine residues S252 and S253, which may regulate its activity (Paul2018Interferon; Paul2023Phosphorylation). These structural features and modifications are critical for IRF9's role in the immune response.

## Function
Interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) is a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the immune response by mediating the effects of type I interferons (IFNs). In healthy human cells, IRF9 is a component of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, which also includes STAT1 and STAT2. This complex is crucial for the transcriptional activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that are essential for antiviral defense (Platanitis2019A; Paul2018Interferon).

IRF9 can form a complex with STAT2 even in the absence of STAT1, known as the STAT2-IRF9 complex, which can drive the expression of certain ISGs independently of STAT1. This complex is involved in basal ISG expression and can provide a prolonged antiviral response (Blaszczyk2015STAT2IRF9; Platanitis2019A). IRF9 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it shuttles to facilitate the transcription of ISGs (Paul2018Interferon).

IRF9 also participates in the formation of the unphosphorylated ISGF3 (U-ISGF3) complex, which sustains the expression of ISGs in the absence of continuous IFN signaling, contributing to prolonged antiviral states and resistance to DNA damage (Cheon2013IFNβdependent).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the IRF9 gene are implicated in several diseases and conditions. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), IRF9 is crucial for the production of IgG autoantibodies and the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in B cells. Mice deficient in IRF9 show defects in TLR7 and TLR9 expression, leading to impaired B cell responses and reduced autoantibody production, which are characteristic of these autoimmune diseases (Thibault2008IRF9; Antonczyk2019Direct).

IRF9 deficiency also affects antiviral immunity. Homozygous IRF9 mutations can result in a phenotype similar to STAT2 deficiency, impacting IFN-I and IFN-III signaling pathways. This deficiency has been observed in children with increased susceptibility to viral infections, highlighting the gene's role in immune defense (Duncan2021Genetic).

Altered IRF9 expression is linked to cancer progression. In lung cancer, IRF9, in conjunction with unphosphorylated STAT2, enhances IL6 expression, promoting STAT3 activation, which supports cancer cell survival and proliferation. High levels of IRF9 correlate with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients (Nan2018IRF9).

## Interactions
IRF9, a key component of the interferon signaling pathway, participates in several critical protein interactions. It forms a complex with STAT1 and STAT2, known as the ISGF3 complex, which is essential for the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). This complex binds to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in DNA, facilitating gene expression in response to interferon signals (Platanitis2019A; Wu2017Interaction).

IRF9 also interacts with STAT2 independently of STAT1, forming a STAT2-IRF9 complex that can regulate basal ISG expression without interferon signaling. This complex is involved in the transition to the ISGF3 complex upon interferon treatment, highlighting a dynamic switch in transcriptional regulation (Platanitis2019A).

In addition to its role in ISGF3, IRF9 interacts with Cyclophilin A (CypA), a component of the ISGF3 complex. This interaction is specific and can be inhibited by CypA inhibitors, suggesting a regulatory role in IFN-induced transcriptional activities (Bobardt2013HCV).

IRF9's interaction with STAT2 is also targeted by viral proteins, such as the measles virus V protein, which competes with IRF9 for binding to STAT2. This competition can disrupt the formation of the ISGF3 complex, illustrating a mechanism of viral immune evasion (Nagano2020The).
