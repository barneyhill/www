# GOLGA8M

## Overview
GOLGA8M is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A8 family member M, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. Golgins are a group of coiled-coil proteins that are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. The golgin A8 family member M is thought to play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and facilitating vesicular transport processes. Although the specific functions of GOLGA8M and its encoded protein are not fully elucidated, they are believed to be involved in cellular processes that are essential for proper cell function and homeostasis. Further research is needed to fully understand the biological roles and potential clinical significance of GOLGA8M (Qiu2020aarFDC).
