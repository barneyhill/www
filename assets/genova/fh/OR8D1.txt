# OR8D1

## Overview
OR8D1 is a gene that encodes the olfactory receptor family 8 subfamily D member 1, a protein that belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are characterized by their seven-transmembrane domain structure, which is essential for their role in signal transduction. The OR8D1 protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, contributing to the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating neuronal responses. This receptor is active in the olfactory epithelium and is associated with the perception of complex scents such as burnt, caramel, coffee, maple, sugar, and sweet (Achebouche2022Application). The protein's function is facilitated by its interaction with G proteins, which are crucial for the signaling pathways that lead to olfactory perception (Kotthoff2021Conserved). The structural and functional characteristics of OR8D1 underscore its significance in the olfactory system, although its broader physiological roles remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
The OR8D1 protein is a member of the olfactory receptor family, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure. This structure is typical of GPCRs and involves a sequence of amino acids forming the primary structure, with the secondary structure comprising alpha helices (Man2004Prediction). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of these helices, creating a pocket-like region that is crucial for ligand binding (Man2004Prediction). 

The predicted binding site residues of OR8D1 are located primarily in the transmembrane helices 2 to 7 and the second extracellular loop, aligning with known ligand-contact residues in other rhodopsin-like GPCRs (Man2004Prediction). This alignment suggests a structural similarity to other GPCRs, such as the human D2 dopamine receptor, where the binding site residues overlap with the retinal binding site in rhodopsin (Man2004Prediction). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, are common in olfactory receptors, although specific modifications for OR8D1 are not detailed in the provided context. The study of OR8D1 in human spermatozoa also identified antisense transcripts, indicating complex regulation at the RNA level (Flegel2016Characterization).

## Function
OR8D1 is an olfactory receptor protein that plays a role in the detection of specific odor molecules. It is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is involved in initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell. In healthy human cells, OR8D1 is primarily active in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds to specific odorants. This binding triggers neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Achebouche2022Application).

The receptor is associated with odors such as burnt, carmellic, coffee, maple, sugar, and sweet, indicating its role in detecting a range of complex scents (Achebouche2022Application). The molecular processes involving OR8D1 include the binding of odorant molecules, which activates the receptor and initiates a cascade of intracellular events. These events typically involve the activation of G-proteins, which then influence various downstream signaling pathways, ultimately leading to a neuronal response that is interpreted as a specific smell by the brain.

While OR8D1's specific function in other tissues or its broader physiological roles in humans are not detailed in the available context, its primary function is clearly linked to olfactory perception.

## Interactions
OR8D1, a member of the olfactory receptor family, is involved in interactions crucial for its function in odor detection. The receptor's C-terminal motifs play a significant role in its interactions with other proteins, particularly G proteins, which are essential for its signaling pathway. These motifs are highly conserved and overlap with amphipathic helix 8, known for its involvement in G protein coupling and receptor dimerization (Kotthoff2021Conserved). Mutations in these motifs, such as the 'RxK' motif, can significantly affect signaling efficacy, indicating their importance in receptor function (Kotthoff2021Conserved).

Truncation studies on OR8D1 have shown that removing specific C-terminal amino acids leads to a reduction in surface expression and signaling efficacy, suggesting that these motifs are crucial for proper receptor function and interaction with G proteins (Kotthoff2021Conserved). The presence of conserved motifs in non-C-terminal intracellular domains, such as the 'RxR' motif, may also function as an ER retention signal, further influencing the receptor's trafficking and signaling (Kotthoff2021Conserved). These interactions highlight the complex network of protein interactions that facilitate OR8D1's role in olfactory signaling.
