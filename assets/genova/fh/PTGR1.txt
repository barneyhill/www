# PTGR1

## Overview
PTGR1, or prostaglandin reductase 1, is a gene that encodes an enzyme belonging to the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) superfamily. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids by catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of the α,β-double bond in aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and ketones, including 15-keto-prostaglandins (Mesa2015Human). The protein product of PTGR1 is a dimeric enzyme with significant implications in cellular processes such as inflammation regulation and oxidative stress response, due to its ability to inactivate reactive lipid electrophiles (SánchezRodríguez2014Increased). PTGR1's expression and activity are intricately regulated by various factors, including microRNAs and transcription factors, which influence its role in health and disease, particularly in the context of cancer (Ye2023Metformin; Kang2017Novel). The enzyme's involvement in cancer progression, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker (SánchezRodríguez2017Ptgr1).

## Structure
The human prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1) enzyme is a member of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) superfamily and is involved in the inactivation of prostaglandins and other eicosanoids. The enzyme catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of the α,β-double bond of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes and ketones, including 15-keto-prostaglandins (Mesa2015Human). 

PTGR1 has a preference for NADPH over NADH, with a lower K_m value for NADPH, indicating a higher affinity for this cofactor (Mesa2015Human). The enzyme is a dimer with a molecular weight of approximately 65 kDa, as determined by gel filtration-HPLC, and each subunit has a size of about 36 kDa, as indicated by SDS-PAGE (Mesa2015Human). 

Structural studies have identified key active-site residues, such as Arg56 and Tyr245, which are crucial for substrate binding, particularly for 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 (15-keto-PGE2) (Mesa2015Human). The enzyme's structure has been analyzed through docking models, providing insights into the binding interactions within the active site (Mesa2015Human). The three-dimensional structure of PTGR1 has been referenced with PDB ID 2Y05, which provides further insights into its molecular structure (Mesa2015Human).

## Function
PTGR1 (prostaglandin reductase 1) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of prostaglandins, which are lipid compounds with hormone-like effects involved in various physiological processes. PTGR1 catalyzes the reduction of 15-keto-prostaglandins to their respective 13,14-dihydro metabolites, thereby inactivating these signaling molecules and regulating prostaglandin signaling pathways (SánchezRodríguez2014Increased). This enzymatic activity is important for maintaining the balance of prostaglandin levels, which are involved in inflammation and smooth muscle function.

In healthy human cells, PTGR1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the inactivation of eicosanoids, such as leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2, which have high biological activity (SánchezRodríguez2014Increased). PTGR1 also exhibits antioxidative functions by reducing unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, including the reduction of fatty acid nitroalkenes to nitroalkanes, thus inactivating reactive lipid electrophiles (SánchezRodríguez2014Increased). This activity helps protect cells from oxidative stress and contributes to cellular homeostasis. The enzyme's role in these processes underscores its importance in regulating inflammation and maintaining cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PTGR1 gene have been implicated in the development and progression of several cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PTGR1 is significantly overexpressed in HCC, both in human clinical samples and experimental rat models, suggesting its involvement in liver cancer progression (SánchezRodríguez2014Increased; SánchezRodríguez2017Ptgr1). The increased expression of PTGR1 in tumor tissues is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and resistance to oxidative stress, which are key factors in tumorigenesis (SánchezRodríguez2017Ptgr1). 

In addition to its role in HCC, PTGR1 is overexpressed in other cancers, such as bladder and gastric carcinomas, indicating its broader oncogenic potential (SánchezRodríguez2017Ptgr1). The regulation of PTGR1 expression is influenced by the transcription factor NRF2, which, when constitutively active, may promote tumorigenesis by enhancing PTGR1 expression (Lee2023The; SánchezRodríguez2017Ptgr1). 

Furthermore, PTGR1's expression is modulated by interactions with Z-DNA forming sequences and microRNAs, such as miR-6867-5p, which can inhibit its expression by binding to these sequences (Lee2024The). These regulatory mechanisms highlight PTGR1 as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker for cancer diagnosis and treatment.

## Interactions
PTGR1, or prostaglandin reductase 1, is involved in various interactions that influence its expression and function. It is regulated by miR-522-3p, a microRNA that binds to the 3'UTR region of PTGR1, affecting its expression levels. Experiments using miR-522-3p inhibitors and mimics have shown that miR-522-3p can decrease or increase PTGR1 expression, respectively, indicating a direct regulatory interaction (Kang2017Novel). 

PTGR1 expression is also influenced by the transcription factors SRF and RUNX3, which are involved in its upregulation through a super-enhancer mechanism in prostate cancer cells. This interaction is significant in the context of metformin resistance, where increased PTGR1 expression is associated with cell cycle progression and reduced drug efficacy (Ye2023Metformin).

Additionally, PTGR1 interacts with HMGB1 (High-Mobility Group Box 1), which can induce PTGR1 expression. This interaction is part of a regulatory mechanism where HMGB1 down-regulates miR-522-3p, thereby affecting PTGR1 levels. This pathway also impacts cellular processes such as phagocytosis (Kang2017Novel).
