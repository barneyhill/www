# PIPOX

## Overview
The PIPOX gene encodes the enzyme pipecolic acid and sarcosine oxidase, which is involved in the catabolism of pipecolic acid and sarcosine, key components of the lysine degradation pathway. This enzyme is categorized as an oxidase and is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by regulating the NADPH/NADP+ ratio and contributing to redox homeostasis (Natarajan2016Evidence). Additionally, PIPOX is active in peroxisomes, where it aids in cellular detoxification and energy metabolism (Kim2022Peroxisomal). The enzyme's activity is linked to important signaling pathways, such as mTORC2 and Akt, which are crucial for cell survival (Natarajan2016Evidence). Alterations in PIPOX expression have clinical implications, particularly in breast cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease prognosis and subtype differentiation (Yoon2014Implications).

## Structure


## Function
Pipecolic acid and sarcosine oxidase, encoded by the PIPOX gene, plays a crucial role in the catabolism of pipecolic acid and sarcosine, which are part of the lysine degradation pathway. This enzyme is primarily localized in the mitochondria of HEK293 cells, where it contributes to cellular protection against oxidative stress, particularly hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death (Natarajan2016Evidence). PIPOX oxidizes pipecolate to Δ1-piperideine-6-carboxylate, which subsequently hydrolyzes to α-aminoadipate semialdehyde, a process essential for mitigating oxidative stress (Natarajan2016Evidence).

The enzyme's activity is linked to the regulation of the NADPH/NADP+ ratio, which is important for maintaining redox homeostasis during oxidative stress (Natarajan2016Evidence). Although PIPOX generates hydrogen peroxide during its catalytic turnover, its exact mechanism of electron transfer to the mitochondrial electron transport chain remains unclear (Natarajan2016Evidence). PIPOX's protective role is also associated with signaling pathways, including mTORC2 and Akt, which are involved in cell survival mechanisms (Natarajan2016Evidence). Despite its mitochondrial localization, PIPOX is also recognized for its activity in peroxisomes, contributing to cellular detoxification and energy metabolism (Kim2022Peroxisomal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PIPOX gene, which encodes pipecolic acid and sarcosine oxidase, have been implicated in various clinical outcomes, particularly in the context of breast cancer. The expression of PIPOX, along with other sarcosine metabolism-related proteins such as GNMT and SARDH, varies significantly across different molecular subtypes of breast cancer. HER-2 type tumors frequently express PIPOX, while triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors exhibit the least expression of these proteins (Yoon2014Implications). 

Clinically, the expression of PIPOX is associated with breast cancer prognosis. Tumoral PIPOX negativity is linked to shorter disease-free survival in breast cancer patients, indicating its potential role in tumor progression and patient outcomes (Yoon2014Implications). Although PIPOX expression was not highlighted as an independent factor in multivariate analyses for any specific breast cancer subtype, its expression patterns suggest a correlation with clinicopathologic factors such as lower Ki-67 labeling index, which is indicative of lower proliferative activity (Yoon2014Implications).

These findings suggest that PIPOX, through its involvement in sarcosine metabolism, may play a role in the differentiation and prognosis of breast cancer subtypes, potentially serving as a biomarker for disease progression and therapeutic targeting.
