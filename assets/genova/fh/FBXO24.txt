# FBXO24

## Overview
FBXO24 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 24, a member of the F-box protein family characterized by an F-box motif that mediates protein-protein interactions. This protein is a crucial component of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a significant role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. F-box protein 24 is predominantly expressed in the testis and is essential for spermiogenesis, the process of sperm maturation. It is involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA splicing, chromatin remodeling, and mitochondrial dynamics, which are critical for normal sperm development and male fertility (Kaneda2024FBXO24; Li2024FBXO24). Additionally, FBXO24 has been implicated in immune response regulation, suggesting its broader biological significance beyond reproductive functions (Johnson2024Targeted).

## Function
FBXO24 is a testis-enriched F-box protein that plays a crucial role in spermiogenesis, the post-meiotic phase of male gametogenesis, which is essential for sperm maturation. It is highly expressed in round and elongating spermatids and is involved in several molecular processes critical for normal sperm formation and male fertility. FBXO24 interacts with splicing factors such as SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9 to modulate mRNA alternative splicing in round spermatids, affecting the expression of genes related to chromatin, mitochondria, and flagellum formation (Li2023FBXO24; Li2024FBXO24).

FBXO24 also mediates the degradation of MIWI, a protein crucial for piRNA production, through K48-linked polyubiquitination. This process is essential for maintaining normal piRNA levels, which are important for sperm development (Li2023FBXO24; Li2024FBXO24). The protein is involved in the histone-to-protamine transition, a critical step for chromatin condensation in mature sperm, and regulates mitochondrial dynamics, impacting mitochondrial architecture and sperm motility (Li2023FBXO24; Li2024FBXO24). FBXO24's role in these processes is vital for proper spermiogenesis, and its deficiency can lead to male infertility (Li2023FBXO24).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the FBXO24 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in male infertility. FBXO24 is crucial for normal spermatogenesis, and its deletion in mice leads to male sterility due to impaired sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology, including defects in the flagella and acrosome reaction (Kaneda2024FBXO24). The absence of FBXO24 results in the accumulation of membraneless electron-dense granules in sperm flagella, which are associated with reduced sperm motility and male infertility (Kaneda2024FBXO24). 

FBXO24 also plays a role in the degradation of proteins such as MIWI and IPO5, and its deficiency leads to the upregulation of piRNAs and aberrant histone retention, contributing to defective sperm formation (Zhuang2024The; Li2024FBXO24). These molecular disruptions highlight the gene's importance in maintaining normal sperm structure and function, and suggest that alterations in FBXO24 could be a target for infertility treatments.

In addition to its role in fertility, FBXO24 is involved in immune responses. Its deletion enhances innate immunity, as evidenced by increased proinflammatory mediators and altered immune responses in bacterial infections (Johnson2024Targeted). This suggests potential therapeutic applications in modulating immune responses through FBXO24 pathways.

## Interactions
FBXO24, an F-box protein, is involved in several critical protein interactions that are essential for spermiogenesis and male fertility. It interacts with splicing factors such as SRSF2, SRSF3, and SRSF9, which are involved in mRNA alternative splicing in round spermatids. These interactions are crucial for the proper splicing of mRNA transcripts necessary for sperm formation (Li2023FBXO24; Li2024FBXO24).

FBXO24 also interacts with MIWI, a protein involved in the piRNA pathway, and mediates its degradation through K48-linked polyubiquitination. This interaction is significant for regulating mitochondrial organization and chromatin condensation in spermatozoa (Li2023FBXO24; Li2024FBXO24). The F-box and RCC1 domains of FBXO24 are responsible for binding with MIWI (Li2024FBXO24).

FBXO24 is part of the SCF (Skp, Cullin, F-box containing) complex, interacting with subunits such as CUL1, SKP1, and RBX1. These interactions facilitate the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins like MIWI (Kaneda2024FBXO24; Li2023FBXO24). FBXO24 also interacts with IPO5, suggesting a role in protein degradation and regulation of RNP granule formation in sperm flagella (Kaneda2024FBXO24).
