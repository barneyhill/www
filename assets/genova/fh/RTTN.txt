# RTTN

## Overview
The RTTN gene encodes the rotatin protein, a critical component in cellular processes, particularly in centriole biogenesis and mitotic progression. Rotatin is characterized by its alpha-solenoid structure, which facilitates diverse protein-protein interactions essential for its function (Fournier2013Functional). As a centrosomal protein, rotatin plays a pivotal role in centriole assembly and elongation, interacting with key proteins such as STIL and CEP295 to ensure proper centriole formation and mitotic spindle integrity (Chen2017Human; Chou2021Human). Mutations in the RTTN gene are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including primary microcephaly and primordial dwarfism, due to their impact on cellular division and brain development (Shamseldin2015RTTN; Vandervore2019Heterogeneous). The gene's involvement in these critical cellular and developmental pathways underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper neurological function.

## Structure
RTTN (rotatin) is a large human protein composed of 2226 amino acids, primarily characterized by its alpha-solenoid structure. The protein is hypothesized to be largely composed of alpha-helical regions, as indicated by multiple sequence alignments with its homologs in other species (Fournier2013Functional). The presence of alpha-solenoids suggests that RTTN may have diverse interaction capabilities, including protein-protein interactions, which are typical of such structures (Fournier2013Functional).

RTTN interacts with mitotic centrosomes and is essential for cilia function, indicating its role in cellular structural processes (Fournier2013Functional). The protein is also involved in centriole biogenesis, where it interacts with the STIL protein and acts downstream of STIL-mediated centriole assembly. This interaction is crucial for building full-length centrioles, highlighting RTTN's role in centriole elongation (Chen2017Human).

Mutations in RTTN, such as the A578P variant, affect its binding affinity to STIL, which can disrupt normal centriole duplication and lead to conditions like primary microcephaly (Chen2017Human). The protein's structure and interactions are critical for its function in cellular processes.

## Function
The RTTN gene encodes the rotatin protein, which plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, particularly in centriole biogenesis and mitotic progression. In healthy human cells, rotatin is involved in the assembly and elongation of centrioles, acting as an upstream effector of CEP295, which is essential for recruiting later-born centriolar proteins such as POC5 and POC1B (Chen2017Human). Rotatin interacts with STIL and is necessary for building full-length centrioles, although it is not required for the initial stages of centriole assembly (Chen2017Human).

Rotatin is also critical for proper mitotic progression and spindle pole integrity. It ensures the correct localization of proteins like NuMA and p150Glued, which are vital for tethering microtubules to spindle poles (Chou2021Human). The absence of RTTN leads to mitotic abnormalities, such as monopolar and multipolar spindles, and affects spindle orientation by disrupting astral microtubule assembly (Chou2021Human). These disruptions can result in cell cycle arrest and increased aneuploidy, highlighting the gene's importance in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division (Chou2021Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RTTN gene, which encodes the protein rotatin, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include primary microcephaly, characterized by a reduced brain size and intellectual disability, and primordial dwarfism, which involves severe growth retardation and microcephaly (Shamseldin2015RTTN; Vandervore2019Heterogeneous). RTTN mutations are also linked to cerebral malformations such as polymicrogyria, lissencephaly, and cerebellar dysplasia, often accompanied by seizures and developmental delays (Romano2023Case; Vandervore2019Heterogeneous).

The clinical severity of these conditions is influenced by the residual function of the rotatin protein, with more severe phenotypes resulting from mutations that significantly impair protein function (Vandervore2019Heterogeneous). RTTN mutations can lead to mitotic defects, centrosome amplification, and ciliogenesis disruption, contributing to neuronal progenitor depletion and cortical malformations (Vandervore2019Heterogeneous; Chou2021Human). These cellular abnormalities result in a spectrum of clinical presentations, including intellectual disability, speech absence, and various congenital malformations (Mudassir2023Microcephaly; Romano2023Case). The heterogeneity of RTTN-related disorders underscores the complex role of this gene in brain development and its impact on neurological health.

## Interactions
RTTN (rotatin) is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for centriole biogenesis and cellular processes. It directly interacts with the protein STIL, which is crucial for the recruitment of later-born centriolar proteins like POC5 and POC1B to the distal-half centrioles. This interaction is vital for building full-length centrioles, and mutations in RTTN, such as A578P, reduce its binding affinity for STIL, potentially leading to primary microcephaly (Chen2017Human).

RTTN also interacts with CEP295, acting as an upstream effector in centriole assembly. This interaction is necessary for the proper loading of centriolar proteins and centriole elongation (Chen2017Human). Additionally, RTTN interacts with PPP1R35, a centrosomal protein that regulates centriole length. The interaction between RTTN and PPP1R35 is crucial for their mutual recruitment to the centriole, with RTTN acting upstream in this process (Sydor2018PPP1R35).

In the context of neuronal migration, RTTN interacts with the non-muscle cellular heavy chain myosin complex, including MYH10 and MYO18A, which are significant for cell division and neuronal migration (Vandervore2019Heterogeneous). These interactions highlight RTTN's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and development.
