# CLEC2A

## Overview
CLEC2A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain family 2 member A, also known as CLEC-2. This protein is a type II transmembrane receptor characterized by its C-type lectin-like domain, which plays a pivotal role in immune surveillance and platelet activation. CLEC-2 is primarily expressed on the surface of platelets and certain immune cells, where it functions as a receptor involved in thrombo-inflammatory processes and immune response regulation. The protein's ability to form non-disulfide-linked homodimers is crucial for its interaction with ligands such as podoplanin and rhodocytin, facilitating platelet aggregation and activation. Additionally, CLEC2A is implicated in the regulation of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) invasion and immune interactions, particularly through its role as a ligand for the NK cell receptor NKp65, highlighting its significance in both hemostatic and immune functions (Watson2009The; GonçalvesMaia2020NK).

## Structure
The CLEC2A protein, also known as CLEC-2, is a type II transmembrane receptor composed of 229 amino acids. Its structure includes an extracellular C-type lectin-like domain, a stalk region, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Martin2021The). The extracellular domain contains three disulfide bridges, which are crucial for maintaining the C-type lectin fold, located between residues C102-C113, C130-C216, and C195-C208 (Martin2021The). The protein also features N-linked glycosylation sites at N120, N134, and N68, which are important for its expression on the cell surface (Martin2021The).

CLEC2A exists as both a monomer and a non-disulfide-linked homodimer on the platelet surface, with dimerization facilitated by hydrophobic interactions rather than disulfide bonds (Watson2009The). The dimeric form is crucial for its signaling function, as it allows interaction with ligands such as podoplanin and rhodocytin, leading to platelet activation (Martin2021The; Watson2009The). The protein's quaternary structure involves dimerization, which is essential for its function in platelet aggregation and thrombus formation (Watson2009The).

## Function
CLEC2A, a member of the C-type lectin domain family, plays a significant role in immune surveillance and the regulation of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) invasion. In healthy human cells, CLEC2A is expressed in primary dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes at all stages of differentiation in the epidermis. It acts as a ligand for the activating NK cell receptor NKp65, facilitating interactions between fibroblasts and natural killer (NK) cells. This interaction is crucial for immune surveillance, potentially aiding in the elimination of cancer cells at early stages of tumorigenesis (GonçalvesMaia2020NK).

The expression of CLEC2A is essential for maintaining effective immune responses, as its absence in fibroblasts from xeroderma pigmentosum (XP-C) patients and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is associated with compromised immune function and increased cancer invasion. The downregulation of CLEC2A by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1a, and IL-1b, which are prevalent in the tumor microenvironment, further underscores its role in immune regulation and cancer progression (GonçalvesMaia2020NK). The presence of CLEC2A in dermal fibroblasts highlights its importance in the crosstalk between fibroblasts and NK cells, which is vital for controlling cancer progression in the skin (GonçalvesMaia2020NK).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLEC2A gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). In patients with XP, especially those in the XP-C complementation group, there is a notable loss of CLEC2A expression in dermal fibroblasts. This loss is also observed in sporadic cancer-associated fibroblasts and when fibroblasts are exposed to SCC-conditioned medium. The absence of CLEC2A expression in XP-C fibroblasts disrupts the interaction between fibroblasts and natural killer (NK) cells, which is crucial for immune surveillance, potentially leading to uncontrolled SCC invasion and increased cancer susceptibility (GonçalvesMaia2020NK).

In the tumor microenvironment of SCC, CLEC2A expression is downregulated, particularly in cancer-associated fibroblasts. This downregulation is influenced by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-1a, and IL-1b, which are prevalent in the tumor microenvironment and may contribute to tumor escape from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (GonçalvesMaia2020NK). The interaction between CLEC2A and the NK cell receptor NKp65 is essential for controlling SCC invasion, and alterations in this interaction can impact cancer progression, especially in XP patients (GonçalvesMaia2020NK). Restoring CLEC2A expression could enhance immune surveillance and potentially improve skin cancer treatments (GonçalvesMaia2020NK).

## Interactions
CLEC2A, also known as CLEC-2, is a C-type lectin-like receptor that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function in platelet activation and immune response regulation. CLEC-2 forms non-disulfide-linked homodimers on the platelet surface, which is essential for its signaling capabilities (Watson2009The). The dimerization is facilitated by the stalk region and glycosylation, enhancing its stability and affinity for ligands such as podoplanin (Watson2009The).

CLEC-2 interacts with the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a critical component in its signaling pathway. Syk binds to the phosphorylated hemITAM motif of CLEC-2, promoting further phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways (Martin2021The; Watson2009The). This interaction is modulated by phosphoinositol lipids, with Syk showing a higher affinity for PIP3 over PIP2, which may stabilize the CLEC-2-Syk interaction and contribute to receptor dimerization (Martin2021The).

CLEC-2 also interacts with exogenous ligands such as the snake venom toxin rhodocytin and the tumor cell surface protein podoplanin, which induce platelet aggregation and activation through receptor clustering (Martin2021The; Meng2021The). These interactions are crucial for CLEC-2's role in thrombo-inflammatory processes and immune responses. There is no evidence of CLEC-2 interacting with nucleic acids in the provided context.
