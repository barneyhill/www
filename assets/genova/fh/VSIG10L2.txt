# VSIG10L2

## Overview
VSIG10L2 is a gene that encodes the protein V-set and immunoglobulin domain containing 10 like 2, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its involvement in cell adhesion and signaling processes, which are crucial for various physiological functions. Although the precise biological roles of VSIG10L2 are not completely understood, it has been associated with several clinical conditions, suggesting its potential importance in human health. Research has indicated that VSIG10L2 may play a role in genetic predispositions to certain syndromes and in the cellular dynamics of the inner ear, particularly in response to pathological conditions (Wang2024Singlecell; Li2022Case). Further studies are needed to clarify the functional mechanisms of VSIG10L2 and its encoded protein in these contexts.

## Clinical Significance
The VSIG10L2 gene has been implicated in several clinical contexts, although its specific role in disease is not fully understood. In a study on post-finasteride syndrome (PFS), genetic variants in VSIG10L2 were identified among patients experiencing persistent adverse effects after discontinuing finasteride, a medication used for androgenetic alopecia. This suggests that VSIG10L2 may be a potential genetic risk factor for PFS, highlighting the need for genetic screening to identify individuals at risk before prescribing finasteride (Li2022Case).

In the context of inner ear balance organs, VSIG10L2 expression was found to be increased in type I hair cells of the human utricle, particularly in diseased conditions such as vestibular schwannoma. This increased expression may be associated with hair cell regeneration processes, although the exact clinical implications of these findings remain to be determined (Wang2024Singlecell).

Overall, while VSIG10L2 has been linked to certain conditions, further research is necessary to fully elucidate its clinical significance and potential role in disease mechanisms.
