# CCDC191

## Overview
The CCDC191 gene encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 191 protein, which is a member of the coiled-coil domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by its structural motif, the coiled-coil domain, which is known for facilitating protein-protein interactions. While the specific biological functions of CCDC191 are not fully elucidated, proteins with coiled-coil domains are often involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, vesicle transport, and cytoskeletal organization. The CCDC191 protein may play a role in these or related pathways, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of CCDC191 in health and disease, as well as its potential interactions with other cellular components.
