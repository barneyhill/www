# KCNE2

## Overview
The KCNE2 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 2, a critical component in the modulation of potassium channels across various tissues. This protein, characterized by a single transmembrane domain, functions as a regulatory subunit that influences the gating properties and conductance of potassium channels, such as KCNQ1 and hERG, by forming heteromeric complexes (Abbott2015The). KCNE2 plays a pivotal role in cardiac physiology by contributing to ventricular repolarization and maintaining normal cardiac rhythm, thus preventing arrhythmias like Long QT syndrome (Abbott2012KCNE2). Beyond the heart, KCNE2 is essential in gastric acid secretion and thyroid hormone biosynthesis, highlighting its diverse physiological roles (Abbott2012KCNE2; Abbott2015The). Mutations in KCNE2 have been linked to various cardiac arrhythmias and systemic conditions, underscoring its clinical significance (Zhou2019The; Nielsen2014GainOfFunction).

## Structure
The KCNE2 protein is a member of the KCNE gene family, characterized by a single transmembrane domain, which is a key feature of its secondary structure (Abbott2015The). This transmembrane domain is identical between human and equine KCNE2, indicating a high degree of conservation across species (Pedersen2015Molecular). The protein forms heteromeric complexes with Kv α subunits, typically with a stoichiometry of 4α:2KCNE subunits, as seen in the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex (Abbott2015The). This quaternary structure is crucial for its role as a regulatory subunit in potassium channels.

KCNE2 is known to interact with various potassium channels, including KCNQ1 and HERG, affecting their gating properties and conductance (Mazhari2001Molecular; Abbott2015The). The protein also has a putative PKC phosphorylation site in the intracellular, membrane-proximal region, suggesting potential post-translational modifications that could influence its function (Abbott2015The). While specific details on the primary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided, the presence of a single transmembrane domain and its role in channel regulation are well-documented.

## Function
The KCNE2 gene encodes a regulatory subunit that plays a crucial role in modulating the function of various potassium (K+) channels, particularly in cardiac and gastric tissues. In cardiac myocytes, KCNE2 is involved in ventricular repolarization by forming complexes with Kv channels, including hERG, which is essential for the I_Kr current, the primary repolarization current in the human heart. KCNE2 modulates hERG by shifting its voltage-dependence, accelerating deactivation, and reducing conductance, which is vital for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm and preventing arrhythmias such as Long QT syndrome (Abbott2012KCNE2; Abbott2015The).

In the stomach, KCNE2 forms a complex with the KCNQ1 channel, creating a heteromeric channel that is essential for gastric acid secretion. This channel is constitutively active and responsive to low extracellular pH, ensuring a continuous potassium flux necessary for the function of the gastric H+/K+-ATPase, which acidifies the stomach (Abbott2012KCNE2; Abbott2015The).

KCNE2 is also expressed in thyrocytes, where it forms a channel with KCNQ1 that is crucial for thyroid iodide accumulation, a process essential for thyroid hormone biosynthesis (Abbott2012KCNE2). These functions highlight KCNE2's role in maintaining normal cardiac, gastric, and thyroid physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNE2 gene are associated with several cardiac arrhythmias and other conditions. Gain-of-function mutations, such as M23L and I57T, have been linked to early-onset lone atrial fibrillation (AF). These mutations increase potassium current densities, potentially shortening cardiac action potentials and facilitating re-entry arrhythmias, which are characteristic of AF (Nielsen2014GainOfFunction). The I57T mutation is also associated with Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada Syndrome (BrS), indicating its role in various arrhythmic conditions (Nielsen2014GainOfFunction).

Alterations in KCNE2 expression or function can lead to acquired Long QT syndrome, a condition affecting cardiac repolarization and predisposing individuals to arrhythmias (Zhou2019The). In mouse models, deletion of Kcne2 results in a multisystem syndrome that includes hyperkalemia, prolonged QT intervals, and increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) (Hu2014Kcne2). These findings suggest that KCNE2 disruptions can provide both the systemic substrate and the electric substrate for SCD (Hu2014Kcne2).

KCNE2 is also implicated in non-cardiac conditions. In the lungs, its disruption leads to reduced lung function and increased pulmonary apoptosis and inflammation (Zhou2019The). These diverse roles highlight the clinical significance of KCNE2 in both cardiac and systemic health.

## Interactions
KCNE2, a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels, engages in several significant protein interactions. It physically interacts with the focal adhesion protein Testin, as identified through yeast two-hybrid screening and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies. This interaction involves Testin residues 297-369, which contain a zinc finger, LIM-type functional domain. Testin modulates KCNE2's effects on the Kv1.5 channel by preventing KCNE2 from negatively shifting the voltage dependence and altering gating kinetics, although it does not affect KCNE2's regulation of the KCNQ1 channel (Papanikolaou2021The).

KCNE2 also forms complexes with KCNQ1 and SMIT1, a sodium-dependent myo-inositol transporter, in the choroid plexus epithelium. This complex is unique as it represents the first report of a K+ channel-solute transporter complex. KCNE2 inhibits myo-inositol transport activity within this complex, despite enhancing channel function (Abbott2015The).

Additionally, KCNE2 interacts with the KCNQ1 channel, affecting its gating kinetics and current amplitude. Specific mutations in the transmembrane regions of KCNE2 can alter these interactions, indicating a precise physical coupling between KCNE2 and KCNQ1 (Liu2007Probing).
