# PEX10

## Overview
The PEX10 gene encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 10, a crucial protein involved in the formation and maintenance of peroxisomes, which are essential organelles for various metabolic processes, including fatty acid beta-oxidation and the synthesis of bile acids and plasmalogens. PEX10 is categorized as a peroxisomal membrane protein and is characterized by its C3HC4 zinc-binding RING-finger domain, which is integral to its function in ubiquitination processes. The protein is predicted to have two transmembrane segments, with both termini exposed to the cytosol, facilitating its role in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Mutations in the PEX10 gene can lead to peroxisome biogenesis disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome, highlighting its critical role in cellular metabolism and peroxisome function (Warren1998Identification; Okumoto1998Mutations).

## Structure
The PEX10 protein is an integral peroxisomal membrane protein involved in peroxisome biogenesis. It consists of 326 amino acids and includes two putative transmembrane segments, with both the N-terminal and C-terminal regions exposed to the cytosol (Warren1998Identification; Okumoto1998Mutations). The protein features a C3HC4 zinc-binding RING-finger domain located near its C-terminus, which is crucial for its function in ubiquitination processes (Okumoto1998Mutations; Prestele2010Different). This RING-finger motif is a common feature in some ubiquitin E3 ligases, facilitating interactions with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Eckert2003Pex10p).

The PEX10 protein also contains a conserved TLGEEY motif and a highly conserved P motif, which are typical of the PEX10 subfamily of zinc-binding proteins (Prestele2010Different). These motifs are important for peroxisome biogenesis and protein import. Mutations in these regions can lead to altered peroxisome morphology and impaired metabolic functions (Prestele2010Different). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which is essential for its role in peroxisomal matrix protein import (Eckert2003Pex10p). Variants of PEX10 can arise from alternative splicing, potentially leading to different isoforms with distinct functions (Okumoto1998Mutations).

## Function
The PEX10 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in peroxisome biogenesis, a process essential for cellular metabolism. The PEX10 protein is involved in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, which are crucial for the proper functioning of peroxisomes. These organelles are responsible for various metabolic processes, including the beta-oxidation of fatty acids and the synthesis of bile acids, cholesterol, and plasmalogens (Warren1998Identification). 

PEX10 contains a C-terminal C3HC4 zinc-binding domain, which is crucial for its function, and is predicted to have two membrane-spanning domains. It is a peroxisomal membrane protein with its C-terminus oriented toward the cytoplasm, and it colocalizes with PMP70, a known peroxisomal membrane protein, indicating its localization to peroxisomes (Warren1998Identification). 

The protein functions independently of the matrix-protein-import machinery, suggesting its involvement in peroxisomal membrane protein import and localization (Warren1998Identification). Mutations in PEX10 can lead to peroxisome-biogenesis disorders, highlighting its essential role in maintaining normal peroxisome function and cellular metabolism (Warren1998Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX10 gene are associated with a range of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs), including Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease. These disorders are part of the Zellweger spectrum and are characterized by impaired peroxisome function, leading to severe neurological and systemic symptoms (Warren1998Identification; Okumoto1998Mutations). 

In Zellweger syndrome, mutations in PEX10, such as a 2-nucleotide deletion causing a frameshift, result in a dysfunctional protein lacking the RING motif, crucial for peroxisome assembly. This leads to a failure in peroxisome formation, contributing to the severe clinical manifestations of the disease (Okumoto1998Mutations). 

Other mutations, such as those affecting splice sites or causing amino acid substitutions in the zinc-binding domain, have been identified in patients with varying degrees of peroxisomal dysfunction. These mutations can lead to defects in the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, which are essential for normal cellular function (Warren1998Identification). 

Milder forms of PBDs, such as autosomal recessive ataxia, have also been linked to PEX10 mutations. These cases may present with neurological symptoms like cerebellar ataxia and motor neuropathy, without the severe systemic involvement seen in classic Zellweger spectrum disorders (Régal2010Mutations; Yamashita2017Ataxic).

## Interactions
PEX10, a peroxisomal membrane protein, is involved in a network of interactions crucial for peroxisome biogenesis. It interacts with several other peroxins, including PEX4, PEX12, and PEX19. The interaction between PEX10 and PEX4 is particularly notable, as it is dependent on the presence of PEX22, suggesting a specific and possibly transient interaction that is crucial for the ubiquitin-conjugating process (Eckert2003Pex10p). PEX10 also interacts with PEX12 and PEX13, forming part of a larger complex involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import (Eckert2003Pex10p).

The RING-finger domain of PEX10 is similar to that of Rad18p, a protein involved in DNA repair, indicating a potential role for PEX10 as an ubiquitin ligase, although this function remains unconfirmed (Eckert2003Pex10p). PEX10's interaction with PEX19 is significant for peroxisomal membrane formation, as PEX19 is essential for recognizing and inserting peroxisomal membrane proteins (Eckert2003Pex10p). In Arabidopsis, PEX19-1 binds specifically to the C-terminal region of PEX10, further supporting the role of PEX10 in peroxisome biogenesis (Hadden2006ArabidopsisPEX19).
