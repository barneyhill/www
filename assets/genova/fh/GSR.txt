# GSR

## Overview
The GSR gene encodes the enzyme glutathione-disulfide reductase, a critical component of the cellular antioxidant defense system. This enzyme, categorized as a flavoprotein, plays a pivotal role in maintaining the redox balance within cells by catalyzing the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to its reduced form, glutathione (GSH), using NADPH as a cofactor. The enzyme's activity is essential for protecting cells from oxidative damage and is found in both the cytosol and mitochondria of mammalian cells (Kelner2000Structural; Kamerbeek2006Molecular). The GSR gene is subject to regulation by the transcription factor Nrf2, which enhances its expression in response to oxidative stress, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis (Harvey2009Nrf2regulated). Mutations in the GSR gene can lead to hereditary glutathione reductase deficiency, highlighting its clinical significance in conditions related to oxidative stress (Kamerbeek2006Molecular).

## Structure
The GSR gene encodes the glutathione-disulfide reductase enzyme, a homodimeric flavoprotein crucial for cellular antioxidant defense. The primary structure of the GSR protein consists of 522 amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain that initiates the synthesis of both mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of the enzyme (Vyas2022Identification; Satoh2010Expression). The secondary structure includes domains such as pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase and FAD/NAD(P)-binding domains, which are essential for the enzyme's function (Vyas2022Identification). 

The tertiary structure of GSR involves a three-dimensional folding pattern that accommodates the binding of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a cofactor necessary for its enzymatic activity. The quaternary structure is characterized by its homodimeric nature, meaning it functions as a dimer of two identical subunits (Satoh2010Expression). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, may occur, influencing the enzyme's activity and stability. The GSR gene also expresses alternative splice variants, GSR delta8 and GSR delta9, which lack exon 8 and exon 9, respectively, resulting in shorter protein isoforms (Satoh2010Expression). These structural features are critical for the enzyme's role in maintaining the cellular redox state.

## Function
The GSR gene encodes the enzyme glutathione-disulfide reductase, also known as glutathione reductase, which is crucial for maintaining cellular redox balance. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form glutathione (GSH) using NADPH as a cofactor, a process essential for protecting cells from oxidative damage (Vyas2022Identification; Kamerbeek2006Molecular). Glutathione reductase is a homodimeric flavoprotein found in both the cytosol and mitochondria of mammalian cells, where it supports detoxification and antioxidant defense mechanisms (Kelner2000Structural; Satoh2010Expression).

The enzyme plays a critical role in recycling oxidized glutathione back to its reduced form, which is vital for maintaining the GSH/GSSG ratio. This balance is essential for various cellular functions, including the activation of dormant cells and the prevention of oxidative stress in red blood cells (Vyas2022Identification). The GSR gene is regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2, which enhances its expression in response to oxidative stress, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage by maintaining glutathione homeostasis (Harvey2009Nrf2regulated). Mutations in the GSR gene can lead to hereditary glutathione reductase deficiency, impairing cellular energy balance and increasing oxidative stress (Kamerbeek2006Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GSR gene, which encodes the enzyme glutathione-disulfide reductase, are associated with several clinical conditions. Hereditary glutathione reductase deficiency is a notable disorder resulting from these mutations. This autosomal recessive condition is characterized by decreased activity of the enzyme, leading to increased oxidative stress in red blood cells and resulting in hereditary hemolytic anemia (Vyas2022Identification; Kamerbeek2006Molecular). Patients with this deficiency may experience hemolytic crises after exposure to oxidative stressors such as fava beans, a condition known as favism, and may also develop early-onset cataracts due to oxidative damage (Kamerbeek2006Molecular).

Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GSR gene, such as rs8190955, have been linked to hereditary anemia, while rs2978663 is associated with obstructive heart defects (OHDs) (Vyas2022Identification). The rs2978663 polymorphism has also been studied in the context of osteoporosis, where certain genotypes may offer a protective effect against the disease (Abdulabbas2023Genetic). These genetic variations can influence the enzyme's stability and function, contributing to the pathogenesis of these conditions (Vyas2022Identification).
