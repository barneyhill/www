# USP17L11

## Overview
USP17L11 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 17 like family member 11, which is part of the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) family. These enzymes play a critical role in the regulation of protein degradation by removing ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitinated proteins, thus rescuing them from proteasomal degradation. The USP17L11 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and immune response modulation. Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and inflammatory diseases. The study of USP17L11 and its encoded protein continues to provide insights into the complex mechanisms of ubiquitin-mediated cellular regulation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
