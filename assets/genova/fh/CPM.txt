# CPM

## Overview
Carboxypeptidase M (CPM) is a gene that encodes the enzyme carboxypeptidase M, a membrane-bound metallo-carboxypeptidase involved in the regulation of peptide hormone activity. The CPM protein is characterized by its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which facilitates its attachment to the plasma membrane, and its structural features, including an α/β hydrolase fold and distinct catalytic and β-sandwich domains (Reverter2004Crystal; TAN2003Effect). Functionally, carboxypeptidase M plays a critical role in cleaving C-terminal basic residues from peptides, thereby modulating their biological activity and receptor interactions, which are essential for processes such as inflammation, cell signaling, and peptide hormone maturation (Reverter2004Crystal; Deiteren2009Carboxypeptidase). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the lung, placenta, kidney, and brain, and is involved in diverse physiological functions, such as blood coagulation and the mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (Deiteren2009Carboxypeptidase; MarquezCurtis2008Carboxypeptidase). Additionally, CPM interacts with other membrane proteins, such as the kinin B1 receptor and angiotensin-converting enzyme, influencing complex signaling pathways (Zhang2013Carboxypeptidasea; Sun2008Interaction).

## Structure
The human carboxypeptidase M (CPM) protein is a membrane-bound enzyme that plays a role in the regulation of peptide hormone activity. The primary structure of CPM includes a signal peptide and a propeptide region, with the mature protein consisting of 443 amino acids (Pessoa2002Molecular). CPM is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which is attached to the C-terminal region of the protein (Reverter2004Crystal; TAN2003Effect).

The secondary structure of CPM features an α/β hydrolase fold typical of metallo-carboxypeptidases, with a central eight-stranded β-sheet flanked by helices (Reverter2004Crystal). The protein consists of two main domains: a 295-residue N-terminal catalytic domain and an 86-residue β-sandwich C-terminal domain, which is more conically shaped compared to similar proteins (Reverter2004Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of CPM include glycosylation, which affects its molecular mass and stability. The recombinant form of CPM expressed in insect cells shows reduced glycosylation compared to the native enzyme (TAN2003Effect). Alternative splicing of the CPM gene results in four different mRNA isoforms, which may lead to truncated proteins due to frame shifts and premature stop codons (Pessoa2002Molecular). These structural features and modifications are crucial for CPM's enzymatic function and interaction with the cell membrane.

## Function
Carboxypeptidase M (CPM) is a membrane-bound enzyme that plays a crucial role in the regulation of peptide hormone activity by cleaving C-terminal basic residues, such as arginine and lysine, from peptides and proteins. This enzymatic activity is essential for the maturation and activation of peptide hormones, which are often synthesized as larger precursor proteins. By removing these residues, CPM modulates receptor specificity and biological properties of peptides, impacting physiological functions such as inflammation and cell signaling (Reverter2004Crystal; Deiteren2009Carboxypeptidase).

CPM is expressed on the surface of various specialized cells and tissues, including the lung, placenta, kidney, and brain, where it is involved in processes like blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and the processing of pro-hormones and neuropeptides (Reverter2004Crystal; Deiteren2009Carboxypeptidase). In the kidney, CPM is found in proximal tubular epithelial cells and glomerular mesangial cells, suggesting roles in phagocytosis and inflammation mediation (Deiteren2009Carboxypeptidase).

CPM's activity is maximal at neutral pH, which aligns with its function on the cell surface, influencing local peptide concentrations and modulating receptor interactions (Reverter2004Crystal). This enzyme is also involved in the degradation of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α, affecting the mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (MarquezCurtis2008Carboxypeptidase).

## Interactions
Carboxypeptidase M (CPM) is known to interact with the kinin B1 receptor (B1R) on the cell membrane, forming a complex that enhances B1R signaling. This interaction is crucial for the efficient generation of B1R signals, particularly in inflammatory processes. CPM is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored ectoenzyme that interacts with the extracellular loop 2 of B1R, enhancing the receptor's affinity for its agonist, des-Arg10-kallidin (DAKD) (Zhang2013Carboxypeptidasea). The interaction between CPM and B1R is not dependent on CPM's enzymatic activity but rather on its physical association with B1R, which can be disrupted by specific antibodies or peptides targeting CPM (Zhang2013Carboxypeptidasea; Zhang2011Crosstalk).

CPM also interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in cell membranes. This interaction leads to the release of CPM from the membrane, independent of ACE's dipeptidase activity. The interaction between CPM and ACE is supported by co-localization studies and cross-linking experiments, indicating a physical association between these proteins (Sun2008Interaction). These interactions highlight CPM's role in modulating receptor activity and its involvement in complex signaling pathways.
