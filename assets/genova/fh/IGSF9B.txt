# IGSF9B

## Overview
The IGSF9B gene encodes the protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 9B, which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its structural components, including five immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and two fibronectin type III (Fn3) domains, which facilitate its role in cell adhesion and synaptic organization (Hansen2013IGSF9; Woo2013The). IGSF9B is predominantly localized at inhibitory synapses, where it functions as a synaptic organizer, playing a critical role in the development and maintenance of inhibitory synapses, particularly in GABAergic neurons (Woo2013The). Through homophilic adhesion and interactions with other synaptic proteins, such as neuroligin 2 and S-SCAM, IGSF9B contributes to the formation of synaptic complexes essential for inhibitory synaptic transmission (Woo2013The). The gene's involvement in neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders underscores its clinical significance, with mutations linked to conditions such as schizophrenia and major depression (Babaev2018IgSF9b; Cameron2018ImmunoglobulinLike).

## Structure
The IGSF9B protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, characterized by its domain structure, which includes five immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and two fibronectin type III (Fn3) domains in its extracellular region (Hansen2013IGSF9; Woo2013The). The extracellular region is followed by a transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic domain (Hansen2013IGSF9). The Ig domains are similar to those found in proteins like titin and DSCAM, while the Fn3 domains resemble those in nephrin and DSCAM (Hansen2013IGSF9). The Fn3II module has a known nuclear magnetic resonance structure (PDB ID: 1V5J) (Hansen2013IGSF9).

IGSF9B is primarily located at inhibitory synapses and is involved in homophilic adhesion through its Ig and Fn3 domains (Woo2013The). It contains a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which facilitates interactions with other synaptic proteins (Woo2013The). Post-translational modifications include N-glycosylation, particularly in the IgIII and Fn3II domains, and potential SUMOylation (Hansen2013IGSF9; Woo2013The). Alternative splicing may generate secreted isoforms, although specific variants are not detailed (Hansen2013IGSF9).

## Function
The IGSF9B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the development and function of inhibitory synapses, particularly in GABAergic neurons. This protein is a homophilic cell adhesion molecule that is distinct from other synaptic proteins like neuroligin 2 and dystroglycan. It is involved in both presynaptic and postsynaptic functions, contributing to the formation and maintenance of inhibitory synapses by forming a ternary complex with neuroligin 2 and S-SCAM. This complex facilitates dynamic interactions and assembly of synaptic components, with IgSF9b mediating synaptic adhesion and the GABA A receptors/gephyrin-containing domain involved in inhibitory synaptic transmission (Woo2013The).

IgSF9b is enriched at inhibitory synapses and functions as a synaptic organizer, inducing protein clustering in contacting axons. Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing IgSF9b levels decreases the number of inhibitory synapses and the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), indicating its importance in normal inhibitory synaptic transmission frequency (Woo2013The).

In the amygdala, IgSF9b regulates anxiety-related behaviors by affecting inhibitory synapses in the centromedial amygdala (CeM). Its deletion has been shown to enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission, likely through a presynaptic mechanism, and may influence the subunit composition of GABA A receptors at inhibitory postsynapses (Babaev2018IgSF9b).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the IGSF9B gene have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Variants of IGSF9B are associated with major depression and schizophrenia, suggesting that these may be gain-of-function mutations leading to reduced synaptic inhibition in the centromedial amygdala (CeM) (Babaev2018IgSF9b; Cameron2018ImmunoglobulinLike). The gene is also linked to negative symptoms in schizophrenia, such as blunted affect and emotional withdrawal, which are associated with depressive symptoms (Fabbri2017Role).

In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), a synonymous SNP in the IGSF9B gene, rs10894768, is nominally associated with a benign disease course, indicating a potential protective role against aggressive disease progression (GilVarea2018Exome). The minor allele of this SNP correlates with lower expression in pancreatic and thyroid tissues, although no significant expression changes were observed in brain tissues (GilVarea2018Exome).

IGSF9B is also involved in the development of inhibitory synapses, particularly in GABAergic neurons. Alterations in its interactions, such as with neuroligin 2, can affect synaptic function and may contribute to the pathophysiology of disorders like autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disabilities (Woo2013The).

## Interactions
The IGSF9B protein, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is primarily involved in the development of inhibitory synapses. It interacts with several key proteins to facilitate synaptic organization. IGSF9B forms a ternary complex with neuroligin 2 and S-SCAM, a scaffolding protein, which is crucial for the development of inhibitory synapses. This interaction is mediated by S-SCAM, which acts as an adaptor protein linking IGSF9B to neuroligin 2, thereby promoting the clustering of inhibitory postsynaptic protein complexes (Woo2013The).

IGSF9B exhibits homophilic adhesion, meaning it can bind to itself, which is important for its role in synaptic adhesion. This homophilic interaction is evidenced by its accumulation at cell-cell contact sites and its ability to induce accumulation on contacting neurites of cocultured neurons (Woo2013The).

While IGSF9B can drive the coclustering of neuroligin 2, it does not induce coclustering of gephyrin, an inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold. Neuroligin 2, however, can cluster gephyrin, indicating distinct roles for these proteins in synaptic organization (Woo2013The). IGSF9B does not interact with other postsynaptic scaffolds like PSD-95 or Shank (Woo2013The).
