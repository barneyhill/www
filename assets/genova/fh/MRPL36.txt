# MRPL36

## Overview
MRPL36 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L36, which is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. This protein is integral to the process of mitochondrial protein synthesis, facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production (Cheong2020Expression; O’Brien2003Properties). As a structural constituent of the mitochondrial ribosome, MRPL36 plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism and overall mitochondrial function. The protein's interactions with other ribosomal proteins and mitochondrial components, such as LETM1, underscore its importance in maintaining mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetic capacity (Li2019LETM1; Piao2009Association). Through these interactions, MRPL36 contributes to the stability and efficiency of mitochondrial translation, highlighting its critical role in cellular homeostasis and energy production (Prestele2009Mrpl36).

## Function
MRPL36 encodes a protein that is a component of the mitochondrial ribosome, specifically the large 39S subunit. This protein plays a crucial role in mitochondrial protein synthesis by facilitating the translation of mitochondrial mRNA into functional proteins, which are essential for oxidative phosphorylation, a critical process for ATP production in cells (Cheong2020Expression; O’Brien2003Properties). MRPL36 is active within the mitochondria, contributing to cellular energy metabolism and overall cellular function (Cheong2020Expression).

The interaction between MRPL36 and LETM1, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, suggests that MRPL36 may be involved in maintaining mitochondrial ATP production and regulating mitochondrial ribosome function (Li2019LETM1; Piao2009Association). LETM1 is thought to act as a membrane anchor for mitochondrial ribosomes, and its association with MRPL36 is crucial for its function. This interaction is significant for mitochondrial biogenesis and function, as demonstrated by experiments where knocking down MRPL36 significantly recovered LETM1-mediated ATP reduction (Piao2009Association). The role of MRPL36 in these processes highlights its importance in cellular energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.

## Interactions
MRPL36, a component of the mitochondrial ribosome's large subunit, plays a crucial role in mitochondrial translation through its interactions with other ribosomal proteins and possibly mitochondrial RNA. It is involved in stabilizing the interaction between the large and small ribosomal subunits, which is essential for efficient protein synthesis within mitochondria (Prestele2009Mrpl36). MRPL36 dynamically associates with ribosomes, integrating into preexisting ribosomal structures to enhance translation efficiency. This dynamic exchange allows MRPL36 to dissociate from inactive ribosomes and re-associate when translation resumes (Prestele2009Mrpl36).

MRPL36 is part of a subcomplex within the mitoribosome that includes other proteins such as MrpL35, Mrp7, MrpL7, MrpL17, and MrpL28. These interactions are crucial for the assembly and function of the mitochondrial ribosome, particularly in the formation of the central protuberance subcomplex (Box2017MrpL35). The interaction between MRPL36 and these proteins is important for coordinating the synthesis and assembly of components of the oxidative phosphorylation system, such as the cytochrome c oxidase complex (Box2017MrpL35). These interactions highlight MRPL36's role in maintaining mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity and ensuring the proper assembly of respiratory chain complexes.
