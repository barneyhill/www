# TMEM9B

## Overview
Transmembrane protein 9B (TMEM9B) is a gene that encodes the TMEM9 domain family member B, a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by its role in cellular signaling pathways and is implicated in the regulation of immune responses and inflammation. TMEM9B is part of a broader family of transmembrane proteins that are integral to maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating communication between the cell's internal and external environments. The protein's structure allows it to span the cellular membrane, enabling it to participate in the transmission of signals across the membrane, which is crucial for the activation of downstream signaling pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
