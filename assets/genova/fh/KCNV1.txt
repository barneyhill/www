# KCNV1

## Overview
KCNV1 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium voltage-gated channel modifier subfamily V member 1, commonly referred to as Kv8.1. Kv8.1 is a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, characterized by its role as a modulatory subunit rather than forming functional channels independently. It is a transmembrane protein with six transmembrane segments and a voltage-sensing domain, which allows it to interact with other potassium channel subunits, such as those in the Kv2 and Kv7 families, to modulate their activity and biophysical properties (Renigunta2024A; Hugnot1996Kv8.1). The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the nervous system, where it plays a critical role in regulating neuronal excitability and signal transmission. Alterations in KCNV1 expression have been linked to neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal cellular function (Renigunta2024A; Huang2023Downregulation).

## Structure
The KCNV1 gene encodes the Kv8.1 protein, a member of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. Kv8.1 is characterized by its six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and a pore-forming loop between the S5 and S6 segments, typical of Kv channel subunits (Renigunta2024A; Hugnot1996Kv8.1). The protein includes a voltage-sensing domain formed by the S1-S4 segments, with the S4 segment containing positively charged residues crucial for voltage sensing (Hugnot1996Kv8.1).

Kv8.1 does not form functional homotetrameric channels on its own but can heterotetramerize with other Kv subunits, such as Kv2, to modulate their activity (Renigunta2024A; Bocksteins2016Kv5). The N-terminal domain of Kv8.1 is essential for its interaction with other subunits, influencing the expression and function of these channels (Hugnot1996Kv8.1). Kv8.1 lacks an N-glycosylation sequence but contains several putative phosphorylation sites, including those for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and Ca2+-calmodulin protein kinase II, which may regulate its function (Hugnot1996Kv8.1).

The gene's promoter region is complex, featuring multiple transcription start sites and regulatory elements such as Sp1 motifs, which suggest a sophisticated transcriptional regulation mechanism (Ebihara2004Structural).

## Function
KCNV1 encodes the Kv8.1 subunit, which is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family. This subunit is electrically silent on its own and does not form functional channels independently. Instead, it modulates the activity of other potassium channels, particularly the Kv7 family, by affecting their membrane trafficking and biophysical properties (Renigunta2024A). Kv8.1 is known to enhance Kv7 currents by increasing their membrane expression, which plays a crucial role in regulating neuronal excitability and signal transmission (Renigunta2024A).

In the nervous system, KCNV1 is expressed in various tissues, including the hippocampus, where it shows a strong correlation with KCNQ2 (Kv7.2), suggesting a functional interaction that may influence neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission (Renigunta2024A). The modulation of Kv7 channels by Kv8.1 is significant for maintaining the resting membrane potential and shaping action potentials, which are essential for proper neurotransmitter release and muscle contraction (Renigunta2024A).

The interaction between Kv8.1 and Kv7 channels is evolutionarily conserved and occurs across different species and cell types, indicating its fundamental role in cellular physiology (Renigunta2024A). This interaction may have implications for understanding the electrical excitability in neurons and repolarization processes in cardiac muscle (Renigunta2024A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the KCNV1 gene, which encodes the Kv8.1 potassium channel subunit, have been implicated in several neurological disorders. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), downregulation of KCNV1 is observed in motor neurons derived from patients, particularly those with SOD1(A4V) and C9orf72 mutations. This downregulation increases the vulnerability of motor neurons to cell death, potentially by affecting neuronal metabolism and lipid/protein transport pathways, rather than altering neuronal excitability (Huang2023Downregulation). The study suggests that targeting Kv8.1-Kv2 interactions could be a therapeutic strategy in ALS (Huang2023Downregulation).

In autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a de novo and likely pathogenic variant of KCNV1 has been identified, suggesting its involvement in the etiology of ASD. The gene is associated with a severe case of ASD and ADHD, highlighting its potential role in neuropsychiatric conditions (CodinaSolà2015Integrated). These findings underscore the importance of KCNV1 in maintaining normal neurological function and its potential contribution to disease when altered.

## Interactions
KCNV1, encoding the Kv8.1 subunit, interacts with various potassium channel subunits, forming heteromeric complexes that modulate the function of these channels. Kv8.1 is known to co-assemble with Kv7 channels, particularly Kv7.2, affecting their membrane trafficking and biophysical properties. This interaction is suggested to occur in tissues such as the hippocampus and dorsal root ganglia, where KCNV1 mRNA expression correlates with KCNQ2 mRNA, indicating a potential interaction between these proteins (Renigunta2024A). 

Experiments using co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays have demonstrated that Kv8.1 can form heteromeric channels with Kv7 subunits, although it shows a preference for Kv7 homomers. These interactions are thought to modulate the current amplitude and voltage dependence of Kv7 channels, potentially forming heterotetramers with unique electrophysiological properties (Renigunta2024A).

Kv8.1 also interacts with Kv2 subunits, forming heterotetrameric Kv2/KvS channels. These channels exhibit distinct biophysical properties compared to Kv2 homomers and are resistant to certain Kv2-selective inhibitors, highlighting their unique pharmacological profile (Stewart2024A). These interactions suggest that Kv8.1 plays a significant role in modulating electrical activity in specific cell types.
