# SNRNP35

## Overview
SNRNP35 is a gene that encodes the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U11/U12 subunit 35, a protein integral to the minor spliceosome complex. This protein is involved in the splicing of U12-type introns, a process essential for the maturation of pre-mRNA into functional mRNA, thereby influencing gene expression and cellular function (Ding2022Roles; Verma2018Minor). SNRNP35 is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which facilitates specific RNA interactions within the spliceosome, contributing to the stability and specificity of the U11 snRNP complex (Zhao2023Structure). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been linked to conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), highlighting its clinical significance in stress-related disorders (Huckins2020Analysis; Huckins2019Analysis).

## Structure
The SNRNP35 protein is a core component of the U11 snRNP, part of the minor spliceosome complex involved in the splicing of U12-type introns. It forms a heterodimer with SNRNP25, which is crucial for its function in recognizing U11 snRNA. The protein contains a canonical RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain that binds specifically to U11 SL3, engaging in stacking interactions with the conserved 5'-UCA-3' sequence, a binding mode similar to other RNA-RRM interactions (Zhao2023Structure).

SNRNP35 also features extensions on both sides of the RRM domain, forming a composite accessory domain (SNRNP35 AD). These extensions are essential for binding to the base of U11 SL3 and the apical region of U11 SL1, conferring specificity to SNRNP35 and preventing the binding of U1-70K to U11 snRNA due to potential steric clashes (Zhao2023Structure). The protein's structure is distinct from its homologue U1-70K, highlighting differences in RNA binding specificity due to these extensions (Zhao2023Structure).

The quaternary structure of SNRNP35 involves its integration into the U11 snRNP complex, which has an elongated, two-lobe architecture, with SNRNP25 and SNRNP35 binding to the body of the U11 snRNA (Zhao2023Structure).

## Function
SNRNP35 is a protein component of the minor spliceosome, specifically part of the U11/U12 di-snRNP complex, which is essential for the splicing of U12-type introns. These introns are rare but crucial for the proper maturation of pre-mRNA into functional mRNA, impacting gene expression and cellular function (Ding2022Roles; Verma2018Minor). SNRNP35 plays a significant role in the recognition and binding of specific RNA structures within the spliceosome, contributing to the stability and specificity of the U11 snRNP complex (Zhao2023Structure).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it facilitates the accurate splicing of U12-type introns, a process that is slower than the splicing of U2-type introns. This slower rate may serve as a regulatory mechanism for gene expression, ensuring that transcripts are correctly processed before being translated into proteins (Turunen2012The). SNRNP35's interaction with other spliceosomal components, such as SNRNP25, is crucial for the specific recognition of U11 snRNA, preventing it from binding to U1 snRNA and ensuring the proper function of the minor spliceosome (Zhao2023Structure). The proper functioning of SNRNP35 is essential for cellular homeostasis and organismal health, as disruptions in its activity can lead to splicing defects and associated diseases (Verma2018Minor).

## Clinical Significance
The SNRNP35 gene has been implicated in the susceptibility to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), particularly in military cohorts. Research indicates that SNRNP35 is downregulated in the prefrontal cortex in response to stress hormones, a change associated with PTSD. This downregulation is linked to glucocorticoid receptor activation, suggesting a role in stress-related neurobiological systems (Huckins2020Analysis; Huckins2019Analysis). The gene's expression is notably affected by deployment stress, with more pronounced effects observed in military-related PTSD cases compared to civilian cases, indicating a trauma type-specific genetic vulnerability (Huckins2020Analysis; Huckins2019Analysis).

SNRNP35 is involved in the splicing of U12-type introns as part of the minor spliceosome. Its downregulation affects specific downstream pathways, potentially contributing to dysregulated circuit transmission and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in PTSD (Huckins2020Analysis; Huckins2019Analysis). While the gene's role in other diseases or conditions is still under investigation, its expression alterations in PTSD highlight its clinical significance in stress-related disorders (Huckins2019Analysis).

## Interactions
SNRNP35 is a component of the U11/U12 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is part of the minor spliceosome involved in the splicing of U12-type introns. Within this complex, SNRNP35 forms a heterodimer with SNRNP25, which is crucial for the specific recognition of U11 snRNA. This interaction involves the binding of SNRNP35's RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain to the U11 SL3 stem-loop, forming stacking interactions with the conserved 5'-UCA-3' sequence. The RRM domain of SNRNP35 also has extensions that form a composite accessory domain, binding specifically to the base of U11 SL3 and the apical region of U11 SL1, which confers specificity and prevents the binding of U1-70K, a homologous protein, to U11 snRNA (Zhao2023Structure).

SNRNP35 is also involved in a network of interactions with other proteins such as PDCD7, SNRNP48, and ZMAT5, which are essential for the recognition and stabilization of the 5' splice site in U12-type introns. These interactions facilitate the stable association of U11 and U12 snRNPs, which is important for their cooperative binding to target introns (Zhao2023Structure).
