# ZNF723

## Overview
ZNF723 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 723, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by their ability to bind DNA and influence gene expression, often acting as transcription factors. The ZNF723 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain diseases. Notably, mutations in ZNF723 have been associated with metastatic lung squamous cell carcinoma and bronchial asthma, suggesting its potential involvement in disease mechanisms (Peng2020Integrated; Akhmerova2023Genetic). Despite these associations, the specific functions and mechanisms of action of ZNF723 in normal physiology and disease states require further investigation.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the ZNF723 gene, which encodes a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, is not fully understood. However, certain mutations and alterations in its expression have been implicated in disease processes. In metastatic lung squamous cell carcinoma, a 'Stopgain' mutation in ZNF723 has been identified, which results in a premature stop codon. This mutation can lead to a truncated and potentially nonfunctional protein, disrupting normal cellular processes and possibly contributing to cancer progression (Peng2020Integrated).

ZNF723 is also part of a cluster of zinc finger protein-coding genes associated with the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma, particularly in the Russian population. While the specific role of ZNF723 mutations in asthma is not detailed, its involvement in a cluster of transcription factors suggests a potential link to the disease (Akhmerova2023Genetic).

Despite these associations, the precise clinical implications of ZNF723 mutations or expression changes, such as their impact on prognosis or treatment response in various diseases, remain unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate the full extent of ZNF723's role in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.
