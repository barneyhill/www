# IL12B

## Overview
The IL12B gene encodes the p40 subunit of the cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12), which is a critical component of the immune system. This gene is located on chromosome 5q31-33 and plays a pivotal role in the formation of the heterodimeric cytokines IL-12 and IL-23, both of which are essential for immune signaling and the regulation of inflammatory responses (Bloch2023Structures). The IL12B-encoded protein, interleukin 12B, is categorized as a cytokine and is involved in the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 1 (Th1) cells, thereby promoting cell-mediated immunity (Picard2002Inherited). The protein's structure includes immunoglobulin-like domains that facilitate its interaction with other subunits and receptors, influencing various immune pathways (Kim2019Analyses). Dysregulation or mutations in IL12B have been associated with several autoimmune and infectious diseases, highlighting its clinical significance in immune system functioning (Cargill2007A; FilipeSantos2006Inborn).

## Structure
The IL12B gene encodes the p40 subunit of interleukin-12, which is a component of the heterodimeric cytokine IL-12. The primary structure of IL12B includes a specific amino acid sequence that forms part of the IL-12 and IL-23 complexes (Bloch2023Structures). The secondary structure of IL12B involves alpha helices and beta sheets, as seen in the immunoglobulin domains D1, D2, and D3 of the IL-12p40 protein (Kim2019Analyses). The tertiary structure is characterized by the 3D folding of these domains, which align with their human counterparts (Kim2019Analyses).

In terms of quaternary structure, IL12B associates with the p35 subunit to form the active IL-12 heterodimer. This interaction is crucial for the cytokine's function in immune signaling (Bloch2023Structures). The IL12B protein is known to undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can affect its stability and tissue distribution (Bootz2016Different). The glycosylation of IL12B is significant for its pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, impacting its performance as a therapeutic protein (Bootz2016Different).

## Function
The IL12B gene encodes the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 (IL-12), a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the immune system by promoting the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 1 (Th1) cells, which are essential for cell-mediated immunity. IL-12 is a heterodimer composed of the p35 and p40 subunits, with the latter being encoded by IL12B (Picard2002Inherited; Zhou2004Interleukin10). This cytokine is primarily produced by activated phagocytes and dendritic cells in response to intracellular pathogens and bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Zhou2007An; Zhou2004Interleukin10).

In healthy human cells, IL-12 is involved in the induction of interferon-gamma (IFNg) production by natural killer (NK) and T lymphocytes, which is vital for effective immune responses against infections, particularly those caused by mycobacteria and Salmonella (Picard2002Inherited). The IL12B gene's expression is tightly regulated to prevent excessive inflammatory responses, with interleukin-10 (IL-10) playing a significant role in inhibiting IL12B expression through mechanisms such as histone deacetylation (Kobayashi2012IL10). This regulation is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing chronic inflammation (Kobayashi2012IL10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL12B gene, which encodes the p40 subunit of interleukin-12, have been implicated in several diseases. In psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune skin condition, genetic variations in IL12B are associated with increased disease susceptibility. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs3212227 and rs6887695 have been linked to psoriasis risk, with the A allele of rs3212227 also associated with other immune-mediated diseases like type 1 diabetes (Cargill2007A). The IL12B risk haplotype leads to increased IL-12 production, promoting Th1 polarization and enhancing the IFN-gamma signature in psoriatic skin (Johnston2013Susceptibilityassociated).

In tuberculosis, mutations in the IL12B gene, particularly in exon 5, intron 2, and the 3' UTR regions, have been observed in patients, leading to decreased IL-12 and IFN-gamma levels. These mutations result in a compromised Th1 response, increasing susceptibility to the disease (Babu2017Novel). IL12B mutations can also cause IL-12p40 deficiency, a rare immunodeficiency that increases susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, including tuberculosis and Salmonella infections (FilipeSantos2006Inborn).

## Interactions
The IL12B gene encodes the p40 subunit, which is a component of both interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23) cytokines. IL12B interacts with the IL12A subunit to form IL-12, and with the IL23A subunit to form IL-23. These cytokines engage with their respective receptors to mediate immune responses. IL-12 binds to the IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12Rβ2 receptors, with the IL-12B subunit undergoing conformational changes to facilitate binding. The interaction involves the D1-D2 hinge of IL-12Rβ1 and the D2-D3 hinge of IL-12Rβ2, stabilizing the IL-12A α-helices around IL-12B (Bloch2023Structures).

IL-23, which also includes the IL12B subunit, interacts with the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) in a similar manner, sharing structural features with IL-12, such as an N-terminal hook-like structure in the receptor that interacts with the cytokine's α-subunit (Bloch2023Structures). The IL12B subunit is crucial for the formation of these cytokine-receptor complexes, influencing T-cell differentiation and activation. Additionally, IL12B can form a homodimer that acts as an antagonist to IL-12, highlighting its role in modulating immune responses (Floss2020IL12).
