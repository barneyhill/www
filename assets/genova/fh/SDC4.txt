# SDC4

## Overview
The SDC4 gene encodes syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a pivotal role in cellular communication and structural organization. Syndecan-4 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and cytoskeletal organization, by acting as a receptor and co-receptor that mediates interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix (Gondelaud2019Structures). It is characterized by a core protein with glycosaminoglycan attachment sites and an alpha-helical transmembrane domain, which facilitates dimerization and interaction with cytoskeletal proteins (Jeyarajah2019Syndecan4; Kim2023NMR). Syndecan-4 is integral to the regulation of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, influencing cell morphology, proliferation, migration, and survival (Saoncella1999Syndecan4). Additionally, it plays a role in lipid metabolism, tissue regeneration, and angiogenesis, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function (Gondelaud2019Structures). The gene's expression and mutations have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, underscoring its clinical significance (Vuorinen2022SDC4rs1981429; Crocco2023Syndecan4).

## Structure
Syndecan-4 (SDC4) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan with a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of SDC4 includes a core protein with glycosaminoglycan attachment sites, which are crucial for its function in cell signaling and interaction with the extracellular matrix (Gondelaud2019Structures). The secondary structure of SDC4 features an alpha-helical transmembrane domain, which can form dimers through a conserved GXXXG motif, a characteristic shared with other syndecans (Dews2007Transmembrane; Kim2023NMR). 

The tertiary structure involves interactions with cytoskeletal proteins, facilitated by the cytoplasmic domain, which contains regions that interact with intracellular proteins such as alpha-actinin and vinculin (Jeyarajah2019Syndecan4). The cytoplasmic domain can form a compact intertwined dimer with a symmetric clamp shape, contributing to its role in signaling pathways (Gondelaud2019Structures). 

Post-translational modifications of SDC4 include glycosylation, which is essential for its function as a co-receptor in various signaling pathways (Gondelaud2019Structures). SDC4 also exists as a soluble protein isoform generated by alternative splicing, which may have distinct functional roles (Gondelaud2019Structures).

## Function
Syndecan-4 (SDC4) is a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in cell signaling, adhesion, and cytoskeletal organization. SDC4 acts as a receptor and co-receptor, mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix, and is essential for cell-cell adhesion (Gondelaud2019Structures). It regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, processes that are crucial for cell morphology, proliferation, migration, and survival (Saoncella1999Syndecan4).

SDC4 interacts with integrins and other proteins to form connections between the extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal signaling proteins, influencing integrin turnover and focal adhesion formation (Elfenbein2013Syndecan4). It is involved in the regulation of Rho family GTPases, which are essential for actin cytoskeleton remodeling and cell motility (Elfenbein2013Syndecan4). SDC4 also plays a role in lipid metabolism, tissue regeneration, and angiogenesis, contributing to cellular homeostasis and function (Gondelaud2019Structures).

In the context of cell migration, SDC4 influences cell polarity and migration by affecting centrosome positioning and intracellular calcium distribution, which are critical for efficient cell movement (Becsky2020Syndecan4). It is active at the cell surface and within focal adhesions, impacting cellular communication and structural integrity (Elfenbein2013Syndecan4).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SDC4 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In breast cancer, the SDC4-rs1981429 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with increased risk, particularly the minor allele C, which is linked to decreased longevity and heightened breast cancer susceptibility. This SNP may influence cancer-related pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, affecting cellular responses to DNA damage and apoptosis (Vuorinen2022SDC4rs1981429).

In metabolic syndrome, specific SDC4 polymorphisms, including rs1981429, are associated with increased risk and higher triglyceride levels, especially in females. These genetic variations influence metabolic phenotypes, including lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, highlighting SDC4's role in metabolic health (Crocco2023Syndecan4).

SDC4 expression is also linked to atherosclerosis. Reduced SDC4 expression in macrophages is associated with increased lipid accumulation and inflammatory cytokine levels, promoting atherogenesis. This suggests that SDC4 downregulation enhances the proinflammatory capacity of macrophages, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis (Hu2022A).

In prostate cancer, SDC4 overexpression is correlated with increased biochemical recurrence-free survival, indicating a better prognosis. Alterations in SDC4 expression during tumor progression suggest its potential as a prognostic marker (Santos2021Syndecan).

## Interactions
Syndecan-4 (SDC4) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling and structural organization. It forms complexes with syntenin-1, a PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein, which negatively regulates syndecan-4 signaling by inhibiting its interaction with protein kinase C alpha (PKCα). This interaction is crucial for controlling focal adhesion formation and cell migration (Choi2016New). Syntenin-1 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4, forming a symmetrical dimer-of-dimers complex that inhibits syndecan-4 functions through steric hindrance and competition for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (Choi2016New).

Syndecan-4 also interacts with integrins, forming ternary complexes that are essential for cell signaling and adhesion. These interactions involve the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of syndecan-4, which mediate binding with extracellular partners (Gondelaud2019Structures). Additionally, syndecan-4 is part of the ALIX-syntenin-syndecan-4 module, which is crucial for cytokinesis by recruiting and stabilizing the ESCRT-III complex at the abscission site (Addi2020The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of syndecan-4 in cellular processes, including cell communication, migration, and structural organization.
