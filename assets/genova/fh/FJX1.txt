# FJX1

## Overview
FJX1, or four-jointed box kinase 1, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein involved in various cellular and developmental processes. The protein, categorized as a kinase, is an orthologue of the Drosophila four-jointed kinase and plays a role in regulating planar cell polarity through the Fat-Dachsous signaling pathway. Although FJX1 does not phosphorylate the vertebrate Fat1 cadherin, it is involved in the phosphorylation of atypical cadherins during their transit through the secretory pathway, impacting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and planar cell polarity (Tagliabracci2013Secreted; Sreelatha2015The). FJX1 is highly expressed in the brain, where it acts as a negative regulator of dendrite growth, essential for proper brain development (Probst2007The). Additionally, FJX1 is implicated in cancer progression, influencing immune pathways and tumor-associated macrophage polarization, and is considered a potential biomarker for liver metastasis in colorectal cancer (Zou2022MultiOmics; Huang2022Intergrated).

## Function
FJX1, also known as four-jointed box kinase 1, is a protein involved in several critical cellular and developmental processes. In mammals, FJX1 is the orthologue of the Drosophila four-jointed kinase, which is known to regulate planar cell polarity through the Fat-Dachsous signaling pathway. Although FJX1 does not phosphorylate the vertebrate Fat1 cadherin in human cells, it is involved in the phosphorylation of extracellular domains of atypical cadherins during their transit through the secretory pathway. This activity is crucial for processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and planar cell polarity, which are important for organ size regulation and tumorigenesis (Tagliabracci2013Secreted; Sreelatha2015The).

FJX1 is predicted to be a secreted protein, localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus, and may act as a ligand for an unknown receptor. It is highly expressed in the brain, where it functions as a negative regulator of dendrite growth, necessary for proper brain development. Knockout studies in mice have shown that FJX1 is required for normal dendritic arborization in the hippocampus, indicating its role as a secreted inhibitory signal that regulates dendrite extension and branching (Tagliabracci2013Secreted; Probst2007The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FJX1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal carcinoma (CRC), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and other cancer types such as breast, lung, ovarian, and head and neck cancers. In CRC, FJX1 expression is significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with higher levels associated with advanced stages and poor patient outcomes (AlGreene2013Four; Zou2022MultiOmics). FJX1 is linked to angiogenesis, promoting tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing endothelial capillary tube formation and stabilizing HIF1-a protein, which induces pro-angiogenic programs (AlGreene2013Four).

In NPC, FJX1 overexpression contributes to cancer cell survival, proliferation, and invasiveness, with its role in several signaling pathways, including the Hippo, Wnt, Hedgehog, and Notch pathways, which are crucial for cancer progression (Chai2019An). High FJX1 expression is also associated with immune cell infiltration and an immunosuppressive microenvironment, correlating with reduced immunotherapy efficacy and worse overall survival in cancer patients (Huang2023Comprehensive).

FJX1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for liver metastasis in colorectal cancer, with its expression linked to poor prognosis and increased tumor growth (Zou2022MultiOmics). These findings suggest that FJX1 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a target for therapeutic strategies.

## Interactions
FJX1, a Notch-inducible secreted ligand, is involved in various interactions, particularly in developmental and cancer-related processes. In Drosophila, FJX1 is known to interact with cadherins such as dachsous (ds) and fat (ft), influencing planar cell polarity and growth through the Hippo pathway. However, in vertebrates, including humans, the direct interaction of FJX1 with homologous cadherins like FAT1 and FAT4 is not well established. Studies have shown that FJX1 does not catalyze the phosphorylation of the FAT1 ectodomain, suggesting that its role in vertebrate cadherin interactions might be regulatory rather than catalytic (Sadeqzadeh2014FAT1).

FJX1 is also implicated in cancer progression, where it influences immune pathways and tumor-associated macrophage polarization. Knockdown of FJX1 in colon cancer cells affects the expression of immune markers, indicating a shift in macrophage polarization from pro-tumor M2-like to antitumor M1-like states. This suggests that FJX1 may interact with immune-related pathways and molecules, impacting the tumor microenvironment and immune response (Huang2022Intergrated). Despite these findings, the specific molecular partners and mechanisms of FJX1 interactions in humans remain to be fully elucidated.
