# CACNB4

## Overview
The CACNB4 gene encodes the calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit beta 4, a critical component of the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). This protein functions as an auxiliary subunit, playing a pivotal role in modulating the activity and expression of these channels, particularly in the central nervous system. The beta 4 subunit is characterized by its tandem src homology 3 (SH3) and guanylate kinase (GK) domains, which are essential for its interaction with other channel components and its nuclear targeting capabilities (Coste2020A; Xu2015Solution). Beyond its role in calcium channel regulation, the beta 4 subunit is involved in channel-independent functions, such as gene regulation, by translocating to the nucleus and interacting with nuclear proteins (Ronjat2013Nuclear). Mutations in the CACNB4 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders, underscoring its significance in maintaining normal neuronal function (Naseer2022WholeExome).

## Structure
The CACNB4 gene encodes the auxiliary calcium channel beta4 subunit, which is part of the voltage-gated calcium channels. The protein structure includes a tandem src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a guanylate kinase (GK) domain, which are critical for its function in channel modulation and nuclear targeting (Coste2020A; Xu2015Solution). The SH3 domain spans residues 18-134, while the GK domain covers residues 166-374, connected by two serines (Xu2015Solution). 

The primary structure of the beta4 subunit is composed of 329 amino acids, with specific residues such as L173, N261, H262, and V303 playing key roles in protein interactions (Xu2015Solution). The secondary structure includes regions of α-helices and β-sheets, which are highly conserved across species (Ebert2008Genomic). 

In terms of tertiary structure, the SH3-GK core structure is essential for the protein's stability and function, with specific loops and helices forming binding pockets for interactions with other proteins (Xu2015Solution). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of the beta4 subunit with other channel components, such as the CaV2.1 α1 subunit, to form functional calcium channels (Coste2020A). 

The beta4 subunit undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms with distinct functions, such as the beta4b variant, which is involved in both channel modulation and gene regulation (Coste2020A).

## Function
The CACNB4 gene encodes the β4 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), which are crucial for regulating calcium ion influx in response to membrane depolarization. In healthy human cells, the β4 subunit is primarily expressed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, where it partners with P/Q-type (CaV2.1) calcium channels to modulate their gating properties and promote membrane expression (Escayg1998Calcium; Etemad2014The). This modulation is essential for processes such as neurotransmitter release and excitation/contraction coupling in muscle cells (Escayg1998Calcium).

Beyond its role in channel regulation, the β4 subunit also participates in channel-independent functions, including gene regulation. It can translocate to the nucleus, where it interacts with nuclear proteins and influences gene transcription. This nuclear function is linked to neuronal differentiation and function, as the β4 subunit forms complexes with proteins like the regulatory subunit of phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the thyroid receptor α, affecting epigenetic regulation (Rima2017The; Ronjat2013Nuclear). The β4 subunit's nuclear translocation is dependent on neuronal electrical activity and is crucial for linking neuronal excitability to gene transcription (Ronjat2013Nuclear).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CACNB4 gene, which encodes the beta-4 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, have been linked to several neurological disorders. These include juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), and episodic ataxia. Specific mutations such as p.Arg468Gln have been associated with febrile seizures and increased neurotransmitter release in excitatory neurons, potentially exacerbating conditions like severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI) when present alongside mutations in other genes like SCN1A (Ohmori2008A; Naseer2022WholeExome).

A homozygous missense mutation, p.Leu126Pro, is linked to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, and cerebellar atrophy. This mutation impairs both channel and non-channel functions of the beta-4 subunit, affecting its nuclear targeting properties (Coste2020A).

Other mutations, such as R482X and C104F, have been identified in patients with generalized epilepsy and episodic ataxia. These mutations alter the inactivation kinetics of calcium channels, contributing to the pathophysiology of these conditions (Escayg2000Coding). The lethargic mouse model, which carries a mutation in the CACNB4 gene, exhibits ataxia and absence seizures, further highlighting the gene's role in neurological disorders (Escayg1998Calcium).

## Interactions
The CACNB4 gene encodes the auxiliary calcium channel beta4 subunit, which participates in various protein interactions that influence both channel and non-channel functions. The beta4 subunit interacts with the alpha1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, affecting their trafficking and gating properties (Ronjat2013Nuclear). It forms a complex with the regulatory subunit B56δ of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), facilitating its nuclear translocation and involvement in gene transcription regulation (Ronjat2013Nuclear). This interaction is crucial for linking neuronal excitability to gene transcription (Ronjat2013Nuclear).

The beta4 subunit also interacts with transcription factors such as Pax6(S), suggesting a role in gene regulation (Rima2016Protein). A specific splice variant, beta4b, forms a protein complex with TNIK, a kinase involved in postsynaptic signaling and neurogenesis. However, a mutation in CACNB4, p.(Leu126Pro), disrupts this interaction, impairing both channel and non-channel functions and contributing to severe neurodevelopmental disorders (Coste2020A).

Additionally, the beta4 subunit interacts with heterochromatin protein 1 gamma (HP1γ), which is involved in gene silencing and transcriptional regulation, indicating a potential role in modulating gene expression (Rima2016Protein). These interactions highlight the multifunctional nature of the CACNB4 protein in cellular processes.
