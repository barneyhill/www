# AVPI1

## Overview
The AVPI1 gene encodes the protein arginine vasopressin induced 1, which is involved in cellular responses to the hormone arginine vasopressin. This protein plays a significant role in intracellular signaling pathways, influencing processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis. It is categorized as a signaling protein due to its involvement in these pathways. AVPI1 is implicated in the regulation of osmolarity within cells and is responsive to changes in cAMP-mediated gene expression, potentially being negatively regulated by the C6orf176 gene. While AVPI1 is not directly involved in oncogenic signaling, it is located in a chromosomal region associated with tumor suppressor genes, particularly in glioblastoma multiforme. Alterations in AVPI1 expression have been linked to various clinical conditions, including alcohol dependency, Alzheimer's disease, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and susceptibility (Barbash2017Alzheimer’s; Waugh2014Chromosomal; Sandoval2016Systemslevel; Reitmair2012C6orf176:; MuñozBello2024Potential; Zhou2019Nuclear).

## Function
The AVPI1 gene encodes a protein involved in the cellular response to arginine vasopressin, a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating water balance and blood pressure. This protein is implicated in intracellular signaling pathways and may influence cellular stress responses. It is active in various cellular compartments, affecting processes such as cell proliferation and apoptosis (Sandoval2016Systemslevel).

In the context of cAMP-mediated gene expression, AVPI1 has been identified as a gene responsive to changes in signaling pathways. When the C6orf176 gene, a potential regulator of cAMP-mediated gene expression, is silenced, AVPI1 expression is significantly upregulated, suggesting that AVPI1 may be negatively regulated by C6orf176. This indicates a potential role for AVPI1 in osmolarity regulation within cells, although the specific mechanisms or functions in healthy human cells are not fully detailed (Reitmair2012C6orf176:).

In glioblastoma multiforme, AVPI1 is located downstream of the PI4K2A gene on chromosome 10, and it shows a pattern of copy number loss similar to that of tumor suppressor genes. However, there is no evidence of its involvement in receptor-stimulated oncogenic signaling (Waugh2014Chromosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AVPI1 gene have been associated with several conditions. In the context of alcohol consumption, decreased levels of AVPI1 transcripts in the hypothalamus have been observed in mice after chronic alcohol intake, suggesting a potential role in alcohol drinking behaviors and withdrawal. A human genetic study also found an association between a variant in the AVPI1 gene and alcohol dependency in European men, indicating that variations in AVPI1 expression may influence susceptibility to alcohol addiction (Zhou2019Nuclear).

In glioblastoma multiforme, the AVPI1 gene is located near the PI4K2A gene on chromosome 10q, an area that frequently shows copy number loss in these tumors. Although AVPI1 itself is not directly implicated in oncogenic signaling, its loss is part of a broader chromosomal instability observed in glioblastoma (Waugh2014Chromosomal).

In Alzheimer's disease, changes in alternative polyadenylation (APA) patterns of AVPI1 have been noted, with significant expression changes in Alzheimer's patients compared to controls. These APA variations may contribute to the disease's pathology by affecting gene expression profiles linked to synaptic transmission and cognitive decline (Barbash2017Alzheimer’s).

In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, elevated expression of AVPI1 is associated with favorable outcomes in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (MuñozBello2024Potential).
