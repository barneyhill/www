# WNT6

## Overview
WNT6 is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 6, a secreted glycoprotein involved in various signaling pathways crucial for cellular processes. As a member of the WNT family, Wnt family member 6 is characterized by its role in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Wei2020Expression). The protein is known for its involvement in the WNT/β-catenin pathway, where it interacts with Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6 to regulate gene expression and cellular functions (Wei2020Expression). Additionally, Wnt family member 6 participates in non-canonical pathways, such as the WNT/Planar cell polarity and WNT/Ca2+ pathways, which are essential for maintaining cellular architecture and function (Wei2020Expression). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in various diseases, including cancer and diabetes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (He2020Secreted; Gonçalves2020A).

## Structure
WNT6 is a member of the WNT family of secreted glycoproteins, characterized by a conserved structure and function. The primary structure of WNT6 consists of a 365 amino-acid polypeptide, which includes an N-terminal signal peptide, a WNT core domain, and an RGD motif (Wei2020Expression). The secondary structure of WNT proteins, including WNT6, is suggested to involve alpha helices and beta sheets, stabilized by multiple intramolecular disulfide bonds due to the presence of 23 or 24 conserved cysteine residues (Miller2001Thewnts). 

The tertiary structure of WNT6, like other WNT proteins, is not fully understood due to their insolubility, but the conserved cysteine residues indicate a potential role in protein folding (Miller2001Thewnts). WNT6 is closely related to WNT10a, with which it is fused in a head-to-tail manner, suggesting some shared structural features (Wei2020Expression). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation are common in WNT proteins, affecting their stability and signaling capabilities (Ain2013Prediction). These modifications are crucial for the function and secretion of WNT proteins, including WNT6.

## Function
WNT6 is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a significant role in various biological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in both the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway and non-canonical pathways. In the canonical pathway, WNT6 binds to Frizzled (FZD) receptors and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) on the cell membrane, leading to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its translocation into the nucleus. This process activates downstream targets such as Cyclin D1, c-Myc, and matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7), which are involved in cell cycle regulation and other cellular functions (Wei2020Expression).

In the non-canonical pathways, WNT6 can activate the WNT/Planar cell polarity (PCP) and WNT/Ca2+ pathways, which regulate cell adhesion, migration, polarity, muscle contraction, gene transcription, and enzyme activation (Wei2020Expression). WNT6 is also crucial for the differentiation and migration of human dental papilla cells, enhancing the formation and size of calcified nodules during tooth mineralization (Wei2020Expression). Additionally, WNT6 plays a role in maintaining human limbal stem/progenitor cells by promoting their proliferation and maintaining their undifferentiated state (Bonnet2021Wnt6).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WNT6 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer. In glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor, WNT6 is overexpressed and correlates with higher tumor grades and poor survival outcomes. This overexpression enhances GBM cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is associated with decreased overall survival in both mouse models and patients. WNT6 operates through multiple pathways, including the β-catenin-dependent WNT pathway, and its expression is regulated by factors such as HOXA9 and DNA methylation (Wei2020Expression; Gonçalves2020A).

In colorectal cancer, WNT6 is activated by the transcription factor PLAGL2, which promotes cancer cell proliferation and progression through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This interaction highlights WNT6's role in tumorigenesis and suggests that targeting PLAGL2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy (Li2018Overexpressed).

WNT6 is also involved in diabetes-associated centrosome amplification, which is linked to cancer development. High glucose and insulin levels increase WNT6 expression, suggesting a connection between type 2 diabetes and cancer risk (He2020Secreted).

## Interactions
WNT6 interacts with various proteins and participates in multiple signaling pathways. It binds to Frizzled (FZD) receptors and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) on the cell membrane, which leads to the recruitment of disheveled (DVL) proteins. This interaction promotes the dissociation of the β-catenin destruction complex, allowing β-catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus, where it interacts with T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) transcription factors to activate downstream targets such as Cyclin D1, c-Myc, and matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) (Wei2020Expression).

WNT6 also interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases of the ROR and RYK families, activating non-canonical pathways like WNT/Planar cell polarity (PCP) and WNT/Ca2+, which regulate cell adhesion, migration, and polarity (Wei2020Expression). In the context of diabetes, WNT6 interacts with its receptor FZD4, activating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is implicated in centrosome amplification (He2020Secreted). This interaction is crucial for the activation of downstream mediators such as ROCK1 and 14-3-3σ, which are involved in centrosome amplification (He2020Secreted).
