# CLRN3

## Overview
CLRN3 is a gene that encodes the protein clarin 3, which is a multi-pass transmembrane protein primarily located in the plasma membrane of cells. This protein is implicated in sensory perception processes, particularly within the auditory and visual systems. Clarin 3 is characterized by its restricted distribution across cell types and is thought to play a crucial role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of sensory cells. In addition to its sensory functions, CLRN3 is also expressed in hepatocytes, where it is associated with the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells. This suggests a potential role in the establishment and maintenance of hepatocyte function, as well as involvement in cellular signaling pathways and receptor functions that may be relevant to infectious diseases (Mallanna2016Mapping).

## Structure


## Function
CLRN3 (clarin 3) is a gene that encodes a multi-pass transmembrane protein, which is primarily active in the plasma membrane of cells. This protein is involved in cellular processes related to sensory perception, particularly in the auditory and visual systems. Although the specific biological role of CLRN3 in hepatocytes is not well understood, it is noted for its restricted cell distribution and potential involvement in maintaining the structure and function of sensory cells (Mallanna2016Mapping).

In the context of liver biology, CLRN3 is identified as one of the cell-surface N-glycoproteins enriched during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells. Its expression is significantly increased during the final stages of hepatocyte differentiation, suggesting a role in the establishment of hepatocyte function (Mallanna2016Mapping). The protein is co-expressed with other markers such as SLC10A1 and AADAC in a subpopulation of iPSC-derived hepatocytes, which are used to improve the homogeneity and hepatic characteristics of these cells (Mallanna2016Mapping).

The identification of CLRN3 and its expression profile in hepatocytes may provide insights into liver biology and the potential involvement of this protein in cellular signaling pathways and receptor functions related to infectious diseases (Mallanna2016Mapping).
