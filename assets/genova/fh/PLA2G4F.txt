# PLA2G4F

## Overview
The PLA2G4F gene encodes the protein phospholipase A2 group IVF, also known as cPLA2ζ, which is a member of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 family. This enzyme is involved in the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids, a critical step in the biosynthesis of various lipid mediators. cPLA2ζ is distinct in its regulatory mechanisms and cellular localization compared to other isoforms, such as cPLA2α, and is primarily found in the cytosol and lysosome. It plays a significant role in inflammatory responses and is expressed in various immune cells, contributing to conditions such as acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Kitsiouli2009Phospholipase; Murakami2020Updating).

## Function
PLA2G4F encodes the enzyme cPLA2ζ, a member of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 family, which plays a significant role in the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipids. In healthy human cells, particularly in the heart, cPLA2ζ is involved in the Ca2+-activated release of AA from mitochondria. This AA is preferentially channeled into cytochrome P450 epoxygenases for the synthesis of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have protective effects against heart failure (Murakami2020Updating). 

cPLA2ζ is distinct from other cPLA2 isoforms, such as cPLA2α, in its regulatory mechanisms and cellular localization. While cPLA2α translocates to the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, cPLA2ζ translocates to ruffles and dynamic vesicular structures in response to ionomycin, indicating a unique regulatory mechanism (Murakami2020Updating). 

The enzyme is located in the cytosol and lysosome, with the ability to translocate to membrane and peripheral membrane vesicles. It is expressed in various human inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, eosinophils, T-cells, monocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome through the production of potent lipid mediators (Kitsiouli2009Phospholipase).
