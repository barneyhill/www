# TGM7

## Overview
TGM7 is a gene that encodes the enzyme transglutaminase 7, which belongs to the family of transglutaminase enzymes. These enzymes are known for their role in catalyzing the formation of covalent bonds between proteins, a process essential for various post-translational modifications. Transglutaminase 7 is particularly involved in cellular processes such as cell adhesion, extracellular matrix stabilization, and apoptosis. The enzyme is predominantly expressed in the testes and lungs, although it is distributed across various tissues. Despite its significant expression and evolutionary conservation, the precise physiological functions of TGM7 remain largely unexplored, with ongoing research aimed at uncovering its roles in human health and disease (Thangaraju2017Genomic; Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase).

## Function
Transglutaminase 7 (TGM7) is an enzyme involved in the formation of covalent bonds between proteins, playing a crucial role in post-translational modification processes such as cell adhesion, extracellular matrix stabilization, and apoptosis. TGM7 is active in both the cytoplasm and extracellular space, contributing to tissue integrity and cellular signaling. Despite its widespread distribution in different tissues, TGM7 exhibits high expression patterns primarily in the testes and lungs (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase).

The specific physiological function of TGM7 in healthy human cells remains largely unclear. However, it is under high selective pressure, similar to TGM2, suggesting a significant physiological role (Thangaraju2017Genomic). The evolutionary constraints on TGM7 are notable, as it does not have known pathological phenotypes associated with non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs), indicating a potential complexity in its function that parallels the multifunctionality observed in TGM2 (Thangaraju2017Genomic). Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise roles and mechanisms of TGM7 in human physiology, as its specific functions in healthy cells have yet to be fully understood (Thangaraju2017Genomic).
