# PMEPA1

## Overview
PMEPA1, or prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1, is a gene that encodes a type 1b transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in hormone-dependent tissues such as the prostate and ovary. The PMEPA1 protein is characterized by its luminal, membrane-spanning, and cytoplasmic domains, which facilitate its role in cellular signaling pathways. It is notably involved in the regulation of androgen and TGF-β signaling pathways, acting as a negative regulator of cell growth and proliferation. PMEPA1 interacts with several proteins, including SMAD2/3 and E3 ubiquitin ligases, to modulate these pathways. The gene is expressed in multiple isoforms, each contributing to its diverse functional roles. Clinically, PMEPA1 has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, including prostate, glioblastoma, and colorectal cancer, where its expression levels correlate with tumor growth and patient prognosis (Zhang2019PMEPA1; Sharad2020PMEPA1; Ji2019PMEPA1).

## Structure
The PMEPA1 protein is a type 1b transmembrane protein characterized by luminal, membrane-spanning, and cytoplasmic domains. The membrane-spanning domain consists of 23 amino acids, which is conserved across its isoforms, except for PMEPA1-c, which has a truncated 13 amino acid transmembrane domain (Sharad2019Analysis; Sharad2020PMEPA1). The cytoplasmic domain contains motifs such as PY, SIM, SH3, and WW binding domains, which facilitate protein interactions and mediate isoform-specific functions (Sharad2020PMEPA1). 

PMEPA1 has several isoforms, including a, b, c, d, and e, each with distinct exon-intron structures and extracellular domains. Isoforms a, b, and d have four exons and three introns, while isoform c has three exons and two introns. Isoform e includes an additional 57 amino acids due to intron retention (Sharad2020PMEPA1). 

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation by casein kinase II and protein kinase C, as well as N-linked glycosylation and N-myristoylation, although these modifications have not been experimentally confirmed (Rae2001Characterization; Sharad2020PMEPA1). The presence of proline-rich motifs suggests potential binding sites for SH3 and WW domain-containing proteins (Rae2001Characterization).

## Function
PMEPA1, also known as prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1, plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation and signaling pathways in healthy human cells. It is predominantly expressed in hormone-dependent organs such as the prostate and ovary, where it is involved in androgen signaling pathways. PMEPA1 is an androgen-inducible gene that acts as a negative regulator of cell growth in the prostate epithelium by interacting with the Nedd4 ubiquitin E3 ligase, suggesting its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (Sharad2020PMEPA1; Richter2007A).

In the context of TGF-β signaling, PMEPA1 functions as a negative feedback regulator by binding to SMAD2/3, preventing their phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation. This interaction modulates cell cycle progression and proliferation by controlling the activity of Smad3/4 and the expression of downstream targets like c-Myc and p21 (Liu2011PMEPA1). PMEPA1 is also involved in maintaining normal androgen levels, particularly through its isoform PMEPA1-b, which is a direct transcriptional target of the androgen receptor (Sharad2020PMEPA1). These functions highlight PMEPA1's role in cell growth regulation and its potential as a biomarker in hormone-regulated processes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PMEPA1 gene have significant clinical implications across various cancers. In prostate cancer, PMEPA1 functions as a negative regulator of androgen and TGF-β signaling pathways. The gene has two main isoforms, PMEPA1-a and PMEPA1-b, which play distinct roles in cancer progression. PMEPA1-a is associated with promoting prostate cancer cell growth and is linked to earlier biochemical recurrence, while PMEPA1-b inhibits cancer cell proliferation, and its reduced expression is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis (Sharad2019Analysis). 

In glioblastoma, PMEPA1a is upregulated and promotes tumor growth by interacting with the Hippo signaling pathway, leading to the degradation of tumor suppressor kinase LATS1, which silences tumor-suppressing signals (Ji2019PMEPA1). 

In colorectal cancer, PMEPA1 is overexpressed in tumor cells, particularly in those undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process linked to metastasis and poor prognosis. Knockdown of PMEPA1 in colorectal cancer cell lines reduces proliferation and invasion, indicating its role in cancer progression (Zhang2019PMEPA1). 

PMEPA1 expression is also correlated with poor prognosis in several other cancers, including bladder, cervical, and lung cancers, and is associated with immune cell infiltration and tumor immunity (Wang2021Diagnostic).

## Interactions
PMEPA1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in modulating various signaling pathways. It interacts with SMAD2 and SMAD3 proteins, which are critical for TGF-β signaling. PMEPA1a and PMEPA1b isoforms, which are membrane-bound, can interact with these SMAD proteins, inhibiting TGF-β signaling by sequestering R-SMADs and reducing transcription levels of TGF-β responsive genes (Sharad2019Analysis; Fournier2015The). PMEPA1 also interacts with E3 ubiquitin ligases such as NEDD4-1, NEDD4-2, AIP-4, and SMURF2, which are negative regulators of TGF-β signaling. PMEPA1a enhances the interaction between SMAD2 and SMURF2, crucial for its inhibitory effect on TGF-β signaling (Fournier2015The).

In prostate cancer, PMEPA1b interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), mediating its degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway involving the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4. This interaction is independent of the MDM2/p53 signaling pathway (Sharad2020PMEPA1). PMEPA1a also facilitates the degradation of LATS1, a kinase in the Hippo signaling pathway, by recruiting NEDD4, leading to the inhibition of Hippo signaling and activation of growth-promoting genes (Ji2019PMEPA1). These interactions highlight PMEPA1's role in regulating key signaling pathways involved in cancer progression.
