# B9D1

## Overview
B9D1 is a gene that encodes the protein B9 domain containing 1, which is a crucial component of the ciliary transition zone in eukaryotic cells. This protein is part of the B9 protein family and plays a significant role in ciliogenesis, the process of forming cilia, which are essential for various cellular functions such as signal transduction and movement. B9 domain containing 1 is involved in maintaining the structure and function of primary cilia by interacting with other proteins in the MKS complex, such as B9D2 and MKS1, and ensuring the proper localization of ciliary components (Roberson2015TMEM231; Hopp2011B9D1). Disruptions in the B9D1 gene can lead to ciliopathies, including Meckel syndrome and Joubert syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Romani2014Mutations; Hopp2011B9D1).

## Function
The B9D1 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis, the process of forming cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of cells. These structures are essential for various cellular functions, including signal transduction and movement. B9D1 is part of the B9 protein family, which is involved in the formation and function of primary cilia, impacting several signaling pathways critical for development (Williams2008Functional; Hopp2011B9D1).

In healthy human cells, B9D1 localizes to the basal body and primary cilia, as well as the transition zone, which is a critical region for ciliary function. The protein interacts with other B9 domain proteins, such as B9D2 and MKS1, and is involved in maintaining cilia structure and function (Hopp2011B9D1). B9D1 is essential for the proper localization of components of the MKS complex to the ciliary transition zone, which is vital for regulating the composition of the ciliary membrane and ensuring proper cell signaling (Roberson2015TMEM231).

Disruption of B9D1 function can lead to a reduction in ciliated cells, which is associated with various phenotypes observed in ciliopathies, such as Meckel syndrome and Joubert syndrome (Romani2014Mutations; Hopp2011B9D1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the B9D1 gene are associated with several ciliopathies, including Meckel syndrome (MKS) and Joubert syndrome (JS). Meckel syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by polycystic kidney disease, central nervous system defects, and liver fibrosis. B9D1 mutations, such as a splicing change (c.505+2T>C), have been linked to severe MKS phenotypes, including posterior encephalocele and multicystic dysplastic kidneys (Hopp2011B9D1). The genetic complexity of MKS is highlighted by the potential for oligogenic inheritance, where mutations in B9D1 may interact with other genes like CEP290 to modify disease presentation (Hopp2011B9D1).

In Joubert syndrome, B9D1 mutations contribute to neurological symptoms and the characteristic 'molar tooth sign' brain malformation. Novel biallelic variants in B9D1, such as c.341G>A and c.529G>C, have been identified in individuals with JS, affecting splicing and protein function (Katiyar2020Two). The overlap between MKS and JS suggests a shared pathogenic mechanism involving ciliary dysfunction (Romani2014Mutations).

B9D1 has also been implicated in the VATER/VACTERL malformation spectrum, where compound heterozygous variants may contribute to congenital anomalies, including renal malformations and cardiac defects (Kolvenbach2021Exome).

## Interactions
B9D1, a component of the MKS complex, is involved in various protein interactions crucial for ciliary function. It interacts with the cytosolic protein YN-Gli2 at the base and/or tip of most cilia, as demonstrated by the BiFC assay (Takao2017Protein). B9D1 also shows strong interactions with the transmembrane proteins SSTR3-YN and GPR161-YN, which drag B9D1 into the shaft of the cilium, indicating its role in the transit of these proteins through the ciliary gating zone (Takao2017Protein). These interactions are specific, as B9D1 does not interact with transmembrane proteins like caveolin and transferrin receptor, which are excluded from the ciliary compartment (Takao2017Protein).

B9D1 is a stable component of the ciliary gating zone, with a large immobile fraction, but it can be dynamically associated with other proteins, as shown by its interactions with SSTR3-FKBP in the presence of rapamycin (Takao2017Protein). In C. elegans, B9D1 forms a complex with other B9 domain proteins, such as B9D2 and MKS1, at the base of the cilium, which is essential for cilia biogenesis and function (Hopp2011B9D1).
