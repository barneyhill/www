# SNAI3

## Overview
SNAI3 is a gene that encodes the protein Snail family transcriptional repressor 3, a member of the Snail family of zinc-finger transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which enable it to bind to specific DNA sequences, thereby functioning as a transcriptional repressor. SNAI3 is involved in various biological processes, including embryonic development, cell differentiation, and the regulation of stem cell maintenance, particularly in mesenchymal stem cells (Razmara2021Functions; GUO2018Expression). Although its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is less prominent compared to other Snail family members, SNAI3 has been implicated in cancer progression, notably in breast and colorectal cancers, where it influences tumor metastasis and interacts with immune cells (Chen2018FOXD4; Tu2022Analysis). Despite its involvement in these critical processes, SNAI3 is not essential for embryogenesis in mice, suggesting functional redundancy with other Snail family proteins (Bradley2013The).

## Structure
The SNAI3 protein, a member of the Snail family of transcriptional repressors, is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its function as a transcription factor. SNAI3 contains four to five C2H2-type zinc finger domains at its C-terminus, which facilitate DNA binding, specifically to E-box consensus sites (CAGGTG or CANNTG) (Razmara2021Functions; GUO2018Expression). The N-terminal region of SNAI3 includes a SNAG (Snai/Gfi) domain, essential for its repressor activity, as it recruits chromatin regulators to silence target genes (Pioli2013Deletion).

The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, sharing significant sequence homology with other Snail family members, such as SNAI1 and SNAI2 (GUO2018Expression). Despite its structural similarities, SNAI3 exhibits specific functions distinct from epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which are not fully understood (Razmara2021Functions). While the context does not provide detailed information on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures of SNAI3, it is known that the protein's zinc finger domains and SNAG domain are critical for its transcriptional repressor function (Pioli2013Deletion). There is no mention of specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms for SNAI3 in the provided context.

## Function
SNAI3, a member of the Snail family of transcriptional repressors, functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor by binding to E-box sequences in DNA. This binding is facilitated by its zinc finger domains, which are crucial for its DNA-binding activity, and its N-terminal SNAG domain, which recruits chromatin regulators to silence target genes (Razmara2021Functions; Pioli2013Deletion). SNAI3 is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle, thymus, and myeloid cells, and is involved in transcriptional repression during embryonic development and cell differentiation (Bradley2013The; GUO2018Expression).

In healthy human cells, SNAI3 is implicated in the regulation of stem cell maintenance and differentiation, particularly in mesenchymal stem cells, which are precursors for cartilage and bone cells (Razmara2021Functions). Although its role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is less defined compared to other Snail family members, SNAI3 may influence cell fate decisions and tissue homeostasis (Razmara2021Functions). Despite its expression in various tissues, Snai3 knockout mice are viable and fertile, suggesting potential redundancy with other Snail family members, such as Snai1 and Snai2 (Bradley2013The).

## Clinical Significance
SNAI3, a member of the Snail family of transcriptional repressors, plays a role in cancer progression, particularly in breast and colorectal cancers. In breast cancer, SNAI3 expression is generally decreased compared to non-cancerous tissues, and its low expression is associated with a poorer prognosis when coupled with high immune cell infiltration. This suggests that SNAI3 may have prognostic implications in breast cancer, potentially influencing patient outcomes through its interaction with immune cells (Tu2022Analysis).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), SNAI3 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer metastasis. The transcription factor FOXD4 regulates SNAI3 expression, promoting CRC cell invasion and migration. This interaction suggests that SNAI3, through its regulation by FOXD4, contributes to CRC progression and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Chen2018FOXD4).

While SNAI3 is not essential for embryogenesis in mice, its role in cancer suggests it may have significant implications in pathological conditions, particularly in the context of tumor progression and immune system interactions (Bradley2013The).

## Interactions
SNAI3, a member of the Snail family of zinc-finger transcription factors, is known to interact with E-box motifs in DNA, competing with other transcription factors such as SOHLH2 and FIGα, which are involved in folliculogenesis (GUO2018Expression). This interaction suggests a role in regulating gene expression during follicle development and early embryo cleavage. In the context of colorectal cancer, SNAI3 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, where it interacts with the transcription factor FOXD4. FOXD4 can directly bind to the SNAI3 promoter, promoting SNAI3 expression and contributing to cancer metastasis (Chen2018FOXD4). This interaction highlights SNAI3's role in facilitating EMT and tumor progression.

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, the long non-coding RNA SNAI3-AS1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA, sponging miR-27a-3p and miR-34a-5p, which prevents these microRNAs from repressing PEG10 expression. This interaction promotes cell proliferation and metastasis, indicating a regulatory role of SNAI3-AS1 in cancer progression through modulation of miRNA activity (Li2020LncRNA). These interactions underscore SNAI3's involvement in various cellular processes and its potential impact on disease progression.
