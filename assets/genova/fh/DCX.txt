# DCX

## Overview
The DCX gene encodes the doublecortin protein, a microtubule-associated protein that plays a pivotal role in neuronal migration during brain development. Doublecortin is characterized by its two homologous doublecortin (DC) domains, which are essential for its interaction with microtubules, facilitating their stabilization and bundling. This protein is crucial for the proper formation of the cerebral cortex, as it ensures the correct organization of cortical layers by aiding in the migration of neurons to their destined locations (Sapir2000Doublecortin; Moslehi2017Dynamic). Mutations in the DCX gene are linked to severe neuronal migration disorders, such as X-linked lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia, underscoring its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental pathologies (Gleeson1998doublecortin; Portes1998A).

## Structure
The DCX (doublecortin) protein is characterized by its two homologous doublecortin (DC) domains, known as DC1 and DC2, which are crucial for its interaction with microtubules. These domains are separated by a flexible unstructured region and are flanked by unstructured N-terminal and serine/proline-rich C-terminal sequences (Moslehi2017Dynamic). The primary structure of DCX includes two tandemly repeated 80 amino acid regions, which are essential for microtubule binding and stabilization (Sapir2000Doublecortin).

The secondary structure of the N-terminal DCX domain (N-DCX) includes a mixed β-sheet of five β-strands and a major α-helix, forming a stable, ubiquitin-like tertiary fold (Kim2003The). The C-terminal DCX domain (C-DCX) is less structured, exhibiting characteristics of molten globules (Kim2003The). The tandem domain structure of DCX, comprising residues 45-275, is crucial for its biological function, as it facilitates microtubule bundling when overexpressed in cells (Kim2003The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate the dynamic association of DCX with microtubules, particularly affecting the C-terminal region (Moslehi2017Dynamic). The DCX domains are part of the ubiquitin-like superfamily, sharing structural similarities with GTPase-binding domains (Kim2003The).

## Function
The DCX (doublecortin) gene encodes a microtubule-associated protein that plays a crucial role in neuronal migration, a key process in brain development. In healthy human cells, DCX is involved in stabilizing microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cell shape, motility, and transport. This stabilization is vital for the proper formation of the cerebral cortex, as it ensures the correct organization of cortical layers by facilitating the movement of neurons to their destined locations (Ayanlaja2017Distinct).

DCX is highly expressed in the axons of neurons and regulates microtubules in response to extracellular signals, aiding in growth cone formation, dendritic extension, and nuclear translocation. It prevents nucleokinesis defects by maintaining the structure of microtubules, which is essential for neuronal pathfinding during development (Ayanlaja2017Distinct). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at the extremities of growing neuronal processes, where it interacts with microtubules and actin filaments to support cellular dynamics and migration (Ayanlaja2017Distinct; Friocourt2003Doublecortin).

DCX's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which influences its localization and interaction with other cytoskeletal components. This regulation is crucial for its role in neuronal migration and the maintenance of microtubule configuration, which is necessary for proper axonal growth and guidance (Jean2012A; Ayanlaja2017Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DCX (doublecortin) gene are associated with two primary neuronal migration disorders: X-linked lissencephaly (XLIS) and subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), also known as double cortex syndrome. These conditions result from abnormal neuronal migration during brain development, leading to significant neurological impairments (Gleeson1998doublecortin; Portes1998A).

In males, mutations in the DCX gene typically result in lissencephaly, characterized by a smooth brain surface due to the failure of neurons to migrate properly, causing severe intellectual disabilities and epilepsy (Gleeson1999Characterization; Pilz1998LIS1). In females, due to X-chromosome inactivation, the same mutations often lead to SBH, where a band of gray matter is found within the white matter, resulting in a range of symptoms from severe mental retardation to normal intelligence, depending on the mutation type and band thickness (Gleeson1998doublecortin; Matsumoto2001Mutation).

The DCX gene mutations include missense mutations, nonsense mutations, and deletions, which can lead to premature protein termination or altered protein function (Matsumoto2001Mutation; Portes1998A). These mutations disrupt the normal function of the DCX protein, which is crucial for neuronal migration, and are strongly suggested to be causative for these disorders (Gleeson1998doublecortin).

## Interactions
Doublecortin (DCX) is a microtubule-associated protein that interacts with various proteins to regulate neuronal migration and cortical development. DCX binds to microtubules and actin filaments, facilitating their bundling and cross-linking, which is crucial for cytoskeletal dynamics (Tsukada2005Doublecortin). The interaction with microtubules is negatively regulated by phosphorylation at specific serine residues, such as Ser-47 and Ser-297 (Tsukada2005Doublecortin).

DCX interacts with neurabin II, an F-actin-binding protein, which enhances its association with actin filaments. This interaction is regulated by phosphorylation and involves the coiled-coil domain of neurabin II and a specific region of DCX (Tsukada2003Identification). Neurabin II also mediates the interaction between DCX and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), facilitating site-specific dephosphorylation of DCX (Shmueli2006Site-specific).

DCX forms a complex with neurofascin (NF) in brain membrane fractions, and this interaction is influenced by phosphorylation. A DCX mutant, DCX-G253D, shows reduced binding to NF, affecting neuronal morphology (Yap2012Doublecortin). DCX also interacts with LIS1, enhancing tubulin polymerization and stabilizing microtubules, which is essential for brain development (Reiner2013LIS1).
