# RBPMS

## Overview
The RBPMS gene encodes the RNA-binding protein, mRNA processing factor, which is a critical player in RNA processing and regulation. This protein is characterized by its RNA recognition motif (RRM), which facilitates its binding to RNA and involvement in various cellular processes, including alternative splicing and transcriptional activation. RBPMS is particularly significant in the regulation of splicing in vascular smooth muscle cells and interacts with other RNA-binding proteins to modulate spliceosomal complex assembly. The protein's ability to form dynamic oligomers and its presence in both the nucleus and cytoplasm suggest roles in RNA transport and localization. Clinically, RBPMS has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in ovarian cancer, where its expression levels correlate with tumor progression and response to chemotherapy, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (RabeloFernández2022Reduced; Farazi2014Identification; Sun2006Potentiation).

## Structure
The RBPMS protein is characterized by a single RNA recognition motif (RRM), which is a common domain for RNA binding. The RRM domain of RBPMS is located between amino acids 24 and 101 and is flanked by 23 amino acids at the N-terminal and 95 amino acids at the C-terminal regions (Farazi2014Identification). The RRM domain exhibits a classical fold with a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and two α-helices, which is conserved across species, including humans, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans (Teplova2015Structural).

In its tertiary structure, the RRM domain of RBPMS forms a symmetrical dimer in its free state, with each monomer binding specifically to a CAC segment in the RNA (Teplova2015Structural). The dimerization is stabilized by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, involving key residues such as Lys36, Arg38, and Asp87 (Teplova2015Structural). The quaternary structure involves the formation of a homodimer, which is crucial for its function in RNA binding and localization to stress granules (Teplova2015Structural).

RBPMS is expressed as multiple mRNA isoforms, resulting in various protein isoforms, which are identical in the majority of their coding sequence (Farazi2014Identification). The C-terminal region of RBPMS is unstructured and characterized by a high density of prolines, which may influence its function and interactions (Farazi2014Identification).

## Function
The RBPMS gene encodes an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in regulating alternative splicing and transcriptional activation in human cells. RBPMS is involved in TGF-b/Smad-mediated transcriptional activation by enhancing Smad protein activity through increased phosphorylation, which is essential for various cellular processes (Sun2006Potentiation). It also acts as a master regulator of alternative splicing in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), influencing the splicing of genes related to the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and cell junction organization (Jacob2022RBPMS; NakagakiSilva2019Identification).

RBPMS forms dynamic oligomers that interact with other RNA-binding proteins, such as MBNL1 and RBFOX2, to modulate spliceosomal complex assembly and splicing decisions. This interaction is crucial for its function in splicing regulation, particularly in smooth muscle cells, where it can switch splicing patterns from exon inclusion to skipping (Yang2023Celltype). The protein's C-terminal intrinsically disordered region is essential for its oligomerization and RNA binding capabilities, which are necessary for its regulatory functions (Yang2023Celltype). RBPMS is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting roles in RNA transport and localization (Farazi2014Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RBPMS gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of ovarian cancer. Reduced levels of RBPMS are associated with increased cell proliferation, invasiveness, and decreased sensitivity to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug used in treating ovarian cancer. This suggests that RBPMS acts as a tumor suppressor, and its reduced expression contributes to drug resistance and tumor progression (RabeloFernández2022Reduced). In ovarian cancer patients, lower RBPMS expression correlates with reduced overall survival and disease-free survival rates, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker (RabeloFernández2022Reduced).

The study of RBPMS splice variants, such as RBPMSA and RBPMSC, further highlights their role in cancer biology. These variants are less expressed in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, and their overexpression in resistant cells leads to reduced proliferation and tumor growth, suggesting a potential therapeutic role (RabeloFernández2022Increased). Overexpression of RBPMSA increases sensitivity to cisplatin treatment, while both RBPMSA and RBPMSC reduce invasion and migration abilities of ovarian cancer cells (RabeloFernández2022Increased). These findings underscore the importance of RBPMS in influencing cancer progression and treatment response.

## Interactions
RBPMS interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and splicing regulation. It forms dynamic oligomers that interact with other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as MBNL1 and RBFOX2. These interactions block the binding of U1 and U2 snRNPs, which are essential for splicing, thereby inhibiting the formation of ATP-dependent complexes and altering the RNA-bound proteome composition (Yang2023Celltype). RBPMS also interacts with Smad proteins, specifically Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4, enhancing Smad-mediated transcriptional activation. This interaction is enhanced by TGF-b1 and involves the RNA recognition motif (RRM) region of RBPMS binding to the MH1 and MH2 domains of Smad4 (Sun2006Potentiation).

The C-terminal 20 amino acids of RBPMS are crucial for its interactions with other proteins, as their deletion leads to a near-global loss of the RBPMS interactome. This region is essential for forming higher-order oligomers and interacting with proteins like MATR3, RBM4, RBM14, RBM47, RBFOX2, ESRP2, and MBNL1 (Yang2023Celltype). RBPMS also undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation, forming dynamic, liquid-like droplets, which is critical for its ability to form higher-order structures and regulate splicing activity (Yang2023Celltype).
