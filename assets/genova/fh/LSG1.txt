# LSG1

## Overview
The LSG1 gene encodes the large 60S subunit nuclear export GTPase 1, a critical protein involved in ribosome biogenesis. As a member of the YlqF Related GTPase (YRG) family, this GTPase is characterized by a unique circular permutation of GTPase motifs, which distinguishes it from other small GTPases (Reynaud2005Human). The protein plays a pivotal role in the cytoplasmic maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, facilitating the release of the anti-association factor NMD3, which is essential for the formation of the mature 80S ribosome (Pantazi2019Inhibition). LSG1's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis, as its inhibition can lead to cellular senescence and endoplasmic reticulum stress, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Pantazi2019Inhibition). The protein's dual localization in the cytosol and nucleus, along with its interaction with ribosomal particles, underscores its significant role in ribosomal assembly and cellular processes (Reynaud2005Human).

## Structure
The human LSG1 protein is a member of the YlqF Related GTPase (YRG) family, characterized by a unique circular permutation of GTPase motifs. This permutation reorganizes the conserved GTPase motifs (G1, G2, G3, and G4) in a non-canonical order, specifically as G4 followed by G1, G2, and G3, which is distinct from the typical structure of small GTPases like Ras (Reynaud2005Human). The GTPase domain of LSG1 also contains an insertion that separates the G4 element from the other GTPase elements, contributing to its unique structural features (Reynaud2005Human).

The protein is involved in ribosome biogenesis and is essential for ribosomal assembly, with dual localization in the cytosol/endoplasmic reticulum and Cajal Bodies, suggesting a role in regulating the rRNA pathway (Reynaud2005Human). The localization studies indicate that LSG1 can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytosol, facilitated by a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminal, which is CRM1-dependent (Reynaud2005Human). The protein's structure and localization are crucial for its role in cellular processes, although specific details on its quaternary structure are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The LSG1 gene encodes a GTPase that is crucial for the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit in human cells. This protein is involved in the cytoplasmic maturation process, where it catalyzes the release of the anti-association factor NMD3 from the ribosomal 60S subunit. This step is essential for the formation of the mature 80S ribosome, which is responsible for protein synthesis (Pantazi2019Inhibition). LSG1 is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and interacts with ER-associated ribosomal particles, playing a role in maintaining ER morphology and function (Pantazi2019Inhibition; Reynaud2005Human).

Inhibition of LSG1 disrupts ribosome biogenesis, leading to cellular senescence characterized by cell cycle arrest and activation of the p53 pathway (Pantazi2019Inhibition). This disruption can also lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress and changes in cholesterol biosynthesis, indicating LSG1's role in cellular homeostasis (Pantazi2019Inhibition). The protein's activity is essential for normal cellular proliferation and growth, highlighting its critical function in ribosome assembly and cellular processes (Pantazi2019Inhibition; Reynaud2005Human).

## Clinical Significance
The LSG1 gene, which encodes the large 60S subunit nuclear export GTPase 1, plays a significant role in ribosome biogenesis and cellular senescence. Alterations in LSG1 expression or function can have clinical implications, particularly in cancer. Inhibition of LSG1 disrupts endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and induces cellular senescence, a process that can suppress tumor growth even in the absence of functional p53, a common tumor suppressor gene. This suggests that LSG1 could be a potential target for cancer therapy, especially in tumors where the p53 and RB pathways are defective (Pantazi2019Inhibition).

The knockdown of LSG1 leads to a senescence response characterized by upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathways and a restricted senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) involving TGFβ signaling. This response is similar to oncogene-induced senescence, indicating that LSG1 inhibition might mimic certain aspects of this process to halt cancer cell proliferation (Pantazi2019Inhibition).

While LSG1 mutations are not directly linked to specific ribosomopathies, its role in ribosome maturation and cellular senescence pathways highlights its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Pantazi2019Inhibition).

## Interactions
LSG1, a GTPase involved in ribosome biogenesis, plays a crucial role in the maturation and export of the 60S ribosomal subunit. It interacts with the anti-association factor NMD3, facilitating its release from the 60S subunit in the cytoplasm, a process essential for the formation of the mature 80S ribosome (Pantazi2019Inhibition; Karbstein2007Role). This interaction is dependent on the presence of ribosomal protein RPL10, which is necessary for NMD3 release and subsequent ribosomal subunit maturation (Karbstein2007Role).

LSG1 also associates with the Nmd3p-60S complex, indicating its involvement in the final stages of ribosome assembly. It binds to recycling cytoplasmic 60S subunits, as opposed to nascent ones, highlighting its role in the later stages of ribosome biogenesis (Kallstrom2003The). The interaction with NMD3 and the 60S subunit is enhanced by the presence of guanine nucleotides, particularly GTP, which stabilizes LSG1's binding and activity (JaramilloRamírez2021Characterisation).

LSG1's activity is modulated by its interaction with guanine nucleotides, with a higher affinity for GTP than GDP, suggesting that it predominantly exists in a GTP-bound form in the cytoplasm (JaramilloRamírez2021Characterisation). This interaction is crucial for the release of NMD3 and the incorporation of ribosomal proteins, such as eL40 and uL16, into the 60S subunit (JaramilloRamírez2021Characterisation).
