# TFEB

## Overview
TFEB (Transcription Factor EB) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) family of transcription factors. The protein, also referred to as TFEB, plays a pivotal role in regulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, processes essential for cellular homeostasis and metabolism. It functions by binding to specific DNA sequences known as CLEAR elements, thereby modulating the expression of genes involved in lysosomal and autophagic pathways (Napolitano2016TFEB; Martina2014Novel). TFEB's activity is tightly regulated by nutrient availability and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by mTORC1, which influence its subcellular localization and function (Tan2022Past; Napolitano2016TFEB). Dysregulation of TFEB has been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and lysosomal storage diseases, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Cortes2019TFEB; Tan2022Past).

## Structure
TFEB (transcription factor EB) is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) family of transcription factors, characterized by its unique structural domains. The protein contains a basic region adjacent to a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain and a leucine zipper (LZ) domain, which are crucial for its DNA-binding and dimerization properties (Fisher1991TFEB). The LZ domain is essential for high-affinity DNA binding, as its deletion results in a significant reduction in binding affinity, likely due to the inability to form dimers (Fisher1991TFEB).

TFEB can form both homodimers and heterodimers, particularly with TFE3, another member of the same protein family, indicating a shared mechanism in forming protein-protein oligomers and binding to DNA (Fisher1991TFEB). In the absence of DNA, TFEB predominantly exists as a tetramer, which dissociates into dimers upon DNA binding, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for its activity (Fisher1991TFEB).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by mTORC1, play a significant role in regulating TFEB's activity and subcellular localization. TFEB interacts with Rag GTPases for recruitment to mTORC1, forming a complex that is crucial for its phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation (Cui2023Structure). These structural and functional characteristics highlight TFEB's role in cellular processes like lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy.

## Function
Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a critical regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy in healthy human cells. It functions by binding to CLEAR (Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation) elements in the promoter regions of lysosomal and autophagy-related genes, thereby enhancing their expression and promoting lysosomal function and autophagosome formation (Napolitano2016TFEB; Martina2014Novel). TFEB is involved in various autophagic processes, including macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy, and plays a role in selective autophagy such as mitophagy (Zhu2021The).

TFEB also influences cellular metabolism by regulating lipid, energy, amino acid, and glucose metabolism. It affects lipid transport and lipophagy, influences energy metabolism through mitochondrial biogenesis, and responds to amino acid signals via RAGs (Zhu2021The). In skeletal muscle, TFEB regulates glucose homeostasis and energy balance, partly by modulating mitochondrial biogenesis (Napolitano2016TFEB).

TFEB's activity is modulated by nutrient availability. Under nutrient-rich conditions, it is phosphorylated by mTORC1 and retained in the cytoplasm. During nutrient deprivation, it is dephosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus to activate target genes (Tan2022Past; Napolitano2016TFEB). This regulation allows TFEB to coordinate cellular responses to varying energetic demands, maintaining cellular homeostasis (Martina2014Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and dysregulation of the TFEB gene are implicated in several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, and lysosomal storage diseases. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, TFEB dysregulation contributes to impaired autophagy and lysosomal function. In Alzheimer's disease, TFEB upregulation is considered a potential therapeutic approach due to its role in lysosomal clearance of amyloid-beta and other toxic proteins (Cortes2019TFEB). In Parkinson's disease, TFEB is mislocalized in the substantia nigra, linked to impaired lysosomal function and α-synuclein toxicity (Cortes2019TFEB; Tan2022Past). 

In cancer, TFEB overexpression is associated with tumor growth and metastasis. It is involved in the transcriptional activation of autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis, which cancer cells exploit for survival. Chromosomal translocations involving TFEB are linked to renal cell carcinoma and other cancers (Tan2022Past; Zhu2021The). 

In lysosomal storage disorders, TFEB plays a significant role in managing the accumulation of undegraded substances. For instance, in Pompe disease, TFEB helps clear glycogen build-up and increases lysosomal numbers (Tan2022Past). These findings highlight TFEB's potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases where its dysregulation contributes to disease pathology.

## Interactions
TFEB (transcription factor EB) interacts with several proteins that regulate its activity and localization. One key interaction is with the YWHA/14-3-3 proteins, which bind to TFEB when it is phosphorylated at serine 211 by mTORC1. This binding retains TFEB in the cytoplasm under nutrient-rich conditions, preventing its nuclear translocation and subsequent activation of autophagy-related genes (Xu2019YWHA1433). The interaction is noncanonical, as the TFEB p-S211-peptide lacks a critical arginine but compensates with hydrophobic residues (Xu2019YWHA1433).

TFEB also interacts with MAP4K3, which phosphorylates it at serine 3. This phosphorylation is necessary for TFEB's interaction with the mTORC1-Rag GTPase complex, influencing its localization and function in autophagy (Hsu2018MAP4K3). The phosphorylation at serine 3 is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation at serine 211 by mTORC1, which is crucial for TFEB's cytoplasmic retention (Hsu2018MAP4K3).

Additionally, TFEB undergoes various post-translational modifications that affect its interactions. For instance, STUB1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds to phosphorylated TFEB, promoting its degradation (Chen2024From). These interactions and modifications are essential for TFEB's role in cellular processes like autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis.
