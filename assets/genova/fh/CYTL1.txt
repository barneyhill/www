# CYTL1

## Overview
CYTL1, or cytokine-like protein 1, is a gene that encodes a secreted protein involved in various biological processes, including cartilage homeostasis, angiogenesis, and immune response regulation. The protein, characterized by a chemokine-like fold, plays a significant role in cellular communication and organismal homeostasis. It is involved in chondrogenesis and bone homeostasis by modulating key factors such as Sox9 and insulin-like growth factor 1. CYTL1 also exhibits chemotactic and pro-angiogenic properties, particularly through interactions with chemokine receptors like CCR2. In the context of cancer, CYTL1 functions as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing mitochondrial complex I and inhibiting metabolic reprogramming. Its expression levels are implicated in various diseases, including breast, lung, and gastric cancers, as well as osteoarthritis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhu2019Protein; Xue2022Intracellular; Schneller2019CytokineLike).

## Structure
CYTL1, also known as cytokine-like protein 1, is a secreted protein encoded by the CYTL1 gene. The primary structure of CYTL1 consists of 126 amino acids, with a signal peptide spanning residues 1 to 22, indicating its secretory nature (Zhu2019Protein). The protein is characterized by a unique cysteine pattern, which suggests the formation of disulfide bonds similar to those found in certain chemokines (Tomczak2017Biochemical).

The secondary structure of CYTL1 includes a higher content of beta-strands compared to alpha-helices, with circular dichroism analysis revealing 13% alpha-helix and 32% beta-strand content (Tomczak2017Biochemical). This composition aligns with an IL8-like chemokine fold rather than a 4-helical cytokine fold (Tomczak2017Biochemical).

In terms of tertiary structure, CYTL1 is predicted to adopt a chemokine-like fold, similar to CCL2, despite lacking significant sequence homology to known chemokines (Tomczak2017Biochemical). The protein's structure is further stabilized by disulfide bonds, and it shares structural features with chemokines, including potential glycosylation sites (Tomczak2011Identification).

Post-translational modifications of CYTL1 include O-glycosylation at threonines 106 and 107, which is crucial for its proangiogenic function (Schneller2019CytokineLike). This modification results in a molecular weight difference between the glycosylated and unmodified forms of the protein (Schneller2019CytokineLike).

## Function
The CYTL1 gene encodes a cytokine-like protein involved in various molecular processes and plays a significant role in cell biology. In healthy human cells, CYTL1 is primarily involved in cartilage homeostasis and chondrogenesis. It is expressed in chondrocytes and influences cartilage formation by modulating the expression of Sox9 and insulin-like growth factor 1, which are crucial for cartilage development and maintenance (Zhu2019Protein; Zhu2020The). CYTL1 also exhibits chemotactic and pro-angiogenic effects, particularly in endothelial progenitor cells, where it promotes angiogenesis by inducing endothelial sprouting and vessel formation. This activity is mediated through chemokine receptors, notably CCR2, and is essential for processes like wound healing and tissue regeneration (Schneller2019CytokineLike).

In the context of bone homeostasis, CYTL1 regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). It promotes the proliferation of undifferentiated hMSCs, thereby increasing the pool of osteoprogenitor cells, while inhibiting osteogenic differentiation by blocking RUNX2, a transcription factor crucial for osteogenesis (Shin2019CYTL1). These functions highlight CYTL1's role in maintaining cellular communication and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CYTL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In breast cancer, CYTL1 is significantly downregulated, and its low expression is associated with poor prognosis, including reduced survival rates. This downregulation is linked to DNA hypermethylation and low copy number variations, which contribute to the progression and metastasis of breast cancer (Wang2019CYTL1; Xue2022Intracellular). CYTL1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting glycolysis and stabilizing mitochondrial complex I, thereby preventing metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells (Xue2022Intracellular).

In lung cancer, CYTL1 is also downregulated, which correlates with increased cell migration and invasion. Overexpression of CYTL1 in lung cancer cells has been shown to reduce these processes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Wang2019CYTL1). Similarly, in gastric cancer, elevated CYTL1 expression is associated with increased cell proliferation and poor prognosis, indicating a complex role in cancer biology (Bai2023CYTL1).

Beyond cancer, CYTL1 is involved in osteoarthritis, where its expression is downregulated, contributing to disease progression (Zhu2019Protein). These findings highlight CYTL1's potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
CYTL1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. In breast cancer cells, CYTL1 acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing the NDUFV1 protein, a component of mitochondrial complex I. This stabilization occurs through CYTL1's competitive binding to NDUFV1, preventing its degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2. This interaction is crucial for inhibiting metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis, thereby maintaining oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Xue2022Intracellular).

CYTL1 also influences the activity of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) by inhibiting its phosphorylation at tyrosine 10, which is mediated through its interaction with NDUFV1. This interaction affects lactate production and is significant in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells (Xue2022Intracellular).

In addition to its role in cancer, CYTL1 interacts with the chemokine receptor CCR2, exhibiting chemotactic activity for monocytes and macrophages. This interaction is involved in immune response regulation and has implications in conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (Zhu2019Protein; Tomczak2017Biochemical). These interactions highlight CYTL1's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis.
