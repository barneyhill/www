# MT-ND4

## Overview
The MT-ND4 gene is a critical component of the mitochondrial genome, encoding the mitochondrially encoded NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 4, a transmembrane protein integral to the function of Complex I in the electron transport chain. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation (Lo2021Mitochondrial). The MT-ND4 protein's structure, characterized by transmembrane helices, is crucial for its function in proton translocation and interaction with other subunits within Complex I (Musiani2022New). Mutations in the MT-ND4 gene are linked to various mitochondrial disorders, including Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and Leigh syndrome, underscoring its clinical significance (Carelli2022Indirect; Xu2016Novel).

## Structure
The MT-ND4 gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also known as Complex I, which is integral to the electron transport chain. The primary structure of the MT-ND4 protein consists of 459 amino acids (Arezi2018The). This protein is a highly conserved transmembrane protein, with significant conservation across Eukaryota, Vertebrata, and Mammalia (Musiani2022New).

The secondary structure of MT-ND4 includes transmembrane helices, specifically within helices TM5, TM6, and TM7, which are involved in binding interactions with inhibitors like rotenone (Musiani2022New). Structural analyses have shown that mutations can introduce elements such as beta-sheets and pi-helices, which are not present in the native protein (Arezi2018The).

In terms of tertiary structure, the MT-ND4 protein forms a specific 3D conformation essential for its function in electron transport. The quaternary structure involves its integration into Complex I, where it interacts with other subunits, such as ND2, to facilitate proton translocation (Musiani2022New). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in mitochondrial function, and mutations can significantly impact its stability and function, potentially leading to mitochondrial diseases (MkaouarRebai2021Mitochondrial).

## Function
The MT-ND4 gene encodes a subunit of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex, also known as Complex I, which is the first enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This complex plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process that is coupled with the translocation of protons across the mitochondrial membrane. This proton translocation generates a proton-motive force that is essential for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation (Lo2021Mitochondrial; MkaouarRebai2021Mitochondrial).

In healthy human cells, the MT-ND4 gene is crucial for maintaining the proper function of the electron transport chain, which is vital for ATP production and overall cellular energy homeostasis. The protein encoded by MT-ND4 is involved in the binding of proteins, as indicated by the presence of a protein binding region at the E433 residue (MkaouarRebai2021Mitochondrial). The stability of the mitochondrial super complex, which involves interactions between Complex I and Complex III, is also dependent on the MT-ND4 gene. This stability is important for efficient electron transfer and the prevention of excessive reactive oxygen species production, which can lead to cellular damage (Lo2021Mitochondrial).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MT-ND4 gene are associated with several mitochondrial disorders, most notably Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). LHON is a maternally inherited condition that leads to severe bilateral central vision loss, primarily due to the m.11778G>A mutation in the MT-ND4 gene. This mutation results in a poor visual prognosis with infrequent spontaneous recovery (Carelli2022Indirect). Lenadogene nolparvovec, an investigational gene therapy, has been developed to address this mutation by complementing the defective ND4 gene, showing significant improvements in visual acuity in clinical trials (Carelli2022Indirect).

In addition to LHON, MT-ND4 mutations have been implicated in other neurodegenerative conditions. For instance, a novel mutation, m.11240C4T, in the ND4 gene has been identified in a patient with Leigh syndrome, a rare neurological disease characterized by developmental delay and progressive loss of mental and movement abilities. This mutation impairs the proton pumping channel of complex I, leading to decreased mitochondrial complex I activity and lower ATP-related mitochondrial respiration (Xu2016Novel).

Another mutation, m.12058A>C, was found in a patient with a severe phenotype, including multisystemic disorders such as sensorineural hearing loss and neurodevelopmental delay, suggesting its potential pathogenicity (MkaouarRebai2021Mitochondrial).

## Interactions
MT-ND4, a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, is involved in several interactions critical for its function. It interacts with other subunits within complex I, such as ND2, forming part of the rotenone-binding pocket essential for the electron transport chain's function. This interaction is crucial for the proton pumping mechanism of the mitochondrial membrane (Musiani2022New). The ND4 subunit also plays a role in the assembly of complex I, with its presence being essential for the formation of the complex I membrane arm (Houštěk2012Nonsynonymous).

MT-ND4 is also involved in interactions with nucleic acids. In breast cancer cells, the microRNA let-7a targets MT-ND4, leading to post-transcriptional repression of ND4 expression. This interaction affects oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic pathways, highlighting the role of let-7a in metabolic reprogramming (Sharma2021Let7a). The interaction between let-7a and ND4 was confirmed through RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interaction studies, including RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays (Sharma2021Let7a). These interactions underscore the importance of MT-ND4 in both structural and regulatory roles within the mitochondria, impacting cellular metabolism and energy production.
