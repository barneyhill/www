# PLA2G2F

## Overview
PLA2G2F is a gene that encodes the protein phospholipase A2 group IIF, a member of the secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) family. This enzyme is primarily involved in lipid metabolism and is categorized as a secreted enzyme due to its extracellular activity. Phospholipase A2 group IIF plays a significant role in maintaining skin homeostasis by contributing to the skin barrier function and acidification, particularly in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis. It preferentially hydrolyzes plasmalogen-type phosphatidylethanolamine to produce bioactive metabolites, which are crucial for keratinocyte differentiation and activation. The gene's expression and activity are linked to various skin conditions, including psoriasis and skin cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Murakami2018Phospholipase; Murakami2016The; Yamamoto2015The).

## Function
PLA2G2F, also known as group IIF secreted phospholipase A2, is primarily expressed in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis in both mice and humans. It plays a crucial role in maintaining skin homeostasis by contributing to the skin barrier function and acidification. The enzyme is active in the extracellular space and functions optimally within the acidic pH range of the skin, which aligns with its distribution in the upper epidermis (Murakami2018Phospholipase; Yamamoto2015The).

PLA2G2F preferentially hydrolyzes plasmalogen-type phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to produce bioactive metabolites such as plasmalogen-type lysoPE (P-LPE) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These metabolites are involved in keratinocyte differentiation and activation, which are essential processes for maintaining the integrity and function of the epidermis (Murakami2018Phospholipase; Murakami2019Group).

In healthy human cells, PLA2G2F is implicated in regulating lipid metabolism and keratinocyte differentiation, contributing to the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis. Its activity is linked to the production of specific lipid metabolites that influence keratinocyte behavior, thereby playing a role in skin barrier function and response to environmental stress (Murakami2016The; Yamamoto2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PLA2G2F gene have been implicated in several skin disorders, including psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and skin cancer. Elevated levels of PLA2G2F expression are associated with epidermal hyperplasia, a characteristic of these conditions (Yamamoto2015The). In psoriasis, PLA2G2F expression is induced by Th17 cytokines such as IL-17A and IL-22, leading to keratinocyte activation and the production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators (Shao2021Phospholipase; Murakami2020Updating). 

The gene's overexpression in transgenic mice results in psoriasis-like epidermal hyperplasia and alopecia, suggesting a direct role in promoting these conditions (Murakami2018Phospholipase; Yamamoto2015The). Conversely, mice lacking PLA2G2F show protection against psoriasis and skin cancer, indicating that the gene's activity exacerbates these diseases (Murakami2020Updating). 

PLA2G2F also influences lipid metabolism, affecting the production of bioactive metabolites like P-LPE, which are linked to keratinocyte hyperplasia and activation (Yamamoto2015The). Targeting PLA2G2F and its lipid products is proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating hyperproliferative skin diseases (Yamamoto2015The; Shao2021Phospholipase).
