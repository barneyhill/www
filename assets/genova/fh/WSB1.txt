# WSB1

## Overview
WSB1 (WD repeat and SOCS box containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is integral to the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation. The WSB1 protein is characterized by its WD-40 repeat motifs and a SOCS box, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. These structural features enable WSB1 to target specific proteins for degradation, thereby regulating various cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and stress responses. WSB1 is involved in critical signaling pathways, including β-catenin signaling, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Its dysregulation is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in cancers like prostate and pancreatic cancer, while its interaction with proteins such as LRRK2 offers potential neuroprotective effects in Parkinson's disease (Nucifora2016Ubiqutination; Dentice2005The; Kim2016WSB1).

## Structure
The WSB1 protein is characterized by the presence of WD-40-repeat motifs and a SOCS box at its C-terminal end. These structural features are conserved across species, including humans, mice, and Fugu rubripes (KehrerSawatzki1999Characterization). The WD-40 repeats are involved in protein-protein interactions and form a beta-propeller structure, which is typical of this domain (Dentice2005The). The SOCS box is a suppressor of cytokine signaling domain that facilitates interactions with an ubiquitinating catalytic core complex, specifically the Elongin BC-Cul5-Rbx1 complex, indicating its role in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Dentice2005The).

The WSB1 protein functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, particularly targeting the thyroid-hormone activating type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) for ubiquitination. This interaction is mediated by the WD-40 propeller, which recognizes a specific 18-amino acid loop in D2, and the SOCS box, which interacts with the ubiquitination machinery (Dentice2005The). The WD-40 propeller of WSB1 is composed of seven repeats, crucial for substrate recognition, with specific arginine residues playing a key role in binding (Dentice2005The). The structural relationship of WSB1 is similar to that of β-TrCP1, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, highlighting the functional and structural parallels between SOCS-box and F-box proteins (Dentice2005The).

## Function
WSB1 (WD repeat and SOCS box containing 1) is a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within cells. WSB1 is involved in the regulation of several key cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. It achieves this by targeting specific proteins for degradation, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) (Fang2024WSB1; Shichrur2014Potential).

In healthy human cells, WSB1 is known to regulate β-catenin signaling, a pathway critical for cell proliferation and differentiation. WSB1 stabilizes β-catenin by inhibiting its ubiquitination, thereby promoting its nuclear translocation and enhancing its transcriptional activity (Gao2020WSB1). This regulation is significant for normal cellular functions and can impact cancer development when dysregulated.

WSB1 is active in various cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, where it forms part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Its activity is modulated by cellular stress conditions, which can influence its expression and function, highlighting its role in cellular stress responses (Archange2008The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the WSB1 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, increased WSB1 expression is associated with higher cancer grades and a worse prognosis, including shorter disease-free intervals and overall survival. This suggests that WSB1 could serve as a clinical biomarker for aggressive forms of prostate cancer (Boldrini2023WSB1). WSB1 is also involved in the progression of other cancers, such as pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma, where its dysregulation is linked to tumor incidence and metastatic potential (Boldrini2023WSB1; Haque2016WSB1:).

WSB1 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting proteins like ATM for degradation, which is crucial in the DNA damage response. This degradation allows cells to bypass oncogene-induced senescence, promoting tumorigenesis. Overexpression of WSB1 has been observed in various cancers, including lung, breast, and prostate, contributing to genomic instability and tumor progression (Kim2016WSB1).

In neurodegenerative diseases, WSB1 modulates the aggregation of the LRRK2 protein, which is associated with Parkinson's Disease. This aggregation is neuroprotective, reducing neuronal toxicity (Nucifora2016Ubiqutination). WSB1's role in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury involves activating β-catenin signaling, which promotes cell survival during ischemic conditions (Fang2024WSB1).

## Interactions
WSB1, a protein containing WD repeats and a SOCS box, participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with ATM, a key protein in the DNA damage response, through its WD40 repeats and SOCS domain. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of ATM, which facilitates cellular transformation by suppressing the DNA damage response (Kim2016WSB1).

WSB1 also interacts with HIPK2, a homeodomain-interacting protein kinase, targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation. The WD40 repeats of WSB1 are responsible for this interaction, while both the WD40 repeats and the SOCS box are necessary for HIPK2 degradation (Choi2008Ubiquitination).

In the context of Parkinson's disease, WSB1 interacts with LRRK2, promoting its ubiquitination through K27 and K29 linkages. This interaction leads to LRRK2 aggregation, which is associated with reduced neuronal toxicity and protection in models of Parkinson's disease (Nucifora2016Ubiqutination).

WSB1 also plays a role in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by interacting with GSK3β. This interaction promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of GSK3β, activating β-catenin signaling and reducing apoptosis in myocardial cells (Fang2024WSB1).
