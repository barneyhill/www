# ABI1

## Overview
ABI1 is a gene that encodes the Abl interactor 1 (Abi1) protein, which is a crucial component in various cellular processes, particularly those involving the actin cytoskeleton. Abi1 is categorized as a cytoskeletal regulatory protein and is integral to the WAVE2 signaling complex, which is essential for actin polymerization and cellular motility. The protein is characterized by several domains, including a Wave-binding domain, SNARE domain, and SH3 domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in cytoskeletal reorganization and signal transduction (Proepper2007Abelson; Echarri2004Abl). Abi1 is involved in cell-cell adhesion, embryonic development, and various physiological processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in several cancers, including prostate and colorectal cancer (Dubielecka2011Essential; Nath2019Abi1).

## Structure
The ABI1 protein, also known as Abl interactor 1, is characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cytoskeletal reorganization and signal transduction. The protein contains an N-terminal Wave-binding (WAB) domain, which is crucial for its interaction with Wave proteins and its localization to the lamellipodium (Echarri2004Abl). The SNARE domain, also located at the N-terminus, is essential for binding to Syntaxin-1, a member of the SNARE protein family involved in vesicle fusion (Echarri2004Abl). The C-terminal region of ABI1 includes an SH3 domain, which facilitates interactions with proline-rich motifs in other proteins, such as ProSAP2/Shank3 (Proepper2007Abelson).

ABI1 is a proline-rich protein, which is typical of transcription activation domains and may aid in binding to SH3 domains (Shi1995Ablinteractor1). The protein is known to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, a process regulated by its SNARE, WAB, and SH3 domains (Echarri2004Abl). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by abelson kinase, play a role in its function, with phosphorylated forms appearing during neuronal development (Proepper2007Abelson). ABI1 also has multiple splice variant isoforms, which can influence its interactions and cellular functions.

## Function
The ABI1 gene encodes the Abl interactor 1 (Abi1) protein, which plays a critical role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell motility, and adhesion. Abi1 is a key component of the WAVE2 signaling complex, which is essential for actin polymerization and remodeling in cells. This complex, which includes WAVE2, Nap1, and PIR121, is recruited to the leading edge of lamellipodia in response to Rac activation, facilitating actin polymerization necessary for membrane protrusion and cell movement (Innocenti2004Abi1).

Abi1 is also involved in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion, particularly through E-cadherin-mediated adhesion. It forms a complex with Nap1 and Dia proteins, which are crucial for the formation and maintenance of intercellular junctions. Depletion of Abi1 impairs cell-cell junction formation and reduces the accumulation of β-catenin and E-cadherin at sites of cell-cell contact, indicating its importance in maintaining healthy cell-cell adhesion (Ryu2009Regulation).

In addition to its role in actin dynamics, Abi1 is essential for the stability and integrity of the WAVE2 complex. The absence of Abi1 leads to decreased levels of WAVE2 complex components and affects cellular motility, highlighting its critical function in embryonic development and various physiological processes (Dubielecka2011Essential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ABI1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly prostate cancer. In prostate cancer, ABI1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene. Its disruption is associated with the development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a precursor to prostate cancer. Mutations in ABI1, such as point mutations and deletions, have been identified in primary prostate tumors, leading to abnormal cellular adhesion and enhanced cellular proliferation (Xiong2012Disruption). Loss of ABI1 expression is linked to high-grade prostate tumors and poor clinical outcomes, including biochemical recurrence and metastasis (Nath2019Abi1).

ABI1 is also involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and non-canonical WNT signaling pathways, contributing to increased tumor invasiveness and progression in prostate cancer. The loss of ABI1 disrupts the WAVE complex, leading to decreased cell-cell adhesion and activation of EMT, which enhances cell migration and invasion (Nath2019Abi1).

In colorectal cancer, ABI1 expression is associated with KRAS mutations and adenomatous changes. It is overexpressed in colorectal carcinomas and their metastases, particularly in KRAS-mutated carcinomas, suggesting a role in actin dynamics regulation and the inflammatory response (Steinestel2012Expression).

## Interactions
ABI1 (Abl interactor 1) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with ProSAP2/Shank3 through its C-terminal SH3 domain, binding to a proline-rich consensus motif in ProSAP2/Shank3. This interaction is confirmed by yeast two-hybrid screens, cotransfection experiments, and GST pull-down assays. ABI1 also interacts with ProSAP1/Shank2 but not with Shank1 (Proepper2007Abelson). 

ABI1 is part of a trimeric complex with Eps8 and Sos-1, which is essential for actin assembly. It also plays a role in the formation and activation of the WAVE2 signaling complex, enhancing actin nucleation via the Arp2/3 complex (Proepper2007Abelson). In the nucleus, ABI1 interacts with the Myc/Max transcription factor complex, enhancing E-box-regulated gene transcription (Proepper2007Abelson).

ABI1's interactions extend to plant systems, where it binds to phosphatidic acid (PA) derived from phospholipase Dα1 (PLDα1), influencing abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. This interaction is crucial for anchoring ABI1 to the plasma membrane, thereby modulating its activity (Zhang2004Phospholipase). ABI1 also interacts with the SRK2E/OST1 kinase, integrating ABA and osmotic stress signals in Arabidopsis (Yoshida2006The).
