# REEP6

## Overview
REEP6, or Receptor Expression Enhancing Protein 6, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the shaping of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and intracellular trafficking. The protein, known as receptor accessory protein 6, is characterized by its dual hairpin structure and a carboxy terminal amphipathic helical domain, which are essential for its role in ER tubule formation and membrane curvature. REEP6 is particularly significant in the retina, where it facilitates the proper sorting and localization of guanylate cyclase proteins, crucial for the phototransduction pathway. Mutations in the REEP6 gene are linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease, underscoring its importance in maintaining retinal homeostasis and photoreceptor cell function (Veleri2017REEP6; Agrawal2017REEP6).

## Structure
REEP6 is a member of the REEP family of proteins, which are involved in shaping the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and facilitating intracellular trafficking. The protein is characterized by its dual hairpin structure, formed by two Reticulon Homology Domains (RHDs) that insert into the ER membrane, inducing high curvature and tubulization (Angelotti2022Exploring). These hairpin structures are part of the protein's secondary structure and are crucial for its function as a membrane-shaping adapter protein (Björk2013REEPs).

REEP6 also features a carboxy terminal amphipathic helical domain (APH), which aligns parallel to the membrane rather than spanning it, contributing to its role in ER tubule formation (Angelotti2022Exploring). The protein lacks a microtubule-binding domain, distinguishing it from other REEP family members like REEP1-4 (Angelotti2022Exploring).

The REEP6 gene produces two isoforms through alternative splicing: REEP6.1 and REEP6.2. REEP6.1 includes an additional exon, resulting in 27 extra amino acids that form a coil and loop structure, which is specific to rod photoreceptors in the retina (Hao2014Regulation). This structural variation is significant for its function in photoreceptor cells.

## Function
REEP6 is a transmembrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a crucial role in the retina by facilitating the proper sorting and localization of guanylate cyclase (GC) proteins from the ER to the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) (Agrawal2017REEP6). It is involved in maintaining ER homeostasis and protein trafficking, particularly for GC1 and GC2, which are essential for the phototransduction pathway. This pathway begins with photon absorption by rhodopsin, leading to a cascade that affects cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels and the opening of cGMP-gated ion channels. REEP6 ensures the proper trafficking of GC proteins, which synthesize cGMP, thereby resetting the sensitivity of rod photoreceptors by restoring cGMP levels in the dark (Agrawal2017REEP6).

In addition to its role in photoreceptor function, REEP6 is involved in the trafficking of a subset of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are crucial for the proper functioning and survival of rod photoreceptors (Veleri2017REEP6). It is also implicated in modulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) trafficking by affecting ER cargo capacity, which influences the expression and transport of intracellular proteins and receptors (Tseng2023The; Björk2013REEPs).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the REEP6 gene are associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative eye disease characterized by progressive vision loss. This condition results from the disruption of photoreceptor cell function due to alterations in REEP6, which is crucial for intracellular trafficking and maintaining retinal homeostasis (Veleri2017REEP6; Agrawal2017REEP6). Specific mutations, such as the E75K missense variant, have been identified in patients with RP, leading to symptoms like night vision disturbances and progressive vision loss (Veleri2017REEP6). Other mutations, including frameshift and splicing variants, have also been linked to RP, particularly in Chinese populations (Zhang2021Autosomal).

The absence or dysfunction of REEP6 disrupts endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and protein trafficking, particularly affecting the stability and trafficking of phototransduction proteins like guanylate cyclases GC1 and GC2. This disruption leads to increased ER stress and activation of apoptotic pathways, contributing to photoreceptor cell death (Agrawal2017REEP6). Studies using animal models have demonstrated that REEP6 mutations result in early-onset retinal degeneration, highlighting the gene's critical role in retinal health (Zaneveld2019Gene). Gene therapy has shown potential in rescuing retinal degeneration caused by REEP6 mutations, offering a promising therapeutic approach (Zaneveld2019Gene).

## Interactions
REEP6 is known to interact with various proteins, particularly in the context of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) trafficking. It is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein that modulates the trafficking and processing of GPCRs by enhancing ER cargo capacity. REEP6 interacts specifically with α2C adrenergic receptors (ARs), but not with α2A ARs, suggesting a selective role in intracellular transport and processing (Björk2013REEPs). 

In the context of cancer, REEP6 has been shown to interact with CXCR1, a chemokine receptor, enhancing CXCR1-mediated signaling in response to IL-8 stimulation. This interaction is specific to CXCR1 and does not occur with CXCR2, indicating receptor type-specificity (Park2016The). The interaction with CXCR1 involves the N-terminal region of the receptor, which is necessary for binding with REEP6 (Park2016The).

REEP6 also interacts with proteins involved in cancer progression, such as CD166, ABCG2, and ALDH1A1, which are linked to poor disease-free survival in oral cancer patients (Tseng2023The). These interactions suggest a role for REEP6 in modulating cellular responses and contributing to cancer cell proliferation and migration.
