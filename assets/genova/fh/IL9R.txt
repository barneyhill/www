# IL9R

## Overview
The IL9R gene encodes the interleukin 9 receptor, a type I transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the effects of interleukin 9 (IL-9). This receptor is part of the cytokine receptor family and is characterized by its involvement in the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway, which is crucial for various immune responses, including T-cell proliferation and survival (SoussiGounni2001Role). The IL9R protein features a fibronectin type III (FN3) domain and is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that can influence its function (KERMOUNI1995The; Singh2020De). The receptor's interactions with other proteins, such as the 14-3-3ζ protein, and its ability to form heterodimers with other receptor subunits, underscore its complex role in immune signaling (SLIVA20001433ζ; Singh2020De). Alterations in the IL9R gene have been linked to various immune-related disorders, including asthma, autoimmune diseases, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (BURKHARDT2009Association; VieyraGarcia2016STAT35Dependent; Son2024Locus).

## Structure
The IL9R protein is a type I transmembrane protein encoded by the IL9R gene, featuring distinct structural domains. The gene comprises 9 exons, with exon 1 corresponding to the 5' untranslated region, exon 2 encoding the signal peptide, exons 3 to 6 forming the extracellular domain, exon 7 as the transmembrane domain, and exons 8 and 9 constituting the cytoplasmic domain (KERMOUNI1995The). The IL9R protein is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in various mRNA isoforms, such as A, AB, AC1, AC2, and ABC, which can alter the protein's functionality (KERMOUNI1995The).

Structurally, the IL9R protein includes a fibronectin type III (FN3) domain, which is part of the extracellular region and is involved in cytokine release from mast cells and T cells (Singh2020De). The protein's secondary structure is characterized by N-lobes starting from ARG 52, consisting of seventeen β-strands arranged in an antiparallel β-sheet with three α-helices, and C-lobes at PRO 257-GLN 258 (Singh2020De). The IL9R protein also contains a conserved site of the short hematopoietin receptor family (Singh2020De).

Post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, which is crucial for interactions with proteins such as 14-3-3ζ, specifically at the C-terminal domain of hIL-9Rα (SLIVA20001433ζ). The IL9R protein can form heterodimers with other receptor subunits, contributing to its quaternary structure (Singh2020De).

## Function
The IL9R gene encodes the interleukin 9 receptor, which is a component of the cytokine receptor family involved in immune response regulation. The IL-9 receptor is composed of a ligand-specific α subunit (IL-9Rα) and a common γ chain, which is shared with other cytokine receptors such as those for IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7 (SLIVA20001433ζ; SoussiGounni2001Role). This receptor is primarily active on the cell surface and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including T-cell proliferation, mast cell proliferation, and the modulation of immune responses (SoussiGounni2001Role).

IL-9R is involved in signal transduction through the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, which is essential for IL-9-mediated responses such as T-cell survival and inhibition of apoptosis (SoussiGounni2001Role). The receptor's signaling is also implicated in the activation of STAT proteins, including STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5, which are necessary for T-cell development and function (SoussiGounni2001Role). Additionally, IL-9R signaling is crucial for the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid and myeloid precursors, as well as the production of immunoglobulins by B-cells (SLIVA20001433ζ).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the IL9R gene are associated with various immune-related disorders. In allergic diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, increased expression of IL-9 and its receptor IL9R has been observed. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL9R gene, such as rs3093467, are linked to non-allergic dermatitis, suggesting a role in skin conditions (Son2024Locus). In asthma, SNPs in IL9R are associated with allergen sensitization outcomes, particularly in males, although clinical trials targeting IL-9 have not yet shown significant improvements in asthma management (Koch2016Th9).

IL9R is also implicated in autoimmune diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, the SNP rs3093457 in the IL9R gene is significantly associated with the disease, especially in male patients and those with anti-CCP-positive status (BURKHARDT2009Association). IL9R expression influences the severity of autoimmune conditions by affecting T cell subsets and cytokine production, as seen in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models (Li2009IL9:).

In cancer, particularly mycosis fungoides, IL9R is overexpressed in neoplastic cells, contributing to tumor growth and survival. Targeting IL9R and its signaling pathways has shown potential in reducing tumor proliferation (VieyraGarcia2016STAT35Dependent).

## Interactions
The interleukin 9 receptor (IL9R) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in immune signaling. One significant interaction is with the 14-3-3ζ protein, which binds to the α-chain of the human IL9R (hIL-9Rα). This interaction is dependent on serine or threonine phosphorylation, specifically at Ser 519 or Thr 521, and involves a specific motif in the C-terminal domain of hIL-9Rα. The binding is enhanced by phosphorylation through the JAK1 kinase and is specific to hIL-9Rα, as it does not occur with the mouse IL-4Rα (SLIVA20001433ζ).

IL9R also forms part of a receptor complex with the common gamma chain (γc), shared with other cytokine receptors like IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7. This complex is essential for activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which plays a role in T cell proliferation and immune response regulation (Singh2020De). These interactions highlight the role of IL9R in mediating specific cytokine signaling pathways and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in immune-related conditions.
