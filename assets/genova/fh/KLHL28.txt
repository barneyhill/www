# KLHL28

## Overview
KLHL28 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 28, which is part of the kelch-like (KLHL) gene family. This protein is categorized as a component potentially involved in the ubiquitination process, a critical cellular mechanism for protein degradation and regulation. The structural similarity of KLHL28 to other known components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, such as KLHL20, suggests its role in these processes (Zhang2024StarFunc:). Additionally, KLHL28 has been identified as a potential binding partner for the Nac1 POZ domain, implicating it in various cellular processes, including cell growth and division, with potential relevance to tumorigenesis (Wu2018Targeting). The gene's expression and function have been linked to cancer cell proliferation, highlighting its clinical significance and the need for further research to fully understand its role in oncogenesis and other diseases (Xiang2021Targeting).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL28 has been implicated in cancer, with studies suggesting its role in promoting cancer cell proliferation. Research indicates that high expression levels of KLHL28 correlate with increased proliferation in various cancer cell lines, suggesting that it may be essential for cancer cell growth and progression (Xiang2021Targeting). The study utilized a screening model to analyze mRNA expression and found that silencing KLHL28 led to significant inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, supporting its potential role in cancer progression (Xiang2021Targeting).

In the context of evolutionary biology, KLHL28 is part of the kelch-like (KLHL) gene family, which has undergone significant diversification and expansion in certain species, such as the polyploid Carassius complex. Although the study primarily focuses on the evolutionary trajectory of KLHL genes, it notes that KLHL28 exhibits expression bias shifts during developmental stages, which may have implications for its function and regulation in disease contexts (Peng2023Genomic).

While the specific diseases or conditions directly resulting from KLHL28 mutations or dysregulation are not detailed, its involvement in cancer cell proliferation highlights its potential clinical significance and warrants further investigation into its role in oncogenesis.

## Interactions
KLHL28 is predicted to be involved in protein ubiquitination, a process crucial for protein degradation and regulation within the cell. This prediction is supported by its structural similarity to KLHL20, a known component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, suggesting that KLHL28 may play a role in ubiquitination processes (Zhang2024StarFunc:). 

KLHL28 is also identified as a potential binding partner for the Nac1 POZ domain, which is involved in various cellular processes such as cell growth and division. The interaction between KLHL28 and Nac1 is characterized by broad specificity, allowing for transient and reversible complex formations. This interaction is significant in the context of tumorigenesis and other diseases, highlighting the potential role of KLHL28 in these processes (Wu2018Targeting).

Despite these predictions and potential interactions, specific protein interactions involving KLHL28 are not detailed in the available literature. The role of KLHL28 in ubiquitination and its interaction with Nac1 suggest its involvement in important cellular pathways, but further research is needed to elucidate its precise functions and interactions.
