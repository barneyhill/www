# TNPO3

## Overview
TNPO3 is a gene that encodes the protein transportin 3, a member of the karyopherin β family, which is primarily involved in the nuclear import of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. These proteins are crucial for mRNA splicing, and transportin 3 facilitates their entry into the nucleus in a Ran-GTP dependent manner. Structurally, transportin 3 is characterized by a series of HEAT repeats that form a solenoid-like structure, allowing it to interact with various cargo proteins. This protein plays a significant role in cellular processes such as alternative splicing, transcription, and mRNA transport. Additionally, transportin 3 is implicated in the nuclear import of viral pre-integration complexes, notably those of HIV-1, highlighting its importance in both cellular and viral contexts (Costa2020Transportin; Krishnan2010The). Mutations in the TNPO3 gene have been linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, underscoring its clinical significance (Melià2013Limbgirdle).

## Structure
TNPO3, or transportin 3, is a protein characterized by a high α-helical content, forming a solenoid-like structure composed of HEAT repeats. These repeats contribute to its tertiary structure, facilitating interactions with various cargo proteins (Costa2020Transportin; Larue2012Interaction). TNPO3 shares structural similarities with Importin-13, with a sequence identity of 25% and a similarity of 44%, and is modeled to have a closed ring configuration where the N- and C-terminal segments form an interface (Larue2012Interaction). 

The protein exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium in solution, with a dissociation constant for dimerization of 8.3 M. The dimeric structure is described as a bilobal prolate 'saddle-shaped' ellipsoid (Larue2012Interaction). The N-terminal portion of TNPO3 is conserved and likely binds the common regulator RanGTP, while the C-terminal domain is involved in intra-protein contacts and interactions with other proteins, such as the HIV-1 integrase (Larue2012Interaction).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence TNPO3's function and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context. The protein's role in nuclear import is crucial, particularly in the transport of serine/arginine-rich proteins (Costa2020Transportin).

## Function
Transportin 3 (TNPO3) is a karyopherin β family protein that plays a crucial role in the nuclear import of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which are essential for mRNA splicing. TNPO3 operates in a Ran-GTP dependent manner, interacting with the phosphorylated RS domain of these proteins to facilitate their import into the nucleus (Ali2015Knockdown). This process is vital for the regulation of alternative splicing, transcription, mRNA transport, translation, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Costa2021Morphological).

TNPO3 is composed of 20 consecutive HEAT repeats, which provide it with high plasticity and the ability to bind different proteins. This structure gives TNPO3 a toroidal shape, with the N-terminal binding RanGTP and the C-terminal carrying the cargo (Costa2021Morphological). In healthy cells, TNPO3 is involved in maintaining organized myofibrillar networks and proper protein localization, which is crucial for muscle differentiation (Costa2020Transportin).

TNPO3 is also implicated in the nuclear import of viral pre-integration complexes, such as those of HIV-1, by interacting with the viral capsid (Krishnan2010The). This highlights its broader role in cellular mRNA processing and nuclear transport, which is essential for various cellular functions and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TNPO3 gene are associated with several forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), including LGMD type 1F (LGMD1F) and type D2 (LGMD D2). LGMD1F is caused by a microdeletion in the TNPO3 gene, leading to a 15-amino acid extension of the C-terminus of the transportin-3 protein. This mutation results in muscle weakness primarily affecting the pelvic and shoulder girdles, with variability in age of onset and disease severity. Histological analysis of muscle biopsies from affected individuals shows abnormalities such as increased variability in fiber size, increased connective tissue, and nuclear abnormalities (Melià2013Limbgirdle).

LGMD D2 is linked to mutations that result in a longer protein in the C-terminal domain, similar to the mutation found in LGMD1F. This condition presents with progressive muscle weakness and variability in clinical symptoms. Muscle biopsies reveal fiber size variability, atrophy, and protein aggregates. The mutations in TNPO3 may disrupt the myofibrillar network and nuclear transport of proteins, contributing to the disease pathogenesis (Costa2020Transportin; Rodríguez2023Limb–Girdle).

Additionally, TNPO3 mutations have been implicated in congenital limb-girdle myopathy with slow progression, characterized by proximal muscle weakness and severe degenerative changes in muscle tissue (Vihola2019Novel).

## Interactions
Transportin 3 (TNPO3) is a nuclear import receptor that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in their nuclear transport. TNPO3 is known to interact with serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which are essential for mRNA splicing. This interaction is significant for the nuclear import of these splicing factors, as demonstrated in the context of myogenesis, where TNPO3 transports the splicing factor SRSF1 into the nucleus, affecting muscle differentiation and maintenance (Costa2021Morphological).

TNPO3 also interacts with the RNA-binding protein RBM20, which is involved in cardiac function. The interaction between TNPO3 and RBM20 is critical for the nuclear localization of RBM20, and mutations in RBM20 that disrupt this interaction can lead to its mislocalization, contributing to dilated cardiomyopathy (Kornienko2023Mislocalization).

In the context of viral replication, TNPO3 interacts with the HIV-1 capsid protein, playing a role in the nuclear import of the HIV-1 pre-integration complex. This interaction is crucial for HIV-1 infectivity, as TNPO3 facilitates a nuclear maturation step required for efficient viral integration (Krishnan2010The). TNPO3's interaction with CPSF6, another SR protein, is also significant in the context of HIV-1 replication, as it prevents the cytoplasmic accumulation of CPSF6, which can inhibit HIV-1 by stabilizing the capsid core (De2013TNPO3).
