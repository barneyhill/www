# POLR3D

## Overview
POLR3D is a gene that encodes the RNA polymerase III subunit D, a crucial component of the RNA polymerase III complex in eukaryotic cells. This protein is integral to the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which are essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Canella2010Defining). As a part of the RNA polymerase III complex, POLR3D plays a significant role in the assembly and function of the polymerase, interacting with other subunits and transcription factors to regulate transcriptional activity (Canella2012A). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, a neurological disorder linked to specific mutations in POLR3D that disrupt normal RNA polymerase III function (Macintosh2023Biallelic).

## Function
POLR3D encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase III (Pol III), which is crucial for the transcription of small non-coding RNAs, including tRNAs and 5S rRNA, in eukaryotic cells. This transcription process is essential for protein synthesis and cellular growth. In healthy human cells, POLR3D is a component of the Pol III transcription machinery, and its presence is indicative of active transcription units. POLR3D peaks are often used as markers to identify active Pol III genes, as they correlate with higher transcription efficiency and are associated with other transcription factors like BDP1 and BRF1 (Canella2010Defining).

POLR3D is involved in the transcription of various RNA genes, including tRNA, 5S rRNA, and other small RNAs, contributing to the overall Pol III transcriptome in human cells (Canella2010Defining). It plays a role in the spatial organization of transcription factors, often found downstream of BDP1 and BRF1 peaks, which suggests its involvement in the regulation of transcriptional activity (Canella2010Defining). POLR3D is active in the nucleoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Canella2010Defining).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLR3D gene are associated with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy, a rare neurological disorder characterized by delayed myelination of the central nervous system. This condition manifests with symptoms such as developmental delays, cerebellar atrophy, and various non-neurological features, including hypodontia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Macintosh2023Biallelic). Genetic analysis has identified specific biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3D, including a missense variant (c.541C > T, p.P181S) and an intronic splice site variant (c.656-6G > A), which are believed to disrupt normal RNA polymerase III function by affecting the assembly and interaction of its subunits (Macintosh2023Biallelic).

These mutations lead to altered expression of Pol III subunits and targets, resulting in decreased RNA-level expression of POLR3D and other Pol III subunit genes. This disruption particularly affects the transcription of 7SK RNA and several tRNA genes, contributing to the pathogenesis of the disease (Macintosh2023Biallelic). The missense variant also impacts the interaction of Pol III with the PAQosome chaperone complex, suggesting a disruption in complex maturation and function (Macintosh2023Biallelic). These findings highlight the critical role of POLR3D in maintaining normal cellular processes and its involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders when mutated.

## Interactions
POLR3D, a subunit of RNA polymerase III, is involved in several interactions within the polymerase complex and with other proteins. It is part of the RNA polymerase III complex, which is responsible for transcribing small non-coding RNAs, such as tRNA and 5S rRNA. The POLR3D subunit interacts with other subunits within the polymerase III complex, contributing to its assembly and function (Canella2012A).

A specific missense variant of POLR3D, p.P181S, has been shown to affect its interaction with the PAQosome chaperone complex. This interaction is crucial for the maturation of the polymerase complex, suggesting that the variant may alter the normal function of POLR3D by prolonging its interaction with the chaperone complex (Macintosh2023Biallelic).

In addition to its role in the polymerase complex, POLR3D occupancy has been studied in various genomic loci, indicating its involvement in the transcription of specific genes. The occupancy of POLR3D, along with other subunits like POLR3A, has been observed at loci encoding tRNA and other small RNAs, highlighting its role in RNA transcription (Canella2012A).
