# ERLIN1

## Overview
ERLIN1 is a gene that encodes the ER lipid raft associated 1 protein, which is a type II endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein. This protein is a member of the SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C) domain family, characterized by its involvement in organizing membrane microdomains. ER lipid raft associated 1 plays a crucial role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, particularly in the degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), which are essential for calcium signaling. The protein forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with ERLIN2, contributing to cholesterol homeostasis by interacting with the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-Scap-Insig complex, thereby regulating cholesterol synthesis and transport. Additionally, ERLIN1 is implicated in immune signaling and cellular stress responses, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Huang2021Transcriptome; Veronese2024ERLIN12; WhittenBauer2019The).

## Structure
ERLIN1 is a type II endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that is part of the SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C) domain family. It contains a cytosolic tail, a transmembrane domain, an SPFH domain, and a coiled-coil domain (Veronese2024ERLIN12). The SPFH domain is a conserved feature among its family members and is involved in organizing membrane microdomains (WhittenBauer2019The). ERLIN1 forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with ERLIN2, likely consisting of 24 subunits, and these complexes are associated with cholesterol-rich domains in the ER membrane (Veronese2024ERLIN12). The ERLIN complex is described as forming cup-shaped oligomers that project into the ER lumen, with each subunit capable of binding up to four cholesterol molecules (Veronese2024ERLIN12).

ERLIN1 is involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) by interacting with E3 ubiquitin ligases like RNF170 (Veronese2024ERLIN12). It is also implicated in cholesterol homeostasis, as it limits cholesterol esterification and facilitates cholesterol transport to the Golgi apparatus (Veronese2024ERLIN12). The protein's interaction with other proteins, such as TMUB1 and RNF170, is mediated by specific amino acids involved in hydrogen bonding (Veronese2024ERLIN12).

## Function
ERLIN1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is part of the ERLIN1/2 complex, which is involved in the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, specifically mediating the degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) crucial for calcium signaling (Huang2021Transcriptome). ERLIN1 is localized in lipid-raft-like domains of the ER, where it interacts with the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-Scap-Insig complex, restricting SREBP activation and regulating cholesterol synthesis (WhittenBauer2019The).

The ERLIN1/2 complex also plays a role in limiting cholesterol esterification, promoting cholesterol transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, and regulating the secretory pathway (Veronese2024ERLIN12). ERLIN1 is involved in stabilizing the INSIG1-SCAP interaction, suppressing SREBP trafficking to the Golgi, and thus controlling cholesterol biosynthesis (Veronese2024ERLIN12). Additionally, ERLIN1 is implicated in the regulation of immune signaling and is upregulated in response to non-septic stress conditions, indicating its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Huang2021Transcriptome).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ERLIN1 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions, particularly those related to metabolic and cardiovascular health. A novel copy number variation (CNV) involving the ERLIN1 gene, located at chromosomal region 10q24.31, has been associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, plasma levels of alanine-aminotransferase, hemorrhagic stroke, type 2 diabetes-associated nephropathy, body mass index, and obesity (Nazarenko2017Genomic). This CNV was not listed in the Database of Genomic Variants, indicating its novelty (Nazarenko2017Genomic).

The ERLIN1 gene is also involved in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis through its role in the SREBP machinery and ER-associated degradation of proteins like the IP3 receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), a target of statins (Nazarenko2017Genomic). Alterations in ERLIN1 expression have been linked to coronary artery disease and metabolic comorbidities, with increased gene copy numbers observed in some patients (Nazarenko2017Genomic).

In the context of carotid atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes, a gain of the ERLIN1 gene was identified in 2-3% of patients, suggesting a potential association with these conditions (Sleptcov2019Assessment). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ERLIN1 in various metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.

## Interactions
ERLIN1, a protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), forms a complex with ERLIN2, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. This complex acts as a scaffold, mediating interactions between TMUB1 and RNF170, which are crucial for regulating cholesterol esterification and the secretory pathway (Veronese2024ERLIN12). ERLIN1 and ERLIN2 are part of the SPFH family of proteins and are involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) by interacting with E3 ubiquitin ligases such as RNF170, RNF185, and RNF5 (Veronese2024ERLIN12).

ERLIN1 also interacts with the rhomboid protease RHBDL4, forming a complex involved in the retrotranslocation and degradation of aggregation-prone proteins (Bock2019Rhomboid). This interaction suggests that ERLIN1, along with ERLIN2, may serve as substrate adaptors for RHBDL4, facilitating the degradation of specific substrates (Bock2019Rhomboid).

Additionally, ERLIN1 interacts with the B12 transmembrane J-protein, playing a role in the transport of the SV40 virus from the ER to the cytosol, which is essential for successful infection (Inoue2017Regulated). This interaction is critical for anchoring B12 in the ER and facilitating its release during viral infection (Inoue2017Regulated).
