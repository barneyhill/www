# TBCEL

## Overview
The TBCEL gene encodes the tubulin folding cofactor E-like protein, which is a critical component in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. This protein functions primarily as a microtubule destabilizer, influencing the folding and degradation of tubulin subunits, particularly α-tubulin, to maintain cellular microtubule homeostasis (Frédéric2013Identification). TBCEL is predominantly expressed in the testes, indicating a specialized role in spermatogenesis, where it balances microtubule stabilization and destabilization (Fabrizio2020Tubulinbinding). The protein operates in the cytoplasm, interacting with tubulin subunits to ensure proper cytoskeletal integrity, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell division and intracellular transport (Fabrizio2020Tubulinbinding). TBCEL's activity complements that of its paralog, TBCE, to coordinate microtubule dynamics necessary for neural network remodeling and spermatid individualization (Fabrizio2020Tubulinbinding).

## Function
The TBCEL gene encodes the tubulin folding cofactor E-like protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics by influencing tubulin folding and degradation. TBCEL is involved in depolymerizing microtubules by promoting the degradation of α-tubulin, which is essential for maintaining microtubule homeostasis and turnover (Frédéric2013Identification). This activity is part of a cellular tubulin quality control machinery, ensuring the proper balance between microtubule stabilization and destabilization, which is vital for various cellular processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and structural support (Frédéric2013Identification).

In humans, TBCEL is preferentially expressed in the testes, suggesting a role in spermatogenesis by balancing microtubule stabilization and destabilization (Fabrizio2020Tubulinbinding). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with tubulin subunits to regulate microtubule dynamics, which is crucial for maintaining cytoskeletal integrity (Fabrizio2020Tubulinbinding). TBCEL's function as a microtubule destabilizer complements the stabilizing activities of its paralog, TBCE, to coordinate microtubule dynamics necessary for processes like neural network remodeling and spermatid individualization (Fabrizio2020Tubulinbinding).

## Clinical Significance
The TBCEL gene, located in the 11q23.3 region, has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It is identified within ASD-associated copy number variation (CNV) regions, suggesting a potential role in the genetic contributions to neurodevelopmental phenotypes (Trost2022Genomic). However, specific details on the clinical significance of TBCEL gene mutations or their direct association with diseases are not provided in the available literature.

In the context of hematological disorders, TBCEL is mentioned among the genes associated with β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia (SCA). These conditions involve genes that influence hematopoiesis and erythrocyte hemostasis, although the specific role of TBCEL in these diseases is not detailed (Suwito2023A).

Overall, while TBCEL is associated with certain genetic regions linked to neurodevelopmental and hematological disorders, the precise clinical implications of its mutations or altered expression remain unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate its role in these conditions and its potential impact on disease phenotypes.

## Interactions
The TBCEL protein, encoded by the TBCEL gene, is involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics through its interactions with tubulin. TBCEL is known to depolymerize microtubules by targeting α-tubulin for proteasomal degradation, thereby influencing microtubule stability and assembly (Frédéric2013Identification). In C. elegans, TBCEL, encoded by the coel-1 gene, interacts with components of the tubulin acetylation/deacetylation pathway, such as hdac-6, mec-17, and atat-2. These interactions suggest that TBCEL's function is antagonistic to tubulin acetylation, affecting microtubule stability and function (Frédéric2013Identification).

TBCEL also interacts with MEC-12, a form of α-tubulin, where the elimination of MEC-12 acetylation can suppress the effects of coel-1 disruption, indicating a regulatory role in microtubule dynamics (Frédéric2013Identification). In Drosophila, TBCEL is crucial for the regulation of inter-flagellar microtubule dynamics during spermatid individualization, where it disrupts tubulin heterodimers to prevent their polymerization, facilitating microtubule disassembly (Fabrizio2020Tubulinbinding). These interactions highlight TBCEL's role in maintaining microtubule homeostasis and its potential involvement in broader cellular processes related to the nervous system and spermatogenesis.
