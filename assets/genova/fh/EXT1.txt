# EXT1

## Overview
The EXT1 gene encodes the protein exostosin glycosyltransferase 1, a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). This protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is essential for the polymerization of heparan sulfate chains, which are critical for various cellular functions, including cell signaling, adhesion, and ligand-binding (McCormick1998The). Exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 functions as a glycosyltransferase, catalyzing the addition of alternating D-glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues, and forms a functional complex with its homolog, EXT2, to enhance its enzymatic activity (Sandell2009Multiple; Duncan2001The). Mutations in the EXT1 gene are linked to hereditary multiple exostoses, a disorder characterized by the formation of multiple benign bone tumors, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Wuyts1998Mutations; Francannet2001Genotypephenotype).

## Structure
The EXT1 protein is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (McCormick1998The). It features a type II membrane topology, characterized by a cytoplasmic amino terminus and a lumenal carboxy terminus (McCormick1998The). The protein is composed of 746 amino acids and includes two critical domains: the exostosin domain (amino acids 110-396) and the glycosyltransferase domain (amino acids 480-729), which is essential for heparan sulfate biosynthesis (CAO2013Novel).

The EXT1 protein undergoes glycosylation, as indicated by the presence of high-mannose N-linked oligosaccharides, which are processed by endoglycosidase H treatment (McCormick1998The). This post-translational modification is crucial for its function and stability. Mutations in EXT1, such as the c.1902C>A (p.Tyr634X) nonsense mutation, can lead to a truncated protein lacking part of the glycosyltransferase domain, significantly impacting its function (CAO2013Novel). The EXT1 protein forms a stable enzyme complex with EXT2, enhancing glycosyltransferase activity, which is vital for effective heparan sulfate chain synthesis (Sandell2009Multiple).

## Function
The EXT1 gene encodes the protein exostosin-1, which is a crucial component in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS), a glycosaminoglycan involved in various cellular functions. Exostosin-1 functions as a glycosyltransferase, catalyzing the polymerization of HS chains by adding alternating D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. This process occurs in the Golgi apparatus, where EXT1 forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with its homologue EXT2, significantly enhancing its glycosyltransferase activity (Sandell2009Multiple; Duncan2001The).

In healthy human cells, EXT1 is essential for the proper synthesis of HS chains, which are critical for cell signaling, adhesion, and ligand-binding. HS chains are found on proteoglycans such as versican, perlecan, and syndecans, which are involved in signaling pathways for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) (Sandell2009Multiple). The EXT1 protein also plays a role in maintaining the architecture and dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), influencing cellular metabolism and glycosylation processes (Kerselidou2020Exostosin1). The proper function of EXT1 is vital for normal skeletal development and cellular homeostasis (Duncan2001The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EXT1 gene are primarily associated with hereditary multiple exostoses (HME), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign bone tumors known as exostoses. These tumors can lead to complications such as bone deformities, restricted joint motion, and in some cases, malignant transformation into chondrosarcoma, a type of bone cancer (Wuyts1998Mutations; Francannet2001Genotypephenotype). The EXT1 gene mutations often result in loss of function, leading to truncated protein products that disrupt normal cellular processes (Wuyts1998Mutations; Santos2018Analysis).

The severity of HME is often linked to mutations in the EXT1 gene, with these mutations associated with more severe phenotypes, including a higher number of exostoses and increased risk of malignant degeneration (Liang2020Identification; Francannet2001Genotypephenotype). Specific missense mutations in EXT1, such as p.Leu264Arg and p.Gly268Glu, have been predicted to be pathogenic and are associated with the disease (Santos2018Analysis). The EXT1 gene's role in heparan sulfate biosynthesis is crucial, and its disruption can affect cellular signaling pathways, contributing to the development of skeletal abnormalities and tumorigenesis (Liang2020Identification).

## Interactions
EXT1 (exostosin glycosyltransferase 1) is known to form a stable complex with EXT2, another glycosyltransferase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate. This complex is localized in the Golgi apparatus and exhibits enhanced glycosyltransferase activity, specifically catalyzing the GlcA-T and GlcNAc-T reactions necessary for heparan sulfate polymerization (Senay2000The; McCormick2000The). The interaction between EXT1 and EXT2 is essential for their function, as neither protein can substitute for the other, and their coexpression leads to increased enzymatic activity (Senay2000The).

EXT1 also interacts with proteins involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), such as NOTCH1 and FBXW7. It acts as a common interactor with these proteins, influencing the NOTCH signaling pathway. EXT1 enhances the interaction between NOTCH1 and FBXW7, leading to the proteasomal degradation of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) in an FBXW7-dependent manner (Daakour2016Systematic). This interaction suggests a regulatory role for EXT1 in modulating NOTCH1 transcriptional activity, impacting the expression of NOTCH1 target genes like HES1 and MYC (Daakour2016Systematic). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of EXT1 in cellular processes beyond heparan sulfate biosynthesis.
