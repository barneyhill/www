# GAR1

## Overview
GAR1 is a gene that encodes the GAR1 ribonucleoprotein, a critical component of the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. These complexes are essential for various cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, pre-messenger RNA splicing, and telomere maintenance. The GAR1 protein is characterized by its glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and are subject to post-translational modifications such as arginine methylation. These modifications are crucial for its function within the H/ACA RNP complexes, where GAR1 interacts with other core proteins like dyskerin, NOP10, and NHP2. The protein's role extends to the assembly and stabilization of the telomerase complex, contributing to telomere maintenance and cellular longevity. Dysregulation of the GAR1 gene has been linked to diseases such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and systemic lupus erythematosus, highlighting its importance in genomic stability and immune response (Darzacq2006Stepwise; Dos2017Dysregulation; Wu2021The).

## Structure
GAR1 is a small ribonucleoprotein characterized by two glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) domains, also known as RGG/RG motifs, which are preferred sites for arginine methylation (Schlotter2023Proteomic). These domains are crucial for its function and are involved in protein-protein interactions within the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. The central domain of GAR1 is highly conserved across species and is essential for its viability, although it does not show significant homology to known protein-functional motifs (WATKINS1998Cbf5p).

In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, GAR1 adopts a six-stranded beta-barrel motif, which is similar to RNA-binding domains found in bacterial translation initiation and elongation factors (Reichow2007The). This structure facilitates its role in modulating RNA recognition rather than direct RNA binding. GAR1 interacts with the catalytic domain of Cbf5, enhancing its activity and facilitating product release (Czekay2021HACA).

Post-translational modifications of GAR1 include arginine methylation, with both mono-methylated and dimethylated forms present. This methylation status affects its association with other proteins, such as NHP2, within the H/ACA RNP complexes (Schlotter2023Proteomic). The methylation is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and PRMT5 (Schlotter2023Proteomic).

## Function
GAR1 is a ribonucleoprotein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, which are essential for ribosome biogenesis, pre-messenger RNA splicing, and telomere maintenance in human cells (Darzacq2006Stepwise). GAR1 is one of the four core proteins in the H/ACA RNP complex, along with dyskerin (DKC1), NOP10, and NHP2, and it is involved in the pseudouridylation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a modification process critical for ribosome function (Dos2017Dysregulation; Saez2019The).

In the maturation of H/ACA RNPs, GAR1 replaces NAF1, marking the transition to a mature complex that localizes to the nucleolus or Cajal bodies, where it performs its functions (Garus2021Dyskerin:). GAR1's interaction with dyskerin is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, which affects its subnuclear localization (Garus2021Dyskerin:). GAR1 is also involved in the assembly and stabilization of the telomerase complex, contributing to telomere maintenance, which is vital for cellular longevity and genomic stability (Dos2017Dysregulation; Garus2021Dyskerin:).

GAR1's activity is primarily localized in the nucleolus, reflecting its role in RNA processing and stability, which are essential for proper cellular function and growth (Dos2017Dysregulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the GAR1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly those related to ribosome biogenesis and telomere maintenance. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a significant decrease in the expression of GAR1 has been observed, suggesting its potential role in genomic instability and telomere dysfunction associated with the disease (Dos2017Dysregulation). The dysregulation of GAR1, along with other components of the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex, may contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL by affecting telomere-associated processes (Dos2017Dysregulation).

GAR1 is also involved in the regulation of RNA-binding properties through PARylation, a process mediated by PARP1. Alterations in PARP1 expression or activity can impact the RNA-binding ability of GAR1, potentially affecting telomerase activity and telomere maintenance, which are crucial for cell survival and proliferation. This suggests that disruptions in GAR1's interactions could be linked to cancer and aging-related conditions (Savelyev2021PARP1).

Additionally, GAR1 has been identified as a nuclear alarmin, capable of activating immune responses. Its alarmin activity, particularly in the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), highlights its role in autoimmunity, where it may contribute to inflammation and immune cell activation (Wu2021The).

## Interactions
GAR1 is a core component of the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which is essential for ribosome biogenesis, pre-messenger RNA splicing, and telomere maintenance. GAR1 interacts with other core proteins of the H/ACA RNP complex, including NAP57 (dyskerin), NHP2, and NOP10, forming a stable complex that is crucial for its function (Darzacq2006Stepwise; Dos2017Dysregulation). GAR1 competes with NAF1 for binding to NAP57, indicating that they have overlapping or identical binding sites on NAP57, which precludes simultaneous interaction. This competition suggests a sequential interaction where NAF1 initially binds to NAP57 and is later replaced by GAR1 to form mature H/ACA RNPs (Darzacq2006Stepwise).

GAR1 is also involved in interactions with the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5, which interacts with several proteins of the H/ACA RNP complex, including GAR1, in an RNA-independent manner. This interaction is important for the function of the H/ACA RNP complex in ribosomal RNA biogenesis (Saez2019The). In yeast, GAR1 (Gar1p) interacts with Rnt1p, a protein required for the nuclear import of H/ACA small nucleolar RNA-associated proteins, through specific amino acid residues (Tremblay2002A).
