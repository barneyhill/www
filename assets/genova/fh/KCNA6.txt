# KCNA6

## Overview
The KCNA6 gene encodes the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 6, a transmembrane protein that is part of the Shaker-related subfamily of voltage-gated potassium channels. These channels are integral to the regulation of potassium ion flow across cell membranes, playing a pivotal role in maintaining cellular excitability and action potential repolarization in both neural and cardiac tissues. The KCNA6 protein is characterized by its six transmembrane segments and a conserved voltage-sensor domain, which are essential for its function in neuronal excitability and cardiac electrophysiology (Synnergren2012Global; Liu2005Homology). The protein's structure, including its pore loop domain and tetrameric assembly, facilitates selective K+ ion permeation, crucial for its physiological roles (Liu2004A). KCNA6 is expressed in various tissues, including the brain and heart, where it contributes to the modulation of electrical signals and maintenance of proper function in neurons and muscle cells (Liu2004A; Wisniewska2012Novel).

## Structure
The KCNA6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the voltage-gated potassium channel family, specifically the Shaker-related subfamily. These channels are characterized by six transmembrane segments (S1-S6), with the pore region located between segments S5 and S6. The protein includes a conserved voltage-sensor domain, which is crucial for its function in neuronal excitability (Liu2005Homology).

The secondary structure of the KCNA6 protein involves alpha-helices, which are typical of voltage-gated potassium channels. The tertiary structure forms a functional channel, allowing for the selective permeation of K+ ions. The quaternary structure involves tetramerization, where four subunits come together to form the complete channel. This tetrameric assembly is essential for the channel's stability and function (Liu2005Homology).

The protein also contains a pore loop domain, which is responsible for K+ ion permeation. This domain is structurally similar to the prokaryotic KcsA channel, particularly in the pore helix and selectivity filter, despite differences in physiological properties (Liu2004A). The selectivity filter's configuration is nearly identical across these channels, suggesting a common architecture for ion permeation (Liu2004A).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in these channels, affecting their activity and regulation. The KCNA6 protein is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and smooth muscle cells (Liu2004A).

## Function
KCNA6 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that plays a crucial role in regulating the flow of potassium ions across cell membranes. This channel is part of the shaker-related subfamily and is involved in maintaining the electrical excitability of cells, particularly in cardiac and neural tissues. The KCNA6 protein contributes to the repolarization of the membrane potential following an action potential, which is essential for the proper functioning of neurons and muscle cells (Synnergren2012Global).

In neurons, KCNA6 is implicated in modulating neuronal excitability and signal transmission. It is a target of β-catenin signaling in thalamic neurons, where it helps maintain proper neuronal excitability by contributing to cell membrane conductance of potassium ions (Wisniewska2012Novel). This conductance is vital for propagating, inhibiting, or modifying electric signals in neurons, thereby influencing neuronal communication and function.

In cardiac tissues, KCNA6 is involved in the regulation of cardiac action potentials, which are critical for heart rhythm and function. The expression of KCNA6 in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and heart tissue suggests its role in cardiac electrophysiology, contributing to the heart's ability to contract and maintain a regular heartbeat (Synnergren2012Global).
