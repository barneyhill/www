# ADA2

## Overview
The ADA2 gene encodes the protein adenosine deaminase 2, a zinc-dependent hydrolase that plays a crucial role in immune regulation and inflammation. This enzyme is part of the adenosine deaminase growth factors (ADGFs) family and is primarily secreted by myeloid cells into the extracellular environment, where it modulates immune responses by deaminating adenosine to inosine. Structurally, ADA2 forms a homodimer, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and interaction with cell surface receptors, contributing to its function as a growth factor. The protein's interaction with various immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and regulatory T cells, underscores its involvement in cell signaling and immune homeostasis. Mutations in the ADA2 gene can lead to Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 (DADA2), a disorder characterized by systemic inflammation and vasculopathy, highlighting the gene's clinical significance (Reiff2019Deficiency; Kaljas2016Human; Zavialov2005Human).

## Structure
The ADA2 protein, encoded by the ADA2 gene, is a 59-kDa enzyme composed of 511 amino acids. Its primary structure includes specific amino acid sequences that are crucial for its enzymatic function (Zervou2019Role). The secondary structure of ADA2 features an 8-stranded, parallel β-sheet that forms a barrel, surrounded by α/β-TIM barrel motif helices and additional α-helices (Zervou2019Role). The tertiary structure is characterized by a deep active site cavity, which is essential for its catalytic activity as a zinc-dependent hydrolase. This active site includes a zinc ion coordinated by invariant residues (Zervou2019Role).

ADA2 forms homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that is important for its stability and function. The N-terminal extension of ADA2 forms a helix-turn-helix arrangement, with key residues involved in ionic interactions that stabilize the dimer (Zervou2019Role). The protein is secreted by antigen-presenting cells and is highly expressed in plasma (Zervou2019Role). ADA2 is also part of a novel family of growth factors with adenosine deaminase activity, known as adenosine deaminase growth factors (ADGFs) (Zavialov2005Human).

## Function
ADA2, encoded by the CECR1 gene, is an enzyme that plays a significant role in immune regulation and inflammation. It is secreted by myeloid cells and functions primarily in the extracellular environment, where it modulates immune responses by deaminating adenosine to inosine, thereby reducing extracellular adenosine levels (Kaljas2016Human). This activity is crucial for restoring the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, which are suppressed by high concentrations of adenosine (Kaljas2016Human).

ADA2 binds to various immune cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells, and B cells, and is involved in cell-cell signaling, particularly in inflammatory responses and tumor microenvironments (Kaljas2016Human). It also interacts with regulatory T cells expressing CD39, influencing their activation and function (Kaljas2016Human).

Structurally, ADA2 forms a homodimer, which is essential for its enzymatic activity and secretion. The dimerization is facilitated by specific domains that also enable interactions with cell surface receptors, potentially contributing to its growth factor activity (Zavialov2010Structural). ADA2's role in immune homeostasis and response to inflammatory signals highlights its importance in maintaining vascular integrity and preventing excessive inflammation (Kaljas2016Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADA2 gene lead to a condition known as Deficiency of Adenosine Deaminase 2 (DADA2), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by systemic inflammation, vasculopathy, and immunodeficiency. DADA2 is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including early-onset vasculopathy resembling polyarteritis nodosa, immunodeficiency, bone marrow failure, and autoimmunity (Reiff2019Deficiency; Hashem2022Allogeneic). Patients may present with symptoms such as livedo racemosa, purpura, leg ulcers, Raynaud's phenomenon, and digital necrosis, with severe cases leading to peripheral neuropathy or early-onset strokes (Reiff2019Deficiency).

The condition is caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the ADA2 gene, with more than 80 disease-associated mutations identified, including common variants like p.Gly47Arg and p.Arg169Gln (Huang2020Polyarteritis). These mutations disrupt ADA2's role in vascular development and immune regulation, leading to endothelial dysfunction and cytokine accumulation (Reiff2019Deficiency; Meyts2018Deficiency). The clinical presentation of DADA2 is highly variable, influenced by modifying alleles and epigenetic factors, and can range from mild skin disease to severe multiorgan involvement (Reiff2019Deficiency; Hashem2022Allogeneic). Treatment options include immunosuppressants and anti-TNF agents, with hematopoietic cell transplantation being the only curative approach for severe cases (Hashem2022Allogeneic).

## Interactions
Adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function and role in the immune system. ADA2 forms a dimer through coil-coil-like interactions involving helices HN2, HN3, and HN5, with a significant 'tryptophan catch' interaction involving Trp-336, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity and secretion (Zavialov2010Structural). The protein also contains a unique 'putative receptor-binding' (PRB) domain, structurally similar to chemokines, suggesting it may bind to specific receptors or induce receptor dimerization (Zavialov2010Structural).

ADA2 interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate on cell surfaces, with tighter interactions observed with more sulfated GAGs like heparin. This interaction stabilizes the ADA2 dimer and enhances its activity (Zavialov2010Structural). ADA2 also binds to myeloid cells and lymphocytes, particularly regulatory T cells expressing CD39, and may modulate the affinity of adenosine receptors (Kaljas2016Human).

In the context of histone acetylation, ADA2 interacts with the Gcn5 protein through its SANT and ZZ zinc-binding domains, forming a complex that enhances Gcn5's catalytic activity (Espinola-Lopez2021The; Sun2018Structural). This interaction is crucial for the function of the Ada2/Gcn5 complex within the SAGA histone acetyltransferase module (Espinola-Lopez2021The).
