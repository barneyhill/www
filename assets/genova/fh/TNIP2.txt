# TNIP2

## Overview
TNIP2, or TNFAIP3 interacting protein 2, is a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the modulation of immune responses and inflammation. The protein, also known as ABIN2, functions primarily as an inhibitor within the NF-κB signaling pathway, a critical pathway for controlling the expression of inflammatory cytokines and genes related to cell proliferation (Pienkos2021Novel; Lou2020microRNA‑15a‑5p). As a hub protein, TNIP2 interacts with various components of the NF-κB network, including membrane receptors and RNA species, to maintain immune homeostasis and prevent excessive inflammatory responses (Banks2016TNIP2). The protein's activity in both the cytoplasm and nucleus underscores its role in processes such as apoptosis and cell proliferation, highlighting its importance in preventing inflammatory diseases and conditions like pulmonary arterial hypertension and certain cancers (Pienkos2021Novel; Tao2022Hyperoxia).

## Function
TNIP2, also known as TNFAIP3 interacting protein 2, plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses and inflammation by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. This protein acts as an inhibitor of NF-κB activation, which is essential for controlling the expression of inflammatory cytokines and genes associated with cell proliferation (Pienkos2021Novel; Lou2020microRNA‑15a‑5p). TNIP2 interacts with several membrane receptors, such as CD40, TNF receptor 1, and toll-like receptor 4, to suppress downstream activation of the NF-κB pathway, thereby maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Pienkos2021Novel).

In healthy human cells, TNIP2 is involved in maintaining immune homeostasis by inhibiting excessive NF-κB pathway activation, which is crucial for regulating inflammation and cell survival (Lou2020microRNA‑15a‑5p). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes like apoptosis and cell proliferation (Tao2022Hyperoxia). TNIP2's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in preventing pathological conditions associated with inflammation, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and other inflammatory diseases (Pienkos2021Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNIP2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A novel missense variant in TNIP2, which encodes the protein ABIN2, has been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This variant results in a serine to glycine substitution at position 233 of the protein, potentially leading to a loss of function and inappropriate activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial in inflammatory responses (Pienkos2021Novel). The variant was identified in two patients with PAH from the same family, although one unaffected family member also carries the variant, suggesting incomplete penetrance or the need for additional factors to trigger disease development (Pienkos2021Novel).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TNIP2 expression is downregulated by miR-1180, leading to increased cell proliferation. This interaction highlights TNIP2's role as a tumor suppressor and its involvement in the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation in various cancers (Zhou2016MiR-1180). Additionally, in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), TNIP2 is targeted by miR-34a, resulting in increased IL-1β production and inflammation, suggesting a protective role of TNIP2 against hyperoxia-induced inflammation and cell death (Tao2022Hyperoxia).

## Interactions
TNIP2, also known as ABIN2, is a hub protein in the NF-κB signaling network, interacting with various proteins and RNA species. It interacts with several components of the NF-κB pathway, including NFKB1, REL, and RELA, and can regulate NF-κB-dependent transcription both positively and negatively (Banks2016TNIP2). TNIP2 associates with the ESCRT-I complex through its interaction with the TSG101 subunit, which is crucial for processes like HIV-1 budding (Banks2016TNIP2). The N-terminal region of TNIP2 is essential for its interaction with NFKB1, while the EABR region is important for its association with the ESCRT-I complex. A point mutation in the EABR region can disrupt this interaction (Banks2016TNIP2).

TNIP2 also interacts with proteins involved in mRNA metabolism and is associated with a specific set of mRNAs linked to transcription regulation (Banks2016TNIP2). It has been shown to interact with RNA-binding proteins and mRNA transcripts, with 314 RNA species enriched in TNIP2 purifications (Banks2016TNIP2). These interactions suggest TNIP2's role in linking cellular transport machinery and RNA transcript processing, highlighting its expanded role in the NF-κB network (Banks2016TNIP2).
