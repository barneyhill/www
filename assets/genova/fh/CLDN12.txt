# CLDN12

## Overview
The CLDN12 gene encodes claudin 12, a member of the claudin family of proteins, which are integral components of tight junctions in epithelial and endothelial cells. Claudin 12 is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the paracellular barrier and regulating ion permeability, particularly in calcium absorption within the intestines (Lu2013Claudins). Unlike some other claudins, claudin 12 does not independently form tight junction strands but is thought to integrate into the tight junction network, contributing to its structural and functional integrity (Berndt2019Tight). The expression of CLDN12 is modulated by vitamin D, highlighting its involvement in vitamin D-dependent calcium homeostasis (Fujita2008Tight). Additionally, CLDN12 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neuropathic disorders, where its altered expression may influence disease progression and symptomatology (Chen2019Claudin12; Tian2019&lt; The; p&gt).

## Function
Claudin 12 (CLDN12) is a protein that plays a significant role in calcium absorption in the intestines. It is highly expressed in the ileum and moderately in the jejunum and colon, with minimal expression in the duodenum. Sub-cellularly, CLDN12 is localized at the apical-most tips of lateral membranes of epithelial cells in these regions, contributing to calcium absorption in intestinal epithelial cells (Lu2013Claudins).

CLDN12, along with claudin-2, is critical for vitamin D-dependent calcium absorption. The expression of CLDN12 is up-regulated by the active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which enhances paracellular calcium transport between enterocytes. This process is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis in the body (Fujita2008Tight). In vitamin D receptor knockout mice, the expression of CLDN12 is significantly reduced, indicating its dependence on vitamin D signaling for proper function (Fujita2008Tight).

CLDN12 may also contribute to epithelial tightening, as suggested by its expression in blood vessels and the urinary bladder, although its exact function in these tissues is not entirely clear (Lameris2012Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CLDN12 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neuropathic conditions. In osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, CLDN12 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis. This overexpression promotes cell proliferation and migration, potentially through the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting that CLDN12 could be a target for therapeutic intervention in osteosarcoma (Tian2019&lt; The; p&gt).

In colorectal cancer, CLDN12 is frequently upregulated, indicating a potential role in cancer progression. The differential expression of CLDN12, along with other claudins, may contribute to changes in cell adhesion and polarity, which are often disrupted in cancerous tissues (Gröne2006Differential).

In the nervous system, CLDN12 deficiency is linked to nerve barrier breakdown, mechanical hypersensitivity, and painfulness in polyneuropathy. This deficiency leads to a leaky barrier in the sciatic nerve and is associated with painful chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) or non-inflammatory polyneuropathy (PNP) in certain patient populations (Chen2019Claudin12).

## Interactions
Claudin 12 (CLDN12) is involved in tight junction formation, but its specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remain unclear. Unlike other claudins, CLDN12 does not form tight junction strands on its own, and neither homo- nor heterophilic interactions have been definitively identified (Berndt2019Tight). It is suggested that CLDN12 may be part of the tight junction strand network, but its precise role and interactions within this network are not well-defined (Berndt2019Tight).

In the context of vitamin D-dependent calcium absorption, CLDN12, along with claudin-2, is implicated in forming paracellular channels for calcium ions in intestinal epithelial cells. This function is supported by the observation that CLDN12 expression is upregulated by vitamin D, indicating a regulatory interaction with the vitamin D receptor pathway (Fujita2008Tight). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in this process are not detailed.

Overall, while CLDN12 is associated with tight junctions and calcium absorption, the exact nature of its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids remains to be fully elucidated.
