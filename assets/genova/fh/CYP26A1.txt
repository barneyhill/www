# CYP26A1

## Overview
CYP26A1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 26 subfamily A member 1, a crucial component of the cytochrome P450 superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), a metabolite of vitamin A, by catalyzing its hydroxylation to maintain retinoid homeostasis and prevent toxic accumulation. As a retinoic acid hydroxylase, CYP26A1 plays a significant role in the liver, where it contributes to the first-pass metabolism of dietary atRA. The enzyme is characterized by its high binding affinity and capacity for atRA, and it is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, requiring P450 oxidoreductase for its function (Topletz2012Comparison; Isoherranen2019Biochemical). CYP26A1's activity is modulated by interactions with cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABPs), which influence its kinetic parameters and regulatory mechanisms (Yabut2022CRABPs). The gene's expression and function are critical for normal embryonic development and have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including developmental disorders and cancer, where its dysregulation can lead to altered retinoic acid signaling and oncogenic processes (Osanai2009Oncogenic; AbuAbed2001The).

## Structure
The human CYP26A1 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, consisting of 497 amino acids with a molecular weight of 56,163 Daltons (Ren2008Structure). The primary structure includes key residues such as Trp112, Phe222, Phe299, Pro371, and Phe374, which are involved in ligand interactions (Isoherranen2019Biochemical). The secondary structure is characterized by a helix-rich domain and a beta-sheet domain with antiparallel beta-strands (Ren2008Structure). The tertiary structure forms a compact, globular shape with a heme-binding domain, where Cys442 serves as the axial ligand to the heme iron (Ren2008Structure).

CYP26A1 contains conserved domains typical of P450 enzymes, such as the heme-binding domain, PERF domain, and ETLR conserved domain (Ren2008Structure). The spatial organization of these domains is conserved across P450s despite low sequence identity (Ren2008Structure). The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, with a predicted shorter variant lacking 69 amino acids, although this variant is non-functional in metabolizing all-trans retinoic acid (Lee2007The). The structure of CYP26A1 is crucial for its role in retinoic acid metabolism, particularly in the context of cancer treatment (Ren2008Structure).

## Function
CYP26A1 is a crucial enzyme in the metabolism of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), a biologically active form of vitamin A. It functions as a retinoic acid hydroxylase, converting atRA into various hydroxylated metabolites such as 4-hydroxy-RA (4-OH-RA), 18-hydroxy-RA (18-OH-RA), and 4-oxo-RA. This process is essential for maintaining retinoid homeostasis and preventing excessive accumulation of atRA, which can be toxic (Lutz2009Expression; Topletz2012Comparison).

CYP26A1 is predominantly expressed in the liver, where it plays a significant role in the first-pass metabolism of dietary atRA, contributing to the clearance of exogenous atRA and maintaining retinoid signaling balance (Zhong2019The; Isoherranen2019Biochemical). The enzyme's activity is highly efficient, with a high binding affinity for atRA, and it is considered a high-capacity atRA hydroxylase (Thatcher2009The; Topletz2012Comparison).

In cellular biology, CYP26A1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and requires P450 oxidoreductase for its function. It is NADPH-dependent and does not interact with cytochrome b5, which is atypical for P450 enzymes (Lutz2009Expression). The regulation of CYP26A1 is influenced by retinoic acid receptors and dietary vitamin A levels, ensuring proper retinoid signaling and homeostasis (Isoherranen2019Biochemical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CYP26A1 gene are associated with several developmental disorders and conditions. Disruption of CYP26A1 in mice leads to severe developmental defects, including spina bifida, tail agenesis, and sirenomelia, which are similar to the effects of excess retinoic acid (RA) exposure. These findings suggest that CYP26A1 is crucial for maintaining appropriate RA levels during embryogenesis to prevent teratogenic effects (AbuAbed2001The). In humans, mutations in CYP26A1 have been linked to caudal regression syndrome, a rare congenital defect characterized by malformations of the spine and spinal cord (Lee2007The).

CYP26A1 is also implicated in cancer, where its overexpression is associated with increased tumorigenic and metastatic potential. This overexpression can lead to a state of functional vitamin A deficiency, reducing RA bioavailability and promoting oncogenic processes. In breast cancer, high CYP26A1 expression is linked to aggressive tumor characteristics and decreased survival rates (Osanai2009Oncogenic). The enzyme's role in RA metabolism suggests that its dysregulation may contribute to cancer progression by impairing apoptosis and enhancing cell survival (Osanai2005Expression).

## Interactions
CYP26A1 interacts with cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABPs), specifically CRABP1 and CRABP2, which influence the metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) through protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for modulating the activity of CYP26A1, as CRABPs can alter the kinetic parameters of atRA metabolism. Apo-CRABPs (unbound to atRA) inhibit CYP26A1 activity, while holo-CRABPs (bound to atRA) facilitate the channeling of atRA to CYP26A1 for metabolism (Yabut2022CRABPs). 

CRABP1 and CRABP2 bind to CYP26A1 with high affinity, affecting the rate of atRA metabolism. The interactions are thought to be allosteric, potentially altering the conformation and activity of CYP26A1 (Yabut2022CRABPs). CRABP2, unlike CRABP1, can translocate to the nucleus upon atRA binding, suggesting a role in nuclear receptor signaling (Yabut2022CRABPs). 

The presence of CRABPs also affects the formation of 4-hydroxy-atRA by CYP26A1, with CRABP1 having a more significant inhibitory effect compared to CRABP2 (Yabut2022CRABPs). These interactions are part of a regulatory mechanism that modulates atRA concentrations and signaling in cells (Yabut2022CRABPs).
