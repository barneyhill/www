# C8orf89

## Overview
C8orf89 is a gene located on chromosome 8 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 8 open reading frame 89. This protein is involved in various biological processes, although its precise functional role remains to be fully elucidated. Current research suggests that C8orf89 may play a role in placental biology and neuropsychiatric conditions, as it has been implicated in intra-uterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, and variations in the morphology of the human corpus callosum. The gene's expression and its genetic interactions are of particular interest in understanding its contribution to these conditions. Additionally, genome-wide association studies have suggested a potential link between C8orf89 and affective temperaments, highlighting its relevance in the study of affective disorders (Apicella2023PanGenomic; Gonda2021Genetic; Bhatt2024The).

## Clinical Significance
C8orf89 has been implicated in various clinical conditions through its genetic interactions and expression levels. In the context of placental biology, C8orf89 is identified as an eGene with significant genotype-disease interactions, particularly in conditions such as Intra-uterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) and Preeclampsia (PE). The gene's expression is influenced by the best-eSNP rs6472746, which shows a significant interaction with disease status, suggesting a complex relationship between C8orf89 and these placental pathologies (Apicella2023PanGenomic).

In neuropsychiatric research, C8orf89 has been associated with variations in the morphology of the human corpus callosum (CC) and cognitive function. A negative genetic correlation has been observed between the C8orf89 locus and total CC area and IQ, indicating that allelic differences at this locus may contribute to differences in CC structure and cognitive abilities (Bhatt2024The).

Additionally, C8orf89 has been linked to affective temperaments, particularly cyclothymic temperament, through genome-wide association studies. The gene was highlighted with a suggestive significance, indicating potential genetic markers for further exploration in the context of affective disorders (Gonda2021Genetic).
