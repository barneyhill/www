# NSUN6

## Overview
NSUN6 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 6) is a gene that encodes a member of the RNA methyltransferase family, specifically involved in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. The NSUN6 protein is characterized as an m5C RNA methyltransferase, which plays a critical role in the methylation of cytosine residues in tRNA and mRNA, thereby influencing RNA stability and function (Selmi2020Sequence; Haag2015NSUN6). The protein contains distinct domains, including a pseudouridine synthase and archaeosine transglycosylase (PUA) RNA binding domain and a catalytic S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Haag2015NSUN6). NSUN6 is implicated in various biological processes, including tRNA biogenesis and mRNA regulation, and has been associated with clinical conditions such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, where its expression levels are altered (Selmi2020Sequence; PerezgrovasSaltijeral2022Differential).

## Structure
The NSUN6 protein is characterized by its distinct domain structure, which includes an N-terminal pseudouridine synthase and archaeosine transglycosylase (PUA) RNA binding domain and a C-terminal S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding domain (Haag2015NSUN6). The PUA domain is crucial for binding to the D-stem region of tRNA and the non-genomically encoded CCA 3' end, which is essential for the methylation of specific tRNAs such as tRNA Cys and tRNA Thr (Bohnsack2019Eukaryotic). The MTase domain of NSUN6 consists of a Rossmann-fold catalytic core and an RNA recognition motif (RRM), which are involved in substrate recognition and catalysis (Liu2017Structural).

The catalytic mechanism of NSUN6 involves specific residues, including Cys373, which acts as the nucleophile in the methylation process, and Cys326, which is suggested to function as a general base (Liu2017Structural). The protein forms a covalent intermediate with cellular RNA, indicating its role as an m5C tRNA methyltransferase (Haag2015NSUN6). NSUN6's structure is further stabilized by disulfide bonds formed between Cys326 and Cys373, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Liu2017Structural). The protein's structure and function are regulated by these conserved cysteine residues, which are essential for its catalytic activity.

## Function
NSUN6 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 6) is a human RNA methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. It specifically catalyzes the formation of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) at position 72 in certain tRNAs, such as tRNA Thr and tRNA Cys, which is essential for their stability and function in protein synthesis (Haag2015NSUN6). NSUN6 is localized in the cytoplasm, particularly around the pericentriolar matrix and the Golgi apparatus, suggesting its involvement in a late stage of tRNA biogenesis after nuclear export (Haag2015NSUN6).

In addition to its role in tRNA methylation, NSUN6 is involved in mRNA methylation, targeting specific mRNA sites in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) with a consensus sequence motif. This methylation enhances mRNA stability and translation, influencing gene expression regulation (Selmi2020Sequence). NSUN6's activity in mRNA methylation is associated with increased mRNA abundance and translation efficiency, particularly affecting mRNAs involved in RNA processing and translation (Selmi2020Sequence). The enzyme's function in mRNA methylation also plays a role in maintaining translation fidelity by influencing ribosome occupancy and translation termination (Selmi2020Sequence).

## Clinical Significance
NSUN6 has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels. In cancer, NSUN6 expression is notably down-regulated in tumors originating from tissues with high NSUN6 expression, such as the testis, thyroid, and ovaries. This down-regulation is associated with later pathological stages and correlates with improved patient survival, suggesting that NSUN6 could serve as a prognostic biomarker for positive outcomes in these cancers (Selmi2020Sequence). Over-expression of NSUN6 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in liver cancer cells, indicating its potential role in controlling cancer progression (Selmi2020Sequence).

In neurodegenerative conditions, NSUN6 expression is significantly decreased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly in the hippocampus and temporal gyrus. This decrease is not driven by a dementia phenotype, suggesting a distinct role in TBI (PerezgrovasSaltijeral2022Differential). In AD, NSUN6 expression is lower in early and late Braak stages, indicating its potential involvement in disease progression (PerezGrovas-Saltijeral2023Differential). These findings highlight the potential role of NSUN6 in neurodegenerative conditions and its altered expression in AD and TBI, which may have clinical significance in understanding disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets (PerezGrovas-Saltijeral2023Differential).

## Interactions
NSUN6 (NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 6) is involved in RNA methylation, specifically catalyzing the formation of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in RNA. It interacts predominantly with tRNA molecules, particularly tRNA Cys and tRNA Thr, as demonstrated by UV crosslinking and 5-azacytidine chemical crosslinking experiments. These interactions are crucial for NSUN6's role in tRNA methylation, with more than 40% of sequence reads from Illumina deep sequencing mapping to tRNA sequences (Haag2015NSUN6). NSUN6's interaction with tRNA involves its PUA domain, which recognizes the CCA end and interacts with the D-stem region of the tRNA, facilitating substrate binding and catalysis (Liu2017Structural).

NSUN6 also interacts with mRNA, where it is responsible for mRNA m5C methylation. The PUA domain is essential for recognizing the stem-loop structure of mRNA substrates, and specific residues are involved in differentiating between tRNA and mRNA methylation (Liu2020Sequence). In the context of cancer, NSUN6 enhances the mRNA level of the tumor suppressor gene FBXW7 through m5C methylation, which is suggested to slow down tumor progression (Xie2024Bioinformatic). These interactions highlight NSUN6's role in RNA processing and its potential implications in disease contexts.
