# LRRC71

## Overview
LRRC71 is a gene that encodes the leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 71, which is characterized by the presence of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, suggesting that LRRC71 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction capabilities. The protein is implicated in reproductive biology, particularly in male fertility, through its interaction with TCTEX1D4, a dynein light chain protein involved in sperm motility (Freitas2014TCTEX1D4). Additionally, LRRC71 has been identified as a hub gene in regulatory networks associated with immune response and disease mechanisms, such as Johne’s disease in dairy cattle (Ghafouri2024Integrated). Its expression is also altered in certain pathological conditions, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and intracerebral hemorrhage, indicating its potential involvement in disease-related pathways (Sun2020Comprehensive; Jin2021Identification).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
LRRC71, a leucine-rich repeat-containing protein, is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its biological functions. In the human testis, LRRC71 interacts with TCTEX1D4, a dynein light chain protein. This interaction is part of a broader network of proteins associated with TCTEX1D4, which plays roles in sperm motility and other reproductive processes (Freitas2014TCTEX1D4). The interaction between LRRC71 and TCTEX1D4 suggests a potential involvement in the regulation of cellular processes related to male fertility.

In the context of disease, LRRC71 has been identified as a hub gene in regulatory networks associated with Johne’s disease in dairy cattle. It is suppressed by multiple miRNAs, indicating its role in complex regulatory pathways (Ghafouri2024Integrated). Although specific protein interactions in this context are not detailed, the regulatory influence of LRRC71 highlights its significance in immune response and disease mechanisms.

LRRC71 is also downregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and intracerebral hemorrhage, suggesting its involvement in pathways related to these conditions, although specific interacting partners in these contexts are not detailed (Sun2020Comprehensive; Jin2021Identification).
