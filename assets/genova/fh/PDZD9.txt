# PDZD9

## Overview
PDZD9 is a gene that encodes the protein PDZ domain containing 9, which is part of the PDZ domain-containing protein family. These proteins are known for their role in signaling pathways and cellular communication, often acting as scaffolding proteins that organize other proteins into functional complexes. PDZ domain containing 9 is implicated in various biological processes, including spermatogenesis and neurological functions, through its interactions with other proteins such as the amyloid beta protein precursor (Petit2015Combining). The gene is located on chromosome 16p12.1, a region associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, intellectual disability, and behavioral abnormalities (Vevera2018Rare; Pizzo2021Functional). Despite its potential significance, the specific functions and mechanisms of PDZD9 remain under investigation, with ongoing research exploring its role in conditions like schizophrenia and its response to environmental stressors (Ren2017The; Sieck2021Betaadrenergic).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
PDZD9 is implicated in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, although its specific role remains unclear. The gene is located within the 16p12.1 chromosomal region, which is associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. While PDZD9 itself lacks detailed functional information, it is suggested that it may contribute to the pathogenicity of the 16p12.1 deletion, which often requires additional genetic variants to manifest severe disease phenotypes (Pizzo2021Functional). 

In the context of schizophrenia, PDZD9 has been identified in a genome-wide association study as one of the genes associated with white matter microstructural abnormalities, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of the disorder (Ren2017The). The 16p12.2 microdeletion, which includes PDZD9, is linked to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and an increased risk for schizophrenia, although the specific contribution of PDZD9 to these outcomes is not well understood (Pizzo2016Clinical).

PDZD9 is also part of a copy number variation associated with intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities, indicating its potential relevance in these conditions, though specific clinical significance remains to be elucidated (Vevera2018Rare).

## Interactions
PDZD9 is involved in several protein interactions that are significant for its biological functions. In the context of spermatogenesis, PDZD9 interacts with the amyloid beta protein precursor (APP), which is a regulator of neuronal development and is associated with spermatogenesis. This interaction suggests a potential role for PDZD9 in male fertility, as it is part of a network of proteins that form a principal connected component, indicating its importance in protein-protein interaction networks (Petit2015Combining).

In beef cattle, PDZD9 was identified as differentially expressed due to environmental effects, with a log2 fold change of 0.54, indicating its potential involvement in response to environmental stressors (Sieck2021Betaadrenergic).

PDZD9 is also mentioned in the context of a 600 kb deletion on chromosome 16, which includes this gene among others. This deletion is associated with intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities, suggesting that PDZD9 may play a role in neurological functions, although specific interactions in this context are not detailed (Vevera2018Rare).

Despite these findings, PDZD9 was not included in a brain-specific interaction network analysis, indicating a lack of available interaction data for this gene in certain contexts (Pizzo2021Functional).
