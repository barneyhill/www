# HNRNPM

## Overview
HNRNPM is a gene that encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M, a multifunctional protein involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including splicing, transport, and stability. As a member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, hnRNPM is characterized by its RNA-binding domains and methionine/arginine-rich motifs, which facilitate its interactions with RNA and other proteins (Datar1993The). The protein plays a critical role in the regulation of alternative splicing, influencing gene expression and cellular responses to stress (Han2010Functional; Huelga2012Integrative). Additionally, hnRNPM is implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers, where it affects tumor progression and metastasis through its splicing regulatory functions (Ho2021HNRNPM; Xu2014Cell). The gene's expression and activity are modulated by alternative splicing and post-translational modifications, contributing to its functional diversity and significance in cellular processes (Datar1993The).

## Structure
HNRNPM, or heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M, is a protein characterized by its modular structure, which includes multiple RNA-binding domains known as RNP-CS domains. These domains are approximately 90 amino acids in length and are crucial for RNA binding, showing about 40% identity to similar domains in yeast proteins (Datar1993The). The protein also features a unique methionine/arginine-rich repeat motif (MR repeat motif) with a consensus sequence of G(I/L)(E/D)RM(G/A), repeated 27 times between residues 399-611, which is thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions (Datar1993The).

The primary structure of HNRNPM is composed of 729 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 77,606 Da, although it migrates at 68 kD by SDS-PAGE, a common anomaly in hnRNP proteins (Datar1993The). The protein also contains regions rich in glycine and methionine residues, with several GMG repeats located amino terminal to the MR repeat motif (Datar1993The).

HNRNPM is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, with several potential phosphorylation sites identified, such as nine casein kinase type II sites and one tyrosine phosphorylation site (Datar1993The). The protein is generated through alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity (Datar1993The).

## Function
HNRNPM, or heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M, is a protein involved in various RNA processing activities, including splicing, transport, localization, translation, and stability. It is primarily located in the nucleus, where it forms complexes with pre-mRNAs to regulate alternative splicing events, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper gene expression (Huelga2012Integrative). HNRNPM binds to GU-rich sequences, often containing a UU sequence, and is associated with both constitutive and alternative splicing exons, playing a significant role in exon inclusion and repression (Huelga2012Integrative).

HNRNPM is involved in the regulation of its own pre-mRNAs and other RNA binding proteins, suggesting a complex network of autoregulation and cooperative regulation with other hnRNP proteins (Huelga2012Integrative). It also plays a role in cellular stress responses, such as the heat-shock response, and acts as an antigen receptor in its M4 isoform, indicating its involvement in RNA processing and cellular stress responses (Han2010Functional).

In addition to its role in splicing, HNRNPM influences the biogenesis of circular RNAs and is involved in maintaining the diversity of the proteome, which is essential for cellular development and function (Ho2021HNRNPM).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HNRNPM gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in various cancers. In prostate cancer, HNRNPM is highly expressed and is essential for cancer cell growth. Its role in regulating splicing and limiting circular RNA (circRNA) biogenesis is crucial for maintaining cancer cell fitness. High levels of HNRNPM correlate with reduced circRNA expression and are associated with a poorer prognosis in prostate cancer patients (Ho2021HNRNPM).

In breast cancer, hnRNPM is implicated in metastasis through its regulation of alternative splicing during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). It promotes the mesenchymal phenotype by regulating the splicing of the CD44 gene, which is crucial for EMT and metastasis. Knockdown of hnRNPM impairs this process, reducing tumor cell motility and invasion (Xu2014Cell).

In colon cancer, hnRNPM is overexpressed and facilitates cancer progression under hypoxic conditions by acting as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) trans-acting factor. Its expression is linked to poor prognosis and lower overall survival rates in colorectal cancer patients (Chen2019hnRNPM).

In lung cancer, hnRNPM interacts with PARP4, influencing splicing events that may contribute to cancer pathogenesis. Lower expression of hnRNPM is associated with poorer overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma (Lee2024PARP4).

## Interactions
HNRNPM (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M) is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in RNA processing and splicing regulation. HNRNPM interacts with the splicing regulator CDC5L and PLRG1 proteins, affecting alternative splice site choice. This interaction is dependent on nascent pre-mRNA production and is disrupted under heat shock conditions, indicating a co-transcriptional requirement (Llères2010Direct).

HNRNPM also interacts with PARP4, a novel driver gene in lung adenocarcinoma, where it plays a role in regulating splicing events. This interaction is significant for the tumor suppressive function of PARP4, as it influences splicing dysregulation observed in lung cancer progression (Lee2024PARP4).

In the context of Ewing sarcoma, HNRNPM is upregulated in response to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition, suggesting its involvement in a splicing program that contributes to drug resistance (Passacantilli2017hnRNPM).

HNRNPM isoforms selectively interact with TET proteins, such as TAF15 and TLS/FUS, through direct protein-protein interactions. These interactions are isoform-specific, with TAF15 associating with higher molecular weight isoforms and TLS/FUS with lower molecular weight isoforms (Marko2014Selective).
