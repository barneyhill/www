# LGALS2

## Overview
LGALS2 is a gene that encodes the protein galectin-2, a member of the galectin family known for its role as a β-galactoside-binding protein. Galectin-2 is characterized by a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, immune response modulation, and inflammation regulation. The protein is primarily synthesized in the cytosol and can be transported to different cellular locations, despite lacking a classical secretion signal sequence. Galectin-2's ability to form homodimers allows it to crosslink receptors on cell surfaces, which is crucial for its function in maintaining epithelial integrity and modulating immune responses. It plays a significant role in gastrointestinal health, immune system regulation, and has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions (Loser2009Galectin2; Negedu2022Galectin2; Kane2021AntiGalectin2).

## Structure
Galectin-2, encoded by the LGALS2 gene, is a 14 KDa protein characterized by a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) located at the C-terminal. This domain is crucial for its function as a β-galactoside-binding protein. The CRD is divided into subsites A to D, with subsite C being the primary galactoside-binding site (Negedu2022Galectin2; Leffler2002Introduction).

The secondary structure of galectin-2 consists of a β-sandwich formed by two antiparallel β-sheets, comprising 5 (F1-F5) and 6 (S1-S6) β-strands. This structure is similar to that of other galectins, such as galectin-1, and is revealed through X-ray crystallography (Yang2008Galectins:; Negedu2022Galectin2).

Galectin-2 can exist as a monomer but is capable of forming non-covalent homodimers in solution. The dimerization occurs on β-strands F1 and S1, opposite the sugar-binding site S4-S6, with the dimer interface formed by four parallel hydrogen bonds involving specific residues (Negedu2022Galectin2).

The protein's tertiary structure is globular with a 'jelly roll' topology, typical of galectins, and it is synthesized in the cytosol, with potential transport to various cellular locations (Unknownauthors2008Galectins; Negedu2022Galectin2). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation.

## Function
Galectin-2, encoded by the LGALS2 gene, is a member of the galactoside-binding galectin family, primarily involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of epithelial layers, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, by contributing to the strength of the mucus layer and protecting epithelial integrity (Negedu2022Galectin2). Galectin-2 interacts with mucin protein MUC5AC and β-catenin on epithelial cell membranes, promoting adhesion and migration, which is essential for gastrointestinal wound healing and barrier strength (Negedu2022Galectin2).

In healthy human cells, galectin-2 is involved in immune response modulation and inflammation regulation. It can activate T cells and induce apoptosis through binding to cell surface glycoproteins, enhancing the secretion of certain cytokines and favoring the conversion of activated T cells to T helper cells (Negedu2022Galectin2). Galectin-2 is synthesized in the cytosol and can be transported to the cell nucleus, membrane, or extracellular space, despite lacking a classical secretion signal sequence (Negedu2022Galectin2). Its ability to form homodimers allows it to crosslink binding receptors on cell surfaces, which is crucial for its function in cellular homeostasis and stress response (Negedu2022Galectin2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LGALS2 gene, which encodes galectin-2, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, LGALS2 is downregulated in human colon tumors, and its deficiency is associated with increased tumor growth in colorectal cancer models. This suggests a suppressive role of galectin-2 in colon tumorigenesis, potentially through mechanisms involving oxidative stress and inflammation (Li2020Genomewide). In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), LGALS2 is identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker due to its elevated expression and association with immune responses and drug resistance (He2023Investigation).

In cardiovascular diseases, galectin-2 influences macrophage polarization, promoting a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, which is linked to atherosclerosis. Inhibition of galectin-2 has been shown to reduce atherosclerotic plaque size and shift macrophage polarity towards an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis (Kane2021AntiGalectin2).

In the context of malaria, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the LGALS2 gene is associated with increased susceptibility to severe malaria in children, highlighting the gene's role in inflammatory responses (Randall2010Age‐Related). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LGALS2 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
Galectin-2 (LGALS2) is involved in several interactions that influence immune responses and cellular processes. It binds to the β1 integrin CD29 on activated CD8+ T cells, which is hypothesized to mediate apoptosis signaling. This interaction is significant in the context of contact allergy, where galectin-2 induces apoptosis in these T cells, thereby modulating immune responses (Loser2009Galectin2). The proapoptotic effects of galectin-2 can be blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD, indicating the involvement of caspases in the apoptosis process (Loser2009Galectin2).

In the context of inflammatory bowel disease, galectin-2 interacts with lamina propria T lymphocytes, inducing apoptosis and ameliorating colitis symptoms. This interaction involves the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, which are critical pathways in the regulation of apoptosis (Paclik2007Galectin2).

Galectin-2 also interacts with the lipopolysaccharide-binding protein CD14, affecting monocyte and macrophage polarization to a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and reducing monocyte motility. This interaction is non-carbohydrate dependent and highlights galectin-2's role in immune modulation (Blois2019Pregnancy).
