# PROX1

## Overview
PROX1, or prospero homeobox 1, is a gene that encodes a homeobox transcription factor involved in various developmental and physiological processes. The protein encoded by PROX1 is crucial for the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system, where it regulates the differentiation of blood vascular endothelial cells into lymphatic endothelial cells. As a transcription factor, PROX1 interacts with other proteins and transcriptional complexes to modulate gene expression, influencing cell cycle regulation and cellular differentiation. It plays a significant role in lymphangiogenesis and has been implicated in several diseases, including primary lymphedema, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. The dual role of PROX1 as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene highlights its complex involvement in cancer biology, with its function varying depending on the cellular context (Petrova2002Lymphatic; Ntikoudi2022The; Elsir2012Transcription; Hong2002Prox1).

## Function
PROX1 is a homeobox transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system. It regulates the differentiation of blood vascular endothelial cells into lymphatic endothelial cells by upregulating lymphatic-specific markers and downregulating blood vascular markers (Petrova2002Lymphatic; Hong2002Prox1). PROX1 is essential for the formation of the lymphatic vasculature, as demonstrated by the absence of lymphatic development in Prox1-null mice (Wigle2002An).

In addition to its role in lymphangiogenesis, PROX1 is involved in cell cycle regulation. It activates the transcription of Cyclin E1 (Ccne1), a key regulator of the G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle, through E2F-binding sites on the Ccne1 promoter (Baxter2011Regulation). This activation can occur independently of direct DNA binding, suggesting that PROX1 may interact with other transcription factors or co-regulators (Baxter2011Regulation).

PROX1 also interacts with COUP-TFII, a transcription factor that helps specify lymphatic endothelial cell fate, indicating a cooperative role in maintaining the lymphatic phenotype (Lee2009Prox1). This interaction is crucial for the expression of several lineage-specific genes, including VEGFR-3 and FGFR-3 (Lee2009Prox1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PROX1 gene are implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of the lymphatic system, mutations in PROX1 have been linked to primary lymphedema, a disorder characterized by fluid build-up in tissues due to lymphatic system malfunction (Ricci2020Two). PROX1 is also associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes, potentially due to altered fat metabolism resulting from lymphatic dysfunction (Ricci2020Two).

In cancer, PROX1 plays a complex role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene depending on the context. In colorectal cancer, PROX1 is up-regulated, promoting progression from benign to malignant phenotypes, and is associated with poor outcomes (Elsir2012Transcription). Conversely, in hepatocellular carcinoma, PROX1 depletion increases cell proliferation, while its over-expression decreases it, indicating a protective role (Elsir2012Transcription). In pancreatic cancer, low PROX1 expression correlates with poor survival (Ntikoudi2022The). PROX1 is also involved in hematologic malignancies, where its expression is often decreased due to DNA hypermethylation, which can be reversed with demethylating agents (Nagai2003Mutations). These findings underscore the gene's context-dependent role in cancer.

## Interactions
PROX1 (prospero homeobox 1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function as a transcription factor. It interacts with retinoic acid-related orphan receptors (RORs), specifically RORg and RORa, through its N-terminal and C-terminal regions. These interactions are crucial for the nuclear localization and stabilization of RORg, with the C-terminal region of PROX1, particularly between amino acids 723 and 729, being essential for this interaction (Takeda2013Prosperorelated). PROX1 acts as a co-repressor of RORs, inhibiting ROR-mediated transcriptional activation by disrupting interactions between RORs and their co-activators (Takeda2013Prosperorelated).

PROX1 also interacts with the LSD1/NuRD complex, a multiprotein complex involved in chromatin remodeling. It directly binds to LSD1, facilitating the recruitment of the LSD1/NuRD complex to specific promoters, such as CYP7A1, leading to transcriptional repression through epigenetic modifications (Ouyang2013Prox1). In the inner ear, PROX1 represses the transcription factors Atoh1 and Gfi1, which are critical for hair cell differentiation, indicating its role in cellular differentiation processes (Kirjavainen2008Prox1). These interactions highlight PROX1's role in modulating gene expression through both direct protein interactions and participation in larger protein complexes.
