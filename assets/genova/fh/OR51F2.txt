# OR51F2

## Overview
OR51F2 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 51 subfamily F member 2, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are integral membrane proteins that play a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules, facilitating the sense of smell by initiating signal transduction pathways in the olfactory epithelium (Damena2021Insilico; Damena2020Functional). Beyond its primary function in olfaction, OR51F2 has been associated with other biological processes, including potential involvement in malaria resistance pathways. This association was highlighted in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that identified OR51F2 as a candidate gene potentially linked to malaria resistance, possibly due to its proximity to the globin gene cluster (Damena2021Insilico; Damena2020Functional).

## Function
OR51F2 is a gene that encodes an olfactory receptor protein, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. These receptors are primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR51F2 is active in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell (Damena2021Insilico; Damena2020Functional).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR51F2 has been implicated in other biological processes. It is involved in G protein-coupled signaling pathways, which are significant in various cellular processes, including those related to malaria resistance pathways. The gene was identified as a candidate potentially involved in malaria resistance, as it was predicted by two of the three mapping strategies used in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) (Damena2021Insilico; Damena2020Functional). The study suggests that OR51F2, along with other olfactory receptor genes, might have been detected due to their abundance and proximity to the globin gene cluster, which is known for its role in malaria resistance (Damena2020Functional).
