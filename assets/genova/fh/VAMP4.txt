# VAMP4

## Overview
VAMP4, or vesicle-associated membrane protein 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the SNARE (Soluble NSF Attachment Protein Receptor) protein family, which is integral to vesicular transport processes within cells. The protein product of VAMP4 is involved in the trafficking of vesicles, particularly within the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure of the Golgi apparatus. As a transmembrane protein, VAMP4 forms part of a SNARE complex with other proteins such as syntaxin 6, syntaxin 16, and Vti1a, facilitating membrane fusion and vesicle transport. It is also implicated in synaptic vesicle release probability, acting as a negative regulator in neuronal contexts. VAMP4's interactions with various adaptor proteins underscore its importance in synaptic vesicle recycling and spontaneous neurotransmission, highlighting its broader significance in cellular and neurological functions (Steegmaier1999Vesicleassociated; NicholsonFish2015VAMP4; Ivanova2021Control).

## Structure
Vesicle-associated membrane protein 4 (VAMP4) is a member of the SNARE protein family, characterized by its involvement in vesicular transport processes. The primary structure of VAMP4 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a single polypeptide chain. Its secondary structure typically includes alpha-helices, which are common in SNARE proteins. The tertiary structure of VAMP4 is marked by a coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for its role in forming SNARE complexes (Ivanova2021Control).

VAMP4 does not independently form quaternary structures but interacts with other SNARE proteins to mediate membrane fusion. It is known to associate with syntaxin 6, forming a SNARE complex involved in trans-Golgi network (TGN) vesicle trafficking (Steegmaier1999Vesicleassociated). The presence of a dileucine motif in VAMP4 may facilitate its incorporation into clathrin-coated vesicles, indicating a role in sorting and transport processes (Steegmaier1999Vesicleassociated).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur, although specific modifications for VAMP4 are not detailed in the provided context. VAMP4 is broadly expressed and has been identified in various tissues, suggesting its involvement in common vesicle-trafficking steps across different cell types (Steegmaier1999Vesicleassociated).

## Function
VAMP4 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 4) is a SNARE protein that plays a critical role in vesicular transport processes within cells. It is primarily involved in maintaining the structure of the Golgi apparatus and facilitating vesicle trafficking within the trans-Golgi network (TGN). VAMP4 is essential for maintaining the Golgi ribbon structure, although it does not affect the cisternal stacking of the Golgi. In VAMP4-depleted cells, the Golgi ribbon structure is disrupted, but the stacking of Golgi cisternae remains normal (Shitara2013VAMP4). VAMP4 forms a SNARE complex with syntaxin 6, syntaxin 16, and Vti1a, which is necessary for maintaining the Golgi ribbon structure (Shitara2013VAMP4).

VAMP4 is localized primarily to the tubular and vesicular membranes of the TGN, where it colocalizes with syntaxin 6, indicating its involvement in TGN-to-endosome transport (Steegmaier1999Vesicleassociated). It is found on clathrin-coated and non-coated vesicles, endosomes, and the medial and trans sides of the Golgi complex (Steegmaier1999Vesicleassociated). VAMP4 is also involved in synaptic vesicle release probability, acting as a negative regulator in neuronal cultures and hippocampal slices (Ivanova2021Control).

## Clinical Significance
The VAMP4 gene has been investigated for its potential clinical significance in various conditions. Despite its role in intracellular trafficking and insulin secretion, studies have shown that VAMP4 polymorphisms do not significantly influence the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or impaired glucose homeostasis in the Old Order Amish population (Sabra2005Vesicleassociated). This suggests that genetic variations in VAMP4 are not a major contributor to T2DM susceptibility in this specific group.

In the context of neuropsychiatric conditions, VAMP4 has been associated with suicide attempts. A study identified the polymorphism rs15655 in the VAMP4 gene as significantly associated with suicidal behavior, suggesting that genetic variations in VAMP4 may affect neural conduction and predispose individuals to such behavior (Wasserman2005Suicide).

VAMP4 also plays a role in synaptic vesicle release probability and synaptic plasticity. Alterations in VAMP4 expression or function can impact synaptic transmission, potentially contributing to neurological conditions characterized by impaired synaptic function (Ivanova2021Control). These findings highlight the importance of VAMP4 in maintaining synaptic efficacy and its potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
VAMP4 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It binds specifically to the adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) through a di-leucine motif, which is essential for its proper localization and function. Mutations in this motif disrupt AP-1 binding, leading to mislocalization of VAMP4 (Peden2001The). VAMP4 also interacts with syntaxin 6, forming a SNARE complex that is important for trafficking processes, such as the delivery of sphingomyelin to the chlamydial inclusion (Kabeiseman2013VesicleAssociated).

In the context of neuronal activity, VAMP4 is involved in activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE) and interacts with adaptor proteins like PACS-1 and the CALM/AP180 family. These interactions are crucial for the recovery of VAMP4 during ADBE, highlighting its role as an essential cargo molecule in this process (NicholsonFish2015VAMP4). VAMP4's interactions with clathrin adaptor proteins are necessary for its role in synaptic vesicle recycling and spontaneous neurotransmission, with the di-leucine motif being critical for these interactions (Lin2020VAMP4).
