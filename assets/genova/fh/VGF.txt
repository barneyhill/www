# VGF

## Overview
The VGF gene encodes a precursor protein known as VGF nerve growth factor inducible, which is primarily expressed in the nervous and endocrine systems. This protein is categorized as a neuroendocrine peptide precursor and is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and energy homeostasis. Upon induction by nerve growth factor (NGF), the VGF protein undergoes extensive post-translational processing to generate multiple bioactive peptides that play significant roles in modulating neuronal activity, mood regulation, and metabolism. These peptides are secreted through a regulated pathway and are involved in intercellular communication, particularly in response to depolarizing stimuli. The expression and activity of VGF are intricately regulated by various signaling pathways and transcription factors, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and systemic homeostasis (Lewis2015Neuroendocrine; Levi2004Processing; Salton1991Structure).

## Structure
The VGF protein is encoded by the VGF gene located on chromosome 7q22.1 and consists of two exons, with the entire protein-coding sequence found on exon 2. It is a 615-amino-acid polypeptide in humans, characterized by its acidic nature and rich in proline and glycine residues (Levi2004Processing; Bartolomucci2011The). The protein contains 10-11 conserved clusters of basic residues, which are processed in a tissue-specific manner to generate various peptide fragments (Bartolomucci2011The).

The VGF protein is synthesized at the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the Golgi complex, where it is sorted and packaged into immature granules. These granules mature and release their contents upon stimulation (Bartolomucci2011The). The protein undergoes endoproteolytic cleavage in the secretory pathway, involving prohormone convertases like PC1/3 and PC2, which suggests a greater number of VGF peptides than currently recognized (Levi2004Processing).

A specific C-terminal 73-amino acid fragment contains two predicted α-helix domains and four PC cleavage sites, crucial for targeting VGF to the regulated secretory pathway. Mutation studies indicate that while the helical domains are not necessary, the 564 RRR 566 PC cleavage site and adjacent HFHH domain are important for VGF sorting and release (Bartolomucci2011The). The VGF protein's structure and processing are essential for its role in various physiological processes.

## Function
The VGF gene encodes a neuronal and endocrine peptide precursor involved in various cellular processes, including neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and energy homeostasis. VGF is primarily expressed in the nervous system and is rapidly induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) in neuronal cells (Salton1991Structure). The VGF protein undergoes post-translational processing to produce several smaller peptides, such as VGF20 and VGF10, which are involved in intercellular communication and are enriched in secretory granules (Levi2004Processing; Trani2002Isolation).

VGF-derived peptides play significant roles in modulating neuronal activity, mood regulation, and metabolism. For instance, specific peptides like TLQP-62 and AQEE-30 have been shown to increase the firing rate of hippocampal neurons and induce neurogenesis, while others like TLQP-21 and NERP-2 are involved in regulating energy balance and water homeostasis (Lewis2015Neuroendocrine). VGF expression is modulated by various physiological conditions, including feeding/fasting and circadian rhythms, indicating its role in maintaining homeostasis (Lewis2015Neuroendocrine). The protein is secreted through a regulated pathway and is released in response to depolarizing stimuli, suggesting its involvement in dynamic cellular processes (Salton1991Structure).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VGF gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), VGF is significantly upregulated, contributing to cancer progression and poor prognosis. This upregulation is associated with increased tumor cell growth and migration, and it is negatively regulated by miR-432-5p, a microRNA that is downregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Chou2024The). 

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), VGF has been identified as a key driver gene. It is downregulated in AD cases, and its expression is linked to protective effects against AD pathogenesis. VGF overexpression in AD models has been shown to partially rescue memory impairment and neuropathology (Beckmann2020Multiscale).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), VGF is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. Its expression influences cell viability and migration through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Shi2023METTL3).

VGF promoter methylation has been linked to ovarian cancer progression, where it inversely correlates with VGF expression, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for VGF in this context (Brait2013Association).

## Interactions
The VGF gene is involved in several interactions with transcription factors and signaling pathways, particularly in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) in PC12 cells. The VGF promoter contains multiple regulatory elements, including a cAMP response element (CRE), CCAAT box, and GC box motifs, which interact with various transcription factors such as CREB, ATF-1, ATF-2, and NGFI-A. These interactions are crucial for the transcriptional activation of the VGF gene by NGF and Ras signaling pathways (D’Arcangelo1996Activation).

The VGF gene is rapidly induced by NGF through pathways involving protein kinase C and phosphoinositol hydrolysis, rather than the protein kinase A pathway. This induction is mediated by the binding of transcription factors to the VGF promoter elements, including CREB and other proteins related to the ATF/CREB and AP1 families (Luc1997Regulation; Salton1991Structure).

Additionally, the VGF promoter's V2 region is recognized by multiple proteins, including CREB, JunB, and JunD, which are involved in the NGF response. JunB binding to the V2C region is inducible by NGF, suggesting its role in mediating VGF promoter induction (Luc1997Regulation). These interactions highlight the complex regulation of VGF expression in response to growth factors.
