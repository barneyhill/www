# COLEC12

## Overview
COLEC12 is a gene that encodes the protein collectin subfamily member 12, which is a type of scavenger receptor involved in the innate immune system. This protein is part of the collectin family and is characterized by its ability to recognize and bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), facilitating the clearance of pathogens and apoptotic cells. Structurally, collectin-12 is composed of several domains, including a collagen-like region and a carbohydrate recognition domain, which contribute to its function in immune surveillance and complement activation (Cedzyński2023Collectins; Zhang2020Soluble). The protein is expressed in various cell types, such as endothelial and placental cells, and plays a significant role in mediating immune responses, including the activation of the complement system through both classical and alternative pathways (Cedzyński2023Collectins; Zhang2020Soluble). COLEC12's interactions with other proteins, such as properdin and caspase-3, further underscore its importance in immune regulation and potential implications in diseases, particularly those associated with Helicobacter pylori infection and neurodegenerative processes (Grabert2023Proteome; Chang2018Stromal).

## Structure
The COLEC12 protein, encoded by the COLEC12 gene located on chromosome 18, is a member of the collectin family and is characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of COLEC12 consists of 742 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 140 kDa (Cedzyński2023Collectins). The protein includes several distinct domains: a long coiled-coil fragment (223 amino acids), a collagen-like region (147 amino acids), a neck region (17 amino acids), and a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (126 amino acids) (Cedzyński2023Collectins). 

The secondary structure of COLEC12 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins with collagen-like and CRD regions. The tertiary structure is defined by the overall 3D conformation of these domains, contributing to its function as a scavenger receptor. COLEC12 forms lower oligomers, consisting of one to three subunits, indicating a quaternary structure that involves the assembly of multiple protein chains (Cedzyński2023Collectins).

The COLEC12 gene produces two major isoforms: a full-length version and another lacking the CRD, along with several other transcript variants (Cedzyński2023Collectins). Polymorphisms in the gene can affect the protein's structure and function, potentially altering its role in the immune system (Cedzyński2023Collectins).

## Function
Collectin-12 (COLEC12) is a protein involved in the innate immune system, functioning primarily as a pattern recognition receptor. It is expressed on various cell types, including endothelial cells, placental cells, gastric stromal cells, and phagocytes such as microglia and alveolar macrophages (Cedzyński2023Collectins; Zhang2020Soluble). COLEC12 plays a crucial role in immune surveillance by recognizing and binding to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), facilitating the clearance of pathogens and apoptotic cells (Cedzyński2023Collectins).

The protein is involved in complement activation through both the classical and alternative pathways. It interacts with C-reactive protein and C1q to activate the classical pathway and synergizes with properdin to enhance the alternative pathway, independent of C3, leading to the formation of the terminal membrane attack complex (Zhang2020Soluble). COLEC12 also mediates phagocytosis of bacteria and fungi, contributing to its role in innate immune defense (Zhang2020Soluble).

In microglial cells, COLEC12 is a substrate for caspase-3, which regulates its function in non-apoptotic processes, enhancing the phagocytosis of bacteria (Grabert2023Proteome). This suggests a role in modulating microglial activity and potentially influencing neurodegenerative processes (Grabert2023Proteome).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the COLEC12 gene, which encodes collectin-12, have been implicated in various gastric diseases, particularly those associated with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection. COLEC12 is involved in the immune response to Hp by mediating interactions between gastric stromal cells (GSCs) and dendritic cells (DCs), influencing the secretion of interleukin-23 (IL-23) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). These interactions are crucial for the inflammatory response and may contribute to the pathogenesis of gastric cancer and other Hp-associated inflammatory diseases (Chang2018Stromal).

In addition to its role in gastric diseases, COLEC12 has been studied for its involvement in the complement system. Soluble collectin-12 (sCL-12) can mediate C3-independent docking of properdin, which activates the alternative pathway of complement. This mechanism is significant in the immune response to certain fungal pathogens, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, and suggests that alterations in COLEC12 expression could impact immune responses and disease progression (Zhang2020Soluble).

While specific mutations in COLEC12 have been identified, their direct clinical significance in terms of disease association remains to be fully elucidated (Cedzyński2023Collectins).

## Interactions
COLEC12, also known as collectin subfamily member 12, participates in several protein interactions that are significant for its role in innate immunity. It interacts with properdin, a component of the complement system, to mediate the docking of properdin and activate the alternative pathway of complement independently of C3 deposition. This interaction is facilitated by COLEC12 binding to certain pathogens, such as Aspergillus strains, which enhances properdin binding and subsequent activation of the alternative pathway (Zhang2020Soluble).

In microglial cells, COLEC12 interacts with cleaved caspase-3 (CASP3), the activated form of CASP3. This interaction is observed under physiological conditions and is increased when CASP3-like activity is inhibited, suggesting that CASP3 cleaves COLEC12, releasing its soluble form. This soluble form may act as a decoy receptor, influencing microglial phagocytosis and bacterial uptake (Grabert2023Proteome).

COLEC12 also interacts with Helicobacter pylori in gastric stromal cells, where it plays a role in the immune response by mediating the effects of H. pylori and influencing cytokine production, such as IL-23, in dendritic cells (Chang2018Stromal).
