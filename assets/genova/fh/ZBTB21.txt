# ZBTB21

## Overview
ZBTB21 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 21 protein, which is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of gene expression. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger and BTB domains, which enable it to bind specific DNA sequences and influence cellular differentiation and development. ZBTB21 is particularly significant in neurodevelopmental processes and cardiac development, with implications in conditions such as Down syndrome and congenital heart defects (CHD) (AlNaama2020C2H2Type; Sailani2013The). The gene's expression and copy number variations have been linked to both neurological and cardiac manifestations, highlighting its role in these complex biological pathways (VenegasZamora2022New). Additionally, ZBTB21 is associated with the regulation of blood pressure, suggesting a broader impact on cardiovascular health (Tsai2024Exosomal).

## Function
ZBTB21 is a transcription factor characterized by zinc finger and BTB domains, which are involved in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. In healthy human cells, ZBTB21 plays a role in cell differentiation and development, influencing cellular functions and organismal outcomes. It is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes, as it is expressed in the brain cortex, particularly in models of Down syndrome, suggesting its involvement in neurological manifestations associated with this condition (AlNaama2020C2H2Type).

ZBTB21 is also associated with congenital heart defects (CHD) in Down syndrome, where a copy number variation within the ZBTB21 gene is linked to an increased risk of CHD, indicating its potential role in cardiac development (Sailani2013The). Additionally, ZBTB21 interacts with PPP2R2B, a regulator of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is necessary for cardiac differentiation of human embryonic stem cells, further suggesting its involvement in cardiac development processes (VenegasZamora2022New).

In the context of hypertension, ZBTB21 has been linked to blood pressure regulation, where its downregulation may reduce hypertension risk, although the specific molecular processes remain to be fully elucidated (Tsai2024Exosomal).

## Clinical Significance
ZBTB21, also known as ZNF295, is implicated in the pathogenesis of congenital heart defects (CHD) in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). Copy number variations (CNVs) within the ZBTB21 gene, particularly a 1.8-kb region affecting its final exon, have been associated with an increased risk of atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) in DS. Deletions in this region were found in 24% of DS-AVSD cases, suggesting a significant role in CHD development (Sailani2013The). The presence of CNV2 correlates with increased expression of ZBTB21, indicating that alterations in gene expression may contribute to the risk of CHD (Sailani2013The).

In mouse models, a genomic region including ZBTB21 has been identified as sufficient to cause CHD when present in three copies, highlighting the gene's dosage sensitivity (LanaElola2016Genetic). Additionally, ZBTB21's elevated expression in the brain cortex of the Tc1 mouse model of Down syndrome suggests its involvement in neurological manifestations associated with DS (AlNaama2020C2H2Type). These findings underscore the potential impact of ZBTB21 gene dosage and expression alterations on both cardiac and neurological conditions in Down syndrome.
