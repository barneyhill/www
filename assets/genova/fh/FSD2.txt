# FSD2

## Overview
The FSD2 gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III and SPRY domain containing 2, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III and SPRY domains, which suggest its role in protein-protein interactions and signal transduction pathways. Although the specific functions of FSD2 are not fully elucidated, proteins with similar domain structures are often implicated in cellular signaling and regulatory mechanisms. The FSD2 protein may play a role in developmental processes and cellular responses to environmental stimuli, although further research is needed to clarify its precise biological functions.
