# FAM114A1

## Overview
FAM114A1 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 114 member A1. This protein functions primarily as an adaptor involved in the recycling of Golgi enzymes, playing a crucial role in the transport of cargo within the Golgi apparatus, particularly in COPI-coated vesicles (Welch2024The). The protein is implicated in maintaining normal Golgi function by facilitating the recruitment of Golgi resident enzymes into vesicles, thereby ensuring the proper organization and levels of glycosylation enzymes (Welch2024The). In addition to its role in the Golgi apparatus, FAM114A1 is significantly expressed in cardiac fibroblasts, where it regulates Angiotensin II signaling, influencing fibroblast proliferation, activation, and migration (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1). The gene's interactions with proteins such as AGTRAP and Rab2A suggest its involvement in cardiac pathological remodeling and potential implications in cardiac conditions like fibrosis and heart failure (Subbaiah2022FAM114A1; Welch2024The).

## Function
The FAM114A1 gene encodes a protein that functions as an adaptor in the recycling of Golgi enzymes, playing a role in the transport of cargo within the Golgi apparatus, specifically in COPI-coated vesicles (Welch2024The). FAM114A1 is involved in maintaining normal Golgi function by binding to the tails of Golgi resident enzymes and recruiting them into vesicles essential for recycling membrane proteins within the Golgi stack (Welch2024The). This process helps maintain the levels and organization of glycosylation enzymes and other Golgi residents, although FAM114A1 appears to play a more minor role compared to other proteins like GOLPH3 (Welch2024The).

In cardiac fibroblasts, FAM114A1 is primarily expressed and plays a significant role in regulating Angiotensin II signaling, which is crucial for fibroblast proliferation, activation, and migration (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1). The gene interacts with AGTRAP, affecting the balance of AGTRAP and AT1R, which is important for maintaining normal cellular functions in cardiac fibroblasts (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1). FAM114A1's involvement in these processes suggests its role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and influencing cardiac function under stress conditions (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1).

## Clinical Significance
The FAM114A1 gene is implicated in several cardiac conditions, primarily through its role in cardiac fibrosis and heart failure. Alterations in FAM114A1 expression are associated with pathological cardiac remodeling, particularly in response to angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling. In failing human and mouse hearts, FAM114A1 expression is elevated, correlating with increased fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1; Subbaiah2022FAM114A1). The gene interacts with AGTRAP, influencing the expression of the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and enhancing Ang II signaling, which is a key driver of cardiac fibrosis (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1; Subbaiah2022FAM114A1).

Genetic studies have linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FAM114A1 locus with myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery disease (CAD), suggesting its role in cardiac pathogenesis (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1). In mouse models, deletion of FAM114A1 results in reduced cardiac fibrosis, inflammation, and improved cardiac function under stress conditions such as Ang II treatment and myocardial infarction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1; Subbaiah2022FAM114A1). These findings suggest that FAM114A1 could be a novel target for treating heart disease by modulating Ang II signaling and reducing cardiac fibrosis.

## Interactions
FAM114A1 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac pathological remodeling. One of its primary interactions is with AGTRAP (Angiotensin II type 1 receptor-associated protein). This interaction has been validated in cardiac fibroblasts and is crucial for regulating Angiotensin II (Ang II) signaling. FAM114A1 binds to AGTRAP, which is involved in the internalization and degradation of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). This interaction influences AT1R protein turnover and enhances Ang II signaling, contributing to cardiac fibrosis and remodeling (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1; Subbaiah2022FAM114A1).

FAM114A1 also interacts with Rab2A and Rab2B, proteins associated with the Golgi apparatus and intra-Golgi transport vesicles. These interactions suggest a role for FAM114A1 in the recycling of Golgi enzymes, although its binding to Golgi enzyme tails is not as strong or specific as that of its paralogue, FAM114A2 (Welch2024The).

The protein's interactions extend to other potential partners identified through yeast two-hybrid screening, including CMTM5, RAB2B, and SPG21, indicating a broader role in cellular processes (Subbaiah2021FAM114A1).
