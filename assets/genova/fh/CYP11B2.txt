# CYP11B2

## Overview
CYP11B2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily B member 2, commonly referred to as aldosterone synthase. This enzyme is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which is known for its role in catalyzing the oxidation of organic substances. Aldosterone synthase is specifically involved in the biosynthesis of aldosterone, a vital mineralocorticoid hormone that regulates sodium and potassium balance, as well as blood pressure. The enzyme is predominantly expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, where it facilitates the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone through a series of hydroxylation and oxidation reactions. The activity of CYP11B2 is tightly regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, ensuring that aldosterone production aligns with the body's physiological needs (Bureik2002The; Schiffer2015The). Mutations in the CYP11B2 gene can lead to disorders such as congenital aldosterone synthase deficiency and corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency, underscoring its clinical significance in maintaining electrolyte homeostasis and blood pressure (Hui2014The; Turan2021Clinical).

## Structure
The CYP11B2 protein, also known as aldosterone synthase, is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily involved in steroid biosynthesis. The primary structure of CYP11B2 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Bureik2002The). The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Bureik2002The). 

CYP11B2 contains a heme-binding domain essential for its function, as the heme group plays a critical role in the enzyme's catalytic activity (Bureik2002The). The active site of CYP11B2 is predicted to be smaller than that of its isoform CYP11B1, with specific residues such as amino acids 301, 302, and 320 being significant for enzyme function (Bureik2002The). 

The protein's structure is also influenced by post-translational modifications, which may include phosphorylation and glycosylation, affecting its activity and stability (Merakou2020Molecular). The structural data of CYP11B2, including its complexes with inhibitors, are crucial for designing selective inhibitors targeting this enzyme (Bernhardt2016The).

## Function
The CYP11B2 gene encodes the enzyme aldosterone synthase, which is crucial for the biosynthesis of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid hormone that regulates salt and water balance in the body. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, where it catalyzes the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) to aldosterone through a series of hydroxylation and oxidation reactions. These reactions include the 11β-hydroxylation of DOC to corticosterone, followed by 18-hydroxylation to 18-hydroxycorticosterone, and finally oxidation to aldosterone (Bureik2002The; Schiffer2015The).

CYP11B2's activity is essential for maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure homeostasis in healthy human cells. The enzyme's function is characterized by its 18-hydroxylase and 18-oxidase activities, which are necessary for aldosterone production (Bureik2002The). The regulation of CYP11B2 expression is influenced by the renin-angiotensin system, with angiotensin II being a principal regulator. This regulation ensures that aldosterone synthesis meets the physiological demands of the body (Schiffer2015The). The enzyme's activity is tightly controlled to maintain proper adrenal function and hormone balance, which is critical for blood pressure regulation and fluid balance (Schiffer2015The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CYP11B2 gene are associated with several disorders related to aldosterone synthesis. Congenital aldosterone synthase deficiency (ASD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in CYP11B2, leading to impaired aldosterone production. This condition manifests in infancy with symptoms such as severe hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, dehydration, and failure to thrive (Miao2019Analysis; Hui2014The). ASD is classified into two types based on enzyme activity: Type 1, where CYP11B2 activity is completely abolished, and Type 2, characterized by decreased 18-hydroxylase and 18-oxidase activities (Hui2014The).

Corticosterone methyloxidase deficiency type 2 (CMOD type 2) is another condition linked to CYP11B2 mutations. It presents with symptoms like salt loss, vomiting, and severe dehydration in early childhood. This disorder is characterized by low aldosterone levels despite high 18-hydroxycorticosterone levels (Turan2021Clinical; Pascoe1992Mutations).

Alterations in CYP11B2 expression or function can also contribute to primary aldosteronism, a condition marked by hypertension and hypokalemia. This highlights the gene's critical role in maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure regulation (Miao2019Analysis).

## Interactions
CYP11B2, also known as aldosterone synthase, is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions essential for its function in steroidogenesis. One of the primary interactions is with adrenodoxin (Adx), a redox partner that facilitates electron transfer necessary for the enzyme's catalytic activity. This interaction is crucial for the conversion of substrates in the biosynthesis of aldosterone (Child2020Functional; Peng2017Molecular). The binding of Adx to CYP11B2 is characterized by electrostatic interactions, with specific lysine residues on CYP11B2 forming salt bridges with aspartate residues on Adx (Peng2017Molecular).

The interaction between CYP11B2 and Adx is modulated by the presence of steroid substrates, which can decrease the stability of the CYP11B2-Adx complex by increasing the dissociation rate (Yablokov2021Substrateinduced; Yablokov2020Substrateinduced). This modulation suggests that substrate binding can influence the electron transfer efficiency and, consequently, the enzyme's activity.

CYP11B2 also interacts with adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), which, along with Adx, forms part of the electron transport chain that supports CYP11B2's enzymatic function (Child2020Functional). These interactions are essential for the proper functioning of CYP11B2 in the mitochondrial environment of adrenal gland cells.
