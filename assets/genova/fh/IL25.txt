# IL25

## Overview
Interleukin 25 (IL25) is a gene that encodes the cytokine protein interleukin 25, also known as IL-17E, which is a member of the IL-17 cytokine family. This protein is characterized by a cysteine-knot structural motif and is primarily involved in promoting type 2 immune responses. IL-25 is secreted as a non-covalent homodimer and interacts with a receptor complex composed of IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and IL-17 receptor B (IL-17RB) to initiate signaling pathways that are crucial for immune regulation. The protein plays a significant role in defense against parasitic infections and is implicated in allergic inflammation, as well as in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis and blood-brain barrier integrity. Alterations in IL25 expression have been associated with various inflammatory, autoimmune, and cancerous conditions, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yuan2023New; Gowhari2021Interleukin‐25:; Sonobe2009Interleukin25).

## Structure
The IL25 gene encodes a protein that is part of the IL-17 cytokine family, characterized by a cysteine-knot structural motif with three disulfide bridges, which is common among cytokines involved in tumor development, invasion, and metastasis (Gowhari2021Interleukin‐25:). The human IL-25 protein is 177 amino acids long, with the first 32 amino acids serving as a signal peptide (Gowhari2021Interleukin‐25:). There are two isoforms of IL-25 mRNA due to alternative splicing: subtype 1 is the complete form, while subtype 2 encodes a protein with 161 amino acids, sharing the same carboxy-terminal end composed of 159 amino acids (Liu2018Biological).

The IL-25 protein has a conserved cysteine sequence and a potential N-glycosylation site, with 10 cysteine residues in humans (Liu2018Biological). The protein forms homodimers and contains a cysteine knot-like structure, similar to other IL-17 family members (Barlow2009IL‐25:). The IL-25 protein's tertiary structure is characterized by this cysteine knot fold, which is a motif common among several growth factors (Saadoun2011Interleukin25:). The protein is secreted as a non-covalent homodimer (Saadoun2011Interleukin25:).

## Function
Interleukin 25 (IL-25), also known as IL-17E, is a cytokine that plays a significant role in promoting type 2 immune responses. It is primarily produced by epithelial cells and Th2 cells, acting as an alarm signal upon cell injury or tissue damage. IL-25 interacts with its receptors, IL-17RA and IL-17RB, to initiate and maintain type 2 immunity, which is crucial for defense against parasitic infections and is implicated in allergic inflammation (Yuan2023New).

IL-25 is involved in the regulation of various immune cells, including macrophages and mast cells, through different signaling pathways. It induces the production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 from a specific population of non-B/non-T (NBNT) cells, which are essential for the expulsion of helminths like Nippostrongylus brasiliensis in mice (Fallon2006Identification). IL-25 also plays a role in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis by limiting the expansion of Th17 cells through the inhibition of IL-23 expression, which is influenced by commensal bacteria (Zaph2008Commensaldependent).

In the central nervous system, IL-25 is expressed by brain capillary endothelial cells and helps maintain blood-brain barrier integrity by up-regulating tight junction proteins through a protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε)-dependent pathway, protecting against inflammatory damage (Sonobe2009Interleukin25).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IL25 gene, which encodes interleukin 25, have been implicated in a variety of diseases. Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and asthma are associated with increased IL-25 expression. In atopic dermatitis, IL-25 disrupts skin barrier function and promotes inflammation, particularly in response to allergens like house dust mites (Yuan2023New; Borowczyk2021IL25). Psoriasis patients exhibit elevated IL-25 levels, and specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL25 gene correlate with disease severity (Borowczyk2021IL25).

In cancer, IL-25 expression is linked to poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly in cases driven by APC mutations. The IL-25-ILC2 axis creates a tumor-permissive microenvironment, supporting tumorigenesis and reducing anti-tumor immunity (Jou2022An). Conversely, IL-25 is downregulated in certain cancers like malignant breast and prostate cancers, where it may have protective roles (Yuan2023New).

IL-25 also plays a role in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, where it is involved in disease progression and modulation of immune responses (Yuan2023New). These findings suggest IL-25 as a potential therapeutic target in various conditions.

## Interactions
Interleukin 25 (IL-25) interacts with a receptor complex composed of IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and IL-17 receptor B (IL-17RB) to initiate signaling pathways. IL-25 binds to this heterodimeric receptor, which recruits SEFIR domain-containing proteins such as Act1 (NF-κB Activator 1) to propagate downstream signaling. Act1 is crucial for the activation of the NF-κB pathway and interacts directly with IL-17RB through its SEFIR domain. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of TRAF6, a key player in IL-25-mediated NF-κB activation (Yuan2023New; Deng2021Roles).

IL-25 also engages in interactions that lead to the activation of other signaling pathways, such as MAPK and JAK/STAT. Act1 recruits TRAF4, which in turn recruits the E3 ligase SMURF2 to degrade DAZAP2, an inhibitory factor of IL-25R, facilitating JAK2-mediated phosphorylation and STAT5 recruitment (Yuan2023New). Additionally, IL-25 can recruit TRADD and FADD, leading to caspase activation and apoptosis (Yuan2023New).

In the context of allergic airway inflammation, IL-25 interacts with CD11c+ macrophage-like cells in the lung, inducing Th2-type cytokines through its receptor complex, with Act1 being essential for this signaling (Claudio2009The).
