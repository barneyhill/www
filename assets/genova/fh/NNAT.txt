# NNAT

## Overview
Neuronatin (NNAT) is a gene that encodes a small, amphipathic proteolipid protein known as neuronatin, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the nervous system and pancreatic β cells. The NNAT gene is characterized by its alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms, α and β, which differ in their amino acid composition and functional roles (Pitale2016Neuronatin; Vrang2010The). Neuronatin is primarily localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a crucial role in insulin maturation by interacting with the signal peptidase complex, thereby facilitating the processing and secretion of insulin (Millership2018Neuronatin). Additionally, neuronatin is implicated in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, potentially acting as a regulatory subunit of ion channels due to its structural homology with other proteolipids (Dou1996Cloning). The gene's expression and function are significant in the context of metabolic and neuropsychological disorders, including diabetes, obesity, and anorexia nervosa, highlighting its importance in both metabolic regulation and neural development (Azmi2023Understanding; Millership2018Neuronatina).

## Structure
The neuronatin (NNAT) protein is a small proteolipid encoded by the NNAT gene, characterized by its amphipathic nature with distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. The primary structure of NNAT includes two isoforms, α and β, resulting from alternative splicing. The α isoform consists of 81 amino acids, while the β isoform comprises 54 amino acids (Pitale2016Neuronatin; Vrang2010The). The hydrophobic N-terminal domain, encoded by exon 1, forms a transmembrane alpha-helix, suggesting its role as a membrane protein (Pitale2016Neuronatin; Dou1996Cloning). The C-terminal domain is hydrophilic and basic, containing a significant proportion of arginine residues, which contributes to its amphipathic nature (Dou1996Cloning).

NNAT shares structural homology with other proteolipids like PMP1 and phospholamban, which are subunits of cation-translocating ATPases, indicating a potential regulatory role in ion channels (Dou1996Cloning). The protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in neurons, where it is involved in processes such as insulin maturation in pancreatic β cells (Millership2018Neuronatin). The NNAT protein is not secreted and is primarily found in the cytoplasm (Vrang2010The).

## Function
Neuronatin (NNAT) is a gene that encodes a proteolipid involved in several critical cellular and molecular processes. In pancreatic β cells, NNAT plays a significant role in insulin content and secretion. It enhances the activity of the signal peptidase complex (SPC), which is crucial for the cleavage of preproinsulin, a precursor to insulin. This process is essential for the maturation, storage, and secretion of insulin, particularly under high-glucose conditions (Millership2018Neuronatina). NNAT is located on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with components of the SPC to facilitate the translocation of nascent proinsulin into the ER, ensuring efficient processing and secretion of insulin (Millership2018Neuronatina).

NNAT is also expressed in the developing human brain, where it is involved in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. It is suggested to function as a regulatory subunit of ion channels, given its homology to other proteolipids like PMP1 and phospholamban, which are involved in modulating ion channel activity (Dou1996Cloning). This implies a role in ion transport or signaling in neurons, potentially influencing neuronal growth and metabolism (Dou1996Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the NNAT (neuronatin) gene have been linked to several metabolic and neuropsychological disorders. In the context of diabetes, NNAT plays a crucial role in insulin maturation and secretion. Mutations affecting the preproinsulin signal peptidase cleavage can lead to reduced insulin secretion and β cell apoptosis, contributing to conditions like mutant insulin gene-induced diabetes of youth (MIDY) (Millership2018Neuronatin). NNAT deficiency in mice has been shown to impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cause glucose intolerance, highlighting its importance in maintaining glucose homeostasis (Millership2018Neuronatin).

In terms of obesity, NNAT expression is downregulated in obese children, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the NNAT locus are associated with extreme childhood obesity (Millership2018Neuronatina). NNAT-deficient mice exhibit reduced fat pad mass and are prone to obesity, especially when aged or on a high-fat diet (Millership2018Neuronatina).

NNAT is also implicated in anorexia nervosa (AN). Structural modifications at the post-translational acetylation site of NNAT can affect protein stability and drug interactions, potentially influencing the development of AN (Azmi2023Understanding). Variants in the NNAT gene have been associated with AN, with specific mutations affecting protein function and drug binding (Azmi2022In). These findings underscore the gene's role in both metabolic and neuropsychological disorders.

## Interactions
Neuronatin (NNAT) is known to participate in several protein interactions that influence its functional roles. NNAT interacts with the signal peptidase complex (SPC) in pancreatic β cells, which is crucial for the cleavage of preproinsulin, a precursor to insulin. This interaction is essential for the proper processing and secretion of insulin, highlighting NNAT's role in insulin maturation and release (Millership2018Neuronatin).

In the context of neural differentiation, NNAT interacts with the SERCA2 protein, a key component in calcium regulation. NNAT antagonizes SERCA2, leading to increased intracellular calcium levels, which is important for neural induction in embryonic stem cells (Lin2010Neuronatin). This interaction underscores NNAT's role in modulating calcium signaling pathways critical for neural lineage specification.

NNAT also interacts with miR-339-5p, a microRNA that regulates its expression. This interaction is significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, as alterations in miR-339-5p levels can affect NNAT protein levels, impacting neuronal calcium homeostasis and potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis (Zou2023Aberrant). These interactions illustrate NNAT's involvement in diverse cellular processes through its protein and nucleic acid interactions.
