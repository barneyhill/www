# UBE2E3

## Overview
UBE2E3 is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E3, a critical component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This enzyme is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of proteins through ubiquitination. The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E3 is involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, and autophagy, by partnering with E3 ligases to transfer ubiquitin to target substrates. The enzyme's activity is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is implicated in cellular senescence and cancer progression. UBE2E3's interactions with multiple E3 ligases underscore its importance in the ubiquitination network, influencing protein stability and function (Plafker2018Loss; van2009A).

## Structure
UBE2E3 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme characterized by a conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes a catalytic cysteine at position 145, crucial for the enzyme's function (Debonneville2004Participation). The UBC domain is responsible for mediating interactions with E3 ligases, such as Nedd4-2, and plays a significant role in the ubiquitination process (Debonneville2004Participation).

The protein also features an N-terminal intrinsically disordered (ID) extension, which, despite lacking a defined structure, is believed to extend the functionality of the enzyme (Uversky2013The). This ID region is not merely a flexible protrusion but is thought to have evolved to serve specific functions, potentially influencing the enzyme's interactions and activity (Uversky2013The).

UBE2E3 is highly conserved across species, with minimal amino acid differences between orthologues, such as those in Xenopus laevis and mammals (Debonneville2004Participation). The protein exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which may affect its function and interactions, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. Common post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may also occur, influencing the protein's activity and interactions.

## Function
UBE2E3 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is crucial for protein degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, UBE2E3 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, mitochondrial function, and autophagy. It partners with multiple E3 ligases to conjugate ubiquitin onto substrates, influencing their stability and function (Plafker2018Loss).

UBE2E3 is essential for cell proliferation, as its knockdown leads to increased levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1, resulting in cell cycle exit and cellular senescence (Plafker2018Loss). It also plays a role in regulating the p53 pathway, as depletion of UBE2E3 increases nuclear p53 levels and its transcriptional activity, which is associated with cellular senescence (Plafker2018Loss).

In the context of autophagy, UBE2E3 is involved in maintaining autophagic balance by regulating autophagic flux. Its depletion leads to increased basal autophagic activity, suggesting a role in preventing the accumulation of autophagic vesicles under normal conditions (Plafker2018Loss). UBE2E3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes critical for maintaining cellular health (Plafker2018Loss).

## Clinical Significance
UBE2E3 has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in cellular senescence and cancer progression. In cellular senescence, depletion of UBE2E3 induces a senescence phenotype characterized by increased mitochondrial and lysosomal mass, and elevated autophagic flux, without causing overt DNA damage. This senescence can be partially suppressed by co-depletion of p53, p21 CIP1/WAF1, or p16 INK4a, indicating its involvement in the p53 pathway (Plafker2018Loss). UBE2E3 depletion also leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to apoptosis, highlighting its role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis (Plafker2018Loss).

In cancer, UBE2E3 is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells, where it promotes cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and enhances cell migration and invasion. This overexpression is positively correlated with the long non-coding RNA SChLAP1, suggesting a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in prostate cancer (Jiang2022Functions). UBE2E3 is also involved in the ubiquitination process related to TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although its direct clinical significance in neurodegenerative diseases is not fully detailed (Maurel2018Causative). Additionally, miR-143-3p targets UBE2E3 in ovarian granulosa cells, promoting senescence and inhibiting proliferation, which may contribute to ovarian aging (Deng2023miR1433p).

## Interactions
UBE2E3, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, is involved in various protein interactions within the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It interacts with multiple E3 ligases, forming a critical part of the ubiquitination network. UBE2E3 is known for its high connectivity with E3 ligases, which is essential for maintaining the robustness of the ubiquitination system (van2009A). It interacts with E3 ligases such as RNF25, where a specialized helix in RNF25 binds to the UBC backside of UBE2E3, promoting processivity by forcing UBE2E3~Ub into a close-state, thereby enhancing the reactivity of the complex (Gundogdu2019Structural).

UBE2E3 also interacts with the E3 ligase RNF167, where it colocalizes in cytoplasmic vesicle-like structures near the endolysosomal compartment, suggesting a biologically relevant interaction within the cell (Ghilarducci2021Functional). Additionally, UBE2E3 has been shown to be active with several E3 ligases, including MuRF1, MuRF2, and MuRF3, although its activity with Hdm2 was weak (Marblestone2013Comprehensive). These interactions highlight UBE2E3's role in the ubiquitination process, influencing protein degradation and cellular homeostasis.
