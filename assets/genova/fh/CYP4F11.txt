# CYP4F11

## Overview
CYP4F11 is a gene that encodes the enzyme cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily F member 11, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily involved in the metabolism of drugs and eicosanoids, playing a crucial role in the oxidative metabolism of various substrates, including therapeutic drugs and endogenous compounds. CYP4F11 is expressed in multiple human tissues, such as the liver, kidney, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, where it contributes to drug metabolism and the catabolism of vitamin K (Kalsotra2006Cytochrome; KALSOTRA2004Expression). The enzyme's structure features a large substrate access channel, allowing it to accommodate larger and more polar substrates, which influences its substrate specificity and catalytic properties (KALSOTRA2004Expression). Additionally, CYP4F11 is involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism, highlighting its significance in maintaining physiological homeostasis (Jarrar2019Molecular).

## Structure
The CYP4F11 protein is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which is involved in the metabolism of drugs and eicosanoids. The primary structure of CYP4F11 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the basis for its functional conformation. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of CYP4F11 involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, forming a heme-binding domain essential for its enzymatic activity (KALSOTRA2004Expression).

CYP4F11 has a large substrate access channel, which is more open compared to other cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP4F3A. This structural feature allows CYP4F11 to accommodate larger and more polar substrates, influencing its substrate specificity and catalytic properties (KALSOTRA2004Expression). The FG loop region of CYP4F11 is more polar and contains additional charged residues, which may affect substrate binding and catalysis (KALSOTRA2004Expression).

Post-translational modifications of CYP4F11 include conjugation with 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which can impair its enzymatic function by altering substrate binding and activity (Skorokhod2023Posttranslational). These modifications occur at specific amino acid residues, such as cysteine, histidine, and lysine, located in exposed regions of the enzyme (Skorokhod2023Posttranslational).

## Function
CYP4F11 is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, primarily involved in the metabolism of therapeutic drugs and eicosanoids. It is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, kidney, heart, brain, and skeletal muscle (Kalsotra2006Cytochrome; KALSOTRA2004Expression). In healthy human cells, CYP4F11 plays a significant role in drug metabolism, particularly through N/O-demethylation of several drugs such as erythromycin, benzphetamine, and imipramine (KALSOTRA2004Expression; Zhang2017Effect). 

CYP4F11 also contributes to the catabolism of vitamin K by catalyzing the ω-hydroxylation of menaquinone-4 (MK4), a crucial step in vitamin K metabolism, which is important for maintaining homeostasis and physiological functions like blood coagulation and bone health (Edson2013Cytochrome). The enzyme's activity in the endoplasmic reticulum is associated with the regulation of inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism (Jarrar2019Molecular). 

Structurally, CYP4F11 has a more open substrate access channel compared to other CYP4F enzymes, allowing it to accommodate larger and more polar substrates, which may explain its broader specificity for drug metabolism (KALSOTRA2004Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CYP4F11 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP4F11 have been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in Mexican women, low-dose aspirin-associated small intestine bleeding in Japanese patients, and warfarin sensitivity in American Indian and Alaskan native populations (Yi2017Functional). The D315N variant of CYP4F11 significantly decreases the enzyme's activity in erythromycin metabolism and 20-HETE synthesis, which could impact cardiovascular health and drug response (Yi2017Functional).

CYP4F11 is also involved in the metabolism of vitamin K, functioning as a vitamin K ω-hydroxylase. Although CYP4F11's role in vitamin K metabolism is less dominant compared to CYP4F2, it may become more significant in individuals with certain genetic variants, such as CYP4F2*3 homozygotes (Edson2013Cytochrome). Variants in CYP4F11, such as rs1060467, have been associated with decreased warfarin dose requirements, highlighting its role in drug metabolism and response (Zhang2017Effect; Fohner2015Variation). These genetic variations can influence the efficacy and safety of warfarin therapy, necessitating personalized dosing strategies in affected individuals.

## Interactions
CYP4F11, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, is involved in various metabolic processes, including the metabolism of fatty acids and drugs. The enzyme interacts with NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) to facilitate its enzymatic activity. This interaction is crucial for the metabolism of arachidonic acid to produce 20-HETE, a lipid mediator involved in cell proliferation and migration (Jia2023Deciphering).

CYP4F11 also interacts with the inhibitor HET0016, a pan inhibitor of CYP4A/F isoforms. HET0016 binds tightly to the heme iron of CYP4F11, causing a type II spectral shift, which is typical for nitrogen-containing compounds. This interaction stabilizes the heme position through hydrogen bonds with specific amino acids, such as Glu-328 and Thr-332, and hydrophobic interactions with Phe-327 (Jia2023Deciphering).

While the context does not provide detailed information on physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, the involvement of CYP4F11 in complex metabolic pathways suggests potential interactions with other components of these pathways. Further studies are needed to elucidate these interactions and their implications for CYP4F11's role in metabolism and disease.
