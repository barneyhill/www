# PAM16

## Overview
PAM16, also known as presequence translocase associated motor 16, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial protein integral to the import of preproteins into the mitochondrial matrix. The protein, also referred to as PAM16, is a peripheral inner-membrane protein that forms a crucial component of the TIM23 translocase complex, facilitating the ATP-dependent translocation of precursor proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Frazier2004Pam16; Kozany2004The). Structurally, PAM16 features a J-like domain, which, despite lacking the canonical HPD motif, allows it to form a heterodimer with Pam18, another component of the mitochondrial import motor (D’Silva2008Interaction; Kozany2004The). This interaction is essential for the formation of a stable mtHsp70-Tim44 complex, which drives the import of preproteins into the mitochondrial matrix (Frazier2004Pam16). Mutations in the PAM16 gene have been linked to severe skeletal dysplasia, underscoring its critical role in mitochondrial function and cellular health (Mehawej2014The).

## Structure
PAM16, also known as presequence translocase associated motor 16, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. The primary structure of PAM16 consists of 149 amino acid residues and is conserved across various eukaryotes, with amino acid identities ranging from 27-39% and similarities from 62-69% (Frazier2004Pam16). The protein features a J-like domain, which is structurally similar to J-domain proteins but lacks the canonical HPD motif typical of ATPase-stimulating DnaJ-like proteins (Kozany2004The). This domain is involved in forming a heterodimer with Pam18, another component of the mitochondrial import motor (D’Silva2008Interaction).

PAM16 is predicted to have three α-helical segments, which are typical of J-domain proteins, contributing to its secondary structure (Kozany2004The). The protein is a peripheral inner-membrane protein, indicating its association with the mitochondrial inner membrane without spanning it (Frazier2004Pam16). In terms of quaternary structure, PAM16 forms a stable heterodimer with Pam18, which is essential for its function in the mitochondrial import motor (D’Silva2005Role; Iosefson2007The). The interaction between PAM16 and Pam18 is mediated by their J- and J-like domains, forming a pseudosymmetrical arrangement (D’Silva2008Interaction).

## Function
PAM16, also known as presequence translocase associated motor 16, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a critical role in the import of preproteins into the mitochondrial matrix. It is a component of the TIM23 translocase complex, which is essential for the translocation of precursor proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane in an ATP-dependent manner (Kozany2004The). PAM16 forms a stable subcomplex with Pam18, a J-domain protein, and is crucial for the association of Pam18 with the TIM23 translocase (Kozany2004The). This interaction is vital for the formation of a stable mtHsp70-Tim44 complex, which drives the import of preproteins into the mitochondrial matrix (Frazier2004Pam16).

PAM16 acts as a negative regulator of Pam18, preventing the 'idling' of the import motor and ensuring efficient protein translocation (Kozany2004The). Although PAM16 is structurally similar to J-domain proteins, it lacks the canonical HPD motif and does not stimulate the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 like true J proteins (Frazier2004Pam16). The protein is conserved across eukaryotes, indicating its fundamental role in mitochondrial protein import and cellular health (Frazier2004Pam16).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PAM16 gene, also known as MAGMAS, have been linked to severe skeletal dysplasia, a condition characterized by significant skeletal abnormalities, including platyspondyly, short ribs, and delayed epiphyseal ossification. This condition is particularly severe, leading to early lethal spondylodysplastic dysplasia in affected individuals. The specific mutation identified, p.Asn76Asp, results in protein instability and defects in mitochondrial protein import, which are critical for cell viability and growth (Mehawej2014The).

The mutation in PAM16 also affects mitochondrial morphology and is associated with unusual mitochondrial and peroxisomal biogenesis, leading to fragmented mitochondria and enhanced pexophagy. These cellular defects contribute to the pathology observed in skeletal dysplasia (Mehawej2014The).

In yeast models, the mutation exhibits a temperature-sensitive phenotype, correlating with the recessive inheritance pattern of the dysplasia. This suggests that the mutation's impact on mitochondrial function is significant enough to cause developmental disorders in humans (Mehawej2014The). The study of PAM16 mutations provides insight into the gene's critical role in skeletal development and its potential involvement in other mitochondrial-related disorders.

## Interactions
PAM16, also known as presequence translocase-associated motor 16, is a mitochondrial protein that plays a crucial role in the mitochondrial protein import motor. It interacts with Pam18 to form a heterodimer, which is essential for the function of the mitochondrial import motor. This interaction is characterized by a preference for heterodimer formation over homodimer formation, as demonstrated by size-exclusion chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (D’Silva2005Role). The J and J-like domains of PAM16 and Pam18 are sufficient for this heterodimer formation, although PAM16 does not stimulate ATPase activity like Pam18 due to its degenerate J domain (D’Silva2005Role).

PAM16 is also associated with the TIM23 complex, a component of the mitochondrial translocon, and is crucial for the formation of a stable complex between mtHsp70 and Tim44. This interaction is necessary for the efficient import-driving activity of the mtHsp70 motor at the protein import channel (Frazier2004Pam16). The N terminus of PAM16 plays a direct role in its association with the translocon and an indirect role in Pam18's association, highlighting its importance in maintaining functional interactions within the mitochondrial import machinery (D’Silva2008Interaction).
