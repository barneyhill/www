# C1QL3

## Overview
C1QL3 is a gene that encodes the protein complement C1q like 3, which is a member of the C1q/TNF superfamily. This protein is characterized by its trimeric quaternary structure and is involved in various biological processes, including synapse organization and energy metabolism. The C1QL3 protein contains a collagen-like region and a C-terminal globular C1q domain, which are essential for its structural integrity and function (Ressl2015Structures; Sticco2020C1QL3). It plays a critical role in forming cell-cell adhesion complexes by interacting with other proteins such as ADGRB3 and neuronal pentraxins, which are vital for synaptic adhesion and communication (Sticco2020C1QL3). Additionally, C1QL3 is implicated in the regulation of insulin secretion, influencing metabolic pathways and potentially contributing to conditions like type 2 diabetes and neurological disorders (Martinelli2016Expression; Gupta2018Complement).

## Structure
C1QL3 is a protein that belongs to the C1q/TNF superfamily and is characterized by a trimeric quaternary structure. Each subunit of C1QL3 contains a collagen-like region and a C-terminal globular C1q domain, which is a hallmark of the C1q family (Ressl2015Structures; Sticco2020C1QL3). The globular C1q domain exhibits a jelly-roll architecture composed of ten beta strands, forming a trimeric quaternary structure typical of the superfamily (Ressl2015Structures).

C1QL3 forms higher-order oligomers, including an 18-mer oligomer, which is a ring-like arrangement of six C1QL3 trimers (Ressl2015Structures). The protein has conserved Ca2+ binding sites along the trimeric symmetry axis and on the surface, which contribute to its stability and potential interactions with other proteins (Ressl2015Structures).

The electrostatic surface of C1QL3 is highly negatively charged, which may influence its binding properties and interactions with other proteins, such as ADGRB3 and neuronal pentraxins (Ressl2015Structures; Sticco2020C1QL3). C1QL3 is secreted and not membrane-bound, and it may undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation (Sticco2020C1QL3).

## Function
The C1QL3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the C1q super-family, which plays a significant role in synapse organization and function. C1QL3 is involved in forming a novel cell-cell adhesion complex by interacting with ADGRB3 and neuronal pentraxins NPTX1 and NPTXR. This complex is crucial for synaptic adhesion and communication between neurons, influencing synapse formation, maintenance, and potentially synapse density (Sticco2020C1QL3). C1QL3 is expressed in excitatory neurons and is thought to be secreted presynaptically, forming a complex that binds to postsynaptic ADGRB3 (Sticco2020C1QL3).

In addition to its role in the nervous system, C1QL3 is involved in energy metabolism, glucose uptake, and insulin secretion. It inhibits insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells by interacting with the cell adhesion G protein-coupled receptor BAI3, specifically affecting the cAMP-mediated signaling pathway. This inhibition is significant in the context of insulin secretion potentiated by agents like exendin-4 and is independent of glucose concentration (Gupta2018Complement). The protein's structure, including its gC1q domain, allows it to form trimers and multimeric assemblies, essential for its function in synaptic organization (Sticco2020C1QL3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the C1QL3 gene or its interactions have been linked to several clinical conditions. C1QL3 is involved in the regulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, and its increased expression is associated with reduced insulin secretion, particularly in the context of obesity. This reduction in insulin secretion is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), as C1QL3 negatively regulates the cAMP signaling pathway crucial for insulin release (Gupta2018Complement; Koltes2019A). The interaction of C1QL3 with the BAI3 receptor further inhibits insulin secretion, contributing to β-cell dysfunction and T2D susceptibility (Gupta2018Complement).

In the nervous system, C1QL3 plays a role in synapse formation and maintenance. Alterations in C1QL3 expression can lead to synaptic dysfunction, which is implicated in neurological disorders. C1QL3 knockout mice exhibit reduced excitatory synapse density and behavioral abnormalities, including impairments in fear memory and reward processing, suggesting its involvement in conditions like autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia (Martinelli2016Expression). The gene's role in synaptic connectivity highlights its potential impact on neurological and psychiatric conditions characterized by synaptic dysfunction (Martinelli2016Expression).

## Interactions
C1QL3, a member of the C1q super-family, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for synaptic organization and cell-cell adhesion. It binds to the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor B3 (ADGRB3), forming a novel cell-cell adhesion complex that includes neuronal pentraxins NPTX1 and NPTXR. These proteins are co-expressed in excitatory neurons, suggesting the formation of a presynaptic complex that interacts with postsynaptic ADGRB3, creating a trans-synaptic adhesion complex (Sticco2020C1QL3).

C1QL3 has a higher affinity for NPTX1 compared to NPTXR, indicating NPTX1 as its preferred binding partner. This interaction is facilitated by the 'extended CUB' domain in ADGRB3, which is necessary for binding C1QL3. The presence of C1QL3 enhances cell-cell adhesion by forming a complex with ADGRB3 and NPTX1/R, significantly increasing cell aggregates (Sticco2020C1QL3).

C1QL3 can also form a heteromeric complex with C1QL2 and interacts with the kainate receptor GRIK2, although these interactions are less prevalent. The gC1q domain of C1QL3 is sufficient for binding NPTX1, and C1QL3 can appear as a hexamer, dodecamer, and octadecamer, suggesting a multifarious stoichiometry in its complexes (Sticco2020C1QL3).
