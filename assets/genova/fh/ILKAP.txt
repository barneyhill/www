# ILKAP

## Overview
ILKAP (Integrin-Linked Kinase Associated Phosphatase) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine phosphatase, which is a member of the PP2C family. The protein product of ILKAP plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those involving integrin-linked kinase (ILK). It is instrumental in regulating various cellular processes such as cell adhesion, growth factor signaling, and cell cycle progression. By modulating the activity of ILK, ILKAP influences the phosphorylation state of key proteins like GSK3b, thereby impacting cell cycle dynamics and maintaining cellular homeostasis. The protein's ability to regulate ILK's subcellular localization and its interactions with other proteins involved in DNA repair and cell survival underscores its importance in preventing oncogenic transformation and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Hausmann2015ILKAP; Nakrieko2008Modulation; Kumar2004ILKAP).

## Function
ILKAP (ILK associated serine/threonine phosphatase) is a protein phosphatase that plays a crucial role in regulating integrin-linked kinase (ILK) signaling pathways in human cells. It is a member of the PP2C family of serine/threonine phosphatases and is involved in various cellular functions, including cell adhesion, growth factor signaling, and cell cycle regulation (Kumar2004ILKAP).

ILKAP selectively associates with ILK to modulate its activity, particularly affecting the phosphorylation of GSK3b at S9, which is important for cell cycle progression. This interaction leads to the nuclear export and proteolysis of cyclin D1, thereby inhibiting entry into the S phase and increasing the proportion of cells in the G1 phase (Kumar2004ILKAP). ILKAP's activity is crucial for maintaining proper cell cycle regulation and preventing excessive ILK signaling, which could lead to tumor progression (Kumar2004ILKAP).

ILKAP also influences the subcellular localization of ILK, promoting its nuclear export in a CRM1-dependent manner. This regulation is significant for processes like DNA synthesis and nuclear integrity maintenance, impacting keratinocyte proliferation (Nakrieko2008Modulation). ILKAP's role in these molecular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oncogenic transformation.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in ILKAP expression or its interactions have been implicated in various cancers. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ILKAP plays a crucial role in DNA repair and radioresistance. Knockdown of ILKAP in p53-wildtype GBM cells leads to increased radiosensitivity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy (Hausmann2015ILKAP). 

In ovarian cancer, ILKAP is involved in the regulation of cell susceptibility to platinum-based chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin. ILKAP expression is modulated by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which sensitizes cells to cisplatin. Conversely, ILKAP silencing protects cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis, indicating its role in mediating drug sensitivity (Lorenzato2016The).

In gastric cancer, the MAEL protein promotes the degradation of ILKAP, leading to increased phosphorylation of oncogenic kinases such as RSK2, CHK1, and p38. This degradation contributes to cancer progression by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. ILKAP's tumor suppressive role is highlighted by its ability to counteract the oncogenic effects of MAEL when overexpressed (Zhang2017MAEL). 

These findings suggest that ILKAP is a significant factor in cancer progression and treatment response, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
ILKAP, a serine/threonine phosphatase, interacts with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and plays a significant role in modulating its activity. ILKAP directly binds to ILK, as demonstrated by two-hybrid assays and co-precipitation from cell lysates, which is crucial for inhibiting ILK's kinase activity (Kumar2004ILKAP). This interaction is essential for ILKAP's role in regulating downstream targets such as GSK3b and cyclin D1, affecting cell cycle progression and oncogenic transformation (Kumar2004ILKAP).

ILKAP also influences the subcellular localization of ILK, promoting its nuclear export in a CRM1-dependent manner. This process requires ILKAP's catalytic activity and involves the N-terminal half of ILK, which contains the ILKAP-binding region (Nakrieko2008Modulation). The C-terminus of ILK is necessary for ILKAP-induced nuclear export, highlighting the importance of specific ILK regions in this interaction (Nakrieko2008Modulation).

In glioblastoma cells, ILKAP is part of a protein complex with ILK and PINCH1, which is involved in cell survival and radiosensitization. ILKAP's interaction with DNA repair proteins such as DNAPK and ATM suggests its role in modulating DNA repair processes and radiosensitivity (Hausmann2015ILKAP).
