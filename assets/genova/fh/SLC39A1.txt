# SLC39A1

## Overview
SLC39A1 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 1, commonly referred to as ZIP1. ZIP1 is a transmembrane zinc transporter that plays a pivotal role in maintaining zinc homeostasis within human cells. Characterized by its eight transmembrane domains, ZIP1 facilitates the uptake of zinc ions, which are crucial for numerous cellular processes, including enzyme activity and gene regulation (Yuan2022Integrated). While ZIP1 is primarily involved in intracellular zinc regulation, its expression and function are modulated by zinc availability and cellular differentiation (Michalczyk2013hZip1). The gene's expression is notably significant in various tissues, including prostate and gut epithelial cells, where it acts as an intracellular sensor for zinc levels (Franklin2003Human; Michalczyk2013hZip1). Additionally, SLC39A1 has been implicated in several cancers, where its altered expression can influence tumor progression and response to treatment, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2020SLC39A1; Qu2021PanCancer).

## Structure
The SLC39A1 protein, also known as ZIP1, is a zinc transporter that is part of the solute carrier family. It is characterized by having eight transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-termini located intracellularly, which is typical for members of this family (Yuan2022Integrated). The protein's structure facilitates the uptake of zinc ions into cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular zinc homeostasis (Yuan2022Integrated).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of SLC39A1 are not provided, it is known that the protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its function and localization (Yuan2022Integrated). The protein's intracellular loop, located between transmembrane domains III and IV, is thought to be involved in zinc transport (Yuan2022Integrated).

The SLC39A1 protein does not appear to have a significant presence at the plasma membrane, even under zinc-deficient conditions, suggesting its role is more focused on intracellular zinc homeostasis rather than direct transport across the plasma membrane (Michalczyk2013hZip1).

## Function
The SLC39A1 gene encodes the hZIP1 protein, a zinc transporter that plays a critical role in zinc homeostasis in human cells. hZIP1 is primarily involved in the uptake and accumulation of zinc, which is essential for various cellular functions, including enzyme activity and gene regulation. In prostate cells, hZIP1 facilitates the transport of zinc from low molecular weight ligands, such as amino acids and citrate, rather than from free Zn2+ ions. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining high intracellular zinc levels, which are important for cellular functions and enzyme activities (Franklin2003Human).

In gut epithelial cells, hZIP1 is implicated in regulating zinc homeostasis. Although it is not present on the plasma membrane, hZIP1 is thought to act as an intracellular sensor to regulate zinc levels, with its expression varying in response to zinc availability (Michalczyk2013hZip1). The protein's localization changes with cell differentiation, suggesting a role in zinc transport or regulation within the cytoplasm (Michalczyk2013hZip1).

In β-cells, SLC39A1 expression is enriched and responsive to cytokine stimulation, indicating a potential role in β-cell-specific functions and stress responses (Lawson2017Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC39A1 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including gliomas, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and liver cancer. In gliomas, SLC39A1 is significantly upregulated, correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor proliferation and invasion. High expression levels are associated with worse survival outcomes and are linked to the expression of invasion-related proteins such as MMP2 and MMP9 (Wang2020SLC39A1). In RCC, SLC39A1 is typically downregulated, and its overexpression can suppress tumor proliferation and migration by affecting metabolic pathways and signaling processes like the PI3K-AKT pathway (Yuan2022Integrated). In liver cancer, SLC39A1 expression is associated with immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Liu2024Zinc).

The SLC39A1 gene also influences drug sensitivity in cancer treatment. Its upregulation has been linked to reduced sensitivity to several chemotherapeutic agents, including paclitaxel, while enhancing sensitivity to others like Irofulven (Qu2021PanCancer). These findings highlight the potential of SLC39A1 as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers, emphasizing its role in tumor progression and response to treatment.

## Interactions
SLC39A1, also known as ZIP1, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in cellular processes. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), SLC39A1 has been shown to significantly downregulate the protein C5AR1, which directly interacts with SLC39A1. This interaction was confirmed through Affinity Capture Mass Spectrometry, suggesting a regulatory mechanism by which SLC39A1 influences cellular processes in RCC (Yuan2022Integrated).

In the context of gliomas, SLC39A1 is associated with the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9, which are crucial for tumor invasion and progression. The interaction with these zinc-dependent enzymes suggests that SLC39A1 may promote glioma progression by increasing zinc ion intake and enhancing MMP2/MMP9 expression (Wang2020SLC39A1). This interaction is significant as it highlights the role of SLC39A1 in extracellular matrix remodeling, a key process in cancer metastasis.

SLC39A1 is also involved in zinc ion transport and homeostasis, which are essential for various cellular functions, including enzyme activity and immune response. Its interactions with other proteins in these pathways underscore its importance in maintaining cellular zinc levels and influencing cancer progression (Qu2021PanCancer).
