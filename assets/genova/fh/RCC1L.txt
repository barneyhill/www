# RCC1L

## Overview
RCC1L, also known as WBSCR16, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the RCC1 superfamily, characterized by the presence of an RCC1-like domain (RLD). This domain is integral to the protein's role in regulating GTPase activity, which is crucial for mitochondrial ribosome assembly and function (Reyes2020RCC1L). The RCC1L protein is primarily localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it interacts with the inner membrane and plays a significant role in mitochondrial translation and ribosome biogenesis. The gene produces three isoforms—RCC1L V1, V2, and V3—through alternative splicing, each contributing differently to mitochondrial processes (Reyes2020RCC1L). The protein's involvement in pseudouridylation and its interactions with mitoribosome biogenesis factors underscore its importance in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production, particularly in energy-demanding cells such as neurons (Ellioff2023Ablation; Reyes2020RCC1L).

## Structure
The RCC1L protein, also known as WBSCR16, is characterized by the presence of an RCC1-like domain (RLD) that spans the entire length of the protein, a key feature of the RCC1 superfamily (Reyes2020RCC1L). This domain is involved in GTPase regulation and is essential for the protein's function in mitochondrial ribosome assembly. The RCC1L gene encodes three isoforms: RCC1L V1, V2, and V3, which result from alternative splicing and differ in their amino acid sequences. RCC1L V1 is 464 amino acids long, RCC1L V2 is 454 amino acids, and RCC1L V3 is 358 amino acids, with variations primarily in the C-terminal region (Reyes2020RCC1L).

The isoforms are localized to the mitochondrial matrix and interact with the inner membrane, facilitated by a cleavable mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) (Reyes2020RCC1L). RCC1L V1 is the most abundant isoform and is conserved across most mammalian species, while V2 and V3 appear to have evolved later in primates (Reyes2020RCC1L). The protein's interactions with GTPases and pseudouridylation proteins suggest a role in coordinating mitochondrial ribosome assembly (Reyes2020RCC1L). The specific molecular structure of RCC1L, including its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures, is not detailed in the available context.

## Function
The RCC1L gene, also known as WBSCR16, encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial ribosome assembly and function. It produces three isoforms: RCC1L V1, V2, and V3, each with distinct roles in mitochondrial processes. RCC1L V1 and V3 are involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial large and small ribosomal subunits (mtLSU and mtSSU), respectively, and are essential for mitochondrial protein synthesis. These isoforms interact with mitoribosome biogenesis factors and GTPases, such as GTPBP10 and ERAL1, which are critical for ribosome assembly and function (Reyes2020RCC1L).

RCC1L is localized to the mitochondrial matrix, where it influences mitochondrial translation by affecting the steady-state levels and distribution of mitoribosome proteins. The protein is also involved in pseudouridylation, a modification process of mitochondrial rRNA, which is crucial for the stability and function of the ribosome (Reyes2020RCC1L). The proper function of RCC1L is vital for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and energy production, particularly in energy-demanding cells like neurons, where it helps prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and associated neurodegenerative conditions (Ellioff2023Ablation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the RCC1L gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative and mitochondrial disorders. The ablation of RCC1L in dopaminergic neurons in mice leads to a Parkinson's disease-like phenotype, characterized by progressive motor impairments, degeneration of the nigrostriatal tract, and symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigid muscles, and resting tremor. This suggests that RCC1L is crucial for mitochondrial function in these neurons, and its dysfunction may contribute to Parkinson's disease (Ellioff2023Ablation).

RCC1L has also been identified as a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of adrenal cortical carcinoma, indicating its broader clinical significance beyond neurodegenerative diseases (Ellioff2023Ablation). Additionally, a missense mutation in the Rcc1l gene causes embryonic lethality due to deficits in early placentation, highlighting its essential role in development (Ellioff2023Ablation).

The gene's involvement in mitochondrial ribosome assembly and interaction with GTPases suggests that alterations in RCC1L expression or function can lead to defects in mitochondrial translation, potentially contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction (Reyes2020RCC1L). These findings underscore the importance of RCC1L in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and its potential link to various mitochondrial disorders.

## Interactions
RCC1L, also known as WBSCR16, is involved in mitochondrial ribosome assembly through its interactions with various proteins and GTPases. The protein has three isoforms: RCC1L V1, V2, and V3, each exhibiting distinct interaction profiles. RCC1L V1 and V3 are crucial for the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomal subunits, with V1 associating with the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (mtLSU) and V3 with the small subunit (mtSSU) (Reyes2020RCC1L).

RCC1L isoforms interact with mitoribosome biogenesis factors, and these interactions are independent of nucleic acids, as shown by treatments with DNase I, RNase A, or Benzonase (Reyes2020RCC1L). RCC1L V1 interacts with pseudouridylation proteins such as TRUB2, RPUSD3, and RPUSD4, potentially regulating the uridylation of 16S rRNA through its GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor activity (Hilander2021The; Reyes2020RCC1L).

RCC1L V3 interacts with ERAL1, a GTPase associated with the mtSSU, and modulates its availability, impacting mitoribosome assembly. Overexpression of RCC1L V3 leads to ERAL1 accumulation in mtSSU fractions, while silencing decreases ERAL1 recruitment, affecting mtSSU stability (Reyes2020RCC1L; Hilander2021The). These interactions highlight RCC1L's role in coordinating mitochondrial ribosome assembly and function.
