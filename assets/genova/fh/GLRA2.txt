# GLRA2

## Overview
The GLRA2 gene encodes the glycine receptor alpha 2 (GlyR α2) subunit, which is a critical component of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. This gene is primarily involved in the formation of inhibitory glycine receptors that mediate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The GlyR α2 subunit can assemble into both homomeric and heteromeric receptor complexes, contributing to the regulation of chloride ion flow across the neuronal membrane, thereby modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic inhibition. The receptor's structure includes a large extracellular domain for ligand binding and multiple transmembrane domains that form the ion channel pore. GlyR α2 is implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neurophysiological processes, including cortical interneuron migration and adult hippocampal neurogenesis, as well as visual processing in the retina. Mutations in GLRA2 have been associated with neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and visual impairments like high myopia, highlighting its clinical significance (Lin2017α2‐glycine; Avila2013Glycine; Tian2022GLRA2gene).

## Structure
The GLRA2 gene encodes the glycine receptor alpha 2 (GlyR α2) subunit, which is part of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily. The GlyR α2 subunit is characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) that contains the ligand-binding site, and four transmembrane domains (M1-M4) connected by short intracellular and extracellular loops, with a long intracellular loop connecting M3 to M4 (Zhang2017StructureFunction). The GlyR α2 subunit can form homomeric or heteromeric receptors, typically in a 3α:2β or 2α:3β stoichiometry (Zhang2017StructureFunction).

The primary structure of the GlyR α2 subunit consists of amino acid sequences that form these transmembrane domains. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the receptor's ligand-binding and ion channel functions. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and sheets into a functional conformation. The quaternary structure refers to the assembly of multiple subunits into a pentameric receptor complex (Zhang2017StructureFunction).

Common post-translational modifications of the GlyR α2 subunit include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can influence receptor function and trafficking. The gene also contains alternative splicing sites, which may generate different isoforms of the α2 subunit (Cummings1998Analysis).

## Function
The GLRA2 gene encodes the glycine receptor alpha 2 (GlyRα2) subunit, which is a component of ligand-gated chloride channels involved in inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. In healthy human cells, GlyRα2 plays a crucial role in various neurodevelopmental processes, including the migration of cortical interneurons during embryonic development. This migration is essential for proper cortical wiring and involves GlyRα2-mediated activation of voltage-gated calcium channels, which modulate intracellular calcium dynamics and myosin II activity, crucial for nucleokinesis and cell migration (Avila2013Glycine).

In the adult brain, particularly in the hippocampus, GlyRα2 is expressed by adult neural stem cells and is involved in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of these receptors decreases the proliferation of these stem cells, indicating that GlyRα2 is vital for maintaining normal neurogenesis and cognitive functions, such as spatial memory (Lin2017α2‐glycine).

GlyRα2 is also expressed in the retina, where it enhances visual processing by modulating the excitatory center response through crossover inhibition between the ON and OFF pathways. This function is crucial for contrast encoding of visual stimuli, and deficiencies in GlyRα2 can lead to visual impairments such as high myopia (Tian2022GLRA2gene).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GLRA2 gene, which encodes the glycine receptor alpha 2 subunit, are associated with several neurological and visual conditions. In humans, rare variants in GLRA2 have been linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), particularly in males with hemizygous mutations. Specific mutations such as a microdeletion (GLRA2∆ex8-9) and missense mutations (p.N109S and p.R126Q) result in impaired cell-surface expression of GlyR α2 and reduced sensitivity to glycine, leading to a loss-of-function classification (Zhang2017StructureFunction). Another missense variant, p.R323L, is associated with autism, macrocephaly, epilepsy, and hypothyroidism, and is characterized by a gain-of-function effect, with altered glycine sensitivity and increased inhibitory postsynaptic current rise and decay times (Zhang2017StructureFunction).

GLRA2 mutations are also implicated in high myopia (HM). Variants such as c.539C>T (p.Pro180Leu) and c.458G>A (p.Arg153Gln) have been identified in families with HM, affecting visual processing in the retina and leading to myopic phenotypes in both humans and mice (Tian2022GLRA2gene). These findings suggest that GLRA2 mutations can contribute to both neurological and visual disorders.

## Interactions
The GLRA2 gene encodes the glycine receptor alpha 2 subunit, which is a component of the inhibitory glycine receptor complex in the central nervous system. This subunit is involved in forming ligand-gated ion channels that mediate synaptic inhibition. The GlyR α2 subunit can form homomeric or heteromeric complexes with other subunits, such as the β subunit, to create functional chloride channels (Zhang2017StructureFunction). These channels are crucial for inhibitory neurotransmission.

The GlyR α2 subunit interacts with gephyrin, a scaffolding protein that anchors glycine receptors to the synaptic membrane, facilitating synapse formation and stabilization (Zhang2017StructureFunction). This interaction is essential for the proper localization and function of glycine receptors at inhibitory synapses. The study also suggests that the GLRA2 protein may interact with neuroligin 2A in the context of synaptic function, although specific details on direct physical interactions are not provided (Zhang2017StructureFunction).

While the context does not provide detailed information on interactions with nucleic acids, it highlights the role of GLRA2 in forming receptor complexes and its involvement in synaptic processes.
