# VNN1

## Overview
VNN1, or vanin 1, is a gene that encodes the enzyme pantetheinase, which plays a critical role in metabolic processes by hydrolyzing pantetheine into pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and cysteamine. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase and is essential for the recycling of pantothenic acid, a precursor for coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis, which is vital for lipid metabolism and energy production (Bartucci2019Vanin; Naquet2014Role). The VNN1 gene is predominantly expressed in tissues with high CoA turnover, such as the liver, intestine, and kidney, and is involved in maintaining CoA homeostasis (Naquet2014Role). Beyond its metabolic functions, vanin 1 is implicated in the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation, acting as an epithelial sensor of stress and influencing immune responses and tissue repair (Jansen2009Expression). The gene's involvement in various signaling pathways and its association with diseases such as hypertension, inflammatory bowel diseases, and certain cancers underscore its clinical significance (Gensollen2013Functional; Giessner2018Vnn1; Wang2014The).

## Function
The VNN1 (vanin 1) gene encodes the enzyme pantetheinase, which is involved in the hydrolysis of pantetheine into pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and cysteamine. This enzymatic activity is crucial for the recycling of pantothenic acid, a precursor for coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis, which is essential for various metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism and energy production (Bartucci2019Vanin; Naquet2014Role). VNN1 is highly expressed in tissues with high CoA turnover, such as the liver, intestine, and kidney, and plays a significant role in maintaining CoA homeostasis (Naquet2014Role).

In healthy human cells, VNN1 contributes to the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation. The enzyme's activity helps manage oxidative stress by maintaining the thiol-disulfide equilibrium and influencing glutathione levels, which are crucial for cellular antioxidant defenses (Bartucci2019Vanin). VNN1 is also involved in the regulation of immune responses and tissue repair processes, acting as an epithelial sensor of stress and influencing innate immune responses (Jansen2009Expression). The enzyme's products, cysteamine and pantothenic acid, play roles in glycolysis regulation, with cysteamine limiting glycolysis and pantothenic acid linked to increased glycolytic activity (Bartucci2019Vanin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the VNN1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. The N131S mutation in the VNN1 gene is associated with reduced vanin-1 protein levels and decreased pantetheinase activity, which may contribute to hypertension. This mutation leads to impaired membrane trafficking and reduced enzymatic activity, suggesting a potential role in blood pressure regulation (Wang2014The).

In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), VNN1 expression is significantly increased, particularly in ulcerative colitis. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regulatory regions of the VNN1 gene, such as VN-681C.T, are associated with increased IBD risk and higher VNN1 expression levels. These genetic variations may influence the gene's role in inflammation and oxidative stress response, contributing to disease susceptibility (Gensollen2013Functional).

VNN1 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of soft tissue sarcomas, where its expression is associated with improved prognosis. VNN1 helps maintain mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and limits glycolysis, thereby reducing tumor growth. Its deficiency is linked to a higher incidence of aggressive tumors, suggesting a tumor suppressor role (Giessner2018Vnn1).

## Interactions
Vanin-1 (VNN1) is involved in several interactions that influence oxidative stress and inflammation. It interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), regulating its expression and antagonizing ligand-induced activation, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Gurung2020Highthroughput). VNN1 also plays a role in the AMPK/GAPDH/Sirt1/FoxO1 signaling pathway, where its overexpression in pancreatic cancer cells inhibits the phosphorylation of AMPK, preventing GAPDH from entering the nucleus and interacting with Sirt1. This inhibition reduces Sirt1 activity, leading to increased acetylation of FoxO1, which decreases its transcriptional activity and promotes β-cell dedifferentiation (Qin2023VNN1).

In smooth muscle cells, VNN1 modulates oxidative stress and PPARγ expression, influencing cell proliferation and migration. It promotes glutathione depletion and matrix metalloproteinase activation, which are crucial for these processes (Dammanahalli2012Vanin1). VNN1's enzymatic product, cysteamine, also contributes to oxidative stress and decreased PPARγ expression (Dammanahalli2012Vanin1). These interactions highlight VNN1's role as a mediator of oxidative stress and inflammation, impacting various cellular signaling pathways.
