# PP2D1

## Overview
PP2D1 is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase 2C-like domain containing 1, which is categorized as a pseudophosphatase. Unlike typical phosphatases, pseudophosphatases lack catalytic activity due to alterations in their active site, which can affect their ability to dephosphorylate substrates. Despite this, they often play crucial roles in cellular signaling by acting as allosteric modulators or scaffolding proteins. The PP2D1 gene is of particular interest due to its potential involvement in pathways related to amyloid processing, as suggested by its interaction with amyloid protein Aβ. This interaction may have implications for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, where amyloid proteins are a key pathological feature (Reiterer2020The). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional roles and potential clinical significance of the protein encoded by PP2D1.

## Interactions
PP2D1, a predicted pseudophosphatase, is noted for its potential interactions within cellular processes, although experimental evidence confirming its lack of catalytic activity is not yet available. According to the BioGRID database, the only known interaction partner for PP2D1 is amyloid protein Aβ (Reiterer2020The). This interaction suggests a possible role in pathways related to amyloid processing or signaling, which could have implications in neurodegenerative diseases where amyloid proteins are involved. The interaction with amyloid protein Aβ highlights the importance of understanding PP2D1's role in cellular contexts, as pseudophosphatases often act as allosteric modulators and could be targeted through non-active site interactions or degradation pathways (Reiterer2020The). Despite the limited information on PP2D1's interactions, its potential involvement in significant cellular pathways underscores the need for further research to elucidate its functional roles and interactions.
