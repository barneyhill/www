# ZNF165

## Overview
ZNF165 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 165, a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family, which is characterized by its zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. The protein is primarily expressed in the testis, where it plays a significant role in spermatogenesis, but it is also present at lower levels in other tissues, indicating a broader functional scope in cellular processes (Zhang2022ZNF165; Lee1997Three). ZNF165 functions as a transcription factor, influencing gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, and has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer and gastric cancer, where it modulates oncogenic signaling pathways (Dong2004Zincfinger; Gibbs2020The). The protein's interactions with other transcriptional regulators, such as SMAD3 and TRIM27, underscore its role in transcriptional regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Gibbs2020The).

## Structure
ZNF165 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of five contiguous zinc finger motifs, which follow the CX2CX3FX8HX3H consensus sequence typical of the Cys2His2 Kruppel family of zinc finger proteins (Lee1997Three). These motifs are located within exon 5 of the gene (Lee1997Three). The protein also contains a SCAN box domain, a conserved domain found in a subset of zinc finger proteins, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Collins2005The; Lee1997Three). The SCAN domain is a highly conserved 84-residue motif near the N-terminus, functioning as a protein interaction domain (Collins2005The).

Post-translational modifications of ZNF165 include potential sumoylation, as the protein contains a sequence fitting the consensus for a SUMO acceptor site, which may affect its transcription factor activity and prevent degradation by the proteasome (Collins2005The). ZNF165 is expressed in various tissues, with predominant expression in the testes and lower levels in other tissues such as the placenta, lung, and liver (Lee1997Three). The nucleotide sequence of ZNF165 expressed in tumors is identical to that expressed in the testis, indicating no splice variant isoforms have been identified (Dong2004Zincfinger).

## Function
ZNF165 is a zinc finger protein that functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a role in regulating gene expression. It is part of the C2H2 zinc finger gene family, which is characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs that facilitate DNA binding. These motifs allow ZNF165 to influence the transcriptional landscape of the cell by binding to specific DNA sequences and modulating the transcription of target genes (Lee1997Three). 

In healthy human cells, ZNF165 is predominantly expressed in the testis, where it is involved in spermatogenesis, indicating its role in reproductive biology (Zhang2022ZNF165). The protein is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues such as the placenta, lung, liver, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and colon, suggesting a broader role in cellular processes across different tissues (Dong2004Zincfinger). 

ZNF165 is active in the nucleus, where it likely influences cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis by regulating gene expression (Dong2004Zincfinger). Despite its expression in various tissues, the specific molecular functions of ZNF165 in healthy human cells remain less well-defined, with most studies focusing on its role in cancer contexts.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF165 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In gastric cancer (GC), ZNF165 is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, particularly in the intestinal type and MSI-high subtype. This expression is associated with poor overall and disease-free survival in patients undergoing fluorouracil-based chemoradiation and radical gastrectomy. ZNF165's role in GC includes promoting cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle, making it a potential target for immunotherapy (Zhang2022ZNF165).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ZNF165 is overexpressed and linked to poor survival outcomes. It plays a critical role in promoting cancer progression by modulating the TGFb signaling pathway, which is essential for TNBC cell survival. ZNF165 represses negative feedback in the TGFb pathway, leading to increased oncogenic activity, including the activation of the WISP1 oncogene (Maxfield2015Comprehensive).

ZNF165 is also identified as a cancer-testis antigen, with expression primarily in the testis among normal tissues but significantly elevated in various tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its expression pattern and ability to elicit an immune response suggest its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer (Dong2004Zincfinger).

## Interactions
ZNF165 interacts with several proteins and forms complexes that play a significant role in transcriptional regulation, particularly in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). ZNF165 acts as a cofactor with SMAD3, a protein involved in TGFβ signaling, to modulate the expression of TGFβ-responsive genes. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of SMAD3 to shared target gene promoters, influencing transcriptional activation (Gibbs2020The). The interaction between ZNF165 and SMAD3 is TGFβ-dependent, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays (Gibbs2020The).

ZNF165 also forms a transcriptional complex with ZNF446 and TRIM27. ZNF446 is an obligate component of this complex, and its interaction with ZNF165 is dependent on the SCAN domain of ZNF165 (Gibbs2020The). TRIM27 is essential for ZNF165's transcriptional activity and tumor growth, interacting with ZNF165 and ZNF446 to modulate the transcriptional activation of certain genes (Gibbs2020The). These interactions highlight the role of ZNF165 in coordinating oncogenic TGFβ signaling and its potential as a target for therapeutic strategies in TNBC (Gibbs2020The).
