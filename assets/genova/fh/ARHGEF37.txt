# ARHGEF37

## Overview
ARHGEF37 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 37, which plays a significant role in cellular processes such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and membrane dynamics. The protein is characterized by its unique structural domains, including an N-terminal actin-regulatory RhoGEF domain, a BAR domain, and two SH3 domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and membrane binding (Viplav2019ArhGEF37). As a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, ARHGEF37 is involved in the activation of the small GTPase Cdc42, influencing cellular activities such as invadopodia formation and tumor cell invasion (Zhang2022ARHGEF37). The gene has been implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with poor clinical outcomes due to its role in enhancing metastasis (Zhang2022ARHGEF37). Additionally, ARHGEF37 has been identified in genome-wide association studies as potentially linked to Multiple System Atrophy, although its broader implications in disease remain under investigation (Hopfner2021Genomewide).

## Structure
The ARHGEF37 protein is composed of 676 amino acids and features several distinct domains. It includes an N-terminal actin-regulatory RhoGEF domain, a BAR domain, and two SH3 domains associated with protein-protein interactions (Viplav2019ArhGEF37). The secondary structure of the GEF and BAR domains consists of α-helices and coil structures, while the SH3 domains contain β-strands and coils (Viplav2019ArhGEF37). Homology modeling of the BAR domain reveals an elongated banana-shaped dimer with positive patches on the convex surface, suggesting its role in membrane interactions (Viplav2019ArhGEF37). The BAR domain of ARHGEF37 is unique in its shape and surface charge distribution compared to other BAR domain proteins (Viplav2019ArhGEF37).

The protein's tertiary and quaternary structures are inferred from homology models and its interaction with membranes (Viplav2019ArhGEF37). ARHGEF37 binds to model membranes formed from brain lipids and membranes composed of POPC/DOPC/Cholesterol/PI(4,5)P2, but not to membranes lacking charged phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate, indicating charge-dependent protein-membrane interactions (Viplav2019ArhGEF37). The study does not provide specific information on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of ARHGEF37 (Viplav2019ArhGEF37).

## Function
ARHGEF37, or Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 37, is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a critical cellular process for internalizing membranes and extracellular materials in mammalian cells. It is characterized by a unique BAR domain and PI(4,5)P2-dependent protein/membrane interactions, which facilitate its accumulation at Dynamin2-rich late endocytic sites, thereby increasing endocytosis rates (Viplav2019ArhGEF37). The protein consists of an N-terminal actin-regulatory RhoGEF domain, a BAR domain, and two SH3 domains, which are associated with protein-protein interactions (Viplav2019ArhGEF37).

ARHGEF37 shows the highest co-localization with Dynamin 2, suggesting its recruitment predominantly during the late stages of CME. However, no direct binding between Dynamin 2 and ARHGEF37 was detected, indicating that ARHGEF37 may promote endocytosis through indirect interactions or other mechanisms (Viplav2019ArhGEF37). The protein's BAR domain is implicated in membrane curvature and dynamics, suggesting a role in cellular processes related to membrane structure (HernándezGarcía2015Endothelial).

In cellular contexts, ARHGEF37 exhibits a dynamic punctate pattern, indicating its active involvement in endocytosis (Viplav2019ArhGEF37). It may also have roles beyond CME, potentially in clathrin-independent endocytosis (Viplav2019ArhGEF37).

## Clinical Significance
ARHGEF37 has been implicated in the progression and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Overexpression of ARHGEF37 is associated with increased tumor invasiveness and pulmonary metastasis, leading to poorer clinical outcomes, including shorter overall and metastasis-free survival in HCC patients (Zhang2022ARHGEF37). The gene promotes extravasation and metastasis by directly activating Cdc42, a Rho GTPase involved in cell signaling pathways that regulate cancer cell adhesion, migration, and invadopodia formation (Zhang2022ARHGEF37). In vivo studies have shown that silencing ARHGEF37 reduces lung metastasis and prolongs survival in mice, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2022ARHGEF37).

In addition to its role in cancer, ARHGEF37 has been identified in a genome-wide association study as having suggestive associations with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), although specific diseases or conditions directly linked to mutations in ARHGEF37 were not detailed (Hopfner2021Genomewide). The gene's involvement in clathrin-mediated endocytosis suggests it may have broader implications in cellular processes, but its direct impact on diseases beyond cancer remains to be fully elucidated (Viplav2019ArhGEF37).

## Interactions
ARHGEF37, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is known to interact with and activate the small GTPase Cdc42. This interaction is crucial for the activation of Cdc42, as ARHGEF37 overexpression increases the GTP-bound form of Cdc42 and its downstream effector PAK1. The binding occurs through the Dbl homology (DH) domain of ARHGEF37, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays and far-western blotting analysis (Zhang2022ARHGEF37). 

ARHGEF37's role in promoting invadopodia formation and disrupting endothelial cell-pericyte interactions is linked to its activation of Cdc42. This activation facilitates tumor cell invasion and metastasis by enhancing the formation of invadopodia, which are actin-rich protrusions that degrade the extracellular matrix (Zhang2022ARHGEF37). 

In the context of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, ARHGEF37 shows co-localization with Dynamin2 (DYN2), although no strong or direct interactions were detected between them in pull-down assays. This suggests that ARHGEF37 may be recruited to late endocytotic sites, potentially playing a role in endocytosis rates through its SH3 domain, despite the lack of direct binding with DYN2 (Viplav2019ArhGEF37).
