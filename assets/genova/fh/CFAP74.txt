# CFAP74

## Overview
CFAP74, or cilia and flagella associated protein 74, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the structure and function of cilia and flagella in human cells. The protein, also named CFAP74, is categorized as an axonemal protein, playing a pivotal role in the assembly and stability of axonemes, which are the core structural components of these organelles. It is particularly crucial for the structural integrity and function of the sperm flagellum, thereby contributing to sperm motility and male fertility (Sha2020Biallelic). CFAP74 is highly expressed in tissues with motile cilia or flagella, such as the testes and respiratory epithelial cells, underscoring its importance in reproductive and respiratory functions (Sha2020Biallelic). The protein also serves as a scaffold within the central apparatus of the cilium axoneme, facilitating interactions essential for ciliary movement and cellular processes like signaling (Liu2022LOF; Zhu2024Incell).

## Function
CFAP74 (cilia and flagella associated protein 74) plays a crucial role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella in human cells. It is primarily involved in the assembly and stability of axonemes, which are the core structural components of these hair-like organelles. CFAP74 is part of the axonemal protein complex and is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of the sperm flagellum, contributing to proper sperm motility and male fertility (Sha2020Biallelic). The protein is highly expressed in tissues with motile cilia or flagella, such as the testes and respiratory epithelial cells, indicating its importance in both reproductive and respiratory functions (Sha2020Biallelic).

In the context of the central apparatus of the cilium axoneme, CFAP74 serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of other proteins, facilitating interactions crucial for the structural integrity and function of the central apparatus (Zhu2024Incell). It is also involved in ciliary movement, which is essential for cellular processes such as signaling and movement (Liu2022LOF). CFAP74's role in these molecular processes underscores its significance in maintaining normal cellular and organismal functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP74 gene have been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and multiple morphological abnormalities of the flagella (MMAF) phenotype. PCD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent respiratory infections, nasosinusitis, tympanitis, and male infertility, while MMAF is a severe form of teratozoospermia resulting from various flagellar defects. In a study, biallelic mutations in CFAP74 were identified in patients exhibiting symptoms of PCD and MMAF, such as chronic bronchiectasis, frequent sinusitis, and male infertility. These mutations were found to cause significant morphological abnormalities in sperm, including defects in the mitochondrial sheath and axoneme structure, as well as the absence of CFAP74 in sperm samples, indicating a loss of function (Sha2020Biallelica).

CFAP74 mutations have also been associated with endometrial cancer (EC), where they are considered potential biomarkers for both sporadic and Lynch syndrome-related EC. The gene contains high-frequency mutation sites, suggesting its involvement in the disease's occurrence and development (&lt; p&gt; em&gt; /em&gt; Gao2020&lt; HNRNPCL1&lt). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CFAP74 mutations in various conditions, particularly those related to ciliary and flagellar dysfunction.

## Interactions
CFAP74 is a protein involved in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the central apparatus (CA) in mammalian sperm axoneme. It interacts with several other proteins to form a multiprotein complex essential for ciliary function. CFAP74 serves as a scaffold for recruiting other proteins, including CFAP46, SPAG6, and LRRC43, which are situated close to the heads of radial spokes RS8 and RS9, indicating potential involvement in CA-radial spoke interactions (Zhu2024Incell). 

CFAP74 is also part of a complex with CFAP54, FAP46, and C1d-87/WDR93, which associates with the C1d projection of the central microtubule apparatus. This complex is involved in regulating dynein motor force in response to calcium changes, interacting with the calcium-binding protein calmodulin. Knockdown of CFAP74 results in the loss of the C1d projection and reduced flagellar motility, highlighting its critical role in the assembly and function of the C1d complex (McKenzie2015CFAP54). 

Mutations in CFAP74 have been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and multiple morphological abnormalities of sperm flagella (MMAF), affecting the structure and function of the axoneme (Sha2020Biallelic).
