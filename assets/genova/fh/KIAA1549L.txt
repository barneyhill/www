# KIAA1549L

## Overview
KIAA1549L is a human gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by KIAA1549L is implicated in several signaling pathways and cellular interactions, potentially acting as a regulatory or structural component within the cell. Research has highlighted its involvement in multiple diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular conditions, suggesting that KIAA1549L may play a role in disease pathogenesis and progression (Qian2023Prognostic; Anderl2015PAX5KIAA1549L:; Zalewski2020Dysregulation). The gene's expression and mutation patterns have been studied in the context of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and functional high-risk multiple myeloma, among other conditions, indicating its potential as a biomarker for disease prognosis and therapeutic targeting (Soekojo2022Genomic; Anderl2015PAX5KIAA1549L:).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
KIAA1549L has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations, expression alterations, and interactions. In pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), a novel fusion gene involving KIAA1549L, known as PAX5-KIAA1549L, has been identified. This fusion results from complex chromosomal rearrangements and is associated with the disease's development (Anderl2015PAX5KIAA1549L:).

In functional high-risk multiple myeloma (FHR MM), mutations in KIAA1549L are specific to this risk group, suggesting a role in the disease's genomic landscape (Soekojo2022Genomic). Additionally, KIAA1549L is associated with cardiovascular diseases and chemical dependency, as well as being downregulated in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (Zalewski2020Dysregulation).

In stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), KIAA1549L is part of a prognostic gene signature related to immune cell infiltration, indicating its potential role in cancer prognosis (Qian2023Prognostic). Furthermore, DNA methylation markers near KIAA1549L have been identified in colorectal cancer, suggesting its involvement in cancer detection (Heiss2017Epigenomewide).
