# IL4I1

## Overview
Interleukin 4 induced 1 (IL4I1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme L-phenylalanine oxidase, a secreted L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) involved in immune regulation. The IL4I1 protein is characterized by its FAD-binding domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity, allowing it to catalyze the oxidation of L-amino acids into α-keto acids, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide. This protein is primarily expressed in immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, where it plays a crucial role in modulating T-cell responses and promoting regulatory T cell differentiation. IL4I1's activity is significant in both acidic and physiological pH environments, indicating its broad functional relevance. The gene's expression is regulated by cytokines, including IL-4 and IFN-γ, and it has been implicated in various cancers and immune-related conditions, serving as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Marquet2010Dichotomy; Cousin2015The; Castellano2017An; Boulland2007Human).

## Structure
The IL4I1 protein is a secreted L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) with a primary structure that includes a sequence of 567 amino acids in humans, sharing high similarity with the mouse IL4I1 protein, except for the C-terminal region (Boulland2007Human). The protein contains a putative signal peptide, which is indicative of its secretion and is involved in its transport to the endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes (Wiemann2005Alternative). The IL4I1 protein is N-glycosylated, a post-translational modification that affects its secretion and size (Boulland2007Human).

IL4I1 has a FAD-binding domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity, as it catalyzes the oxidation of L-amino acids, particularly phenylalanine, into α-keto acids, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide (Castellano2017An). The protein's structure is similar to other flavoproteins, with a topology resembling polyamine oxidases, comprising a FAD-binding domain, a substrate-binding domain, and a helical domain (Castellano2017An). The IL4I1 gene has several splice variant isoforms, which differ in the 5' untranslated region and the first two exons coding for a signal peptide, leading to tissue-specific expression patterns (Castellano2017An).

## Function
The IL4I1 gene encodes an enzyme known as L-phenylalanine oxidase, which plays a significant role in immune regulation. This enzyme is primarily expressed by mature dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and is involved in modulating T-cell responses. IL4I1 functions by inhibiting the proliferation of T lymphocytes, particularly affecting memory T cells more than naive T cells. This inhibition is mediated through the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which down-regulates T-cell receptor (TCR) expression and signaling, thereby reducing T-cell activation (Boulland2007Human).

IL4I1 also promotes the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells) from naive CD4+ T cells, contributing to immune tolerance. This process is facilitated by the enzyme's ability to deplete phenylalanine and produce catabolites like H2O2, which influence T-cell differentiation pathways (Cousin2015The). The enzyme's activity is not restricted to acidic environments and is active at physiological pH, indicating its functional relevance in various cellular contexts (Boulland2007Human).

IL4I1 is secreted and acts in the extracellular space, allowing it to modulate immune responses without direct cell contact. Its expression is regulated by cytokines such as IL-4 and IFN-γ, highlighting its role in immune response modulation (Marquet2010Dichotomy).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the IL4I1 gene have been implicated in various cancers and immune-related conditions. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), decreased IL4I1 expression is associated with resistance to the drug ibrutinib, a treatment for this type of lymphoma. This resistance is linked to metabolic shifts in the tumor cells, suggesting that IL4I1 plays a role in modulating drug resistance through metabolic pathways (Choueiry2021Integration).

IL4I1 is also identified as a metabolic immune checkpoint that activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), promoting tumor progression and immune escape. High IL4I1 expression is associated with increased tumor growth and poor prognosis in cancers such as glioma, melanoma, and breast cancer. It contributes to immune evasion by limiting antitumor T cell proliferation and facilitating regulatory T cell differentiation (Sadik2020IL4I1; MolinierFrenkel2019The).

In addition, IL4I1 expression is linked to immune cell infiltration and resistance to certain anticancer drugs, while also being associated with sensitivity to others, such as temozolomide. This suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer treatment (Chen2024Pancancer).
