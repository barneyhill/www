# GRIN1

## Overview
The GRIN1 gene encodes the GluN1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a pivotal component of the glutamatergic neurotransmission system in the central nervous system. The NMDA receptor is an ionotropic receptor and ion channel protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by mediating calcium, sodium, and potassium ion flow across the neuronal membrane. The GluN1 subunit is essential for the receptor's function, forming part of a heterotetrameric complex with other subunits such as GluN2 and GluN3. This receptor's activity is modulated by the binding of neurotransmitters like glutamate and glycine and is subject to a voltage-dependent block by magnesium ions (Chen2017GRIN1; Lemke2016Delineating). The GRIN1 gene is widely expressed in the brain, highlighting its significance in normal neurological function and its involvement in various protein interactions that influence receptor localization and signal transduction (Hardingham2009Coupling; Enoch2014Expression).

## Structure
The GRIN1 gene encodes the GluN1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a critical component of the glutamatergic neurotransmission system. The GluN1 subunit is part of a heterotetrameric complex that includes two GluN1 subunits and a combination of GluN2 and/or GluN3 subunits (SantosGómez2021Paradigmatic; Chen2017GRIN1). The primary structure of GluN1 consists of several domains: an extracellular amino terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) with four segments (M1-M4), and an intracellular carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) (Chen2017GRIN1; Xu2024De).

The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the folding and stability of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional conformation, while the quaternary structure refers to the assembly of the GluN1 subunit with other subunits to form the functional NMDA receptor (Xu2024De). The M3 transmembrane helix, containing the SYTANLAAF motif, is crucial for channel gating and is highly conserved, indicating its importance in receptor function (Xu2024De).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can regulate the activity of the NMDA receptor, affecting its role in synaptic plasticity and memory function (Chen2017GRIN1). Splice variants of the GRIN1 gene may alter receptor properties and localization, contributing to the diversity of NMDA receptor functions (Chen2017GRIN1).

## Function
The GRIN1 gene encodes the GluN1 subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is a critical component of excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. NMDA receptors are ionotropic glutamate receptors that form ligand-gated cation channel complexes, allowing the flow of calcium, sodium, and potassium ions across the cell membrane. This ion flow is essential for synaptic plasticity, memory function, and learning (Hung2002Systematic; Lemke2016Delineating).

In healthy human cells, the NMDA receptor is involved in synaptic signaling and plasticity, which are crucial for learning and memory. The receptor is a heterotetramer composed of two GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 subunits. The GluN1 subunit is obligatory for the receptor's function, as it cannot operate without it (Lemke2016Delineating). The receptor's activity is modulated by the binding of glutamate and glycine, and it is subject to a voltage-dependent block by magnesium ions (Chen2017GRIN1).

The GRIN1 gene is expressed throughout the brain, with the highest expression levels observed across various brain regions, underscoring its importance in normal brain function (Enoch2014Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GRIN1 gene, which encodes the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. These include severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, movement disorders, and cortical visual impairment. Patients with GRIN1 mutations often exhibit profound developmental delay, absent speech, muscular hypotonia, and hyperkinetic movement disorders (Benke2021Clinical; Lemke2016Delineating). The mutations typically result in a loss of receptor function, leading to a distinct condition known as NMDA receptor encephalopathy (Lemke2016Delineating).

The clinical spectrum of GRIN1-related disorders is broad, with symptoms such as seizures, cortical blindness, and oculogyric crises. Epilepsy is common, with onset ranging from birth to 11 years, and many cases show resistance to conventional antiseizure treatments (Benke2021Clinical). Some individuals also present with autism spectrum disorder traits, sleep problems, and self-harm behavior (Benke2021Clinical).

De novo missense mutations in GRIN1 are often clustered in the transmembrane domains, which are critical for receptor function. These mutations can lead to altered gating properties of the ion channel, impairing receptor function and contributing to the observed neurodevelopmental phenotypes (Ohba2015GRIN1).

## Interactions
The GRIN1 gene encodes the GluN1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, which is involved in various protein interactions critical for its function. GRIN1 interacts with GluN2A and GluN2B subunits to form functional NMDA receptors. Mutations in GRIN1, such as GluN1-G620R, can disrupt these interactions, particularly with GluN2B, affecting receptor trafficking and function (Chen2017GRIN1).

GRIN1 is also part of a larger multi-protein complex linked via the cytoplasmic C-termini of NR1 and NR2 subunits. This complex includes proteins like MAGUKs (Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinases), such as PSD-95, SAP-102, and PSD-93, which facilitate receptor localization and signal transduction (Hardingham2009Coupling). GRIN1 interacts with scaffold proteins like Homer1/3, Dlg1, and Dlgap4, linking it to downstream signaling cascades (Husi2013A).

In the nervous system, GRIN1 colocalizes with the Gαo protein, suggesting a role in Gαo-GRIN1 signaling pathways. This interaction is implicated in neuronal differentiation and neurite extension (Masuho2008Dynamic). GRIN1 also interacts with p140Cap, a synaptic protein hub, and is part of complexes involving other synaptic proteins like Dlg4/PSD95 and Shank3 (Alfieri2017Synaptic).
