# FAM111B

## Overview
FAM111B is a gene that encodes the FAM111 trypsin-like peptidase B, a serine protease involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, repair, and cell cycle regulation. The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and is characterized by a trypsin/cysteine protease-like domain, which is crucial for its protease activity (Arowolo2022Proposed; Naicker2024Unravelling). FAM111B interacts with several nuclear components, such as replication factor C complex (RFC) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), playing a significant role in maintaining genome stability and integrity (Naicker2024Unravelling). Mutations in FAM111B are associated with hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP), as well as increased cancer predisposition, highlighting its clinical significance (Mercier2015Expanding; Arowolo2022Proposed).

## Structure
The FAM111B protein is a 734 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of approximately 85 kDa. It shares about 45% sequence homology with its paralog, FAM111A (Arowolo2022Proposed; Naicker2024Unravelling). The protein is predicted to contain a trypsin/cysteine protease-like domain at its C-terminus, which is considered functionally important. This domain is suggested to be involved in protease activity, as indicated by structural homology modeling using the E. coli DegS protease as a template (Arowolo2022Proposed). 

FAM111B interacts with the replication factor C complex (RFC) and PCNA, but it lacks the PIP box sequence found in FAM111A (Naicker2024Unravelling). The protein is also involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking, interacting with nuclear pore components such as SEC13 and NUP42, and RNA export machinery components like RAE1 and GLE1 (Naicker2024Unravelling). 

Mutations in FAM111B are associated with hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contractures, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP), with several missense mutations predicted to localize in the trypsin-like cysteine/serine peptidase domain (Mercier2015Expanding). The protein's role in maintaining DNA repair and genome integrity is also noted, although detailed structural information such as primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures is not provided in the available literature (Naicker2024Unravelling).

## Function
The FAM111B gene encodes a serine protease that plays a significant role in maintaining genome stability and integrity in healthy human cells. It is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with nuclear pore complexes and is involved in several cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Naicker2024Unravelling; Kliszczak2023Loss). FAM111B is crucial for DNA replication, as it interacts with DNA-binding proteins like replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which are essential for DNA replication (Arowolo2022Proposed; Naicker2024Unravelling).

FAM111B influences the cell cycle by regulating the degradation of the tumor-suppressor protein p16, facilitating the transition from the G1 to S phase and promoting cell cycle progression (Arowolo2022Proposed). It also plays a role in apoptosis by upregulating anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2 and BAG3, which inhibit pro-apoptotic pathways, thus promoting cell survival (Naicker2024Unravelling).

FAM111B is involved in maintaining normal telomere length by recruiting the telomere repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2), a component of the shelterin complex that protects telomeres. Loss of FAM111B leads to shorter telomeres and genome instability, triggering DNA damage responses (Naicker2024Unravelling; Kliszczak2023Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FAM111B gene are linked to several diseases and conditions, most notably hereditary fibrosing poikiloderma with tendon contracture, myopathy, and pulmonary fibrosis (POIKTMP). This rare autosomal dominant syndrome is characterized by poikiloderma, tendon contractures, muscle weakness, and pulmonary fibrosis. The molecular basis of these mutations often involves gain-of-function changes that lead to accelerated autocleavage of proteins crucial for cell homeostasis, resulting in genome instability and telomere shortening (Arowolo2022Proposed; Naicker2024Unravelling).

FAM111B mutations are also associated with increased cancer predisposition. Overexpression of the gene in cancer cells correlates with increased tumor progression and poor clinical outcomes, particularly in pancreatic cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. This is thought to be due to the gene's role in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, where its dysregulation leads to genomic instability and cell cycle dysregulation (Arowolo2022Proposed; Roversi2021Spontaneous).

In addition to POIKTMP and cancer, FAM111B mutations have been implicated in other conditions such as progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH) and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting the gene's broad impact on human health (Arowolo2022Proposed).

## Interactions
FAM111B is primarily localized in the nucleus and interacts with components of the nuclear pore complexes, specifically nucleoporins SEC13 and NUP42, suggesting a role in nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking (Naicker2024Unravelling; Kliszczak2023Loss). It also interacts with RAE1 and GLE1, which are part of the RNA export machinery, although the exact mechanisms of these interactions remain unclear (Naicker2024Unravelling; Kliszczak2023Loss).

FAM111B is involved in DNA replication and repair processes through its interactions with DNA-binding proteins such as replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Arowolo2022Proposed; Naicker2024Unravelling). These interactions are crucial for DNA replication, as RFC helps load PCNA onto DNA (Naicker2024Unravelling). FAM111B also interacts with calpains, specifically CAPNS1 and CAPN1, indicating its role as a protease (Arowolo2022Proposed).

FAM111B shares overlapping functions with its paralog FAM111A, and both proteins interact with cellular replication and transcription components like RFC subunits and RPB1, suggesting potential functional synergy (Naicker2024Unravelling). FAM111B has been identified as a primary interactor of FAM111A, indicating their collaborative roles in regulating various cellular processes (Naicker2024Unravelling).
