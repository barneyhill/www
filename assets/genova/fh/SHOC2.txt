# SHOC2

## Overview
The SHOC2 gene encodes the SHOC2 leucine-rich repeat scaffold protein, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly the RAS-MAPK pathway. This protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which facilitate its function as a scaffold protein, assembling multiprotein complexes that modulate ERK1/2 signaling. SHOC2 interacts with key signaling molecules such as MRAS and PP1C, forming a ternary complex essential for the dephosphorylation and activation of RAF kinases. This interaction is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell motility, adhesion, and proliferation. Mutations in the SHOC2 gene are linked to several disorders, including Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair, highlighting its clinical significance (Motta2019Clinical; Kwon2022Structure–function; Young2018SHOC2–MRAS–PP1).

## Structure
The SHOC2 protein is characterized by its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which form a solenoid structure crucial for its function in the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway. The primary structure of SHOC2 includes a sequence of amino acids that assemble into twenty tandem LRR domains, creating a concave surface that facilitates interactions with other proteins such as MRAS and PP1C (Kwon2022Structure–function). The secondary structure of SHOC2 is composed of parallel β-strands that form the concave surface, while α-helices create the convex surface. The tertiary structure is stabilized by a hydrophobic core formed by conserved leucines and an 'asparagine ladder' motif critical to the LRR fold (Kwon2022Structure–function).

In terms of quaternary structure, SHOC2 forms a complex with MRAS and PP1C, acting as a scaffold that brings these proteins together. This interaction is mediated by the concave surface of SHOC2, which engages in polar and hydrophobic contacts with MRAS and PP1C (Kwon2022Structure–function; Hauseman2022Structure). The SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C complex is essential for the dephosphorylation of RAF, a key step in the RAS-MAPK pathway (Liau2022Structural).

## Function
The SHOC2 leucine-rich repeat scaffold protein plays a critical role in the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes such as cell motility, adhesion, and proliferation. SHOC2 acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of multiprotein complexes that modulate ERK1/2 activity by interacting with key signaling partners like Ras and RAF-1 (Jeoung2016Shoc2tranduced; Jang2014HUWE1). It enhances the dephosphorylation and activation of RAF-1 by recruiting protein phosphatase PP1c, thereby promoting ERK1/2 signaling (Galperin2012Shoc2).

SHOC2 is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1, which serves as a feedback mechanism to modulate the amplitude of RAF-ERK1/2 signals (Jang2020The). This ubiquitination process is crucial for the dynamic regulation of the SHOC2 complex assembly and ERK1/2 activity (Jang2015Spatial). SHOC2 is also involved in the spatial regulation of signaling, as it translocates to late endosomes upon epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, a process necessary for efficient ERK1/2 activation (Galperin2012Shoc2).

In healthy human cells, SHOC2 is expressed in all tissues and is vital for embryonic development, particularly in heart development, as its ablation leads to embryonic lethality (Jang2014HUWE1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SHOC2 gene are associated with several disorders, most notably Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair (NSLH), a condition characterized by developmental delays, distinctive facial features, and cardiac abnormalities. The most common pathogenic variant is the p.Ser2Gly mutation, which results in constitutive targeting of the SHOC2 protein to the plasma membrane, enhancing MAPK signaling and contributing to the NSLH phenotype (Motta2019Clinical; Wilson2023The). Other mutations, such as p.Met173Ile and c.807_808delinsTT, are linked to milder phenotypes resembling Noonan syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, with features like macrocephaly and speech delay (Motta2019Clinical).

SHOC2 mutations can also lead to a range of clinical features, including facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, and short stature, as seen in NSLH (Wilson2023The). The SHOC2-MRAS-PP1 complex plays a crucial role in regulating RAF activity, and mutations in SHOC2 can disrupt this regulation, contributing to the pathogenesis of Noonan syndrome (Young2018SHOC2–MRAS–PP1). Alterations in SHOC2 expression or interactions may also impact cell growth and differentiation, contributing to various pathologies, including cancer (Jang2020The).

## Interactions
The SHOC2 protein is a key component of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C holophosphatase complex, which plays a crucial role in the dephosphorylation of RAF kinases, particularly at the S259 site, facilitating RAF activation and subsequent MAPK pathway signaling (RodriguezViciana2006A; Young2018SHOC2–MRAS–PP1). SHOC2 interacts with MRAS in its GTP-bound state and PP1C, forming a stable ternary complex that is essential for its function as a RAF phosphatase (Liau2022Structural; Hauseman2022Structure). This interaction is characterized by a high degree of cooperativity, with SHOC2 acting as a scaffold that brings together MRAS and PP1C through its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain (Hauseman2022Structure).

Mutations in SHOC2, such as M173I, enhance its interaction with MRAS and PP1C, leading to increased complex stability and activity, which is associated with conditions like Noonan syndrome (Hauseman2022Structure; Young2018SHOC2–MRAS–PP1). SHOC2 also competes with RAF for binding to RAS, indicating its role in modulating the assembly and function of the RAS-RAF signaling complex (Hauseman2022Structure). These interactions highlight SHOC2's critical role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the context of MAPK pathway activation.
