# JUP

## Overview
JUP is a gene that encodes the protein junction plakoglobin, a critical component of cell-cell adhesion complexes, particularly in tissues that experience significant mechanical stress, such as the heart and skin. Junction plakoglobin is categorized as an intracellular adapter protein, playing a pivotal role in the structural integrity and function of desmosomes and adherens junctions. It is involved in linking intermediate filaments to cadherins, thereby maintaining tissue architecture and facilitating mechanical and electrical coupling in cardiac cells (Vahidnezhad2020Arrhythmogenic; Yeruva2020Adrenergic). The protein's interactions and post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are essential for its function in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Gaudry2001Tyrosinephosphorylated; Miravet2003Tyrosine). Mutations in the JUP gene are associated with several clinical conditions, including arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and Naxos disease, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular cohesion and tissue integrity (Kaviarasan2022Genetic; McKoy2000Identification).

## Structure
Plakoglobin, encoded by the JUP gene, is a protein characterized by a central domain composed of 12 armadillo repeats, each consisting of 42 amino acids. These repeats form a super helix structure with 36 small α-helices, which are crucial for its role in cell adhesion and signaling (Miravet2003Tyrosine). The armadillo domain is highly conserved and facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as desmogleins and desmoplakin, which are essential for the structural integrity of desmosomes and adherens junctions (Waschke2008The; Getsios2004Working).

Plakoglobin undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can significantly affect its interactions and functions. For example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylates plakoglobin, altering its association with desmosomal components (Gaudry2001Tyrosinephosphorylated; Miravet2003Tyrosine). The phosphorylation status of plakoglobin influences its subcellular localization and interaction with junctional binding partners (Gaudry2001Tyrosinephosphorylated).

The protein is also involved in nuclear signaling, similar to β-catenin, and participates in transcriptional regulation with TCF-4/LEF transcription factors (Waschke2008The). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
Junction plakoglobin (JUP) is a crucial intracellular adapter protein involved in cell-cell adhesion complexes, particularly in tissues subjected to high mechanical stress, such as the epidermis and heart muscle. In healthy cells, JUP plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of these tissues by connecting intermediate filaments to cadherins in desmosomes, which are structures that provide mechanical strength (Vahidnezhad2020Arrhythmogenic). In cardiomyocytes, JUP is essential for anchoring the myofibrillar apparatus to adherens junctions, ensuring myofibrillar compliance, and maintaining cardiac cell cohesion and structural integrity of intercalated discs (Yeruva2020Adrenergic). 

JUP is also involved in the ultrastructural organization of intercalated discs, contributing to the mechanical and electrical coupling of cardiac cells. It facilitates the interaction between desmoglein-2 and N-cadherin within intercalated discs, which is crucial for maintaining cell cohesion and structural remodeling in response to adrenergic signaling (Yeruva2020Adrenergic). The protein's role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways underscores its importance in maintaining tissue architecture and function (Costa2021Arrhythmogenic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the JUP gene, which encodes the junction plakoglobin protein, are associated with several clinical conditions. One of the primary diseases linked to JUP mutations is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a hereditary disorder characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Specific mutations such as p.R577C, p.V603L, and a 2 base pair deletion have been identified in ARVC patients, affecting the desmosome function crucial for cardiac cell adhesion (Kaviarasan2022Genetic; McKoy2000Identification). 

JUP mutations are also implicated in Naxos disease, a condition that combines ARVC with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair. This disease is caused by a homozygous deletion in the JUP gene, leading to a frameshift and premature termination of the plakoglobin protein, which disrupts cell-cell adhesion in heart and skin cells (McKoy2000Identification).

Additionally, JUP mutations have been associated with skin fragility issues and epidermolysis bullosa, a condition characterized by blistering of the skin (Kaviarasan2022Genetic). These mutations affect the stability of desmosome junctions, impacting the structural integrity of tissues where plakoglobin is expressed.

## Interactions
Junction plakoglobin (JUP) is a key component of the epithelial junctional complex, participating in various protein interactions that are crucial for cell adhesion and signaling. JUP acts as a cytoskeletal adaptor protein, linking membrane proteins of desmosomes, such as desmocollin-2 (DSC2) and desmoglein-2 (DSG2), to keratin-based intermediate filaments. It also interacts with plakophilins (PKP2 and PKP3) within the junctional complex (Paris2008The).

JUP is involved in phosphorylation-dependent regulatory processes, serving as a substrate for kinases like casein kinase 2 alpha 1 (CSNK2A1) and protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA), which phosphorylate structural proteins within the junctional complex. It is also targeted by receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases, such as PTPN1, which dephosphorylate adaptor proteins of adherens junctions and desmosomes (Paris2008The).

In addition to its structural role, JUP is part of a signaling platform that integrates regulatory interactions across diverse junctions. It interacts with catenin delta 1 (CTNND1) and is regulated by accessory nodes like SRC and PTPN6, highlighting its involvement in both structural and regulatory networks within the epithelial junctional complex (Paris2008The).
