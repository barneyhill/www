# KNG1

## Overview
The KNG1 gene encodes the protein kininogen 1, a nonenzymatic glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in the blood coagulation and kinin-kallikrein systems. Kininogen 1, also known as high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), is integral to the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, acting as a cofactor for the activation of factor XII and prekallikrein, thereby initiating the contact activation system (Cagliani2013Evolutionary; SabaterLleal2012A). This protein is also involved in the release of bradykinin, a peptide that mediates various physiological responses, including vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, linking coagulation with inflammatory processes (Cagliani2013Evolutionary). Kininogen 1's interactions with endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes underscore its multifaceted role in hemostasis and immune response (Pathak2018Cell). Mutations in the KNG1 gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as venous thrombosis, hereditary angioedema, and glioma, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Veronez2021The; Morange2011KNG1; Xu2018Overexpression).

## Structure
The KNG1 gene encodes high molecular weight kininogen (HK), a multidomain glycoprotein involved in blood coagulation. HK is composed of 626 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 70 kDa, although it appears as 120 kDa on SDS-PAGE due to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation (Ponczek2021High). The protein is organized into six distinct domains (D1-D6), with domains 1-3 belonging to the cysteine protease inhibitor family. The D5 domain is mutable and varies across species, being shorter in amphibians, birds, and turtles, and absent in lizards and snakes. The D6 domain is conserved across all tetrapods, indicating its importance in carrying prekallikrein (PK) in terrestrial vertebrates (Ponczek2021High).

HK circulates in plasma at a concentration of about 70 µg/mL and is primarily expressed by hepatocytes. It forms non-covalent complexes with plasma prekallikrein and coagulation factor XI, facilitating their localization on negatively charged surfaces. HK is cleaved by plasma kallikrein to release bradykinin, a peptide with significant physiological effects such as vasodilation and increased vascular permeability (Ponczek2021High). Despite its importance, the atomic structure of HK remains unknown, as traditional methods like crystallization have been ineffective. However, computational tools like AlphaFold have been used to predict its structure (Ponczek2021High).

## Function
The KNG1 gene encodes high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK), a nonenzymatic glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in the contact system, part of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. In healthy human cells, HMWK acts as a cofactor for the activation of factor XII (FXII) and prekallikrein, initiating the contact pathway of coagulation, which is essential for blood clotting processes (Cagliani2013Evolutionary; SabaterLleal2012A). HMWK complexes with and stabilizes factor XI (FXI) in plasma, influencing FXI levels and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which are critical for understanding coagulation disorders (SabaterLleal2012A).

HMWK is also involved in the kinin-kallikrein system, where it is cleaved by plasma kallikrein to release bradykinin, a vasoactive peptide that increases vascular permeability, causes hypotension, and induces smooth muscle contraction and fever (Cagliani2013Evolutionary). This process links coagulation with inflammatory responses and plays a role in host defense during tissue damage and infection. HMWK's interaction with negatively charged surfaces and its cleavage by kallikrein highlight its role in both coagulation and inflammation, underscoring its importance in maintaining hemostatic balance and modulating immune responses (Cagliani2013Evolutionary).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KNG1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. The rs710446-C allele in KNG1 is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis (VT) and decreased activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which are indicators of coagulation abnormalities (Morange2011KNG1). Additionally, a homozygous nonsense variant in KNG1, resulting in a truncated high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) protein, has been identified in a Chinese family. This mutation leads to severe HMWK deficiency, characterized by prolonged aPTT, although affected individuals do not exhibit bleeding disorders, suggesting that the contact activation system does not significantly contribute to physiological hemostasis (Yang2020Severe).

In glioma, a type of brain tumor, KNG1 expression is significantly reduced. Overexpression of KNG1 in glioma cells has been shown to inhibit cell viability and angiogenesis, promote apoptosis, and cause cell cycle arrest, suggesting a potential protective role against tumor progression (Xu2018Overexpression).

Furthermore, a mutation in KNG1 has been implicated in hereditary angioedema (HAE), a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling. The p.Met379Lys mutation in KNG1 is associated with HAE, likely affecting the bradykinin-forming process, which is crucial in the pathophysiology of the disease (Veronez2021The).

## Interactions
The KNG1 gene encodes high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), which participates in several critical interactions within the blood coagulation pathway. HK forms non-covalent complexes with plasma prekallikrein (PK) and coagulation factor XI (fXI), facilitating their localization next to factor XII on negatively charged surfaces, which is essential for blood coagulation (Ponczek2021High). HK also binds to endothelial cell receptors such as gC1q-R, uPAR, and CK1, with gC1q-R showing the highest affinity. These interactions are crucial for the activation of the contact activation system (CAS) and involve Zn2+-dependent binding (Pathak2018Cell).

HK interacts with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria, binding with high affinity and influencing cytokine production during endotoxemia. This interaction does not require zinc and involves the formation of HK-LPS complexes (Yang2017An). HK also binds to platelets through the GPIbα receptor and to leukocytes via the Mac-1 integrin receptor, enhancing interactions between these cell types and contributing to immuno-thrombosis (Pathak2018Cell). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of HK in coagulation, immune response, and inflammation.
