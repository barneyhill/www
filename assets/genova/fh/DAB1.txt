# DAB1

## Overview
The DAB1 gene encodes the DAB adaptor protein 1, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that plays a pivotal role in intracellular signaling, particularly within the Reelin signaling pathway. This protein is integral to neuronal migration and positioning during brain development, functioning as a docking protein that facilitates interactions between Reelin and downstream signaling molecules. DAB1 is characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is essential for its interactions with proteins containing NPXY motifs, such as those in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and low-density lipoprotein receptor families (Howell1999The). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation, which is crucial for its function in signal transduction pathways (Gao2012SpliceMediated). Beyond its role in neuronal cells, DAB1 is also involved in endothelial cell function within the central nervous system, highlighting its importance in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the brain (Segarra2018Endothelial). Alterations in the DAB1 gene have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, underscoring its clinical significance (Nawa2020Rare; Ramsden2023ApoER2Dab1).

## Structure
The DAB1 protein is characterized by its phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins in signal transduction pathways. This domain binds to NPXY motifs found in transmembrane proteins such as those in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and low-density lipoprotein receptor families (Howell1999The). The PTB domain is unique in that it does not bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide ligands but instead interacts with phospholipid bilayers containing phosphatidylinositol 4P (PtdIns4P) or PtdIns4,5P2 (Howell1999The).

The DAB1 protein undergoes post-translational modifications, primarily phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, which is essential for its function. These phosphorylation sites are recognized by SH2 domain-containing proteins, facilitating various signaling pathways (Gao2012SpliceMediated). Alternative splicing of the DAB1 gene results in multiple isoforms, each with different combinations of tyrosine phosphorylation motifs, affecting its ability to activate Src and recruit SH2 domains (Gao2012SpliceMediated).

The molecular structure of DAB1 includes a cluster of five tyrosines and a C-terminal region with consensus sequences for serine/threonine kinase Cdk5 (Costagli2006Identification). The protein's structure is further defined by its involvement in the Reelin signaling pathway, crucial for neuronal migration during brain development (Costagli2006Identification).

## Function
The DAB1 gene encodes a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that plays a crucial role in the Reelin signaling pathway, which is essential for neuronal migration and positioning during brain development. DAB1 functions as a docking protein, facilitating interactions between Reelin and downstream signaling molecules. This interaction is critical for the phosphorylation of DAB1 on tyrosine residues, a process necessary for the proper positioning of neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Howell2000Dab1). 

In healthy cells, DAB1 interacts with the ApoER2 and VLDLR receptors on the surface of neurons, which are activated by Reelin binding. This activation leads to the phosphorylation of DAB1 by Src family kinases, initiating a signaling cascade that regulates neuronal migration and placement (Pramatarova2008A). DAB1 is also involved in the regulation of neuronal adhesion to radial glial fibers, which is crucial for the detachment and proper migration of neurons during corticogenesis (Sanada2004Disabled1Regulated).

DAB1 signaling is not limited to neuronal cells; it also plays a role in endothelial cells within the central nervous system, influencing neuro-glia-vessel communication and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (Segarra2018Endothelial). This highlights the multifaceted role of DAB1 in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the brain.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DAB1 gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Rare single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in DAB1, such as the missense mutations G382C and V129I, have been studied for their potential association with schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although no statistically significant association was found, the G382C variant, which was not present in public databases, may affect neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity through changes in Reelin-DAB1 signaling, potentially contributing to SCZ and ASD susceptibility (Nawa2020Rare).

DAB1 is also involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disruption of the ApoER2-Dab1 signaling pathway is linked to the accumulation of pathological tau protein (pTau) and amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, which are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. This disruption may lead to neurodegeneration by affecting neuronal integrity and synaptic function, particularly in the early stages of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (Ramsden2023ApoER2Dab1).

In psychiatric disorders, transient downregulation of DAB1 during development can result in structural and behavioral deficits, such as memory impairments and increased anxiety-like behavior, which are associated with conditions like schizophrenia (Teixeira2013Transient).

## Interactions
DAB1 (DAB adaptor protein 1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular signaling pathways. DAB1 interacts with the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1) through its protein-interaction (PI) domain. This interaction has been confirmed in yeast cells, cell-free extracts, and intact mammalian cells, indicating a strong physical interaction in vivo (Homayouni1999Disabled1). DAB1 also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APLP2, although with varying affinities, with the strongest binding to APLP1 (Homayouni1999Disabled1).

DAB1 interacts with the Alpha2 subunit of the Pafah1b complex and Lis1, but Alpha2 interferes with the formation of the DAB1-Lis1 complex by binding to either DAB1 or Lis1 individually. This suggests a potential trimeric complex involving VLDLR, DAB1, and Alpha2 (Zhang2009Differential). DAB1 also binds to Fe65, APP, and LRP, modulating their interactions and affecting APP processing (Kwon2010Dab1).

DAB1's phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain binds to proteins containing ⌽XNPXY sequences, such as APP, APLP1, APLP2, and LRP, and also interacts with phospholipids, specifically PtdIns4P and PtdIns4,5P2 (Howell1999The). These interactions are important for DAB1's function in membrane interactions and signal transduction.
