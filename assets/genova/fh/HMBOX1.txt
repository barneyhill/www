# HMBOX1

## Overview
HMBOX1 is a gene that encodes the homeobox containing 1 protein, a transcriptional repressor involved in various cellular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, and immune response regulation. The protein is characterized by a homeobox domain, which facilitates DNA binding, and is highly conserved across multiple species, indicating its evolutionary importance (Zhao2018HMBOX1; Chen2006Isolation). HMBOX1 is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm but can translocate to the nucleus to exert its regulatory functions. It plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by interacting with other proteins, such as Metallothionein 2A, and regulating intracellular zinc levels (Ma2015HMBOX1). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and immune disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Tu2022ExosomeDerived; Zhou2017Knockdown).

## Structure
The HMBOX1 protein is encoded by a gene composed of 10 exons, spanning approximately 160 kb on chromosome 8, specifically between bands 8p12 and 8p21.1. The open reading frame of HMBOX1 is 1,263 base pairs, encoding a protein with 421 amino acids and a molecular mass of 47.25 kDa. The protein has an acidic isoelectric point of 5.72 (Chen2006Isolation; Su2010Role).

HMBOX1 contains a homeobox domain, a conserved DNA-binding motif, located between amino acids 267 and 344. This domain is characterized by a helix-turn-helix structure, which includes two alpha-helices and a short turn, facilitating DNA binding through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Chen2006Isolation). Additionally, the N-terminus of HMBOX1 potentially matches the HNF1_N domain, spanning amino acids 18 to 235 (Chen2006Isolation).

The protein is highly conserved across species, including humans, mice, rats, chickens, and Xenopus laevis (Zhao2018HMBOX1; Chen2006Isolation). While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures, post-translational modifications, and splice variant isoforms are not provided, a novel splicing variant, HMBOX1b, has been identified, which may function differently from the primary isoform (Jiang2023HMBOX1).

## Function
The HMBOX1 gene encodes a transcriptional repressor protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes. It is involved in regulating apoptosis and autophagy in vascular endothelial cells (VECs), particularly in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HMBOX1 interacts with Metallothionein 2A (MT2A) to regulate intracellular free zinc levels, which is crucial for its anti-apoptotic and pro-autophagic effects. Overexpression of HMBOX1 inhibits apoptosis and promotes autophagy, while its knockdown induces apoptosis and inhibits autophagy (Ma2015HMBOX1).

HMBOX1 is also implicated in the differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into endothelial cells, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal VEC function (Ma2015HMBOX1). In the immune system, HMBOX1 negatively regulates the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in natural killer (NK) cells, acting as a transcriptional repressor to modulate immune responses (Wu2011HMBOX1).

The protein is expressed in various human tissues and is primarily located in the cytoplasm, with some presence in the nucleus, suggesting it may translocate to the nucleus in response to stimuli to regulate gene transcription (Chen2006Isolation). HMBOX1's role in these processes underscores its importance in cellular homeostasis and function.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HMBOX1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cervical cancer cells, knockdown of HMBOX1 increases radiosensitivity, leading to enhanced apoptosis and impaired DNA damage repair. This suggests that HMBOX1 plays a role in cancer cell survival and proliferation, making it a potential target in radiotherapy for cervical cancer (Zhou2017Knockdown).

In the context of sepsis, exosomes derived from sepsis patients' blood have been shown to decrease HMBOX1 expression in cardiomyocytes, promoting pyroptosis and increasing inflammatory cytokines. This process is mediated by the miR-885-5p/HMBOX1 axis, where miR-885-5p negatively regulates HMBOX1 expression. Overexpression of HMBOX1 can reverse the inflammatory effects induced by miR-885-5p, highlighting its potential therapeutic role in septic myocardial depression (Tu2022ExosomeDerived).

In vascular endothelial cells, HMBOX1 is involved in regulating apoptosis and autophagy. Its knockdown leads to increased apoptosis, which is linked to various vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and hypertension. HMBOX1's interaction with MT2A and its regulation of intracellular zinc levels are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis in these cells (Ma2015HMBOX1).

## Interactions
HMBOX1, a transcription factor, is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cellular processes. One significant interaction is with Metallothionein 2A (MT2A) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid assay and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, demonstrating that HMBOX1 and MT2A physically interact in these cells (Ma2015HMBOX1). The interaction with MT2A is crucial for regulating intracellular free zinc levels, which in turn affects apoptosis and autophagy. Overexpression of HMBOX1 increases intracellular zinc levels, promoting autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis, while knockdown of MT2A inhibits this effect (Ma2015HMBOX1).

HMBOX1 also acts as a transcriptional repressor, binding directly to telomeric double-stranded DNA, which is involved in telomere maintenance and alternative lengthening (Zhao2018HMBOX1). In the context of liver cancer, HMBOX1 inhibits the p38/AKT/mTOR pathway, promoting autophagy and suppressing cancer progression (Zhao2018Homeobox). Additionally, HMBOX1 is targeted by miR-18a in glioma cells, where miR-18a binds to the 3'UTR of HMBOX1, reducing its expression and affecting cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (Zhou2018cFosmicroRNA18a).
