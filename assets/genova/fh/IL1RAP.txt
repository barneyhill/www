# IL1RAP

## Overview
The IL1RAP gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein, a critical component of the interleukin-1 receptor complex involved in immune and inflammatory responses. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane receptor and plays a pivotal role in facilitating the signaling of interleukin-1 (IL-1) by forming a complex with IL-1 receptors, thereby enhancing their affinity for IL-1 ligands. The interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein is integral to the MyD88/IRAK/TRAF6 signaling pathway, which is essential for the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune cell recruitment (Boraschi2013The; Mitchell2018IL1RAP). IL1RAP is expressed at low levels in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells but is upregulated in various malignancies, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Ågerstam2015Antibodies; De2020The). The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms, including soluble forms that modulate its signaling capabilities (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The).

## Structure
The IL1RAP gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein, which is a critical component of the IL-1 receptor complex. The primary structure of IL1RAP includes a precursor protein that is 570 amino acids long, with a transmembrane form encoded by 12 exons, excluding exon 9b (Boraschi2013The). The protein is part of the Ig domain subgroup of TIR receptors, characterized by immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular portion and a Toll-IL-1R (TIR) signaling domain in its intracellular portion (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2022What).

IL1RAP undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms. A soluble form, sIL-1R3, is produced by splicing after exon 9, lacking the transmembrane and intracellular domains (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The). Another variant, sIL-1RAcPβ, is a unique soluble receptor generated by omitting exons 9 and 9b (Boraschi2013The; Boraschi2017The). The IL1RAPb isoform, found in neuronal cells, cannot recruit canonical downstream signaling proteins but modulates neuronal gene expression (Landuzzi2024IL1).

The quaternary structure of IL1RAP involves forming high-affinity trimeric complexes with ligand-bound IL-1R family chains, essential for signal transduction (Boraschi2017The). The protein's rigidity within these complexes may explain its inability to bind IL-1 cytokines directly (Boraschi2017The).

## Function
The IL1RAP gene encodes the interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein, which is a crucial component of the interleukin-1 receptor complex. In healthy human cells, IL1RAP is minimally expressed in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and is involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. It acts as a coreceptor for the IL-1 receptor, facilitating the transmission of IL-1 signaling, which leads to the activation of proinflammatory gene expression and cell survival pathways (Ågerstam2015Antibodies; Mitchell2018IL1RAP).

IL1RAP is directly upstream of the MyD88/IRAK1/IRAK4/TRAF6 signaling axis, which is part of the innate immune response. This pathway is crucial for the secretion of cytokines like IL-6 and the expression of adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, which are involved in the recruitment of immune cells to sites of infection (Mitchell2018IL1RAP). Despite its role in inflammation, IL1RAP is not essential for the steady-state phenotype in mammals, as knockout studies in mice have shown no major phenotypic abnormalities, indicating that it is dispensable for normal hematopoietic stem cell function and healthy hematopoiesis (Mitchell2018IL1RAP).

## Clinical Significance
IL1RAP (interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein) is implicated in several hematological malignancies and solid tumors due to its altered expression and interactions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IL1RAP is overexpressed in leukemic stem cells and is associated with the activation of oncogenic pathways involving FLT3 and c-KIT, contributing to disease progression and poor prognosis (De2020The; Mitchell2018IL1RAP). Its expression is linked to a proinflammatory state that favors leukemic proliferation over normal hematopoiesis, making it a potential therapeutic target (De2020The).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), IL1RAP is upregulated in CD34+ cells and is associated with the expression of the P210 BCR/ABL1 fusion protein, a hallmark of CML. This upregulation suggests IL1RAP as a leukemia-associated antigen, potentially aiding in the identification and targeting of CML stem cells (Järås2010Isolation).

IL1RAP is also involved in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), where its high expression correlates with worse prognostic outcomes. It interacts with proteins like MAPK3 and RAC1, influencing tumor proliferation and migration (Lv2021The). In Ewing sarcoma, IL1RAP is identified as a key driver of metastasis by suppressing anoikis, a form of cell death, thus promoting tumor survival and spread (Zhang2021Proteomic).

## Interactions
IL1RAP (interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in immune signaling. It forms a complex with IL-1 receptors (IL-1RI and IL-1RII), enhancing their affinity for IL-1, and recruits several intracellular proteins and kinases, including Toll-interacting protein (Tollip), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), members of the IL-1R associated kinase (IRAK) family, and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6). These interactions trigger signaling cascades leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Frenay2022IL1RAP).

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IL1RAP physically interacts with receptor tyrosine kinases FLT3 and c-KIT, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation and flow cytometric Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays. These interactions occur at close physical distances, suggesting a significant role in AML pathogenesis by amplifying oncogenic signaling pathways (Mitchell2018IL1RAP).

In Ewing sarcoma cells, IL1RAP forms a complex with CD98 and xCT, components of the system Xc- cystine transporter. The interaction with CD98 involves a disulfide bond, while the association with xCT is independent of CD98, indicating IL1RAP's role in larger protein complexes (Zhang2021Proteomic).
