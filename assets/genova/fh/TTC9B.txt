# TTC9B

## Overview
TTC9B is a gene that encodes the protein tetratricopeptide repeat domain 9B, which is characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. These domains are crucial for mediating protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes, playing significant roles in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation, protein folding, and signal transduction. The TTC9B protein is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is notably expressed in the brain, suggesting a potential role in brain-specific functions and cellular stress responses. Although the precise functions of TTC9B in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in estrogen signaling and may influence synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. The gene's expression is modulated by gonadal hormones, indicating its involvement in hormonal regulation and potential relevance to conditions such as postpartum depression (Wang2010Microarray; Osborne2015Replication).

## Structure
The human tetratricopeptide repeat protein 9B (TTC9B) is a 239-residue protein characterized by a Pro-rich segment and two tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). The Pro-rich segment spans residues 17-50, while the TPRs are located at residues 65-99 and 171-204 (Van2020Intrinsic). TPR motifs typically form a helix-turn-helix structure, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Van2020Intrinsic). 

TTC9B exhibits significant intrinsic disorder, particularly within its N-terminal half, which can be approximated as one long intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) spanning residues 1-140 (Van2020Intrinsic). This region includes the first TPR, which overlaps with the longest of three molecular recognition features (MoRFs) located at residues 1-16, 52-98, and 140-146 (Van2020Intrinsic). The protein also contains a majority of its phosphorylation sites within this disordered region (Van2020Intrinsic).

TTC9B has an alternative splicing-generated isoform, where the C-terminal region (residues 143-239) is altered to a shorter sequence, resulting in a completely disordered form of the protein. This isoform is characterized by a high percentage of predicted disordered residues (PPDR = 93.0 ± 6.0%) and an average disorder score (ADS = 0.787 ± 0.010) (Van2020Intrinsic).

## Function
The TTC9B gene encodes a protein that contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes. These domains are involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, protein folding, and signal transduction. TTC9B is primarily active in the cytoplasm and may play a role in cellular stress responses and development (Wang2010Microarray).

In the brain, TTC9B is significantly expressed, with a mean expression level 13.64-fold higher than in other tissues, suggesting a strong brain-selective expression pattern. However, the specific function of TTC9B in the brain or in healthy human cells remains unclear (Wang2010Microarray). The gene's expression is responsive to gonadal hormones and is associated with estrogen signaling, which may be relevant to its function in modulating hippocampal synaptic plasticity (Osborne2015Replication).

TTC9B may also be involved in feedback inhibition mechanisms related to estrogen signaling, similar to its homolog TTC9A, which regulates estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) levels. This suggests that TTC9B could have a role in estrogen sensitivity and related cellular processes (Osborne2015Replication).

## Clinical Significance
The TTC9B gene has been implicated in the development of postpartum depression (PPD) through its role in estrogen sensitivity and synaptic plasticity. Variations in the DNA methylation of TTC9B have been associated with PPD, suggesting that epigenetic changes at this locus may contribute to the condition by affecting hormonal regulation during pregnancy (Osborne2015Replication; Guintivano2014Antenatal). Studies have shown that TTC9B is responsive to gonadal hormones, and its expression may be influenced by changes in estrogen levels, which are critical during the postpartum period (McEvoy2017Reproductive; Payne2020DNA).

The predictive accuracy of TTC9B as a biomarker for PPD has been demonstrated in several studies, with models incorporating its methylation status achieving high accuracy in identifying women at risk for PPD (Payne2020DNA; Osborne2015Replication). These findings suggest that TTC9B may serve as a valuable tool for early screening and intervention in PPD, potentially allowing for targeted therapeutic strategies (Kaminsky2020Epigenetic). The gene's involvement in synaptic plasticity and estrogen signaling further underscores its clinical significance in mood disorders related to hormonal changes (Osborne2015Replication).
