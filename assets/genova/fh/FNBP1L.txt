# FNBP1L

## Overview
FNBP1L, or formin-binding protein 1-like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical component of cellular structure and dynamics. The protein, categorized as a cytoskeletal-associated protein, features an N-terminal F-BAR domain and a C-terminal SH3 domain, which facilitate its interactions with phospholipid membranes and other proteins, respectively (Heath2008FBAR; Cvrčková2013Formins). These interactions are essential for processes such as endocytosis, cell motility, and actin polymerization. FNBP1L plays a significant role in cellular functions, including cell shape regulation, polarity, and motility, and is implicated in neurodevelopmental processes and autophagic pathways (Cao2024Mechanistic; Wu2017Cyclic). Additionally, it has been associated with cognitive function, highlighting its potential importance in both developmental and physiological contexts (Benyamin2013Childhood).

## Structure
FNBP1L, also known as formin-binding protein 1-like, is characterized by its structural domains that facilitate its role in cytoskeletal organization. The protein contains an N-terminal F-BAR domain, which is involved in membrane binding and curvature, forming a crescent-shaped structure that interacts with phospholipid membranes (Heath2008FBAR; Cvrčková2013Formins). This domain is crucial for its function in processes like endocytosis and cell motility. 

In addition to the F-BAR domain, FNBP1L has a C-terminal SH3 domain, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions, particularly with proteins such as formins and N-WASP, facilitating actin polymerization (Wu2017Cyclic; Cvrčková2013Formins). The SH3 domain allows FNBP1L to interact with other proteins, such as DAAM1, contributing to its role in cytoskeletal dynamics (Cvrčková2013Formins).

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity, although specific details on these modifications are not provided in the context. There is also a possibility of splice variant isoforms, which could lead to different functional roles, but specific isoforms are not detailed in the available information.

## Function
The FNBP1L gene encodes the formin-binding protein 1-like protein, which plays a crucial role in actin cytoskeleton organization. It interacts with proteins such as Cdc42 and N-WASP, facilitating the activation of N-WASP, which is essential for the actin-nucleating activity of the Arp2/3 complex. This activity is vital for the polymerization of actin filaments, contributing to cytoskeletal remodeling and cell movement (Benyamin2013Childhood; Wu2017Cyclic).

FNBP1L is involved in regulating cell shape, polarity, and motility, and it has been associated with neurodevelopmental processes. It plays a role in autophagic biochemical processes, particularly through its interaction with the HR1 domain and human Atg3 protein, which is necessary for autophagic signaling pathways (Cao2024Mechanistic; Huett2009Building).

In the context of mechanical stress, such as cyclic stretch in human periodontal ligament cells, FNBP1L is involved in the regulation of actin filament dynamics, contributing to cytoskeletal rearrangement and cellular realignment (Wu2017Cyclic). Additionally, FNBP1L has been linked to cognitive function, with studies suggesting its association with intelligence in both children and adults (Benyamin2013Childhood).

## Interactions
The FNBP1L gene encodes the formin-binding protein 1-like protein, which is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. FNBP1L interacts with the human Atg3 protein, a connection necessary for autophagic biochemical processes, particularly in macrophage function (Cao2024Mechanistic). It also plays a role in antibacterial autophagy by interacting with ATG3, which is essential for the autophagy of internalized Salmonella typhimurium (Huett2009Building).

FNBP1L is involved in the polymerization and depolymerization of microfilaments, interacting with Cdc42 and the Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP). This interaction facilitates the activation of N-WASP, which is crucial for the actin-nucleating activity of the actin-related protein-2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, contributing to actin filament polymerization and cytoskeletal remodeling (Wu2017Cyclic).

In the context of kidney podocytes, FNBP1L is identified as a junctional and actin-organizing protein, co-localizing with podocin in the glomeruli, suggesting a potential interaction or association with podocin (Gerlach2023Mapping). This interaction is part of its role in maintaining the integrity of the podocyte foot process through its association with the actin cytoskeleton (Gerlach2023Mapping).
