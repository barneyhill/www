# LIMK2

## Overview
LIMK2, or LIM domain kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. The protein product of LIMK2, also referred to as LIM domain kinase 2, is characterized by its distinct domain architecture, which includes two LIM domains, a PDZ domain, and a kinase domain. These structural features facilitate its role in phosphorylating cofilin and actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF), leading to actin cytoskeletal reorganization. LIMK2 is a critical component of the Rho family GTPase signaling pathways and is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell migration, cell cycle progression, and neuronal differentiation. Its activity is modulated by phosphorylation and interactions with other proteins, making it a significant player in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions such as cancer and neurological disorders (Villalonga2023LIM; AMANO2001LIM-kinase; Bernard2007Lim).

## Structure
LIMK2 (LIM domain kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase characterized by its distinct domain architecture, which includes two N-terminal LIM domains, an internal PDZ domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain (Manetti2011LIM; AMANO2001LIM-kinase). The LIM domains are involved in protein-protein interactions and are stabilized by zinc ions, contributing to the structural integrity of the protein (Chatterjee2022Structural). The PDZ domain is a globular protein interaction module that may regulate the activity of the kinase domain (Chatterjee2022Structural).

The kinase domain of LIMK2 is responsible for its enzymatic activity, specifically phosphorylating cofilin and actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) at Ser-3, which leads to actin cytoskeletal reorganization (AMANO2001LIM-kinase). The kinase domain contains a consensus sequence typical of protein kinases and an unusual DLNSHN sequence in subdomain VIB of the catalytic region (Manetti2011LIM). LIMK2 also features a basic amino acid-rich motif between the PDZ and kinase domains, in addition to the basic region found within the kinase domain itself (Manetti2011LIM).

LIMK2 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation at Thr-505, which is crucial for its activation and function in stress fiber and focal adhesion formation (AMANO2001LIM-kinase). Splice variants of LIMK2 may exist, potentially leading to isoforms with distinct functions (Manetti2011LIM).

## Function
LIM domain kinase 2 (LIMK2) is a serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in regulating cytoskeleton dynamics by controlling actin filaments and microtubule turnover. It primarily functions through the phosphorylation of cofilin, an actin depolymerizing factor, which inactivates cofilin and leads to the accumulation of filamentous actin (F-actin) and actin stress fiber formation. This process is essential for various biological processes, including cell cycle progression, cell migration, and neuronal differentiation (Villalonga2023LIM; Bernard2007Lim).

LIMK2 is part of the Rho family GTPase signal transduction pathways and is activated by phosphorylation at Thr505. It is involved in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, regulated by nuclear localization signals (NLS) and nuclear export signals (NES). This shuttling is influenced by the deletion of LIM domains, with LIM1 playing a crucial role in its cytoplasmic localization (Manetti2011LIM).

In healthy human cells, LIMK2 is expressed in specific cell types, such as elongated spermatids in the testis, suggesting a cell-specific function distinct from its homolog LIMK1. Subcellularly, LIMK2 is found in cytoplasmic punctae resembling endosomes, indicating different cellular functions or substrates compared to LIMK1 (Bernard2007Lim).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in LIMK2 expression and function have been implicated in various cancers. In bladder cancer, LIMK2 acts as an oncogene, with its overexpression linked to increased cell motility, invasion, and tumor growth. This overexpression is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis, contributing to cancer metastasis (Wang2018LIMK2). In colorectal cancer, LIMK2 expression is significantly reduced, correlating with tumor progression and poorer patient survival. This reduction is thought to relieve constraints on gastrointestinal stem cell proliferation, potentially due to promoter methylation (Lourenço2013Reduced).

In castration-resistant prostate cancer, LIMK2 expression is upregulated, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Knockdown of LIMK2 in experimental models results in significant tumor regression, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Nikhil2019Identification). In triple-negative breast cancer, LIMK2 overexpression is linked to metastatic progression, and its inhibition can block these metastatic attributes (Malvi2020LIMK2).

LIMK2 also plays a role in neurological disorders, where its dysregulation can lead to neuronal necrosis and impaired mitochondrial function, suggesting its involvement in neurotoxicity (Villalonga2023LIM). These findings underscore the clinical significance of LIMK2 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
LIMK2 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cancer progression and cellular dynamics. In prostate cancer, LIMK2 phosphorylates NKX-3.1 on Ser185, which is crucial for NKX-3.1 ubiquitination and degradation, promoting cellular growth and migration. It also phosphorylates PTEN, contributing to its degradation, and interacts with SPOP, affecting its stability and function (Villalonga2023LIM). In breast cancer, LIMK2 interacts with Aurora kinase A (AURKA), enhancing its levels and activity by inhibiting its degradation. It also targets SRPK1, involved in mRNA splicing, contributing to metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (Villalonga2023LIM; Malvi2020LIMK2).

LIMK2 is involved in cytoskeleton remodeling through interactions with MT1-MMP, facilitating matrix degradation and tumor invasion (Villalonga2023LIM). It also interacts with β-catenin in colorectal cancer, promoting its nuclear translocation and activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Zhang2018Imbalanced). LIMK2's interactions with small Rho family GTPases, such as Rac and Cdc42, regulate its activation and influence cell motility and morphology (Manetti2011LIM). These interactions highlight LIMK2's role in various signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
