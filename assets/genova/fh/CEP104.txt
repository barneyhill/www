# CEP104

## Overview
CEP104 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 104, a critical component involved in ciliogenesis and Hedgehog signaling pathways. The protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein and is essential for the elongation of the ciliary axoneme, a process vital for cellular signaling and movement. Centrosomal protein 104 contains several functional domains, including a jelly-roll fold and a tumor-overexpressed gene (TOG) domain, which contribute to its microtubule-polymerizing activity and interactions with other proteins such as CSPP1. This protein plays a significant role in the ciliary trafficking of key signaling molecules, including Smoothened and GPR161, which are crucial for the transduction of Hedgehog signals. Mutations in the CEP104 gene have been linked to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy characterized by neurological and developmental abnormalities, as well as age-related hearing loss, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal cellular and physiological functions (Yamazoe2020Roles; Luo2019Whole; Di2020New).

## Structure
CEP104 is a centrosomal protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cilium elongation and Hedgehog signaling. The protein contains a jelly-roll fold (JR fold) at the N-terminus, which partially contributes to its microtubule-polymerizing activity and interacts with CSPP1, a protein involved in cilium elongation (Yamazoe2020Roles). The central region of CEP104 features a tumor-overexpressed gene (TOG) domain, which is crucial for microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulins. This activity is essential for the cilium-elongating function of CEP104, and mutations impairing this binding abolish its activity (Yamazoe2020Roles).

The C-terminal region of CEP104 includes four tandem zinc-finger (ZF) repeats and an SXIP motif, although these are not necessary for cilium elongation, indicating that binding to proteins such as CP110, NEK1, or EB1 is not required for this function (Yamazoe2020Roles). CEP104 is also involved in the ciliary import of Smoothened and export of GPR161 in Hedgehog signaling, with the TOG domain playing a critical role in this process (Yamazoe2020Roles). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, potentially affecting its function and localization.

## Function
CEP104 (centrosomal protein 104) is a crucial component in the process of ciliogenesis, specifically involved in the elongation of the ciliary axoneme rather than the initiation of cilium formation. It localizes to the tip of the elongating axoneme and is essential for the proper elongation of cilia, which are vital for cellular signaling and movement (Yamazoe2020Roles). The TOG domain of CEP104 exhibits microtubule-polymerizing activity, which is necessary for cilium elongation, as it promotes the polymerization of microtubules, a critical process for maintaining cilium length (Yamazoe2020Roles).

CEP104 also plays a significant role in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling by regulating the ciliary trafficking of key signaling molecules such as Smoothened (Smo) and GPR161. It facilitates the ciliary entry of Smo and the export of GPR161, which are essential for the proper transduction of Hh signals (Yamazoe2020Roles). Mutations in CEP104 are linked to Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy, highlighting its importance in healthy cellular function and normal brain development (Yamazoe2020Roles; Luo2019Whole).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP104 gene are associated with Joubert syndrome (JBTS), a ciliopathy characterized by mid-and hindbrain hypotrophy, ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, retinal dystrophy, nephronophthisis, and liver fibrosis. These mutations affect the ciliary transport of Hedgehog-related transmembrane proteins, contributing to the symptoms of JBTS (Yamazoe2020Roles). CEP104 is crucial for cilium elongation and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, and its dysfunction can lead to defects in ciliary length and function, which are implicated in the development of ciliopathies like Joubert syndrome (Saunders2024A).

CEP104 mutations have also been linked to age-related hearing loss (ARHL). In human retinal pigment cells, knockdown of CEP104 results in severe defects in ciliogenesis, with structural deformities at the ciliary tips. A mutant allele detected in an ARHL patient enhances proteasomal and lysosomal protein degradation, leading to a quantitative loss of the mutant CEP104, which is likely insufficient for normal function (Di2020New). Although the case described does not display Joubert syndrome symptoms, older cases of Joubert syndrome might develop progressive, late-onset sensorineural hearing loss, overlapping with ARHL (Di2020New).

## Interactions
CEP104 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cilium elongation and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. It binds to centriolar capping proteins CP110 and CEP97 at the distal ends of centrioles in nonciliated cells. Upon cell-cycle exit, CP110 and CEP97 are removed from the mother centriole, allowing CEP104 to translocate to the tip of the elongating cilium. However, CEP104 is not involved in the centriolar removal of CP110 (Yamazoe2020Roles; Tsang2013CP110).

CEP104 interacts with CSPP1 through its N-terminal JR-fold-containing region, which is involved in cilium elongation. The TOG domain of CEP104 binds to tubulins and exhibits microtubule (MT)-polymerizing activity, essential for cilium elongation. CEP104 also binds to EB1, although this interaction is not necessary for its localization or function (Yamazoe2020Roles).

CEP104 is involved in the ciliary trafficking of Smoothened (Smo) and GPR161, crucial for Hh signaling. The TOG domain is critical for this function, while the JR fold may play a role in Smo trafficking. CEP104's JR fold is structurally related to IFT25, which, along with IFT27, forms a sub-complex essential for ciliary function (Yamazoe2020Roles).
