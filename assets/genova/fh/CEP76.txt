# CEP76

## Overview
CEP76 is a gene that encodes the centrosomal protein 76, a crucial regulatory component involved in the control of centriole duplication within the cell cycle. As a centrosomal protein, it plays a pivotal role in ensuring that centrioles replicate only once per cell cycle, thereby maintaining genomic stability. The protein interacts with other centrosomal proteins such as CP110 and Cep97, forming complexes that are essential for inhibiting centriole reduplication. Additionally, CEP76 is involved in regulating PLK1 activity during mitosis, which is vital for proper spindle orientation and cell division. Mutations in the CEP76 gene have been linked to male infertility and certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both reproductive health and oncogenesis (Tsang2009Cep76; Takeda2020The; Houston2023CEP76).

## Function
CEP76 is a centrosomal protein that plays a crucial role in regulating centriole duplication, ensuring that centrioles replicate only once per cell cycle. It interacts with CP110 and Cep97, forming distinct assemblies that are separate from CP110-centrin complexes. CEP76 localizes to centrosomes and its protein levels oscillate during the cell cycle, peaking during the S and G2 phases and decreasing as cells re-enter G1 (Tsang2009Cep76). The primary function of CEP76 is to restrain centriole reduplication, acting as an inhibitory factor in the process of centriole assembly. Depletion of CEP76 leads to centriole amplification, indicating its role in controlling centriole duplication (Tsang2009Cep76).

CEP76 also plays a role in regulating PLK1 activity during mitosis. It suppresses the ectopic aggregation of PLK1 in the cytoplasm, which is crucial for proper mitotic progression. Depletion of CEP76 results in the formation of ectopic aggregates of PLK1, leading to mitotic delay and spindle orientation defects (Takeda2020The). CEP76's interaction with PLK1 is important for maintaining proper spindle orientation and ensuring accurate cell division (Takeda2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CEP76 gene have been linked to male infertility due to abnormal sperm tail composition. Specifically, a missense mutation (c.607G>C, p.Gly203Arg) in CEP76 has been identified in an infertile man with azoospermia, indicating its critical role in male fertility (Houston2024Genetic; Houston2023CEP76). The absence of functional CEP76 results in shorter, immotile sperm tails due to deficits in essential motility proteins like DNAH2 and AKAP4, which accumulate at the sperm neck, leading to impaired sperm motility (Houston2024Genetic; Houston2023CEP76). These structural defects in the sperm tail, including abnormalities in the annulus, fibrous sheath, and outer dense fibers, contribute to male infertility (Houston2024Genetic).

CEP76 is also implicated in cancer, particularly in restraining centriole reduplication. Loss of CEP76 is associated with centriole amplification in certain cancers, such as osteosarcomas and blastomas, but not in nontransformed or epithelial-origin cells (Tsang2009Cep76). This suggests that CEP76 plays a role in maintaining genomic stability, and its dysregulation may contribute to tumorigenesis.

## Interactions
CEP76 is known to interact with several centrosomal proteins, playing a crucial role in regulating centriole duplication. It physically interacts with CP110, a centriolar protein, as demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation experiments. This interaction occurs within CP110 residues 350-565 and is essential for inhibiting centriole reduplication (Tsang2009Cep76). CEP76 also interacts with Cep97, another centrosomal protein, forming distinct assemblies separate from CP110-centrin complexes (Tsang2009Cep76).

CEP76 has been shown to interact with PLK1, a key regulator of mitosis. This interaction is dependent on the polo-box domain of PLK1 and is crucial for maintaining proper spindle orientation during mitosis. Depletion of CEP76 leads to ectopic aggregation of highly phosphorylated PLK1 in the cytoplasm, resulting in mitotic delay and defective spindle orientation (Takeda2020The). The interaction between CEP76 and PLK1 is further supported by yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Takeda2020The).

In the context of male fertility, CEP76 is involved in the transition zone of male germ cells, interacting with proteins like AKAP4 and DNAH2, which are essential for sperm tail composition and function (Houston2024Genetic).
