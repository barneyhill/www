# CXCL10

## Overview
CXCL10, also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, is a gene that encodes a small cytokine belonging to the CXC chemokine family. The protein product of this gene plays a pivotal role in immune responses, primarily through its function as a chemokine that mediates the chemotaxis of immune cells such as T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages. CXCL10 is induced by interferon-gamma and is involved in various biological processes, including immune surveillance, inflammation, and angiostasis. It exerts its effects by binding to the CXCR3 receptor, facilitating the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation or infection. Additionally, CXCL10 exhibits antimicrobial properties, interacting with bacterial components and disrupting membrane integrity. The gene's expression is tightly regulated and is associated with several pathological conditions, including autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Zhou2023The; Margulieux2016CXCL10; Liu2011CXCL10IP10).

## Structure
CXCL10, also known as Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), is a chemokine with a conserved tertiary structure typical of the CXC chemokine family. This structure includes a flexible N-terminus, a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, and a C-terminal α-helix, stabilized by disulfide bridges formed by conserved cysteine residues (Miller2017Chemokines; Nguyen2012Structural). The primary structure of CXCL10 consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain, which is crucial for its function in immune responses (Trotta2009Modelling).

In terms of quaternary structure, CXCL10 can form oligomers, including dimers and tetramers. The tetramers of CXCL10 are described as dimers of β-sheet dimers, indicating a complex quaternary structure involving β-sheet interactions (Nguyen2012Structural). CXCL10's ability to form distinct tetramers with both CC and CXC dimer topologies highlights its structural variability (Miller2017Chemokines).

Post-translational modifications of CXCL10 may include C-terminal processing, which can influence its activity and interactions (Nguyen2012Structural). These structural features are essential for CXCL10's role in binding to receptors and mediating immune responses.

## Function
CXCL10, also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, is a chemokine involved in various molecular processes in healthy human cells. It primarily functions by binding to the CXCR3 receptor, which is expressed on several immune cells, including T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and macrophages. This interaction is crucial for the chemotaxis of these immune cells to sites of inflammation or infection, thereby playing a significant role in immune surveillance and the regulation of inflammatory responses (Liu2011CXCL10IP10).

In healthy cells, CXCL10 is secreted in response to inflammatory stimuli such as interferon-gamma (IFN-g), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b). It is constitutively present in blood and normal tissues, including the colon, and its expression increases significantly during systemic inflammation (Zhao2017A). CXCL10 is involved in activating signaling pathways such as p38/MAPK, PI3K, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), which are essential for chemotaxis and cell motility (Liu2011CXCL10IP10).

The protein also plays a role in angiostasis, inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels, which is particularly relevant in the context of cancer, where it reduces tumor-associated angiogenesis (Liu2011CXCL10IP10).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL10 gene are associated with a variety of diseases, particularly those involving inflammation and immune responses. Elevated levels of CXCL10 are observed in multiple sclerosis (MS), where it contributes to leukocyte trafficking and inflammation, leading to tissue damage and demyelination in the central nervous system (Vazirinejad2014The; McKimmie2014Role). In cancer, CXCL10 plays a dual role; it can inhibit tumor growth through its anti-angiogenic properties, yet its increased expression is linked to advanced stages of cancers such as malignant melanoma and ovarian carcinoma (Jin2021Identification; LIU2011The).

In autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis, CXCL10 serves as a biomarker for disease activity and severity, contributing to renal inflammation by attracting T cells (Zhou2023The). In rheumatoid arthritis, CXCL10 is recommended as a marker for disease activity due to its role in recruiting inflammatory cells (Zhou2023The). Additionally, CXCL10 is implicated in liver inflammation in hepatitis B and C, and in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where it impairs autophagic processes (Zhou2023The). These alterations in CXCL10 expression and interactions highlight its clinical significance across a range of pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CXCL10, also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10, participates in several significant interactions with proteins, particularly in its role as an antimicrobial agent. It interacts with the FtsE/X complex in Bacillus anthracis, a crucial component in bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan processing. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal region of CXCL10, which mimics the receptor CXCR3, suggesting a receptor-like interaction with the bacterial FtsX protein. The CXCR3-like region of FtsX is essential for this interaction, as demonstrated by peptide competition assays that inhibit CXCL10's activity when mimicking this region (Margulieux2016CXCL10).

CXCL10 also exhibits a FtsE/X-independent mechanism involving the depolarization of bacterial membranes through its C-terminal α-helix, similar to cationic antimicrobial peptides like LL37. This mechanism contributes to its antimicrobial activity by disrupting bacterial membrane integrity (Margulieux2016CXCL10).

In addition to its antimicrobial interactions, CXCL10 binds to the CXCR3 receptor on immune cells, influencing immune responses. This interaction involves the formation of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, contributing to the binding strength and receptor activation (Trotta2009Modelling).
