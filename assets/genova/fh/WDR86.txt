# WDR86

## Overview
WDR86 is a gene that encodes the WD repeat domain 86 protein, which is characterized by the presence of WD repeat motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that WD repeat domain 86 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interaction with other proteins. Although the specific functions of the WDR86 protein are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in several biological pathways and conditions, including preeclampsia and breast cancer, through its expression patterns and genetic variations (Li2019A). The gene's expression and associated polymorphisms have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its potential significance in medical research and as a prognostic marker (Wang2018Functional).

## Clinical Significance
WDR86 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In the context of preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific disorder, WDR86-AS1, a long non-coding RNA associated with WDR86, is upregulated in PE-affected placentas. This upregulation is part of a regulatory network involving miR-10b-3p and LITAF, which may contribute to PE pathogenesis by affecting inflammatory responses and trophoblast cell functions (Li2019A).

In breast cancer, WDR86 is identified as an age-associated gene with downregulated expression in tumor samples. Although it does not exhibit tumor-suppressive functions like some other genes, its expression pattern suggests a potential prognostic value for relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients (Gu2020Ageassociated).

Additionally, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7805747 is associated with changes in WDR86 expression in various tissues, including the colon sigmoid. This SNP is linked to several diseases and phenotypes, such as chronic kidney disease and breast cancer, indicating that alterations in WDR86 expression may be involved in these conditions (Wang2018Functional).
