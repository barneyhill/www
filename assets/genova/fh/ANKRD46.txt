# ANKRD46

## Overview
ANKRD46 is a gene that encodes the ankyrin repeat domain 46 protein, which is characterized by the presence of ankyrin repeat motifs. These motifs are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions, which are essential for various cellular processes such as signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization (Zhang2023Exploration). The protein is predominantly expressed in hepatocytes and thyroid gland cells, indicating its potential role in maintaining cellular structure and function within these tissues (Zhang2023Exploration). While the specific functions of ANKRD46 in normal physiological conditions are not fully elucidated, its involvement in fundamental cellular processes suggests it plays a critical role in cellular integrity and homeostasis. Additionally, ANKRD46 has been implicated in clinical contexts, such as its association with alcohol use disorder and its mis-expression in certain congenital cataract conditions, highlighting its potential significance in disease mechanisms (Anand2021Genome-Wide; Hill2023A).

## Structure
ANKRD46 encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat domains, which are prevalent motifs involved in protein-protein interactions. These ankyrin repeats typically form a helix-loop-helix structure, contributing significantly to the protein's secondary structure. The tertiary structure of the ANKRD46 protein is often stabilized by these repeats, allowing it to perform diverse functional roles. Specific details on post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms of ANKRD46 are not provided in the available context and should be referenced from detailed protein databases or scientific literature for comprehensive information. The ankyrin repeat domains are crucial for the protein's ability to interact with other proteins, which may influence its functional capabilities in various cellular processes.

## Function
ANKRD46 encodes a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat motifs, which are known for mediating protein-protein interactions. These interactions are crucial for various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and cytoskeletal organization (Zhang2023Exploration). The protein is primarily enriched in hepatocytes and thyroid gland cells, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular structure and function in these tissues (Zhang2023Exploration).

In the context of cellular biology, ANKRD46 is involved in cytoskeletal regulation, which is essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling cellular movement, and facilitating intracellular transport (Anand2021Genome-Wide). The ankyrin domain of ANKRD46 is particularly important for its role in protein-protein interactions, which are vital for the coordination of cellular activities and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Zhang2023Exploration).

While the specific functions of ANKRD46 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its involvement in these fundamental processes suggests it plays a significant role in cellular integrity and function. The gene's expression and regulation are also influenced by microRNAs, such as miR-21, which can modulate its activity and potentially impact cellular outcomes (Yan2011Knockdown).

## Clinical Significance
ANKRD46 has been implicated in several studies exploring its potential clinical significance, particularly in relation to alcohol use disorder (AUD). A study by Hill and Hostyk identified rare protein-truncating variants in ANKRD46 that are associated with a significant increase in the risk of AUD, with an odds ratio of 176.1 and a p-value of 2.01 Ã— 10^-4, suggesting a strong association between these variants and the disorder (Hill2023A). Despite this association, there is no direct evidence linking ANKRD46 to alcohol consumption in existing clinical or animal literature, indicating the need for further research to confirm these findings (Hill2023A).

In other contexts, ANKRD46 has been identified as a mis-expressed mRNA in lenses deficient for the congenital cataract-linked protein TDRD7, suggesting its involvement in regulatory networks related to lens development and cataract formation (Anand2021Genome-Wide). However, specific diseases or conditions directly associated with mutations or alterations in ANKRD46 beyond these contexts have not been conclusively identified. The gene's role in various cellular processes and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms remain areas of active investigation.
