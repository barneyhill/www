# ATP2B2

## Overview
The ATP2B2 gene encodes the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2), a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in calcium ion transport across the plasma membrane. PMCA2 is essential for maintaining calcium homeostasis within cells, particularly in excitable tissues such as the brain and inner ear. The protein functions by actively transporting calcium ions out of the cytosol, utilizing ATP hydrolysis to regulate intracellular calcium levels. This regulation is vital for processes such as neuronal signaling and auditory function. PMCA2 is characterized by its ten transmembrane domains and large intracellular loops, which facilitate its interaction with regulatory proteins like calmodulin. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with distinct tissue-specific expressions and regulatory properties. Mutations in ATP2B2 have been linked to hereditary deafness and neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in sensory and neural health (Brini2008Plasma; Grati2006Rapid; Stafford2017The).

## Structure
The ATP2B2 gene encodes the PMCA2 protein, a plasma membrane calcium ATPase involved in calcium ion transport. The primary structure of PMCA2 includes ten transmembrane domains and two large intracellular loops, which are crucial for its function (Brini2008Plasma; Stafford2017The). The secondary structure is characterized by alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of membrane proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context.

The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these helices and loops into a functional protein, with the C-terminal tail playing a significant role in regulatory interactions, particularly with calmodulin, which modulates the pump's activity by altering its conformation (Poggio2023ATP2B2; Brini2013The). The quaternary structure may involve interactions with other proteins, although specific details are not provided.

PMCA2 undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in several isoforms with distinct regulatory properties. These isoforms are tissue-specific, with PMCA2 being highly expressed in the inner ear and cerebellum, where it plays a critical role in calcium homeostasis (Smits2018De; Brini2013The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the activity and localization of PMCA2 (Brini2008Plasma).

## Function
The ATP2B2 gene encodes the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase isoform 2 (PMCA2), a crucial protein for maintaining calcium homeostasis in cells. PMCA2 actively transports calcium ions out of the cytosol, using ATP hydrolysis, to regulate intracellular calcium levels. This function is vital in excitable tissues such as the brain and inner ear, where it influences neuronal signaling and auditory function (Grati2006Rapid; Padányi2010Apical).

In polarized cells, PMCA2's localization is influenced by alternative splicing, resulting in different splice variants with distinct membrane localizations. For example, the PMCA2w/b variant is apically localized, while PMCA2z/b and PMCA2x/b are mostly basolateral. The interaction with the scaffolding protein NHERF2 enhances the apical localization of PMCA2w/b by anchoring it to the apical membrane cytoskeleton, reducing internalization and lateral mobility, and stabilizing it in the apical membrane (Padányi2010Apical).

PMCA2 is particularly prominent in the inner ear, where it is enriched in the hair cell apical membrane. It plays a critical role in the rapid clearance of Ca2+ that enters stereocilia through mechanoelectrical transduction channels, which is essential for signal adaptation and stereocilia viability (Grati2006Rapid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATP2B2 gene, which encodes the PMCA2 pump, are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting hearing and neurological function. Hereditary deafness is a significant condition linked to ATP2B2 mutations. These mutations impair the pump's ability to maintain calcium homeostasis in cochlear hair cells, leading to sensorineural hearing loss. Mouse models, such as the 'deafwaddler' and 'oblivion', demonstrate that mutations in ATP2B2 result in hearing loss and motor imbalance due to disrupted calcium signaling in the inner ear (Spiden2008The; Street1998Mutations).

In humans, specific mutations like ATP2B2 V586M and ATP2B2 G293S are associated with progressive hearing loss, particularly when combined with mutations in the CDH23 gene (Spiden2008The). The gene is also implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Studies have shown differential expression of ATP2B2 in autistic individuals, suggesting that alterations in calcium signaling pathways may contribute to the development of autism, particularly affecting nervous system development and function (Stafford2017The; Carayol2011Converging).

Overall, ATP2B2 mutations disrupt intracellular calcium levels, affecting neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptogenesis, which are crucial for both auditory and neurological health (Stafford2017The).

## Interactions
The ATP2B2 gene encodes the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase 2 (PMCA2), which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function. PMCA2 interacts with calmodulin, a regulatory protein that significantly enhances its activity. This interaction is particularly strong in the PMCA2AII isoform, which shows a higher affinity for calmodulin compared to other isoforms like PMCA4CI (Hilfiker1994Cloning).

PMCA2 also interacts with acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidyl inositol, which stimulate its activity. This interaction is thought to involve the calmodulin binding domain, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism involving both calmodulin and phospholipids (Hilfiker1994Cloning).

In addition to calmodulin, PMCA2 interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins like NHERF2. This interaction increases PMCA2's presence in the apical membrane of polarized cells and reduces its internalization, likely anchoring the pump to the membrane cytoskeleton (Strehler2015The).

PMCA2 is also part of multiprotein signaling complexes, interacting with proteins such as the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCX1 and the presynaptic glycine transporter GlyT2 in neurons. These interactions highlight PMCA2's role in local calcium control and signaling (Strehler2015The).
