# PRB1

## Overview
The PRB1 gene encodes the proline-rich protein BstNI subfamily 1, which is a member of the proline-rich protein (PRP) family predominantly found in human saliva. These proteins are characterized by their high proline content and are known for their role in oral health, particularly in the lubrication and protection of oral tissues. The PRB1-encoded protein is involved in binding dietary tannins, thereby influencing nutrient absorption and taste perception by preventing tannin absorption in the digestive tract. The gene is part of a complex that includes other similar genes, and its protein products are synthesized as precursors that undergo proteolytic cleavage to become active. This process is facilitated by the enzyme furin, which recognizes specific cleavage sites on the precursor proteins. The PRB1 gene is actively expressed in the salivary glands, and its protein products contribute to various functions, including calcium binding, inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation, and serving as masticatory lubricants, all of which are essential for dental health and the initial stages of digestion (Kim1993The; Stubbs1998Encoding; Maeda1985Differential).

## Function
The PRB1 gene encodes a family of basic and glycosylated proline-rich proteins (PRPs) that are primarily active in human saliva. These proteins play a crucial role in oral health and digestion by contributing to the lubrication and protection of oral tissues. PRB1 proteins are involved in binding dietary tannins, which can affect nutrient absorption and taste perception by preventing tannin absorption in the alimentary canal (Kim1993The; Stubbs1998Encoding).

The PRB1 gene is part of a complex that includes several other genes encoding similar proteins, and these proteins are initially synthesized as precursor proteins. They undergo proteolytic cleavage to become active, secreted proteins in saliva. The cleavage sites conform to a consensus site for the enzyme furin, which processes these precursor proteins (Stubbs1998Encoding). The PRB1 gene is actively transcribed in the salivary glands, and its protein products are involved in various functions, including binding calcium, inhibiting hydroxyapatite formation, and acting as masticatory lubricants (Kim1993The; Maeda1985Differential). These functions suggest a significant role in maintaining dental health and facilitating the initial stages of digestion.
