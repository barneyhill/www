# IQCM

## Overview
The IQCM gene encodes the IQ motif containing M protein, which is characterized by the presence of an IQ motif, a sequence known for its ability to bind calmodulin and other EF-hand proteins. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, potentially through its interactions with calmodulin, which is a key mediator of calcium signaling pathways. The IQCM protein's structure, including its primary, secondary, and tertiary configurations, is essential for its functional interactions within the cell. While the specific biological roles and mechanisms of action of the IQCM protein remain to be fully elucidated, its structural features suggest a role in modulating cellular responses to calcium signals. Post-translational modifications and the existence of splice variant isoforms further contribute to the functional diversity of the IQCM protein, allowing it to participate in a range of cellular activities (Qiu2020aarFDC).

## Structure
The IQCM gene encodes a protein that features an IQ motif, a sequence known for its role in binding calmodulin and other EF-hand proteins. The primary structure of the IQCM protein is defined by its specific amino acid sequence, which includes this IQ motif. In terms of secondary structure, the protein may contain alpha helices and beta sheets, which are common structural elements in proteins with IQ motifs. The tertiary structure of the IQCM protein refers to its overall three-dimensional shape, which is crucial for its interaction with calmodulin and other proteins. There is no information provided about the quaternary structure, suggesting that the protein may function as a single polypeptide chain without forming complexes with other subunits.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation can occur, potentially influencing the protein's function and localization within the cell. These modifications are important for regulating the activity and interactions of the protein. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of the IQCM gene may exist, leading to proteins with different functional properties. These isoforms can result in variations in the protein's structure and function, allowing for diverse roles in cellular processes.
