# EPN2

## Overview
EPN2 is a gene that encodes the protein epsin 2, which is a crucial component of the cellular machinery involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Epsin 2 functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles by interacting with clathrin and the adaptor protein complex AP2. This protein is categorized as an adaptor protein due to its role in linking membrane-bound receptors to the endocytic machinery. Epsin 2 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, particularly at the plasma membrane, where it binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, contributing to membrane invagination and endocytic pit formation. Beyond its role in endocytosis, epsin 2 is involved in regulating angiogenesis and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including multiple system atrophy and breast cancer, through its interactions with different signaling pathways and protein complexes (Cheng2022Epsin2; Sen2012The; Sakai2017A).

## Function
EPN2 (epsin 2) is a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a critical cellular process for internalizing and trafficking membrane-anchored molecules. Epsin 2 functions as an adaptor protein, interacting with clathrin and the adaptor protein complex AP2 to facilitate the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. This interaction is essential for membrane curvature and vesicle budding, impacting cellular trafficking and signaling pathways (Sen2012The; Madhivanan2022Yeast).

Epsin 2 is active in the cytoplasm, particularly at the plasma membrane, where it binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate through its ENTH domain, contributing to membrane invagination and the formation of endocytic pits (Sen2012The). The protein also contains ubiquitin-interacting motifs that recognize ubiquitinated cargo, aiding in receptor-mediated endocytosis (Sen2012The).

In addition to its role in endocytosis, EPN2 is involved in regulating angiogenesis. It acts as a negative regulator by modulating the signaling pathways of VEGF and NOTCH, which are crucial for blood vessel formation. Knockdown of EPN2 enhances angiogenesis, indicating its suppressive function in this process (Sakai2017A).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EPN2 gene, which encodes the protein epsin-2, have been implicated in the pathology of multiple system atrophy (MSA), a neurodegenerative disease. Epsin-2 is involved in the propagation of FABP7/α-synuclein (αSyn) hetero-aggregates, which are selectively taken up by oligodendrocytes and Purkinje neurons. These aggregates are more toxic than αSyn aggregates alone and contribute to cerebellar dysfunction in MSA (Cheng2022Epsin2). 

In MSA, increased levels of epsin-2 in oligodendrocytes and Purkinje neurons have been observed in mice injected with these aggregates, suggesting a role in their propagation. Knockdown of epsin-2 resulted in decreased uptake of the aggregates and improved motor function, indicating its involvement in cerebellar dysfunction associated with MSA (Cheng2022Epsin2). Epsin-2 facilitates the uptake of αSyn aggregates through clathrin-dependent endocytosis, contributing to demyelination and Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum (Cheng2022Epsin2). 

Additionally, the mRNA expression of EPN2 is downregulated in the whole blood of MSA patients, further implicating its involvement in the disease (Cheng2022Epsin2). These findings suggest that targeting epsin-2 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for MSA.

## Interactions
Epsin 2 (EPN2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. EPN2 interacts with components of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery, including clathrin and the AP-2 adaptor complex, facilitating the internalization of membrane proteins (Sakai2017A). It also binds to phosphoinositides and ubiquitin, which are important for membrane curvature and protein sorting.

In the context of angiogenesis, EPN2 is targeted by miR-1224, which binds to the 3'-UTR of EPN2 mRNA, leading to its downregulation. This interaction results in enhanced VEGFR2 phosphorylation and reduced NOTCH signaling, promoting angiogenesis (Sakai2017A). The miR-1224/EPN2 pathway is noted for its species-specific regulatory role in angiogenesis (Sakai2017A).

EPN2 also plays a role in breast cancer development by interacting with the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) and its substrate NEMO, promoting NF-κB activation. This interaction is crucial for the assembly of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, enhancing NF-κB signaling, particularly in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer (Song2021Epsins). These interactions highlight EPN2's involvement in both endocytosis and signal transduction pathways.
