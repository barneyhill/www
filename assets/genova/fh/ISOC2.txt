# ISOC2

## Overview
Isochorismatase domain containing 2 (ISOC2) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which belongs to the isochorismatase family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their isochorismatase domain, which is typically involved in catalyzing the hydrolysis of isochorismate to produce pyruvate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, although the specific enzymatic activity of ISOC2 remains to be fully elucidated. The ISOC2 protein is implicated in various cellular processes, potentially including metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms, although its precise biological roles are still under investigation. Understanding the function and interactions of ISOC2 is crucial, as alterations in its expression or activity may have clinical significance, potentially contributing to disease states (Qiu2020aarFDC).
