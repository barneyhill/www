# GSTM4

## Overview
GSTM4, or glutathione S-transferase mu 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, specifically the Mu class. This family of enzymes is integral to the detoxification processes in cells, facilitating the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of electrophilic compounds, including carcinogens, environmental toxins, and drugs. The GSTM4 protein is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm and is notably active in tissues such as the testis. It plays a significant role in phase II metabolism, contributing to the detoxification of harmful substances and the mitigation of oxidative stress. While GSTM4 shares substrates with other Mu-class GSTs, its activity is generally lower compared to its counterparts. The gene is located on chromosome 1 and comprises eight exons and seven introns. Despite its established role in detoxification, the specific physiological functions of GSTM4 in healthy human cells remain underexplored, and no coding region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been validated to date (Board2013Glutathione; Denson2006Screening; Zhong1993Deduced).

## Structure
The GSTM4 protein is a member of the glutathione S-transferase Mu class, characterized by its role in detoxification processes. The primary structure of GSTM4 consists of 218 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 25.5 kDa (Zhong1993Deduced). The gene structure includes eight exons and seven introns, following the gt/ag splice rule, which is typical for Mu-class GSTs (Zhong1993Deduced).

The secondary structure of GSTM4 likely includes alpha helices and beta sheets, common features in GST proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional three-dimensional shape, forming a characteristic GST fold. The quaternary structure of GSTM4 may involve dimerization, a common feature among GSTs, allowing for functional diversity and stability.

GSTM4 exhibits several splice variants, including one with an alternative last exon resulting in a shorter protein of 195 amino acids, and another variant lacking exon 4 (Denson2006Screening). These splice variants may impact the protein's function and activity, although specific functional implications are not detailed in the context. The presence of these variants suggests potential functional diversity within the GSTM4 protein.

## Function
GSTM4 (glutathione S-transferase mu 4) is a member of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family, which plays a crucial role in detoxifying harmful compounds by catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) with electrophilic xenobiotics. These compounds include carcinogens, environmental pollutants, and chemotherapeutic drugs (Zhong1993Deduced). GSTM4 is involved in phase II metabolism, aiding in the detoxification of various carcinogens, drugs, and environmental toxins, as well as physiological products of oxidative stress (Denson2006Screening).

The GSTM4 protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is expressed in specific tissues, such as the testis (Board2013Glutathione). It shares some common substrates with other GSTM proteins, although its activity is lower compared to other GSTM proteins for the test substrates (Denson2006Screening). The gene structure of GSTM4 includes eight exons and seven introns, and it is located on chromosome 1 (Zhong1993Deduced).

Despite its role in detoxification, the specific function of GSTM4 in healthy human cells is not well-documented, and no coding region SNPs have been validated, suggesting a lack of detailed information on its specific function or polymorphisms in the coding region (Board2013Glutathione).

## Clinical Significance
The GSTM4 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to lung cancer. Genetic polymorphisms in GSTM4, such as specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been associated with lung cancer survival following platinum-based chemotherapy. These polymorphisms may influence the detoxification of platinum compounds, affecting treatment outcomes. Overexpression of GSTM4 has been linked to increased resistance to cisplatin, a common chemotherapy drug, suggesting that GSTM4 plays a role in drug resistance mechanisms (Moyer2010Glutathione).

A particular SNP in GSTM4 is in linkage disequilibrium with another SNP, rs650985, which has been associated with lung cancer risk. This suggests a potential role for GSTM4 in lung cancer carcinogenesis (Moyer2010Glutathione). Additionally, a C-T polymorphism in intron 6 of GSTM4, identified as allele *B, has been suggested to have a protective effect against lung cancer, as it was found less frequently in lung cancer patients compared to healthy controls (Liloglou2002A).

The GSTM4 gene is less studied compared to other GST family members, but its polymorphisms and expression levels are considered potential biomarkers for predicting responses to chemotherapy and assessing lung cancer risk (Guo2020Clinical).

## Interactions
GSTM4 interacts with Apoptosis Signaling Kinase 1 (ASK1) in Ewing sarcoma cells, inhibiting etoposide-induced JNK activation and apoptosis. This interaction is significant as it suggests a mechanism by which GSTM4 contributes to drug resistance in cancer cells. Immunoprecipitation analyses have confirmed that GSTM4 binds robustly to ASK1, but not to other kinases tested in the MAPK pathway. The C-terminal end of GSTM4 is required for this interaction, which decreases the phosphorylation of MKK4, a kinase downstream of ASK1 necessary for JNK activation (Zhuo2014Targeting).

GSTM4 is also involved in the regulation of the Nrf2 pathway, which is crucial for oxidative stress response and apoptosis regulation. In endometriosis, GSTM4 interacts with Nrf2, and its inhibition by NBDHEX affects Nrf2 expression, suggesting a regulatory interaction where Nrf2 and GSTM4 may inhibit each other (Liu20216(7nitro2). However, specific physical interactions of GSTM4 with other proteins or nucleic acids in this context are not detailed (Liu20216(7nitro2).
