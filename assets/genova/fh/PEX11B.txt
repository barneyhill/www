# PEX11B

## Overview
PEX11B is a gene that encodes the peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11 beta, a protein integral to the proliferation and maintenance of peroxisomes in human cells. This protein is categorized as a peroxisomal membrane protein and plays a pivotal role in peroxisome dynamics by facilitating membrane elongation and division. It interacts with key fission factors such as hFis1 and DRP1, which are essential for the peroxisomal fission process (Koch2010PEX11). Additionally, PEX11B is involved in the regulation of peroxisome numbers and function, which is crucial for cellular lipid homeostasis and detoxification (Koch2010PEX11). The expression of PEX11B is influenced by the TGFβ signaling pathway, linking it to broader cellular processes (Azadi2020A). Mutations in the PEX11B gene are associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorder 14B, underscoring its significance in cellular and organismal health (Tian2019Variant).

## Function
The PEX11B gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in peroxisome proliferation and maintenance in human cells. PEX11B is involved in the dynamic changes of the peroxisomal membrane, acting as a membrane elongation factor that facilitates peroxisome proliferation and division (Koch2010PEX11). It localizes to the peroxisomal membrane, where it promotes membrane elongation and interacts with fission factors such as hFis1 and DRP1, which are essential for the fission process (Koch2010PEX11). This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of these fission factors to the peroxisomal membrane, facilitating the final steps of peroxisome division (Koch2010PEX11).

PEX11B is also implicated in the regulation of peroxisome dynamics through its involvement in the TGFβ signaling pathway, as it contains a functional SMAD2/3 binding site in its promoter region (Azadi2020A). This suggests that PEX11B expression is regulated by TGFβ signaling, linking it to broader cellular processes. The protein's activity is essential for maintaining peroxisome numbers and function, which is vital for cellular lipid homeostasis and detoxification processes (Koch2010PEX11). Deficiency in PEX11B is associated with severe health conditions, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health (Azadi2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PEX11B gene are associated with peroxisome biogenesis disorder 14B, a condition characterized by a range of clinical features including mild intellectual disability, congenital cataracts, progressive hearing loss, and polyneuropathy (Tian2019Variant; Taylor2017Novel). These mutations can lead to defects in peroxisome division, affecting peroxisomal function and contributing to the symptoms observed in patients (Ebberink2012A). 

A specific mutation, c.64C>T, results in a p.Q22X change, leading to the absence of PEX11B protein production, which has been confirmed as the underlying cause of the disorder through functional complementation studies (Ebberink2012A). Patients with PEX11B mutations may also experience unique symptoms such as recurrent migraine-like episodes, which are uncommon in peroxisomal disorders (Ebberink2012A).

In mouse models, PEX11B deficiency results in severe developmental issues, including neonatal lethality and neuronal migration defects, although peroxisomal function remains largely unaffected (Li2002PEX11β). The deletion of a single allele in mice can cause oxidative stress and neuronal death, indicating the critical role of PEX11B in neuronal development (Ahlemeyer2012Deletion). These findings highlight the importance of PEX11B in maintaining normal cellular and neurological functions.

## Interactions
PEX11B, a peroxisomal membrane protein, is involved in several interactions crucial for peroxisome dynamics. It interacts with hFis1 and DRP1, forming a ternary complex essential for peroxisome fission. This interaction is facilitated by the presence of hydrophobic regions and is detectable in specific conditions, such as the presence of digitonin (Koch2010PEX11). PEX11B also interacts with microtubules, which are necessary for peroxisome proliferation and membrane elongation (Koch2010PEX11).

PEX11B's interaction with Pex19 is significant for its stability and proper membrane insertion. Pex19 acts as a chaperone, binding to the Pex19-binding site (Pex19-BS) on PEX11B, preventing its aggregation and degradation. This interaction is crucial for maintaining PEX11B stability, as demonstrated by the decreased stability of PEX11B in the absence of Pex19 (ZientaraRytter2022Recognition). The Pex19-BS is located within the H2 region of PEX11B, which is also involved in its dimerization (ZientaraRytter2022Recognition).

PEX11B is also involved in the regulation of peroxisomal protein sorting. Inactivation of PEX11B can lead to the mislocalization of peroxisomal proteins to mitochondria, indicating its role in peroxisomal membrane biogenesis and protein sorting (Lismont2019Deciphering).
