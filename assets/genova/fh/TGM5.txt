# TGM5

## Overview
The TGM5 gene encodes the enzyme transglutaminase 5 (TG5), a member of the transglutaminase family, which is characterized by its ability to catalyze the formation of covalent bonds between proteins. TG5 is a Ca2+-dependent enzyme predominantly expressed in the epidermis, where it plays a crucial role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, a key component of the skin barrier. This enzyme is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and the cross-linking of structural proteins, contributing to the mechanical resilience and integrity of the skin. Mutations in the TGM5 gene are linked to acral peeling skin syndrome, a condition marked by superficial skin peeling, particularly on the extremities. The study of TGM5 and its interactions with other proteins, such as polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1, provides insights into its broader biological functions and potential implications in neurodegenerative diseases (Lee2022Crossspecies; Cassidy2005A; Candi2002Expression).

## Function
Transglutaminase 5 (TG5), encoded by the TGM5 gene, is a Ca2+-dependent enzyme that plays a critical role in the formation of the cornified cell envelope (CE) in the epidermis. It is primarily expressed in the upper layers of the epidermis, particularly in the spinous and granular layers, where it contributes to keratinocyte differentiation and the assembly of the CE by catalyzing the formation of isopeptide bonds between proteins (Candi2002Expression). This cross-linking activity is essential for maintaining cell-cell adhesion and the structural integrity of the skin barrier, particularly at the junction between the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum (Cassidy2005A).

TG5 utilizes substrates such as loricrin, involucrin, and small proline-rich proteins, which are crucial for the stability and resilience of the epidermis (Cassidy2005A). The enzyme's activity is vital for the cornification process, which is necessary for forming a protective barrier in the skin (Lorand2018Transglutaminase). In healthy human cells, TG5's function ensures the proper differentiation and cornification of keratinocytes, contributing to the overall homeostasis and protective function of the skin (Chermnykh2020Transglutaminase).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TGM5 gene are primarily associated with acral peeling skin syndrome (APSS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by superficial exfoliation and blistering of the skin, particularly on the hands and feet. The condition is exacerbated by heat, humidity, and friction, but lesions typically heal without scarring (van2012A; Szczecinska2014Under‐recognition). The most common mutation linked to APSS is p.G113C, which completely abolishes the activity of transglutaminase 5, leading to the skin peeling observed in affected individuals (Kharfi2009A; Cassidy2005A). This mutation is prevalent among European patients and is considered a founder mutation in this population (van2012A; Szczecinska2014Under‐recognition).

APSS is often misdiagnosed as other skin conditions, such as localized epidermolysis bullosa simplex, due to similar clinical presentations (Szczecinska2014Under‐recognition). The genetic heterogeneity of APSS is highlighted by the identification of multiple mutations in the TGM5 gene, affecting the enzyme's catalytic core and β-sandwich domains, which are crucial for its function (Pigors2012TGM5; Szczecinska2014Under‐recognition). These mutations disrupt the normal function of transglutaminase 5, impacting epidermal differentiation and skin barrier integrity (Pigors2012TGM5).

## Interactions
Transglutaminase 5 (TGM5) is involved in the regulation of polyglutamine-expanded ataxin-1 (ATXN1) through its cross-linking activity, which affects the protein's solubility and oligomerization. TGM5 preferentially interacts with the mutant form of ATXN1, facilitating its transformation into insoluble forms and high molecular weight species, which are associated with neuronal toxicity in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) (Lee2022Crossspecies). TGM5 colocalizes with ATXN1 nuclear inclusions in neurons from SCA1 patients, indicating a direct regulatory role in the pathogenesis of the disease (Lee2022Crossspecies).

The interaction between TGM5 and ATXN1 is polyglutamine-length-dependent, with TGM5 catalyzing cross-links that stabilize ATXN1 oligomers. This interaction is specific to the mutant form of ATXN1, as TGM5 does not significantly affect the wild-type protein (Lee2022Crossspecies). The study also notes that TGM5's regulation of ATXN1 involves both direct cross-linking and indirect mechanisms, as insoluble ATXN1 monomers are not cross-linked by TGM5 (Lee2022Crossspecies). These findings suggest that TGM5's interactions with ATXN1 are crucial for understanding its role in neurodegeneration and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for SCA1.
