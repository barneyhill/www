# ESAM

## Overview
Endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The ESAM protein is primarily expressed in endothelial cells and activated platelets, where it plays a pivotal role in vascular biology by regulating cell adhesion and maintaining vascular integrity. As a transmembrane protein, ESAM is involved in cell-cell interactions at endothelial tight junctions, contributing to processes such as leukocyte extravasation and thrombus formation. The protein's structure, which includes immunoglobulin-like domains, facilitates its function in these critical biological processes. ESAM's interactions with other proteins, such as NHERF-1 and MAGI1, further underscore its importance in cellular signaling pathways that influence vascular permeability and immune responses (Hansmeier20223D; Wegmann2006ESAM; STALKER2009Endothelial).

## Structure
The endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) is a type I transmembrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is structurally related to the Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) and shares a common structure with other IgCAM family members, including a membrane-distal V-set Ig domain and a membrane-proximal C2-set Ig domain, followed by a single transmembrane helix and a cytoplasmic tail (Schreiber2013The). The extracellular domain of ESAM facilitates cell-cell interactions at cell junctions, playing a crucial role in vascular biology (Hansmeier20223D).

ESAM is expressed primarily in endothelial cells and activated platelets, where it contributes to the regulation of thrombus formation and cell adhesion processes (Hansmeier20223D). The protein's structure allows it to function effectively in these roles, although specific details on its primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context. The presence of immunoglobulin-like domains suggests potential post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which may influence its stability and interactions, although specific modifications are not detailed in the context provided. The context does not mention any splice variant isoforms for ESAM.

## Function
The endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM) is a protein primarily expressed in endothelial cells and plays a significant role in maintaining vascular integrity and permeability. ESAM is located at endothelial tight junctions and is involved in cell-cell adhesion through homophilic interactions, contributing to the stability of these junctions (Wegmann2006ESAM; Kacso2012Endothelial). It is crucial for the process of leukocyte extravasation, particularly in the migration of neutrophils through the vessel wall, a process known as diapedesis. This function is facilitated by the activation of Rho, a GTPase that destabilizes tight junctions, allowing neutrophils to migrate through the endothelial barrier (Wegmann2006ESAM).

ESAM also plays a role in vascular permeability, as its absence has been shown to reduce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced permeability, indicating its involvement in the regulation of endothelial cell contacts (Wegmann2006ESAM). In addition to its role in endothelial cells, ESAM is expressed on platelets, where it localizes to platelet-platelet contacts and regulates thrombus formation, limiting thrombus growth and stability (STALKER2009Endothelial). These functions highlight ESAM's critical role in vascular biology and immune response regulation.

## Interactions
ESAM (endothelial cell adhesion molecule) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in its function. ESAM contains a PDZ domain binding motif in its cytoplasmic domain, which facilitates interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins. Notably, ESAM interacts with NHERF-1 (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1) in both resting and activated platelets, as confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (STALKER2009Endothelial). This interaction suggests a mechanism by which ESAM regulates platelet activity and thrombus formation.

ESAM is also implicated in the activation of the small GTPase Rho, which is involved in the stability of endothelial cell contacts. RNA interference experiments have shown that reducing ESAM expression significantly decreases Rho activation levels, indicating that ESAM may influence signaling pathways that activate Rho (Wegmann2006ESAM).

Additionally, ESAM has been identified to interact with MAGI1 (membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain-containing protein 1), which may activate RhoA, leading to the accumulation of Zo-1 and F-actin at junctions (Sauteur2017Distinct). These interactions highlight ESAM's role in maintaining vascular integrity and regulating cellular communication.
