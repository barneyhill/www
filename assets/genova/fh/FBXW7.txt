# FBXW7

## Overview
FBXW7 is a gene that encodes the F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 protein, a crucial component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by its F-box domain, which facilitates interactions with the SCF complex, and multiple WD40 repeats that form a beta-propeller structure essential for substrate recognition. As a tumor suppressor, the FBXW7 protein plays a vital role in regulating the degradation of several oncoproteins, including cyclin E, c-Myc, and Notch, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Yeh2018FBXW7:; Welcker2008FBW7). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and alternative splicing, which contribute to its functional diversity across different cellular contexts. FBXW7's involvement in critical cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis underscores its importance in maintaining genomic integrity and its function as a tumor suppressor (Yeh2018FBXW7:; Welcker2008FBW7).

## Structure
FBXW7 encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The protein is characterized by the presence of an F-box domain, which is essential for mediating protein-protein interactions. This domain facilitates the binding of FBXW7 to the SCF complex, allowing it to function in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. In addition to the F-box domain, FBXW7 contains multiple WD40 repeats. These repeats form a beta-propeller structure, which is a common motif involved in protein-protein interactions and is critical for the recognition of substrate proteins.

FBXW7 exists in several isoforms due to alternative splicing, which allows for functional diversity and regulation of its activity in different cellular contexts. The activity of FBXW7 is also modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. These modifications can influence the stability and interaction capabilities of the protein, thereby affecting its role in the ubiquitination process. The structural features of FBXW7, including its domains and post-translational modifications, underscore its importance in maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell.

## Function
FBXW7 encodes a protein that is a critical component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a vital role in targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Yeh2018FBXW7:). In healthy human cells, FBXW7 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating the degradation of several oncoproteins, including cyclin E, c-Myc, and Notch (Yeh2018FBXW7:; Welcker2008FBW7). 

FBXW7 recognizes its substrates through a conserved CDC4 phosphodegron (CPD) motif, which requires phosphorylation by a kinase (Yeh2018FBXW7:; Welcker2008FBW7). This regulation ensures proper transition through the G1/S phase of the cell cycle and prevents uncontrolled cell proliferation (Fan2022Clinical). The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, contributing to the regulation of cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis (Yeh2018FBXW7:; Welcker2008FBW7). 

FBXW7 also interacts with p53, facilitating its degradation to allow cell cycle resumption post-repair, and is involved in DNA damage repair processes, targeting proteins like PLK1 and XRCC4 for degradation or modification (Fan2022Clinical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the FBXW7 gene are implicated in various cancers, contributing to tumor progression and drug resistance. In colorectal cancer (CRC), FBXW7 mutations are common and associated with drug resistance and shorter overall survival (Yumimoto2020Recent; Fan2022Clinical). In gastric cancer, FBXW7 inactivation leads to aggressive tumors and poor prognosis, with miR-223 promoting cisplatin resistance by targeting FBXW7 (Wang2023FBXW7). In endometrial and cervical cancers, FBXW7 mutations are prevalent and linked to aggressive tumor characteristics and resistance to therapies like PD-1 inhibitors (Yumimoto2020Recent; Fan2022Clinical).

In lung cancer, FBXW7 mutations result in downregulation, poorer prognosis, and resistance to treatments such as gefitinib (Sailo2019FBXW7). In pancreatic cancer, FBXW7 mutations lead to cyclin E upregulation and chemotherapy resistance (Sailo2019FBXW7). In melanoma, FBXW7 deletion is associated with resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (Wang2023FBXW7). In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), FBXW7 mutations are linked to increased levels of Notch1 and c-Myc, enhancing glucocorticoid sensitivity and improving prognosis (Sailo2019FBXW7). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FBXW7 in cancer progression and treatment resistance.

## Interactions
FBXW7 is involved in numerous interactions that regulate its function and stability. It forms part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting proteins for ubiquitination and degradation. FBXW7 interacts with substrates such as cyclin E, c-Myc, and NOTCH through conserved CDC4 phospho-degron (CPD) motifs, facilitating their degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Lan2021Tumor; Kar2021The).

FBXW7's dimerization, mediated by its dimerization domain, enhances its catalytic efficiency for substrate degradation. This process is influenced by interactions with proteins like PIN1, which prevents dimerization in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and LSD1, which disrupts dimerization leading to self-ubiquitylation (Yumimoto2020Recent; Lan2021Tumor).

Phosphorylation plays a significant role in FBXW7's interactions. ERK phosphorylates FBXW7 at Thr 205, promoting its ubiquitylation in a PIN1-dependent manner. PLK1 and PLK2 phosphorylate FBXW7, leading to its self-ubiquitination and degradation (Yumimoto2020Recent; Fan2022Clinical).

FBXW7 also interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM) for nucleolar localization and stabilization, and with proteins like USP28, which reverses its auto-ubiquitination, affecting its stability and substrate degradation (Yumimoto2020Recent; Yeh2018FBXW7:). These interactions highlight FBXW7's role in maintaining genomic integrity and its function as a tumor suppressor.
