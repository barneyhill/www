# HCN1

## Overview
The HCN1 gene encodes the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 1, a transmembrane protein that is part of the HCN channel family. These channels are integral to the regulation of neuronal excitability and rhythmic activity, particularly in the brain and heart. The HCN1 protein is characterized by its tetrameric structure, with each subunit containing six transmembrane segments and a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain, which modulates channel activity in response to cyclic nucleotides like cAMP (Lee2017Structures; WahlSchott2008HCN). HCN1 channels are predominantly expressed in the neocortex and hippocampus, where they contribute to the generation of the I_h current, crucial for maintaining neuronal stability and excitability (Reetz2013Protein; Bonzanni2018A). Mutations in the HCN1 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, highlighting its clinical significance (Kobayashi2023The; Bonzanni2018A).

## Structure
The HCN1 protein is a member of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel family, characterized by a tetrameric structure composed of four identical subunits. Each subunit contains six transmembrane segments (S1-S6) with a pore loop between S5 and S6, forming the ion-conducting pathway (Lee2017Structures; WahlSchott2008HCN). The voltage sensor domain is located in the S1-S4 segments, with the S4 segment containing positively charged residues crucial for voltage sensing (Lee2017Structures; WahlSchott2008HCN).

The C-terminal region of HCN1 includes a cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) and a C-linker domain, which are involved in channel modulation by cyclic nucleotides like cAMP (Lee2017Structures; WahlSchott2008HCN). The CNBD features a conserved fold with an alpha-helix, an eight-stranded antiparallel beta-roll, and a long C-helix (WahlSchott2008HCN).

The quaternary structure of HCN1 is maintained by subunit-subunit interactions, with the C-linker playing a significant role in this assembly (Lee2017Structures). The channel's selectivity filter is non-selective for monovalent cations, allowing both K+ and Na+ ions to permeate, with a preference for K+ (Lee2017Structures). The HCN1 channel is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity (WahlSchott2008HCN).

## Function
The HCN1 gene encodes a protein that forms part of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel family, which is crucial for regulating neuronal excitability and rhythmic activity in the brain. HCN1 channels are primarily expressed in neurons, particularly in the neocortex and hippocampus, where they contribute to the generation of the I_h current. This current is essential for setting the pace of neuronal activity and excitability, influencing processes such as synaptic integration and plasticity (Reetz2013Protein; Bonzanni2018A).

HCN1 channels stabilize the resting membrane potential by counteracting deviations in membrane potential, thus maintaining neuronal stability and excitability. They are involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and dendritic excitability, particularly in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, where they constrain long-term potentiation (LTP) and dendritic integration (WahlSchott2008HCN; He2014Neurophysiology).

In the cerebellum, HCN1 channels in Purkinje cells stabilize integrative properties, allowing for reliable encoding of information and accurate decoding of input patterns, which is essential for motor learning (WahlSchott2008HCN). HCN1 channels also play a role in maintaining rhythmic activity in cardiac pacemaker cells, contributing to heart rate regulation (Porro2021Do).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HCN1 gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, particularly various forms of epilepsy. These include developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE), genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), and genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE) (Mckenzie2022Impaired; Kobayashi2023The; Bonzanni2018A). The HCN1 gene encodes a channel that is crucial for stabilizing neuronal membrane potential and regulating neuronal network excitability. Variants in this gene can lead to altered channel function, contributing to increased neuronal excitability and seizure activity (Porro2021Do; Bonzanni2018A).

Specific mutations, such as the p.Ser399Pro and p.Leu157Val variants, have been identified in patients with severe epileptic phenotypes, including drug-resistant epilepsy and profound developmental delays (Kobayashi2023The; Bonzanni2018A). These mutations often exhibit a dominant-negative effect, reducing the channel's contribution to net inward current and leading to increased neuronal excitability (Bonzanni2018A). Additionally, some HCN1 mutations are linked to visual deficits due to the gene's expression in the retina, affecting photoreceptor function and light response (Mckenzie2022Impaired; Zhao2023Retinal).

## Interactions
HCN1 interacts with the TRIP8b protein, which regulates its trafficking and gating in the brain. TRIP8b binds to HCN1 at two distinct C-terminal sites: an upstream site involving the C-linker/cyclic nucleotide-binding domain of HCN1 and a downstream site involving the SNL tripeptide of HCN1. The upstream interaction is crucial for TRIP8b's ability to inhibit HCN1 channel opening, while the downstream interaction is important for modulating channel trafficking (Santoro2011TRIP8b).

TRIP8b undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms that differentially affect HCN1 surface expression. Some isoforms increase surface expression, while others decrease it by promoting endocytosis (Santoro2011TRIP8b). The interaction between TRIP8b and HCN1 is mediated by the conserved SNL tripeptide sequence in HCN1, which is essential for the regulation of channel surface expression (Santoro2004Regulation).

Additionally, HCN1 interacts with KCNE2, a potassium channel accessory subunit, which can modulate the current density and gating of HCN1 channels, although the effects vary across different studies (Peters2022Regulation).
