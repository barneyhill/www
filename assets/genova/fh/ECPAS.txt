# ECPAS

## Overview
ECPAS, also known as Ecm29, is a gene that encodes the Ecm29 proteasome adaptor and scaffold protein, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation and stabilization of the proteasome complex. The proteasome is a critical cellular machinery responsible for the degradation of unneeded or damaged proteins, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing cellular dysfunction. Ecm29, as a scaffold protein, facilitates the interaction between the core particle and regulatory particle of the proteasome, ensuring efficient protein degradation and proper proteasome function (Sato2023ProteasomeAssociated; Dunlop2024Proteomic). This protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to various biological processes, including spermatogenesis, by regulating protein turnover and preventing the accumulation of damaged proteins (Sato2023ProteasomeAssociated). The functional importance of Ecm29 is underscored by its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in diseases associated with protein aggregation.

## Function
ECPAS, also known as Ecm29, functions as a proteasome adaptor and scaffold protein, playing a critical role in maintaining the integrity and function of the proteasome complex. The proteasome is responsible for degrading unneeded or damaged proteins through proteolysis, a process essential for cellular homeostasis and protein quality control (Dunlop2024Proteomic). ECPAS stabilizes the proteasome complex and facilitates its interactions with other cellular components, ensuring efficient protein degradation. This activity is crucial for regulating protein turnover and preventing the accumulation of damaged proteins, which can lead to cellular dysfunction.

ECPAS is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of protein degradation pathways. Its role as a scaffold protein suggests that it may organize or stabilize the proteasome complex, potentially influencing its activity or interactions with other cellular components (Dunlop2024Proteomic). Although specific details on the function of ECPAS in healthy human cells are not extensively detailed in the available literature, its involvement in proteasome regulation indicates its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing diseases associated with protein aggregation.

## Interactions
ECPAS, also known as Ecm29, is a proteasome adaptor protein that interacts with the 26S proteasome, playing a crucial role in stabilizing its structure and function. It binds to the core particle (CP) and regulatory particle (RP) complex of the proteasome, acting as a checkpoint for CP maturation and inhibiting proteasome activity (Sato2023ProteasomeAssociated). This interaction is essential for the regulation of proteasome-mediated protein degradation, which is critical for various biological processes, including spermatogenesis (Sato2023ProteasomeAssociated).

In murine models, ECPAS has been shown to work cooperatively with another proteasome-associated protein, PA200, to maintain proper spermatogenesis. The absence of both proteins in double knockout mice leads to significant reductions in proteasome activity and subsequent infertility, highlighting their functional complementarity (Sato2023ProteasomeAssociated). ECPAS is also involved in regulating the levels of specific proteins, such as LPIN1, which affects mitochondrial morphology during spermiogenesis (Sato2023ProteasomeAssociated).

While ECPAS is implicated in these interactions, specific details regarding its interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Li2022Combined).
