# WNT5A

## Overview
WNT5A is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 5A, a secreted lipid-modified glycoprotein that is part of the Wnt family. This protein plays a pivotal role in non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including cell migration, adhesion, and polarity, particularly during embryogenesis (Zhou2017Wnt5a; Nishita2010Celltissuetropic). Wnt family member 5A interacts with receptors such as the Frizzled family and receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptors (ROR1/ROR2), activating pathways independent of β-catenin. It is also involved in immune responses, being expressed by antigen-presenting cells in response to microbial stimulation (Blumenthal2006The). Clinically, mutations in WNT5A are associated with disorders such as Robinow syndrome and various cancers, where it can act as a tumor suppressor or be silenced through promoter methylation (Person2009WNT5A; RomanGomez2007WNT5A).

## Structure
The WNT5A gene encodes two protein isoforms, WNT5A-L and WNT5A-S, which are produced from alternative transcriptional start sites. These isoforms differ in their amino-terminal sequences, with WNT5A-L being a 337 amino acid protein and WNT5A-S a 319 amino acid protein. The primary structure differences are due to the presence or absence of the first 15 or 20 N-terminal amino acids (Bauer2013WNT5A). Both isoforms are secreted proteins and are highly hydrophobic due to lipid modifications, which are crucial for their processing, secretion, and receptor binding (Bauer2013WNT5A).

The WNT5A protein is a member of the Wnt family of secreted lipid-modified glycoproteins, which are involved in various developmental processes. It undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation, which are essential for its function (Bauer2013WNT5A). The isoforms have similar molecular weights (~43 kDa) and partition to the hydrophobic/organic phase, suggesting a similar tertiary structure (Bauer2013WNT5A). The WNT5A protein can form multimeric complexes, indicating a quaternary structure, although specific details on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the context.

## Function
WNT5A is a crucial component of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways, which are essential for various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It primarily interacts with receptors such as the Frizzled family and receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptors (ROR1/ROR2) to activate pathways independent of β-catenin, including the Wnt-Ca2+ and planar cell polarity (PCP) pathways. These pathways are vital for regulating cell migration, adhesion, and polarity, particularly during embryogenesis (Zhou2017Wnt5a; Nishita2010Celltissuetropic).

In the context of immune responses, WNT5A is expressed by antigen-presenting cells like monocytes and macrophages in response to microbial stimulation. This expression is mediated by Toll-like receptor signaling and the NF-kB pathway, highlighting its role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity (Blumenthal2006The). WNT5A also regulates the Th1 cytokine response, which is crucial for antimicrobial defenses (Blumenthal2006The).

WNT5A's role in cell biology extends to influencing tissue morphogenesis and maintaining cellular homeostasis. It can act as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell growth and migration in certain contexts, although its effects can vary depending on the cellular environment and receptor expression (Nishita2010Celltissuetropic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WNT5A gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In Robinow syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by skeletal dysplasia, limb shortening, and facial abnormalities, mutations in WNT5A are significant. Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome is linked to heterozygous missense mutations in WNT5A, such as C83S and C182R, which result in reduced signaling ability and affect craniofacial, skeletal, and genital development (Person2009WNT5A). These mutations lead to hypomorphic alleles, impacting the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway crucial for normal development (White2018WNT).

In cancer, WNT5A acts as a tumor suppressor in various types, including breast and colorectal cancer. Its expression is often silenced by promoter methylation, which is associated with poor prognosis. In colorectal cancer, WNT5A antagonizes the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, reducing tumor cell clonogenicity (Ying2008WNT5AExhibits). In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, WNT5A is frequently hypermethylated, leading to its silencing and contributing to disease progression (RomanGomez2007WNT5A). These findings highlight the gene's dual role in cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while promoting tumor progression in others (Katoh2017Molecular).

## Interactions
WNT5A is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various signaling pathways. It forms a complex with Dishevelled (Dvl) and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) proteins, enhancing the recruitment of APC to the cell periphery, which is essential for cell migration and signaling. This interaction is specific to WNT5A, as WNT3A does not have the same effect (Matsumoto2010Binding). WNT5A also interacts with Frizzled receptors, particularly Frizzled2 (Fz2), and is involved in the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics in migrating cells (Matsumoto2010Binding).

WNT5A binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror2, a key player in the non-canonical WNT5A/JNK signaling pathway. This interaction involves the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Ror2 and is significant for JNK activation, suggesting a role in developmental morphogenesis (Oishi2003The). WNT5A also promotes the assembly of Frizzled-4 (FZD4) signalosomes by stabilizing the dimerization of CRDs, which is crucial for intracellular signalosome assembly and WNT signaling (DeBruine2017Wnt5a). These interactions highlight WNT5A's role in modulating cell movement, polarity, and signaling pathways.
