# RPL3L

## Overview
RPL3L is a gene that encodes the ribosomal protein L3-like, a ribosomal protein paralog predominantly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. This protein is integral to the assembly and function of ribosomes, particularly influencing translation elongation dynamics in muscle cells. Unlike its paralog RPL3, RPL3L-containing ribosomes are less prone to collisions, which is crucial for efficient protein synthesis in muscle tissues (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining). The gene's expression is largely restricted to cardiomyocytes, where it complements the lower expression of RPL3, suggesting a specialized role in muscle-specific ribosome biogenesis and function (Milenkovic2021Dynamic). Mutations in RPL3L have been associated with cardiac conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining normal cardiac and skeletal muscle function (Ganapathi2020Biallelic; Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining).

## Structure
The RPL3L protein is a ribosomal protein paralog specifically expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. It shares approximately 78% sequence identity with its paralog RPL3, with notable differences in the C-terminal region, which is located on the surface of the ribosome (Ganapathi2020Biallelic; Milenkovic2021Dynamic). The primary structure of RPL3L includes several amino acid differences from RPL3, which may influence its function, particularly near the A-tRNA binding pocket of the ribosome (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining).

The tertiary structure of RPL3L has been modeled using homology modeling techniques, with the structure of RPL3 serving as a template. This modeling suggests that RPL3L maintains a similar overall structural organization to RPL3, but with an extended COOH-terminus by four amino acids (Ganapathi2020Biallelic; Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in ribosome biogenesis and function, particularly in muscle-specific contexts (Ganapathi2020Biallelic).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in RPL3L, potentially affecting its function and interactions within the ribosome (Ganapathi2020Biallelic). The presence of splice variant isoforms has not been explicitly detailed in the provided context.

## Function
RPL3L (ribosomal protein L3-like) is a ribosomal protein paralog specifically expressed in heart and skeletal muscle tissues. It plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of ribosomes, particularly in translation elongation dynamics. RPL3L-containing ribosomes are less prone to collisions compared to those containing its paralog RPL3, which is important for efficient protein synthesis in muscle cells (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining). The protein is involved in regulating translation elongation dynamics, especially at alanine and proline codons, which is essential for the production of proteins related to cardiac muscle contraction and overall cardiac function (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining).

RPL3L is largely restricted to cardiomyocytes in the human heart, where it complements the lower expression of RPL3, suggesting a functional interplay between these ribosomal proteins (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining). The presence of RPL3L in cardiomyocytes is associated with the absence of RPL3, indicating a mutually exclusive expression pattern that is not observed in other ribosomal protein paralog pairs (Milenkovic2021Dynamic). This exclusivity suggests that RPL3L-containing ribosomes may have specialized roles in muscle-specific ribosome biogenesis and function, contributing to the maintenance of normal cardiac and skeletal muscle function (Ganapathi2020Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RPL3L gene have been linked to several cardiac conditions, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and atrial fibrillation. Biallelic pathogenic variants in RPL3L are associated with rapidly progressive neonatal DCM, an autosomal recessive condition with a poor prognosis. This has been observed in multiple case studies where affected neonates presented with severe cardiomegaly and heart failure, often leading to early mortality (Nannapaneni2022Further; Ganapathi2020Biallelic). 

In addition to neonatal DCM, mutations in RPL3L have been identified in individuals with atrial fibrillation and other cardiac dysfunctions. These mutations can lead to impaired cardiac contractility due to decreased expression of proteins essential for cardiac muscle contraction (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining). The gene's role in translation elongation dynamics is crucial for maintaining cardiac function, and its deficiency can disrupt the translation of genes related to cardiac muscle contraction (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining).

The RPL3L gene's expression is also correlated with immune cell infiltration in the heart, suggesting a potential role in the immune response associated with DCM (Bajpai2023Exploring). These findings underscore the clinical significance of RPL3L in cardiac health and disease.

## Interactions
RPL3L, a ribosomal protein specific to cardiac and skeletal muscle, participates in several interactions that influence its function in ribosome biogenesis and translation. RPL3L is incorporated into translating ribosomes in wild-type hearts, where it plays a role in translation elongation dynamics, particularly at specific codons such as Ala and Pro, and at sites prone to ribosome collisions (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining; Milenkovic2021Dynamic). This incorporation is crucial for the translation of genes related to cardiac muscle contraction and dilated cardiomyopathy (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining).

In the absence of RPL3L, as observed in Rpl3l knockout models, RPL3 substitutes for RPL3L in ribosomes. This substitution leads to increased interactions between RPL3-containing ribosomes and mitochondrial proteins, which is not observed with RPL3L-containing ribosomes (Milenkovic2021Dynamic). These interactions are associated with enhanced ATP production, indicating a potential impact on mitochondrial function (Milenkovic2021Dynamic).

RPL3L's structural features, such as its NH2-terminal extension and W finger, are positioned close to the A-tRNA binding pocket, influencing peptidyl transferase activity and thus affecting translation elongation (Shiraishi2023RPL3Lcontaining). These interactions highlight RPL3L's role in modulating ribosomal function and its impact on cardiac physiology.
