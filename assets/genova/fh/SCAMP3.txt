# SCAMP3

## Overview
SCAMP3, or secretory carrier membrane protein 3, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in intracellular trafficking processes, particularly endocytosis and exocytosis. The SCAMP3 protein is characterized by four transmembrane helices and is localized to various cellular compartments, including the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and extracellular vesicles. It plays a crucial role in vesicle trafficking and recycling, impacting cellular signaling and homeostasis. SCAMP3 is part of the SCAMP family, which is essential for membrane protein trafficking and recycling in post-Golgi membranes. The protein is involved in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), by promoting their degradation through lysosome-targeted pathways. This function is vital for maintaining proper cellular signaling and preventing excessive cell proliferation. SCAMP3's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which is essential for its interaction with EGFR and its role in receptor degradation and cytokinesis (SCAMP3; Venugopalan2021SCAMP3; Li2020&lt; p&gt).

## Structure
SCAMP3 is a transmembrane protein characterized by four transmembrane helices, which contribute to its secondary structure (Hama2023TAX1BP1). It is involved in intracellular trafficking and is localized to various cellular compartments, including extracellular vesicles, the Golgi apparatus, and endosomes (Hama2023TAX1BP1). SCAMP3 is also associated with ATG9 vesicles, playing a role in selective autophagy processes (Hama2023TAX1BP1).

The protein is implicated in endocytosis and exocytosis, processes essential for membrane trafficking (Han2020&lt; Bioinformatics; p&gt). SCAMP3 is known to interact with other proteins, such as TAX1BP1, facilitating the recruitment of ATG9 vesicles to p62 condensates, which is crucial for autophagosome formation (Hama2023TAX1BP1). This interaction highlights its role in the assembly of vesicular structures necessary for cellular degradation pathways.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may occur in SCAMP3, although specific details are not provided in the context. The protein's involvement in various cellular processes, including its potential role in cancer progression and insulin secretion, underscores its functional significance in cellular dynamics (Norris2024Optimised; AcevedoDíaz2022SCAMP3).

## Function
SCAMP3 (secretory carrier membrane protein 3) is a transmembrane protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in the regulation of endocytosis and exocytosis. It is located in the endosomal and Golgi compartments, where it plays a critical role in vesicle trafficking and recycling, impacting cellular signaling and homeostasis (SCAMP3; Li2020&lt; p&gt). SCAMP3 is part of the SCAMP family, which is widely distributed in post-Golgi membranes and is essential for membrane protein trafficking and recycling (SCAMP3; Li2020&lt; p&gt).

In healthy human cells, SCAMP3 is involved in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs). It enhances EGFR degradation upon stimulation by promoting lysosome-targeted degradation through intraluminal vesicle formation in late endosomes (Venugopalan2021SCAMP3). This function is crucial for maintaining proper cellular signaling and preventing excessive cell proliferation. SCAMP3's role in cytokinesis is also significant, as its depletion results in multinucleated cells, which can lead to therapeutic resistance and tumor heterogeneity (Venugopalan2021SCAMP3).

SCAMP3's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, particularly at the Y86 site, which is essential for its interaction with EGFR and its function in receptor degradation and cytokinesis (Venugopalan2021SCAMP3).

## Clinical Significance
SCAMP3 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in membrane trafficking and receptor degradation. In lung adenocarcinoma, SCAMP3 functions as a tumor suppressor by promoting the degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Depletion of SCAMP3 leads to delayed EGFR degradation, increased tumor growth, and altered cytokinesis, which are associated with therapeutic resistance and tumor heterogeneity. These effects are dependent on the phosphorylation of SCAMP3 at the Y86 site (Venugopalan2021SCAMP3).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SCAMP3 is overexpressed and associated with poor survival outcomes. It enhances EGFR recycling and negatively regulates its degradation, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. SCAMP3 depletion in TNBC cells decreases these oncogenic processes and affects key signaling pathways, including AKT, ERK, and STAT3 (AcevedoDíaz2022SCAMP3).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), SCAMP3 is upregulated and correlates with worse survival rates. It is involved in pathways like ribosome and proteasome, affecting protein degradation and endosomal sorting. SCAMP3's expression is linked to disease stages and tumor grades, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Han2020&lt; Bioinformatics; p&gt).

## Interactions
SCAMP3 interacts with the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), playing a significant role in its trafficking and degradation. This interaction is enhanced by the phosphorylation of SCAMP3 at tyrosine residues Y35 and Y86, which is mediated by both wild-type and mutant forms of EGFR. The phosphorylation at these sites is crucial for SCAMP3's function in promoting EGFR degradation and attenuating downstream signaling pathways, such as the MAP kinase pathway, in lung adenocarcinoma (Venugopalan2021SCAMP3).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), SCAMP3 also modulates EGFR signaling, influencing cell proliferation and migration. It regulates the redistribution and degradation of EGFR, affecting key signaling pathways like AKT, ERK, and STAT3. SCAMP3's interaction with EGFR in TNBC cells is associated with increased cell motility and proliferation, highlighting its role in cancer progression (AcevedoDíaz2022SCAMP3).

SCAMP3 is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, potentially affecting protein degradation processes. It is suggested to interact with other proteins involved in cellular processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation, and metabolism, indicating its broader role in cellular signaling and cancer biology (Han2020&lt; Bioinformatics; p&gt).
