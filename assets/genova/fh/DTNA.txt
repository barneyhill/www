# DTNA

## Overview
The DTNA gene encodes the protein dystrobrevin alpha, which is a critical component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC). This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells by linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, thereby stabilizing the muscle cell membrane (Böhm2009Profound). Dystrobrevin alpha is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein and is involved in both structural support and signal transduction, particularly at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Newey2001Syncoilin). Beyond its role in muscle tissue, dystrobrevin alpha is also present in the brain, where it contributes to the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier and the structural integrity of perivascular astrocyte endfeet (Lien2012Absence; Sharp2021The). Mutations in the DTNA gene have been linked to various neuromuscular and cardiac disorders, highlighting its importance in human health (Xing2006Genetic; Finsterer2009Cardiogenetics).

## Function
The DTNA gene encodes α-dystrobrevin, a protein that is a key component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC). This complex is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells by linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, thereby stabilizing the muscle cell membrane and contributing to muscle function and structure (Böhm2009Profound). In skeletal muscle, α-dystrobrevin interacts with dystrophin and syntrophin, playing a role in both structural support and signal transduction at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Newey2001Syncoilin). It is involved in the maturation of the postsynaptic apparatus at the NMJ, where it helps maintain the integrity of acetylcholine receptor clusters and synaptic morphology (Newey2001Syncoilin).

In the brain, α-dystrobrevin is part of the dystrophin-associated protein complex within perivascular astrocyte endfeet, where it tethers these endfeet to the basement membranes. This interaction is essential for maintaining the structure and function of the extracellular matrix and for facilitating the proper flow of interstitial fluid and solutes out of the brain (Sharp2021The). The protein is also involved in maintaining the blood-brain barrier by supporting interactions between endothelial cells and astrocytes, which are necessary for the barrier's integrity (Lien2012Absence).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DTNA gene, which encodes α-dystrobrevin, have been implicated in several neuromuscular and cardiac conditions. Dystrobrevinopathy, caused by mutations in DTNA, is characterized by congenital onset weakness, muscle wasting, hypotonia, and variable complete external ophthalmoplegia. The clinical severity of this condition varies, and it can lead to death within the first year of life (Finsterer2009Cardiogenetics). DTNA mutations are also associated with left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), a cardiomyopathy marked by excessive trabeculations in the heart. In particular, the 362C>T mutation in DTNA has been linked to LVNC in several families, with both isolated and nonisolated forms of the condition observed (Xing2006Genetic).

Additionally, a rare missense variant in DTNA has been associated with early-onset atrial fibrillation in an Iranian family, expanding the spectrum of cardiac conditions linked to this gene (Malakootian2022Wholeexome). DTNA mutations have also been implicated in congenital heart defects, such as ventricular septal defects and patent duct arteriosus, as well as in Meniere's disease, where rare variants in DTNA may impair protein function and contribute to the disease phenotype (Oh2020Rare). These findings underscore the clinical significance of DTNA in both cardiac and neuromuscular disorders.

## Interactions
DTNA (dystrobrevin alpha) is a component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), where it plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity and function of muscle cells. It interacts with dystrophin through reciprocal coiled-coil interactions, forming part of the DGC in striated muscle (Waite2009The). DTNA also binds to syntrophins, which act as modular adaptors within the complex, facilitating interactions with various proteins such as neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), aquaporin-4, ion channels, and kinases (Valera2021Essential).

In the cardiac context, DTNA is involved in the assembly of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC), where it interacts with syntrophins and sarcoglycans. These interactions are essential for the recruitment and organization of signaling molecules at cell junctions, impacting cardiac health and function (Wang2021Proteomic). DTNA is also associated with the SG-SSPN complex, contributing to the stability and localization of the DGC at the sarcolemma (Valera2021Essential).

In the brain, DTNA interacts with dysbindin, a component of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), which is involved in protein trafficking and has been linked to schizophrenia susceptibility (Guo2008The).
