# CNKSR2

## Overview
The CNKSR2 gene encodes the Connector Enhancer of Kinase Suppressor of Ras 2 (CNK2), a synaptic scaffold protein that plays a pivotal role in neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity. CNK2 is primarily expressed in neural tissues, where it integrates multiple signaling pathways, including the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is essential for cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival (Houge2011LossofFunction; David2018Regulation). The protein contains several functional domains, such as the Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM), PDZ, and Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domains, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its localization to the postsynaptic density in dendritic spines (Ito2022Functions; Zieger2020Diseaseassociated). Mutations in CNKSR2 are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy and intellectual disabilities, highlighting its critical role in brain function and development (Erata2021Cnksr2; Ito2022Functions).

## Structure
The CNKSR2 gene encodes a protein known as the Connector Enhancer of Kinase Suppressor of Ras-2, or CNK2, which functions as a synaptic scaffold protein primarily expressed in neural tissues. CNKSR2 contains several functional domains that facilitate its role in cellular signaling and protein-protein interactions. These domains include the Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM), Conserved Region in CNK (CRIC), PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ), Pleckstrin Homology (PH), and a C-terminal PDZ binding motif (Ito2022Functions; Zieger2020Diseaseassociated).

The SAM domain is involved in developmental processes and signal transduction pathways, while the PDZ domain is common in proteins that participate in neuronal synapse signaling. The PH domain is crucial for membrane localization and synaptic targeting, binding lipid phosphatidylinositol and proteins like protein kinase C (Wilkinson2020Molecular; Ito2022Functions). CNKSR2 also contains a proline-rich motif important for binding with proteins such as Vilse/ARHGAP39 (Ito2022Functions).

CNKSR2 has multiple isoforms, including isoform 1, which consists of 1034 amino acids and includes all the mentioned domains, and isoform 3, a truncated form with 898 amino acids lacking the C-terminal PDZ binding motif (Ito2022Functions). The full-length CNKSR2 is required for binding with certain partners, indicating the importance of its complete structure for its function (Ito2022Functions).

## Function
The CNKSR2 gene encodes a scaffold protein involved in the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as growth, differentiation, and survival. This protein, also known as Connector enhancer of kinase suppressor of Ras 2, facilitates interactions between kinases and other signaling molecules, playing a significant role in neuronal signaling and synaptic plasticity (Houge2011LossofFunction; David2018Regulation).

CNKSR2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions like the hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebellum, where it is involved in synaptic function and neuronal morphogenesis (Sun2018CNKSR2; Higa2021CNKSR2related). It is localized to the postsynaptic density in dendritic spines, suggesting its role in integrating MAPK activation with processes such as membrane and cytoskeletal remodeling (Houge2011LossofFunction).

The protein is also involved in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, particularly the RAS-RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, which is essential for conveying proliferative and differentiative signals to the nucleus (David2018Regulation). CNKSR2's interaction with synaptic scaffold molecules and the postsynaptic density forms a complex that mediates neuronal proliferation, migration, differentiation, and death (Sun2018CNKSR2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CNKSR2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy-related conditions. These include developmental delay, intellectual disability, attention problems, language delay, and epilepsy, particularly within the Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum (EAS) (Erata2021Cnksr2; Ito2022Functions). Specific conditions linked to CNKSR2 mutations include Landau-Kleffner syndrome, Continuous Spikes and Waves during Slow Sleep (CSWS), and Childhood Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (CECTS) (Damiano2017Frequency). 

The gene is located on the X chromosome, and its mutations often result in X-linked intellectual disability, with a higher prevalence in males due to its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern (Higa2021CNKSR2related; Ito2022Functions). Pathogenic variants, predominantly loss of function, lead to early developmental delay, sleep disturbances, and seizures (Higa2021CNKSR2related). 

CNKSR2 mutations can also result in language impairment, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (Liu2022Case; Higa2021CNKSR2related). The absence of CNKSR2 protein has been linked to intellectual disability, attention problems, and language deficits following early childhood epilepsy (Vaags2014Absent). These findings underscore the critical role of CNKSR2 in neurodevelopment and its association with a spectrum of neurological and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
The CNKSR2 protein, also known as CNK2, is a scaffold protein that participates in various physical interactions with other proteins, playing a crucial role in signaling pathways and synaptic organization. CNKSR2 interacts with RAF1/c-Raf, a member of the RAF kinase family, which is involved in ERK signaling (Ito2022Functions). It also forms complexes with proteins in the Ral small GTPase pathways, such as Rlf, and interacts with Rac GTPase signaling molecules like Vilse/ARHGAP39, PAK3, PAK4, ARHGEF6, ARHGEF7, and CYTH2 (Ito2022Functions). 

CNKSR2 binds with Vilse/ARHGAP39 through a proline-rich motif, affecting its localization at the plasma membrane (Ito2022Functions). It is associated with synaptic proteins such as PSD95, S-SCAM/MAGI-2, and Densin-180. The interaction with S-SCAM/MAGI-2 involves the PDZ domains, while the C-terminus of CNKSR2 interacts with the PDZ domain of Densin-180 (Ito2022Functions). CNKSR2 also interacts with TNIK, a kinase involved in synaptic development, influencing TNIK's localization at dendritic spines (Ito2022Functions).

In addition, CNKSR2 interacts with the Smurf2 protein, a member of the Nedd4 family of HECT ubiquitin ligases. This interaction is mediated by the WW2 domain of Smurf2 and the 'SPPPPY' motif in CNKSR2, influencing CNKSR2's stability and expression (David2018Regulation).
