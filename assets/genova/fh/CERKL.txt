# CERKL

## Overview
CERKL is a gene that encodes the ceramide kinase-like protein, which is primarily involved in cellular homeostasis and is categorized as a kinase due to its structural domains. The protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and mRNA metabolism, particularly in the retina and brain. It is characterized by the presence of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) domain, which are essential for its subcellular localization and kinase activity, respectively (Rovina2009Subcellular; Bornancin2005Characterization). CERKL is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, especially under oxidative stress conditions, and is involved in the regulation of stress granules and P-bodies (GarcíaArroyo2021Overexpression). Mutations in the CERKL gene are linked to retinal diseases such as autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and cone-rod dystrophy, highlighting its importance in photoreceptor cell function and survival (Tuson2004Mutation; Downes2020Genetic).

## Structure
The CERKL protein is composed of 532 amino acids and has an approximate molecular weight of 60 kDa (Bornancin2005Characterization). Its primary structure includes several important domains, such as the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) domain, which are crucial for its function and localization (Rovina2009Subcellular; Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL). The PH domain is located in the N-terminal region and is essential for subcellular localization, while the DAGK domain is involved in kinase activity (Rovina2009Subcellular).

CERKL contains multiple conserved domains, including CC1, CC2, and CC3, with varying degrees of homology to other kinases (Rovina2009Subcellular). The protein also has several potential phosphorylation sites, primarily on serine residues, although phosphorylation does not alter its localization or activity (Bornancin2005Characterization). 

The CERKL gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with different 5' ends but a shared 3' region, contributing to its functional diversity (Garanto2011High). These isoforms include alternative exons encoding nuclear localization signals and the PH domain (Garanto2011High). The protein is associated with nucleoli, suggesting a potential role in nuclear functions (Bornancin2005Characterization).

## Function
The CERKL gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the retina and brain. In healthy human cells, CERKL is involved in several molecular processes, including autophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and mRNA metabolism. It acts as a shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus, binding sphingolipids and interacting with antioxidant enzymes to regulate stress granules and P-bodies under stress conditions (GarcíaArroyo2021Overexpression; Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL).

CERKL is essential for protecting the mitochondrial network, especially under oxidative stress. It helps maintain mitochondrial integrity by regulating mitochondrial morphology and function, which is vital for cellular health and resilience against stress (GarcíaArroyo2021Overexpression). The protein localizes to mitochondria, where it influences mitochondrial respiration and dynamics, impacting processes like fission, fusion, and trafficking (GarcíaArroyo2022CERKL).

In addition to its role in mitochondrial function, CERKL is involved in mRNA metabolism. It forms compact mRNA-protein complexes associated with microtubules, influencing mRNA transport and localization. This interaction is crucial for mRNA protection and survival until translation (Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL). CERKL's proper function is necessary for maintaining photoreceptor cell function and survival, impacting vision and neurological health (GarcíaArroyo2022CERKL).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CERKL gene are associated with several retinal diseases, most notably autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and cone-rod dystrophy (CRD). Retinitis pigmentosa is characterized by the progressive degeneration of photoreceptors, leading to symptoms such as night blindness and peripheral vision loss, eventually resulting in complete blindness (Tuson2004Mutation; Downes2020Genetic). Cone-rod dystrophy presents a more severe phenotype with early macular involvement and central vision deterioration (Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL).

The CERKL gene has been linked to a variety of pathogenic variants, with some populations exhibiting a founder mutation effect, such as in Spanish and North Indian communities (Tuson2004Mutation; Bansal2023Founder). These mutations can lead to premature protein truncation, disrupting normal cellular processes and increasing the susceptibility of retinal cells to apoptosis (Tuson2004Mutation; Bansal2023Founder).

The exact function of CERKL remains unclear, but it is thought to play a role in protecting retinal cells from oxidative stress. Its dysfunction may lead to increased retinal stress and apoptosis, contributing to the pathology of retinal degeneration (Garanto2012Targeted; Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL). Despite extensive research, no clear genotype-phenotype correlation has been established, and the variants are distributed across the entire gene (Downes2020Genetic).

## Interactions
The CERKL protein is an mRNA-binding protein that interacts with various components of the translation machinery. It is known to bind to mRNAs through its N-terminal region, specifically interacting with the 5' cap structure of mRNAs (Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL). CERKL forms complexes with several proteins, including PABP, HSP70, and RPS3, in an mRNA-dependent manner. These interactions are crucial for its role in mRNA stability and translation regulation (Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL).

CERKL is also associated with stress granules (SGs) and P-bodies (PBs), which are involved in mRNA translation regulation and degradation. Its localization to SGs is dependent on nuclear import/export and mRNA transcription (Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL). The protein interacts with microtubules, as evidenced by its colocalization with microtubule-related structures and its association with alpha- and beta-tubulin (Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL).

The CERKL-C125W mutant, however, does not interact with eIF3B and fails to form mRNA-dependent complexes, highlighting the importance of these interactions for its function (Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL). This mutant's inability to form complexes is linked to its restricted nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling ability (Fathinajafabadi2014CERKL).
