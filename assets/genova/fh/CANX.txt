# CANX

## Overview
The CANX gene encodes calnexin, a type I membrane-bound chaperone protein predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. Calnexin is integral to the calnexin/calreticulin chaperone system, which is essential for the proper folding and quality control of glycoproteins. As a lectin, calnexin specifically binds to monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides on nascent glycoproteins, facilitating their correct folding and maturation. This protein is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, ensuring that misfolded proteins are retained within the ER and targeted for degradation if necessary. Calnexin's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions with other ER chaperones and cellular components. The protein's role extends to various physiological processes, including cellular homeostasis and the pathogenesis of diseases such as colorectal cancer and cystic fibrosis, underscoring its clinical significance (Ryan2016Calnexin; Chevet2010Calnexin; Hammond1994Role).

## Structure
Calnexin (CANX) is a type I membrane-bound protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It features a large N-terminal lumenal domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The protein is part of the calnexin/calreticulin chaperone system, which assists in the folding of glycoproteins. Calnexin contains a lectin domain characterized by a globular β-sandwich structure, which specifically recognizes N-glycans containing Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. Key amino acids involved in glycan binding include Y164, K166, M188, and E216 (Guo2020Calnexin).

The protein also has a proline-rich P-domain, which forms an extended β-hairpin structure. This domain is crucial for interactions with protein disulfide isomerases like ERp57 and ERp29, facilitating disulfide-bond formation and proline isomerization, essential for protein folding (Guo2020Calnexin; Venkatesan2021Roles). The C-domain, although not fully resolved, is part of the ER lumenal domain (Venkatesan2021Roles).

Calnexin undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which are important for its function. However, specific details on these modifications or splice variant isoforms are not provided in the context (Guo2020Calnexin).

## Function
Calnexin, encoded by the CANX gene, is a chaperone protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotic cells. It plays a critical role in the folding and quality control of glycoproteins. Calnexin functions as a lectin, binding specifically to monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides on newly synthesized glycoproteins. This interaction is essential for the proper folding of glycoproteins, ensuring that only correctly folded proteins proceed through the secretory pathway (Kozlov2020Calnexin; Hammond1994Role).

Calnexin is involved in the calnexin/calreticulin cycle, a quality control system that retains misfolded proteins within the ER, targeting them for degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway if necessary (Chevet2010Calnexin). The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation events, which influence its role in protein folding and its interaction with other cellular components (Chevet2010Calnexin).

Calnexin also interacts with other ER chaperones, such as ERp57, to assist in the formation of disulfide bonds and other folding processes (Kozlov2020Calnexin). Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein function, with deficiencies leading to severe developmental issues in organisms (Williams2006Beyond).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the CANX gene, which encodes the chaperone protein calnexin, have been implicated in several diseases. In colorectal cancer (CRC), elevated levels of calnexin are associated with poor clinical outcomes, particularly in patients undergoing 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy. Silencing the calnexin gene in CRC cell lines has been shown to decrease clonogenic survival and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy, suggesting that calnexin could be a potential therapeutic target in CRC (Ryan2016Calnexin).

Calnexin also plays a role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis, particularly in the processing of the ΔF508 CFTR protein. Overexpression of calnexin can attenuate the formation of aggresomes and affect the accumulation of ΔF508 CFTR, indicating its involvement in the quality control of CFTR proteins (Okiyoneda2004ΔF508).

In the context of neurodegenerative disorders, calnexin deficiency in mice leads to early postnatal death and motor disorders, characterized by a significant loss of large myelinated nerve fibers. This suggests that calnexin is crucial for motor function and survival, highlighting its potential relevance to human neurological conditions (Denzel2002Early).

## Interactions
Calnexin (CANX) is a chaperone protein that participates in various interactions within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to ensure proper protein folding and quality control. It interacts with glycoproteins through its lectin domain, which recognizes monoglucosylated glycans, facilitating the folding of newly synthesized proteins (Schrag2001The). Calnexin forms complexes with ERp57, a protein disulfide isomerase, which assists in the formation of disulfide bonds in glycoproteins (Schrag2001The).

Calnexin also interacts with the ER-phagy receptor FAM134B, playing a crucial role in the autophagy-mediated quality control of procollagens. This interaction is essential for the selective autophagic clearance of misfolded procollagens, linking ER quality control mechanisms with the autophagy pathway (Forrester2018A). The interaction between calnexin and FAM134B occurs within the ER membrane and is mediated by the transmembrane regions of FAM134B (Forrester2018A).

Calnexin's association with ribosomes is enhanced by phosphorylation through CK2 and MAPK, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that modulates its interaction with ribosomal proteins (Chevet1999Phosphorylation). These interactions highlight calnexin's multifaceted role in protein folding and quality control within the ER.
