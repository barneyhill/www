# USB1

## Overview
The USB1 gene encodes the U6 snRNA biogenesis phosphodiesterase 1, a crucial enzyme in the 2H phosphodiesterase superfamily, which plays a significant role in RNA processing. This enzyme is primarily involved in the maturation of U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), a vital component of the spliceosome responsible for RNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. USB1 functions by processing the 3' end of U6 snRNA, facilitating the formation of a terminal 2',3'-cyclic phosphate group, which is essential for the proper assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (Didychuk2017Usb1; Nomura2018Structural). The protein's structure, characterized by a conserved 2H phosphodiesterase fold, enables its catalytic activity and interaction with RNA substrates (Didychuk2017Usb1). Mutations in the USB1 gene can lead to disorders such as poikiloderma with neutropenia, underscoring its importance in maintaining RNA stability and cellular function (Akdogan2020Poikiloderma).

## Structure
The USB1 protein, encoded by the human gene USB1, is a member of the 2H phosphodiesterase superfamily, characterized by two vicinal active site HxS/T motifs essential for its catalytic function (Nomura2019Structural). The protein exhibits a typical 2H phosphodiesterase fold, which is crucial for its role in RNA processing (Didychuk2017Usb1). The active site of USB1 is highly conserved and involves key residues such as His120 and His208, which are important for its enzymatic activity (Nomura2018Structural).

The tertiary structure of USB1 includes a catalytic domain that is homologous to its yeast counterpart, with nearly superimposable active sites (Didychuk2017Usb1). The structure of USB1 has been elucidated through crystallography, revealing its interaction with substrate analogs and highlighting the importance of specific residues in substrate binding and catalysis (Nomura2018Structural).

USB1's structure also features a conserved loop architecture that forms a distinct nucleotide binding site, contributing to its cyclic phosphodiesterase activity (Nomura2019Structural). The protein's structure facilitates an in-line attack geometry necessary for catalysis, with nucleotides in the active site cleft splayed apart (Nomura2018Structural).

## Function
The USB1 gene encodes an exoribonuclease enzyme that plays a critical role in the maturation of U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), a key component of the spliceosome, which is essential for RNA splicing in eukaryotic cells. USB1 specifically processes the 3' end of U6 snRNA by removing terminal adenosines and creating a terminal 2',3'-cyclic phosphate group. This modification is crucial for the proper binding of the Lsm2-8 protein complex, which is necessary for the formation of U6 and U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (Didychuk2017Usb1; Nomura2018Structural).

The enzyme's activity ensures the correct assembly and function of the spliceosome by preventing the binding of the La protein and promoting the binding of Lsm2-8 proteins, which prefer RNAs with a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate (Didychuk2017Usb1). USB1's function is vital for maintaining RNA stability and proper RNA splicing, impacting gene expression and protein synthesis in healthy human cells (Didychuk2017Usb1). The enzyme is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to RNA processing and overall cellular function (Didychuk2017Usb1). Loss of function mutations in USB1 can lead to disorders such as poikiloderma with neutropenia, highlighting its importance in normal cellular processes (Nomura2018Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USB1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably poikiloderma with neutropenia (PN), a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis. This condition is characterized by early-onset poikiloderma, nail dystrophy, palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, and chronic neutropenia, which predisposes individuals to recurrent infections and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (Colombo2015A; Akdogan2020Poikiloderma). The USB1 gene encodes a 3'-5' exoribonuclease involved in the post-transcriptional processing of U6 snRNA, and mutations can lead to aberrant RNA processing, contributing to the pathogenesis of PN (Hilcenko2013Aberrant).

Specific mutations, such as c.531delA, result in a frameshift and premature stop codon, disrupting the protein's function and leading to the clinical manifestations of PN (Akdogan2020Poikiloderma). In addition to PN, USB1 mutations have been implicated in acquired myeloid neoplasms, including MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting a broader role in hematological disorders (Negri2015Expanding). The gene's involvement in these conditions highlights its critical role in maintaining RNA stability and cellular function, with mutations leading to significant clinical consequences.

## Interactions
The human USB1 protein, also known as U6 snRNA biogenesis phosphodiesterase 1, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that are crucial for its function in RNA processing. USB1 specifically interacts with U6 snRNA, where it plays a role in the deadenylation process, cleaving the dinucleotide UA. This interaction is essential for the proper processing and maturation of U6 snRNA, a critical component of the spliceosome (Nomura2018Structural).

USB1's recruitment to the spliceosome is vital for efficient U6 snRNA processing, potentially facilitated by its N-terminal domain. This domain may aid in protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Nomura2018Structural). High-throughput interactome studies suggest that USB1 may interact with splicing factors such as Prp19 and Syf1, indicating its role in marking U6 snRNA for splicing progression and protecting it from inhibitory proteins or exoribonucleases (Nomura2018Structural).

These interactions highlight USB1's critical role in RNA splicing, ensuring the stability and proper function of U6 snRNA within the spliceosome complex.
