# CCT8L2

## Overview
CCT8L2 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the chaperonin family, specifically the chaperonin containing TCP1 subunit 8 like 2. This protein is part of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), also known as the TRiC complex, which plays a critical role in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin. These proteins are essential for maintaining cellular structure and function. CCT8L2 is predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a specialized role in testicular function. Although it shares structural similarities with other chaperonins, CCT8L2 is unlikely to form a typical oligomeric complex due to sequence differentiation and the acquisition of inserted elements, which may affect its substrate specificity and ATP-hydrolysis activity (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin; Shemesh2021The).

## Structure
The CCT8L2 protein is a member of the chaperonin family, which is involved in protein folding. It retains a chaperonin-like core structure, characterized by three domains: apical, intermediate, and equatorial, similar to other chaperonin proteins (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin). The secondary structure of CCT8L2 is predicted to have extensive conservation of secondary-structure elements, with some variations in helix and strand predictions compared to canonical CCT subunits (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin). 

The equatorial domain of CCT8L2 is mostly alpha-helical, aligning with the typical structure of this region in chaperonins (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin). However, the protein shows significant differentiation in substrate-binding positions, suggesting it may interact with substrates differently than canonical CCT monomers (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin). 

CCT8L2 is expressed predominantly in the testis, indicating a potential role in testicular function (Shemesh2021The). Despite its structural similarities to other chaperonins, CCT8L2 is unlikely to form a CCT-like oligomeric complex due to sequence differentiation and the acquisition of inserted elements (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin). The ATP-hydrolysis motif, crucial for chaperonin function, has also differentiated, indicating a potential loss of hydrolytic activity (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin).

## Function
CCT8L2 is a gene encoding a protein that is part of the chaperonin-containing TCP1 complex (CCT), also known as the TRiC complex. This complex is involved in the folding of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin, which are essential for maintaining cell structure and function. CCT8L2, specifically, is a mammal-specific chaperonin gene that is predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a specialized role in this tissue (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin; Shemesh2021The).

The CCT8L2 protein maintains a typical chaperonin-like core structure but is unlikely to form a CCT-like oligomeric complex due to sequence variations that affect substrate specificity and complex formation (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin). Despite these variations, the protein retains the ability to bind ATP, although it may have lost hydrolytic activity, which is crucial for the function of traditional chaperonin complexes (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin).

CCT8L2's role in healthy human cells is not fully characterized, but its expression pattern and evolutionary conservation suggest it may have functions beyond traditional protein folding, potentially involving microtubule elongation and other cellular processes (Mukherjee2010Chaperonin).
