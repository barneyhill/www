# ZNF880

## Overview
ZNF880 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 880, a member of the zinc finger protein family characterized by the presence of KRAB and C2H2 domains. These domains are integral to the protein's role in transcriptional regulation, as they facilitate DNA binding through the formation of zinc finger motifs (Dong2023Promoter). Zinc finger protein 880 is involved in various cellular pathways, including those related to cancer progression, by interacting with other proteins and nucleic acids. Notably, it has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC), where its expression is down-regulated, potentially affecting tumor suppressor activities and immune cell infiltration (Dong2023Promoter). The protein's interactions and regulatory networks suggest its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in CRC (Dong2023Promoter).

## Structure
ZNF880 is a zinc finger protein characterized by the presence of KRAB and C2H2 domains, which are typical features of zinc finger proteins involved in transcriptional regulation (Dong2023Promoter). The primary structure of ZNF880 includes sequences rich in cysteine and histidine residues, which are essential for the formation of zinc finger motifs. These motifs facilitate DNA binding, a common function of zinc finger proteins (Dong2023Promoter).

The secondary structure of ZNF880 likely includes beta sheets and alpha helices, which are common in zinc finger proteins, contributing to the stability and functionality of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains to form a stable conformation that allows for specific DNA interactions (Dong2023Promoter).

ZNF880 may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can affect its activity and interactions with other proteins. The protein-protein interaction network constructed for ZNF880 indicates interactions with proteins like CENPK, IFNGR2, and REC8, suggesting its involvement in various cellular pathways (Dong2023Promoter). The study does not provide specific details about the quaternary structure of ZNF880.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
ZNF880 has been implicated in colorectal cancer (CRC), where its expression is significantly down-regulated, particularly in the early stages of tumorigenesis. This down-regulation is associated with promoter hypermethylation and a high number of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in its KRAB and C2H2 domains, which contribute to decreased expression levels (Dong2023Promoter). Low expression of ZNF880 correlates with shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in CRC patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for poor prognosis (Dong2023Promoter).

The gene is part of a complex regulatory network involving competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), including several miRNAs and lncRNAs, which are up-regulated in CRC and may influence ZNF880 expression (Dong2023Promoter). ZNF880's down-regulation is linked to reduced immune infiltration of CD8+ cells in colon adenocarcinoma, while showing a positive correlation with CD4+ cells and macrophages (Dong2023Promoter).

ZNF880 may also regulate genes involved in tumor progression, such as CENPK, IFNGR2, and REC8. Its down-regulation could lead to increased expression of these genes, potentially activating tumor signaling pathways and affecting tumor suppressor activities (Dong2023Promoter). These findings suggest that ZNF880 plays a significant role in CRC progression and could be a target for therapeutic interventions (Dong2023Promoter).

## Interactions
ZNF880, a zinc finger protein, is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in colorectal cancer (CRC). It is suggested to interact with Interphase Centromere Complex Protein (CENPK) as part of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed using the STRING database. This interaction is notable because CENPK is involved in mitotic progression and chromosome segregation, and its upregulation is linked to various cancers. ZNF880 may repress CENPK, and its downregulation in CRC could lead to increased CENPK expression, potentially activating the YAP1 pathway, which is crucial for cancer progression (Dong2023Promoter).

ZNF880 also interacts with mRNA, with key proteins such as IFNGR2 and REC8 identified through binding energy analysis. IFNGR2 can inhibit Bax, a proapoptotic protein, and its increased expression in CRC may be due to decreased ZNF880, affecting Bax activation. REC8, a tumor suppressor, is downregulated in CRC, and ZNF880 may activate its transcription (Dong2023Promoter).

The study also highlights the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in regulating ZNF880, with a constructed competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network involving lncRNAs and miRNAs. This network suggests potential therapeutic strategies for CRC by targeting these ncRNA interactions (Dong2023Promoter).
