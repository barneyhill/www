# PFAS

## Overview
The PFAS gene encodes the enzyme phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase, which plays a pivotal role in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) to formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM), a critical step in the synthesis of purine nucleotides necessary for DNA and RNA production. As a cytoplasmic enzyme, phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase is integral to nucleotide metabolism and cellular energy balance, impacting cell proliferation and growth. The enzyme's activity is modulated by ERK2-mediated phosphorylation, linking it to growth-promoting signals and highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and pathological conditions such as cancer (Ali2020ERK2). Additionally, PFAS interacts with various proteins, including heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and viral components, underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular and viral processes (Xu2024Viral; Liu2019Mapping).

## Structure


## Function
Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS) is a crucial enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway, responsible for catalyzing the conversion of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) to formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM). This step is essential for the formation of purine nucleotides, which are vital for DNA and RNA synthesis, impacting cell proliferation and growth (Ali2020ERK2). In healthy human cells, PFAS is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to nucleotide metabolism and cellular energy balance.

The activity of PFAS is regulated by ERK2-mediated phosphorylation at the T619 site, which is necessary for stimulating purine synthesis. This phosphorylation is crucial for maintaining normal purine synthesis activity, as it enhances the enzyme's function, thereby supporting nucleic acid production and cell growth (Ali2020ERK2). The ERK2-PFAS axis serves as a molecular link between growth-promoting signals and purine metabolism, indicating that PFAS phosphorylation by ERK2 may be an ancestral mechanism to modulate the nucleotide pool in response to growth factor availability (Ali2020ERK2). This regulation is independent of changes in transcript or protein levels, suggesting a rapid control mechanism (Ali2020ERK2).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
PFAS (phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase) is involved in several protein interactions that regulate its function in purine biosynthesis. It is phosphorylated by ERK2 at the T619 residue, a modification that enhances its activity and is crucial for purine synthesis. This phosphorylation event is significant for cell proliferation and tumor growth, particularly in RAS-driven cancers (Ali2020ERK2). 

PFAS also interacts with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which is essential for its stability. Inhibition of HSP90 leads to decreased interaction with PFAS and increased proteolytic degradation, indicating that HSP90 is crucial for maintaining PFAS function within the purine biosynthetic pathway (Liu2019Mapping).

In the context of viral interactions, PFAS is involved in the deamidation of the replication and transcription activator (RTA) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). This interaction hinders RTA's nuclear import and transcriptional activity, thereby inhibiting KSHV lytic replication. The viral pseudo-enzyme vGAT interacts with both RTA and PFAS, suppressing PFAS-mediated deamidation and promoting RTA's transcriptional activation, which enhances KSHV replication (Xu2024Viral).
