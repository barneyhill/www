# UBAP1

## Overview
UBAP1 (ubiquitin associated protein 1) is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which is a critical component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-I). The UBAP1 protein is characterized by its involvement in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, specifically in the sorting and trafficking of ubiquitinated cargo within endosomes. It contains distinct structural domains, including the C-terminal solenoid of overlapping UBAs (SOUBA) domain, which facilitates its interaction with ubiquitin, and the N-terminal UBAP1-MVB12-associated (UMA) domain, which is essential for its integration into the ESCRT-I complex (Agromayor2012The; Farazi2019Truncating). UBAP1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by mediating the degradation and recycling of membrane proteins. Mutations in the UBAP1 gene have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, a neurodegenerative disorder, and have also been implicated in certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Lin2019Stopgain; Li2022A).

## Structure
The UBAP1 protein is characterized by its distinct domains and structural features. It contains a C-terminal solenoid of overlapping UBAs (SOUBA) domain, which is crucial for interacting with ubiquitin. This domain consists of three overlapping UBA domains, each composed of approximately 45 residues folded into a compact three-helix bundle with a right-handed twist (Agromayor2012The). The SOUBA domain is arranged as a right-handed solenoid of seven alpha helices, forming a single domain with a convex surface formed by helices one and three from each UBA, and a concave surface formed by the second helix from each UBA (Agromayor2012The).

The N-terminal region of UBAP1 contains the UBAP1-MVB12-associated (UMA) domain, which mediates association with the ESCRT-I complex (Farazi2019Truncating). The central region of UBAP1 interacts with the ESCRT accessory protein HD-PTP, which is involved in ubiquitin-dependent endosomal trafficking processes (Nan2019UBAP1).

UBAP1 is expressed as a single 2.7 kb transcript across various tissues, with high expression in the heart, skeletal muscle, and liver (Qian2001Isolation). The protein has potential post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and N-myristoylation sites (Qian2001Isolation).

## Function
UBAP1 (ubiquitin associated protein 1) is a subunit of the ESCRT-I complex, which is involved in the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated cargo. This process is crucial for the degradation and recycling of membrane proteins, playing a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. UBAP1 interacts with other ESCRT-I subunits, such as TSG101, VPS28, and VPS37, forming a stable heterotetrameric complex that is essential for its function in endosomal sorting (Agromayor2012The).

The protein is particularly important for the degradation of ubiquitinated endosomal cargo, facilitating the interaction of ESCRT-I with ubiquitin through its SOUBA domain, which binds ubiquitin. This binding is crucial for the sorting of endosomal cargo, as monoubiquitination serves as a sufficient signal for vacuolar/lysosomal trafficking (Agromayor2012The). UBAP1 is not required for other ESCRT-I-mediated processes like midbody abscission or viral budding, indicating its specific role in endosomal sorting (Agromayor2012The).

UBAP1 is expressed in various tissues and is essential for embryonic development, as its deletion is lethal in mice (Agromayor2012The). Its function in healthy human cells is primarily related to its role in endosomal sorting and ubiquitin binding, which are critical for cellular processes like membrane trafficking and signal transduction (Agromayor2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the UBAP1 gene are linked to hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. These mutations often result in truncated UBAP1 proteins that disrupt normal endosomal sorting processes, leading to neurodegeneration. The mutations are typically associated with autosomal dominant inheritance patterns and can manifest as either pure or complex forms of HSP (Lin2019Stopgain; Nan2019UBAP1). 

Common mutations include frameshift and nonsense mutations, such as c.468_469delTG and c.512T>G, which lead to premature translation termination and truncated proteins lacking essential domains for ubiquitin-binding (Lin2019Stopgain; Bian2021Two). These mutations impair the protein's role in the ESCRT-I complex, crucial for endosomal sorting, and can cause symptoms like lower limb spasticity, hyperreflexia, and urinary bladder dysfunction (Wang2020Autosomal; Li2022A).

In addition to HSP, UBAP1 mutations have been implicated in tumor development, with decreased expression observed in certain cancers. The relationship between UBAP1 mutations and cancer requires further investigation (Li2022A).

## Interactions
UBAP1 (ubiquitin associated protein 1) is a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT-I) and is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function. UBAP1 interacts with the ESCRT-I subunits TSG101, VPS28, and VPS37A, forming a stable complex with a 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal UMA domain of UBAP1, which is essential for its incorporation into the ESCRT-I complex (Agromayor2012The). 

UBAP1 selectively associates with VPS37A, but not with VPS37B or VPS37C, highlighting its specificity in ESCRT-I complex assembly. This selectivity is influenced by the UMA domain and a contiguous helical region of UBAP1 (Wunderley2013The). 

UBAP1 also interacts with ubiquitin through its C-terminal solenoid of overlapping UBAs (SOUBA) domain, which binds monoubiquitin. This interaction is crucial for the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo within the endosomal pathway (Agromayor2012The). 

Additionally, UBAP1 interacts with the His domain protein tyrosine phosphatase (HDPTP), a Bro1 protein involved in multivesicular body (MVB) formation, but not with Alix, another Bro1 protein (Stefani2011UBAP1).
