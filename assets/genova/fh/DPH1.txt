# DPH1

## Overview
The DPH1 gene encodes the diphthamide biosynthesis 1 protein, which is integral to the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a unique post-translational modification found on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). This protein is categorized as a non-canonical radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme, functioning in conjunction with DPH2 to catalyze the initial steps of diphthamide synthesis. The modification of eEF2 by diphthamide is crucial for maintaining translational fidelity and preventing -1 frameshifting during protein synthesis (Liu2012Diphthamide; Ütkür2023DPH1). Mutations in DPH1 are linked to developmental disorders and have implications in cancer biology, highlighting its role as a tumor suppressor gene (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency; Shi2024Diphthamide).

## Function
The DPH1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of diphthamide, a unique post-translational modification of a histidine residue on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). This modification is essential for maintaining the fidelity of mRNA translation and normal protein synthesis in cells (Liu2012Diphthamide; Ütkür2023DPH1). The DPH1 protein functions as part of a complex with DPH2, forming a radical SAM enzyme that utilizes iron-sulfur clusters to catalyze the formation of a 3-amino-3-carboxy-propyl radical, a precursor in diphthamide synthesis (Dong2014Dph3; Ütkür2023DPH1).

In healthy human cells, DPH1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the structural integrity and function of the DPH1•DPH2 enzyme complex. This complex is crucial for the initial step of diphthamide biosynthesis, which involves the transfer of a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to a histidine residue on eEF2 (Ütkür2024Functionala; Webb2008Diphthamide). The presence of diphthamide on eEF2 is vital for preventing -1 frameshifting during translation, ensuring accurate protein synthesis and normal cellular function (Liu2012Diphthamide). Deficiencies in diphthamide-modified eEF2 can lead to developmental issues and neurodevelopmental disorders (Ütkür2024Functionala).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DPH1 gene are associated with several developmental disorders and conditions. Diphthamide deficiency syndrome, also known as DEDSSH1, is linked to mutations in DPH1 and is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, craniofacial abnormalities, short stature, and sparse hair. This syndrome results from impaired diphthamide modification of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which affects cell proliferation and neural crest development (Shi2024Diphthamide).

DPH1 mutations can lead to the redistribution of eEF2 from ribosomes to p53, enhancing p53's binding to the p21 promoter. This increases p21 expression, inhibiting cell proliferation and contributing to the phenotypes observed in DEDSSH1 (Shi2024Diphthamide). Knockin mice with mutations corresponding to human DPH1 mutations exhibit similar defects, supporting the role of DPH1 in these developmental issues (Shi2024Diphthamide).

DPH1 is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly as a tumor suppressor gene. It is frequently associated with ovarian cancer due to loss of heterozygosity. The gene's inactivation can lead to increased tumor development, while complete inactivation is embryonically lethal (Hawer2020Diphthamide-deficiency; Pemov2014Genetic).

## Interactions
DPH1 is known to interact with several proteins involved in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway. It forms a heterodimer with DPH2, which is crucial for the synthesis of diphthamide, a post-translational modification on eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) (Abdel-Fattah2013Insights; Ütkür2023DPH1). This DPH1-DPH2 complex is a non-canonical radical SAM enzyme that plays a key role in the initial step of diphthamide synthesis by facilitating the transfer of a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to eEF2 (Ütkür2023DPH1).

DPH1 also interacts with DPH3, forming a complex that is essential for the diphthamide synthesis process (Abdel-Fattah2013Insights). The interactions between DPH1, DPH2, and DPH3 are not only structural but also functional, as they are necessary for the enzymatic activity required for diphthamide synthesis (Abdel-Fattah2013Insights). Truncation experiments have shown that while DPH1 can still physically interact with DPH2 and DPH3, these interactions alone are insufficient for enzymatic activity, highlighting the importance of the full-length protein for function (Abdel-Fattah2013Insights).

The DPH1-DPH2 complex is stabilized by specific cysteine residues, which are crucial for maintaining its activity and stability, particularly in the context of the radical SAM domain (Ütkür2024Functional). These interactions underscore the complex's role in the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway.
