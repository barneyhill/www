# ZC3H15

## Overview
ZC3H15 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger CCCH-type containing 15 protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including protein interactions and signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its zinc finger domain, which is a motif commonly involved in binding nucleic acids or other proteins, suggesting its role in transcriptional regulation and protein stability. ZC3H15 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, such as gastric cancer, glioblastoma, and acute myeloid leukemia, through its interactions with key signaling pathways and proteins, including FBXW7, c-Myc, and EGFR (Hou2022ZC3H15; Hou2022ZC3H15a). These interactions highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology. Additionally, ZC3H15 is involved in histidine methylation, further indicating its diverse functional roles in cellular metabolism and signaling (Wang2024Metabolic).

## Clinical Significance
ZC3H15 has been implicated in the progression of several cancers, including gastric cancer (GC), glioblastoma (GBM), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In gastric cancer, ZC3H15 is upregulated and associated with poor survival outcomes. It promotes cancer progression by enhancing c-Myc protein stability through the inhibition of FBXW7 transcription, a tumor suppressor responsible for c-Myc degradation. This interaction suggests that ZC3H15 could be a potential therapeutic target in GC (Hou2022ZC3H15a).

In glioblastoma, ZC3H15 is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis. It promotes tumor progression by stabilizing the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through the suppression of CBL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in EGFR degradation. This stabilization enhances cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating ZC3H15's role in GBM progression (Hou2022ZC3H15).

In acute myeloid leukemia, ZC3H15 is upregulated and affects cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. It interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TRAF-2) signaling adapter protein, making it a potential biotarget in AML (Orlov2018The). Additionally, ZC3H15 is a direct target of hsa-miR-133, which regulates its expression in pediatric AML, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wang2022Exploration).

## Interactions
ZC3H15 is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. In gastric cancer, ZC3H15 interacts with the FBXW7/c-Myc pathway. It binds to the FBXW7 promoter, inhibiting its transcription, which in turn affects the stability of the c-Myc protein by reducing its ubiquitination and degradation (Hou2022ZC3H15). This interaction highlights ZC3H15's role in modulating c-Myc protein levels and promoting cancer progression (Hou2022ZC3H15).

In glioblastoma, ZC3H15 interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. It stabilizes EGFR by reducing its ubiquitination, thereby preventing its degradation. This stabilization is achieved through the suppression of CBL, an E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for EGFR degradation (Hou2022ZC3H15a). ZC3H15's interaction with EGFR is crucial for promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in glioblastoma (Hou2022ZC3H15a).

ZC3H15 also interacts with the Zika virus protein NS5, although this interaction does not significantly affect Zika virus replication (Kong2019Diversified). Additionally, ZC3H15 is involved in histidine methylation through its interaction with CARNMT1, which methylates ZC3H15 and other zinc finger proteins (Wang2024Metabolic).
