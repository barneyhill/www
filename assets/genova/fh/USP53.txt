# USP53

## Overview
USP53 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 53, a deubiquitinating enzyme involved in various cellular processes. As a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, USP53 plays a critical role in the regulation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are important for non-degradative cellular functions such as intracellular trafficking and immune signaling (Wendrich2024Discovery). The protein is characterized by a unique molecular structure, including a USP catalytic domain, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Wendrich2024Discovery). USP53 is implicated in maintaining cellular junction integrity, particularly in the cochlea, where it is crucial for hearing (Kazmierczak2015Progressive). Additionally, it is involved in osteogenic differentiation and has been linked to various pathological conditions, including liver disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Baek2021Ubiquitinspecific; Gezdirici2022Biallelic).

## Structure
USP53 is a deubiquitinase with a unique molecular structure that includes a USP catalytic domain. This domain is characterized by a weakened S1 site and a cryptic S2 ubiquitin binding site, which is crucial for its activity, particularly in cleaving K63-linked ubiquitin chains (Wendrich2024Discovery). The S2 site is located on the backside of the USP fingers subdomain and is essential for the enzyme's specificity and catalytic efficiency (Wendrich2024Discovery).

The protein structure of USP53 includes a catalytic domain from amino acids 29-352, part of the Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase (UCH) superfamily. The mutation c.682T>C, resulting in a cysteine to arginine substitution at position 228 (Cys228Arg), occurs in a region of interest between amino acids 220-240, specifically affecting a cysteine motif (CXXXC) in the Finger region (Kanwal2023Genome).

USP53 was initially thought to be a non-protease homologue due to the absence of essential catalytic residues, but recent studies have revised this annotation, confirming its active deubiquitinase function (Wendrich2024Discovery; Quesada2004Cloning). The protein's structure and activity are further influenced by specific residues, such as Tyr160, which is crucial for engaging K63-linked ubiquitin chains (Wendrich2024Discovery).

## Function
USP53 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular processes through its activity on K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. These chains are involved in non-degradative cellular processes such as intracellular trafficking, innate immune signaling, and genome maintenance. In healthy human cells, USP53 regulates K63-linked ubiquitination, particularly at tricellular junction components, suggesting a role in maintaining cellular junction integrity (Wendrich2024Discovery).

USP53 is also involved in the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). It enhances osteogenic differentiation by stabilizing β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, through its deubiquitinase activity. This stabilization increases β-catenin's half-life, promoting bone formation (Baek2021Ubiquitinspecific). USP53 interacts with the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex to reduce the polyubiquitination of β-catenin, further supporting its role in osteogenesis (Baek2021Ubiquitinspecific).

In the cochlea, USP53 is localized to tight junctions in epithelial cells, where it is crucial for maintaining the functional integrity of these junctions. This localization is important for protecting outer hair cells from damage, thereby playing a role in hearing (Kazmierczak2015Progressive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the USP53 gene have been linked to various liver disorders, particularly cholestasis, a condition characterized by impaired bile flow. Biallelic variants in USP53 have been associated with both normal and low gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) cholestasis. These mutations can lead to significant liver pathology, including fibrosis and structural changes at the cellular level, such as elongated tight junction complexes (Zhang2020Low‐GGT). Patients with USP53 mutations often present with early-onset jaundice and pruritus, and some may require liver transplantation due to severe symptoms (Gezdirici2022Biallelic).

USP53 mutations have also been implicated in benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC), characterized by recurrent episodes of jaundice and pruritus without extrahepatic bile duct obstruction. This condition is now classified as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 7 (Ateş2023A). Additionally, some patients with USP53 mutations experience hearing loss, likely due to the gene's role in maintaining tight junction structures in the ear (Gezdirici2022Biallelic).

Beyond liver disorders, a rare missense variant in USP53 has been associated with severe psychosis, specifically schizophrenia, in a consanguineous family. This variant is thought to affect neural function by interacting with proteins involved in the AMPA synapse (Kanwal2023Genome).

## Interactions
USP53 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that interacts with several proteins, influencing various cellular processes. In endothelial cells, USP53 stabilizes the SR-A protein by inhibiting its K48-linked polyubiquitination, a process enhanced by the presence of exogenous rDKK1 or co-culturing with endothelial cells overexpressing DKK1. This interaction is crucial for promoting foam cell formation in smooth muscle cells during atherosclerosis (Liu2024Endothelial).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), USP53 interacts with the CRKL protein, stabilizing and deubiquitinating it. This interaction promotes metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TNBC cells, highlighting USP53's role in tumor progression (Liu2023USP53).

USP53 also interacts with cytochrome c (CYCS) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it acts as a tumor suppressor. By deubiquitinating CYCS, USP53 stabilizes it, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth (Yao2022USP53).

In lung adenocarcinoma, USP53 interacts with FKBP51, promoting its expression through deubiquitination. This interaction suppresses AKT activation, contributing to apoptosis and inhibiting glycolysis in cancer cells (Zhao2020USP53). These interactions underscore USP53's diverse roles in cellular regulation and disease.
