# ENPP2

## Overview
ENPP2 is a gene that encodes the protein ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 2, commonly known as autotaxin. Autotaxin is a secreted glycoprotein that functions as a lysophospholipase D, catalyzing the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid involved in numerous cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and survival (Hausmann2016Structural). Structurally, autotaxin is characterized by a multi-domain architecture, including somatomedin B-like domains, a catalytic phosphodiesterase domain, and a nuclease-like domain, and it belongs to the alkaline phosphatase superfamily (Inoue2011Crystallization; Hausmann2016Structural). The protein's enzymatic activity is crucial for various physiological processes, including embryonic development, wound healing, and vascular integrity, and its dysregulation is implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer and inflammatory diseases (Herr2019Pleotropic; Federico2016Thematic).

## Structure
The ENPP2 gene encodes the protein autotaxin, a secreted glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa. Autotaxin is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes two N-terminal somatomedin B-like domains, a central catalytic phosphodiesterase domain, and a C-terminal nuclease-like domain (Inoue2011Crystallization; Hausmann2016Structural). The phosphodiesterase domain is responsible for the enzyme's lysophospholipase D activity, which converts lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Hausmann2016Structural).

The active site of autotaxin contains two zinc ions and a threonine residue (Thr209), which are crucial for its catalytic function. The zinc ions facilitate substrate processing and product release, while Thr209 acts as a nucleophile in the catalytic mechanism (Hausmann2016Structural). Autotaxin's structure is similar to its bacterial homologues, belonging to the alkaline phosphatase superfamily, but it lacks the third metal ion site found in some other phosphatases (Hausmann2016Structural).

Autotaxin is glycosylated, a post-translational modification essential for its function, and exists as a homodimer, which is important for its enzymatic activity (Hausmann2010Mammalian).

## Function
ENPP2, also known as autotaxin, is an enzyme that plays a significant role in the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA is a bioactive lipid that is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival. The activity of ENPP2 is primarily located in the extracellular space, where it facilitates the production of LPA, thereby influencing numerous physiological processes. 

In healthy human cells, ENPP2 is crucial for embryonic development, as it contributes to the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. It is also involved in wound healing, where it aids in cell migration and tissue repair. Additionally, ENPP2 plays a role in maintaining vascular integrity, which is essential for proper blood vessel function and overall cardiovascular health. The enzyme's ability to modulate these processes highlights its importance in normal cellular and organismal function. 

Through its enzymatic activity, ENPP2 impacts various signaling pathways that are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological changes. Its role in producing LPA underscores its significance in both normal cellular functions and potential pathological conditions when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the ENPP2 gene, which encodes the enzyme autotaxin, have been implicated in various diseases. In cancer, ENPP2 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. This overexpression is linked to several cancer types, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancers, where it promotes cell motility, invasion, and angiogenesis (Federico2016Thematic). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), high ENPP2 expression is associated with reduced overall survival, and its inhibition has shown potential therapeutic benefits by reducing cell proliferation and enhancing apoptosis (Wang2023ENPP2).

ENPP2 is also involved in inflammatory conditions. It is upregulated during inflammation, leading to increased levels of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which can exacerbate immune responses and contribute to diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and asthma (Herr2019Pleotropic; Ninou2018Autotaxin). In neurological disorders, ENPP2 activity is linked to conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, where it influences demyelination and cognitive decline (Herr2019Pleotropic). These findings suggest that targeting ENPP2 and its pathways could offer therapeutic potential across a range of diseases.

## Interactions
ENPP2, also known as autotaxin, participates in several physical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function and regulation. ENPP2 interacts with integrins through its somatomedin B (SMB) domains, which are crucial for its lysophospholipase D (lysoPLD) activity. This interaction involves a non-canonical RGD motif, which is important for phospholipid binding and substrate recognition (Bellacchio2012In).

ENPP2 is also involved in the formation of a complex with JMJD3 and DDX21, which plays a role in transcription regulation. This complex is recruited to the ENPP2 locus, where it prevents R-loop formation and promotes transcription elongation. The helicase activity of DDX21 is essential for resolving R-loops, which are structures that can impede transcription (Argaud2019Enhancermediated). The interaction between JMJD3 and DDX21 is enhanced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, which increases their recruitment to the ENPP2 transcription start site and gene body (Argaud2019Enhancermediated).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of ENPP2 in cellular processes, including its involvement in cancer progression and inflammatory responses.
