# H3-7

## Overview
The H3-7 gene encodes the H3.7 histone variant, a member of the histone H3 family, which plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and function. Unlike other histone variants, H3.7 is characterized by unique structural motifs and post-translational modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, which suggest specialized functions in chromatin regulation. Although initially considered a pseudogene, H3-7 has been identified as a functional gene with tissue-specific expression patterns, indicating potential roles in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. The H3.7 protein is notably defective in forming nucleosome core particles, hinting at a distinct influence on chromatin accessibility and stability, which may impact transcriptional activity and DNA repair processes (Kurumizaka2021Contributions; Forcob2014Differential). The precise biological functions and implications of H3.7 in cellular and organismal contexts remain subjects of ongoing research.

## Structure
The H3.7 histone variant is a unique member of the histone H3 family, characterized by specific structural features and post-translational modifications. The primary structure of H3.7 includes a distinct motif, LVK105KLPFQ, located before the N-terminal end of the α1 helix adjacent to the histone fold domain (Forcob2014Differential). This motif is exposed on the nucleosome's lateral surface, which may play a role in counteracting heterochromatin formation (Forcob2014Differential).

H3.7 is acetylated at lysine-32, which is equivalent to lysine-36 in other H3 variants, and this acetylation is associated with a permissive chromatin structure (Forcob2014Differential). The acetylation is confirmed by its reaction with anti-H3K36ac antibodies, indicating a unique post-translational modification targeted to H3.7 (Forcob2014Differential). Additionally, H3.7 reacts with anti-H3K4me3 antibodies, suggesting the presence of methylation at lysine-4 (Forcob2014Differential).

H3.7 is specifically enriched in macronuclear anlagen during chromosome polytenization and is absent in micronuclei and parental macronuclear fragments, indicating its role in macronuclear development (Forcob2014Differential). The variant's unique sequence and modifications suggest a specialized function in chromatin regulation during Stylonychia macronuclear development.

## Function
H3.7 is a human histone variant that was initially thought to be a pseudogene but has been identified as a functional gene through in silico hybridization. It differs from the histone variant H3.3 by four amino acids at positions 77, 96, 127, and 128. Despite these minor differences, H3.7 is defective in forming nucleosome core particles (NCPs) in vitro, suggesting it may have a unique role in chromatin structure or dynamics that is not yet fully understood (Kurumizaka2021Contributions).

H3.7 is expressed in a tissue-specific manner, indicating it may have specialized functions in certain cell types or conditions. The specific molecular processes or cellular roles of H3.7 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, but its expression pattern implies potential involvement in chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. The defective NCP formation suggests that H3.7 might influence chromatin accessibility and stability differently from other histone variants, potentially affecting transcriptional activity and DNA repair processes (Kurumizaka2021Contributions).

The precise functions of H3.7 in chromatin dynamics and its impact on cellular and organismal outcomes remain areas of active research, with its tissue-specific expression hinting at roles in specialized cellular contexts (Kurumizaka2021Contributions).
