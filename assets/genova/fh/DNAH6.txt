# DNAH6

## Overview
DNAH6 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein axonemal heavy chain 6, a crucial component of the inner dynein arm (IDA) in axonemal structures. This protein belongs to the dynein family of motor proteins, which are essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. DNAH6 is primarily active in ciliated tissues, where it plays a significant role in converting ATP into mechanical force, thereby driving ciliary and flagellar movement (Wilken2024Primary). The protein's function is vital for various physiological processes, including respiratory function and sperm motility. Mutations in DNAH6 have been linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), male infertility due to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), and heterotaxy, highlighting its clinical significance in ciliary function and embryonic development (Tu2019Identification; Li2016DNAH6; Antony2022Spectrum).

## Structure
The DNAH6 protein is a member of the dynein family, which are motor proteins involved in ciliary and flagellar movement. It is composed of 4158 amino acids and contains 77 exons (Tu2019Identification). The primary structure of DNAH6 includes a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, such as the motor domain, which is crucial for ATPase activity and microtubule binding (Tu2019Identification). The secondary structure of DNAH6 involves the formation of α-helices and β-sheets, which are essential for its structural integrity and function (Tu2019Identification).

The tertiary structure of DNAH6 is a complex three-dimensional shape that is critical for its function as a motor protein. Mutations in DNAH6 can lead to alterations in this structure, resulting in misfolding and reduced ATPase activity, which impairs its ability to bind microtubules (Tu2019Identification). The quaternary structure involves the assembly of DNAH6 as part of larger dynein complexes, which are essential for its role in axonemal function (Wilken2024Primary).

DNAH6 is subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins (Cho2018ZMYND10). These structural features and modifications are crucial for the proper function of DNAH6 in ciliary and flagellar motility.

## Function
DNAH6 encodes a protein that is a component of the inner dynein arm (IDA) of axonemal structures, which are essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. In healthy human cells, DNAH6 is localized throughout the full-length ciliary axoneme, as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis, indicating its role as an axonemal component of respiratory cilia (Wilken2024Primary). The protein is involved in the structural integrity and motility of cilia by interacting with the light intermediate chain of IDAd and associating with CETN2, a protein linked to ciliary function (Wilken2024Primary).

DNAH6, along with other dynein heavy chains such as DNAH1 and DNAH7, plays a critical role in regulating the waveform of ciliary beating. It converts ATP into mechanical force, which is necessary for driving ciliary motility (Wilken2024Primary). This function is crucial for processes like respiratory function and sperm motility, as defects in DNAH6 are associated with severe impairment of sperm motility and primary ciliary dyskinesia (Wilken2024Primary). DNAH6 is primarily active in ciliated tissues, contributing to the proper function of these motile structures (Maiti2000Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH6 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions, primarily related to ciliary dysfunction. DNAH6 mutations are associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections and infertility due to impaired ciliary motility. These mutations can lead to defects in the central pair complex of motile cilia, contributing to the clinical manifestations of PCD (Li2016DNAH6).

In the context of male infertility, DNAH6 mutations have been linked to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), resulting in conditions such as asthenoteratozoospermia. These mutations disrupt the structure and function of sperm flagella, leading to reduced sperm motility and abnormal morphology, which are significant factors in male infertility (Tu2019Identification; Huang2023A).

DNAH6 mutations are also associated with heterotaxy, a condition involving abnormal arrangement of internal organs. This is often due to the gene's role in left-right patterning during embryonic development. The mutations can interact with other genes involved in ciliary function, suggesting a complex genetic model involving multiple gene interactions (Li2016DNAH6; Antony2022Spectrum).

## Interactions
DNAH6 is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, which plays a crucial role in ciliary and flagellar movement. It is involved in interactions with other dynein subunits and proteins, such as tubulin, to facilitate microtubule sliding. DNAH6 is identified as a putative inner dynein arm component and is associated with the light intermediate chain of IDAd and CETN2, indicating a physical interaction with these proteins (Wilken2024Primary). In healthy individuals, DNAH6 is localized throughout the full-length ciliary axoneme, but its localization is substantially reduced or absent in individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) who have variants in the CCDC39 and CCDC40 genes (Wilken2024Primary).

DNAH6 may also participate in trans-heterozygous interactions with other genes associated with PCD, such as DNAI1 and DNAH5. These interactions have been observed in zebrafish and mouse models, where subthreshold knockdown of DNAH6 in combination with mutations in DNAI1 or DNAH5 led to motile cilia defects (Li2016DNAH6). However, specific physical interactions of DNAH6 with nucleic acids or other proteins beyond these associations are not detailed in the available context.
