# EIF5AL1

## Overview
EIF5AL1 is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A like 1, a protein involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, particularly during the initiation phase of translation. This protein is categorized as a translation initiation factor and is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular homeostasis by influencing processes such as growth, proliferation, and apoptosis (Wu2020Recent). Unlike its closely related counterpart EIF5A1, EIF5AL1 cannot undergo hypusination, a modification critical for EIF5A1's function, suggesting that EIF5AL1 may have distinct biological roles (Wu2023Comparison). Research indicates that EIF5AL1 may act as a tumor suppressor, as its overexpression has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and migration in certain cancer cell lines (Wu2023Comparison). Additionally, EIF5AL1 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and juvenile dermatomyositis, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Yang2020High; Roberson2021Transcriptomes).

## Function
EIF5AL1, or eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A like 1, is a protein involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, specifically in the translation initiation process. This process is crucial for the production of proteins within cells, impacting cellular growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. EIF5AL1 is active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in maintaining normal cellular and organismal homeostasis (Wu2020Recent).

Although EIF5AL1 is almost identical to EIF5A1, with only three amino acid differences, it cannot undergo hypusination, a post-translational modification essential for EIF5A1's function. This lack of hypusination in EIF5AL1 suggests a distinct functional role compared to EIF5A1 (Wu2023Comparison). EIF5AL1 is suggested to function as a tumor suppressor, as its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and migration in HeLa cells, indicating its potential role in regulating cell growth and maintaining cellular stability (Wu2023Comparison).

The protein turnover of EIF5AL1 is faster than that of EIF5A1, which may explain the different expression levels of these proteins in cells. This rapid degradation occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, highlighting the importance of protein stability in its function (Wu2023Comparison).

## Clinical Significance
EIF5AL1 has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) among African American patients, EIF5AL1 is overexpressed and correlates with decreased survival rates. This overexpression is associated with the activation of the MYC transcriptional program, which is linked to oncogenic processes. The study suggests that EIF5AL1, along with other genes, plays a unique role in the tumorigenesis of TNBC in African American patients, as its overexpression does not have the same impact on clinical outcomes in Caucasian patients (Yang2020High).

In juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM), EIF5AL1 expression is negatively correlated with measures of vascular damage, such as nailfold capillary end row loop quantification. This suggests a potential role in the disease's pathology, although the specific clinical significance of EIF5AL1 mutations in JDM is not detailed (Roberson2021Transcriptomes).

EIF5AL1 is also mentioned in the context of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), where somatic mutations in the gene have been observed. However, these mutations were found in single colonies, and their pathogenicity remains unclear (Machado2023Convergent). The clinical significance of EIF5AL1 mutations in other diseases is not well-documented.
