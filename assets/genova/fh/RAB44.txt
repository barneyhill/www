# RAB44

## Overview
RAB44 is a gene that encodes a large Rab GTPase protein, which is a member of the RAS oncogene family. The RAB44 protein is characterized by its involvement in intracellular membrane trafficking and calcium signaling, particularly within immune-related cells. It contains several functional domains, including an EF-hand domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a Rab GTPase domain, which facilitate its role in processes such as osteoclast differentiation and mast cell degranulation (Tsukuba2021Large; Ogawa2020Role). The protein is predominantly expressed in bone marrow cells, including granulocytes and mast cells, and is implicated in immune responses and cellular differentiation (Tokuhisa2020Expression). Additionally, RAB44 has been associated with various clinical conditions, including immune-related diseases and cancer, where it may influence cytokine production and tumor progression (Noguromi2023Rab44; Sun2017CDKN1ARAB44transcript).

## Structure
The RAB44 protein is a large Rab GTPase characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function and localization. It contains an amino-terminal EF-hand domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a carboxy-terminal Rab GTPase domain (Tsukuba2021Large; Ogawa2020Role). The EF-hand domain is a calcium-binding site crucial for the translocation of Rab44 from lysosomes to the plasma membrane or cytosol following calcium influx (Ogawa2020Role). The coiled-coil domain is important for the localization and formation of organelles, particularly influencing lysosomal size and interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum (Tsukuba2021Large; Ogawa2020Role).

Rab44 exists in two isoforms in mice: a long form (Rab44-L) and a short form (Rab44-S). The long form includes all the domains, while the short form lacks the EF-hand domain and part of the coiled-coil domain (Tsukuba2021Large). In humans, only the long form has been reported (Tsukuba2021Large). Rab44 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as lipidation, which are essential for its membrane localization (Ogawa2020Role). The protein interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8), indicating a role in vesicular trafficking (Tsukuba2021Large).

## Function
Rab44 is a large Rab GTPase involved in various cellular processes, particularly in immune-related cells. It contains an EF-hand domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a Rab-GTPase domain, which contribute to its role in intracellular membrane trafficking (Tsukuba2021Large). Rab44 is highly expressed in bone marrow cells, including granulocytes and mast cells, and plays a role in osteoclast differentiation by regulating lysosomal calcium influx, which affects NFATc1 signaling in macrophages (Tsukuba2021Large).

In mast cells, Rab44 is involved in granule exocytosis and IgE-mediated anaphylaxis. It interacts with the v-SNARE protein VAMP8, facilitating the docking and fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane. This interaction is crucial for the FceRI-mediated release of secretory granules, highlighting Rab44's role in immune responses (Kadowaki2021Rab44). Rab44 exists in different isoforms, with the long form primarily localizing to lysosomes and the short form to nonendolysosomal compartments, both promoting lysosomal exocytosis (Kadowaki2021Rab44).

Rab44's expression and localization are cell type-specific and influenced by the form of the protein, suggesting its involvement in the differentiation and function of immune cells (Tokuhisa2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RAB44 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in immune-related conditions and cancer. In the context of immune responses, Rab44 deficiency is associated with impaired cytokine production and altered immune cell profiles, which can affect responses to allergens such as nickel, a common cause of allergic contact dermatitis (Noguromi2023Rab44). Rab44 is also linked to reduced anaphylactic responses and lower histamine levels, suggesting a role in allergies and autoimmune diseases (Tsukuba2021Large).

In cancer, a novel transcript fusion between CDKN1A and RAB44 has been identified, which is associated with increased RAB44 expression and downregulation of CDKN1A. This fusion is linked to immune evasion in tumors, as it leads to the inactivation of the TP53 tumor suppressor pathway, contributing to cancer progression (Sun2017CDKN1ARAB44transcript). The fusion transcript is prevalent in various cancer types, including bladder, stomach, and skin cancers, and is associated with higher RAB44 expression in tumors compared to adjacent tissues (Sun2017CDKN1ARAB44transcript). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of RAB44 in both immune-related conditions and cancer.

## Interactions
Rab44, a large Rab GTPase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. One significant interaction is with Coronin1C, an actin-binding protein. This interaction occurs primarily when Rab44 is in its GDP-bound form, as demonstrated in macrophages. The interaction between Rab44 and Coronin1C is crucial for osteoclast formation, as it regulates cell motility. Coronin1C knockdown impairs osteoclast differentiation, migration, and chemotaxis, highlighting its role as a GDP-specific Rab44 effector (Yamaguchi2022Coronin1C).

Rab44 also interacts with vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (VAMP8), a v-SNARE protein, in mast cells. This interaction is essential for the degranulation process, as Rab44 localizes mainly to lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum in these cells. The interaction with VAMP8 is observed in both mouse and human cells, suggesting a conserved mechanism across species (Tsukuba2021Large; Kadowaki2021Rab44).

These interactions indicate that Rab44 plays a role in regulating intracellular calcium levels and membrane trafficking, impacting processes such as osteoclast differentiation and mast cell degranulation (Kadowaki2021Rab44; Yamaguchi2022Coronin1C).
