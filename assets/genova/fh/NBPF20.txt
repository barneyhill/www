# NBPF20

## Overview
Neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 20 (NBPF20) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in neural development and differentiation. The NBPF20 protein is characterized by the presence of DUF1220 domains, which are associated with brain size and cognitive function, suggesting a role in the evolutionary expansion of the human brain. This protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it may participate in cell signaling and growth regulation, contributing to essential cellular processes for neural function. While the precise molecular mechanisms of NBPF20's action are still under investigation, its involvement in signaling pathways highlights its potential significance in neural cell growth and differentiation. The gene has been studied in various clinical contexts, including neuroblastoma and otitis media, although its direct clinical implications remain to be fully elucidated (Jiang2022Comprehensive; Khan2015Acquired; Elling2022The; Ma2017Whole).

## Function
NBPF20, a member of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family of genes, plays a significant role in neural development and differentiation. This gene is characterized by the presence of DUF1220 protein domains, which have been associated with brain size and cognitive function. The NBPF20 protein is typically active in the cytoplasm, where it may be involved in cell signaling and growth regulation. These activities suggest that NBPF20 contributes to the regulation of cellular processes that are crucial for proper neural function and development. The presence of DUF1220 domains in NBPF20 indicates a potential involvement in the evolutionary expansion of the human brain, as these domains are linked to increased brain size and cognitive capabilities. The specific molecular mechanisms by which NBPF20 influences these processes remain an area of active research, but its role in the cytoplasm suggests it may interact with other cellular components to modulate signaling pathways that are essential for neural cell growth and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
NBPF20 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its genetic alterations and expression changes. In neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that arises from nerve tissue, NBPF20 has been studied for its genetic alterations. However, gains in NBPF20 were not associated with poor clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma patients, suggesting that its role in this cancer may not be directly linked to prognosis (Khan2015Acquired).

In the context of otitis media, a common ear infection, NBPF20 was found to be significantly downregulated in patients carrying the FUT2 c.461G>A variant. This downregulation was observed alongside other genes, indicating a potential role in the pathogenesis of otitis media, although the specific clinical significance of NBPF20 in this condition was not directly addressed (Elling2022The).

NBPF20 has also been identified in co-mutation pairs in cancer genomes, particularly in the ICGC dataset, suggesting its involvement in tumorigenesis. However, the clinical significance of these co-mutations remains unclear (Jiang2022Comprehensive). Additionally, NBPF20 was noted to have mutations in hemangioblastoma patients, but the study did not discuss the clinical implications of these mutations (Ma2017Whole).
