# IFT20

## Overview
IFT20 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20) protein, a critical component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system. This system is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella, which are vital for cellular signaling and motility in eukaryotic cells. The IFT20 protein is characterized by a coiled-coil domain that facilitates its interaction with other proteins within the IFT-B complex, such as IFT57 and KIF3B, and is involved in protein sorting and transport to the ciliary membrane (Follit2006The; Baker2003IFT20). Beyond its role in ciliated cells, IFT20 is also implicated in non-ciliary functions, such as autophagy regulation in T cells and opsin trafficking in photoreceptor cells, underscoring its diverse functional repertoire (Finetti2021The; Keady2011IFT20). Mutations or disruptions in the IFT20 gene can lead to various pathologies, including retinal degeneration and cystic kidney disease, highlighting its clinical significance (Kretschmer2023Deletion; Jonassen2008Deletion).

## Structure
IFT20 is a protein involved in the intraflagellar transport system, essential for cilia and flagella function. The protein is approximately 15 kDa in size and is characterized by a coiled-coil domain near its C terminus, which serves as a protein-protein interaction motif (Follit2006The; Baker2003IFT20). This domain is crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as IFT57 and KIF3B, a subunit of kinesin II (Baker2003IFT20). The coiled-coil domain constitutes about 75% of the C-terminal peptide, indicating its prominence in the protein's structure (Follit2006The).

IFT20 does not share significant homology with other proteins and lacks conserved motifs beyond the coiled-coil domain (Follit2006The). It is part of the IFT-B complex and interacts with other IFT proteins, forming a stable hexameric complex with IFT57, IFT54, and others (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). The protein is also associated with the Golgi complex, where it interacts with Golgi proteins, indicating its role in protein sorting and transport to the ciliary membrane (Follit2006The; Taschner2012Architecture). The small size of IFT20 has made it challenging to determine the exact binding sites for its interactions (Follit2009Characterization).

## Function
IFT20 is a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella in eukaryotic cells. In healthy human cells, IFT20 is involved in the trafficking of ciliary membrane proteins, facilitating their transport from the Golgi complex to the cilium. This function is vital for the sensory roles of cilia, as defects in IFT20 can lead to impaired ciliary assembly and function (Follit2006The).

IFT20 also plays a significant role in T cells, which are non-ciliated. It regulates basal autophagy by recruiting the autophagy protein ATG16L1 to early endosomes, a critical step for autophagosome formation. This process is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and is distinct from IFT20's role in ciliated cells (Finetti2021The). IFT20's interaction with ATG16L1 is crucial for the localization of autophagic machinery components, highlighting its role in autophagy regulation (Finetti2021The).

In the context of photoreceptor cells, IFT20 is involved in the trafficking of opsin proteins, necessary for photoreceptor function and outer segment development. Its absence leads to opsin accumulation and cell degeneration, underscoring its importance in protein transport within the photoreceptor cells (Keady2011IFT20).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the IFT20 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions due to its critical role in ciliary function and intracellular processes. In the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), deletion of IFT20 leads to the loss of primary cilia, resulting in retinal degeneration and visual impairment. This condition is characterized by defects in RPE maturation and function, ultimately affecting photoreceptor health and causing their degeneration (Kretschmer2023Deletion). 

In the kidneys, IFT20 is essential for maintaining normal kidney architecture. Its deletion in the kidney collecting duct epithelium leads to cystic kidney disease, characterized by misorientation of the mitotic spindle, increased Wnt signaling, and rapid cystic expansion, resulting in renal failure (Jonassen2008Deletion). 

IFT20 also plays a role in bone formation and craniofacial development. Its loss in osteoblasts results in defective mineralization and delayed collagen secretion, similar to conditions like craniolenticulo-sutural dysplasia (Finetti2022IFT20:). These findings highlight the gene's involvement in various pathologies linked to ciliary dysfunction and intracellular trafficking defects.

## Interactions
IFT20 is a protein involved in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, playing a crucial role in cilia and flagella function. It interacts with several other proteins within the IFT complex B, including IFT57, IFT88, and IFT52, forming a stable subcomplex essential for transport processes in cilia and flagella (Baker2003IFT20). The interaction between IFT20 and IFT57 is direct and involves coiled-coil domains, which are critical for their binding (Baker2003IFT20). IFT20 also interacts with the kinesin II subunit KIF3B, although this interaction is weaker compared to its interaction with IFT57 and is specific to KIF3B, not KIF3A (Baker2003IFT20).

IFT20 is associated with the Golgi apparatus and interacts with GMAP-210, which tethers IFT20 to the Golgi in ciliated cells (Follit2009Characterization; Galgano2017The). It also interacts with IFT54, which can displace IFT20 from the Golgi complex, indicating a direct interaction (Follit2009Characterization). In T cells, IFT20 is involved in the recycling of T-cell receptors to the immune synapse, interacting with proteins such as ARPC3 and ERGIC-53, which are involved in vesicular trafficking and immune synapse assembly (Galgano2017The).
