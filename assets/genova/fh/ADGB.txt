# ADGB

## Overview
The ADGB gene encodes the protein androglobin, a chimeric mammalian globin with a complex structure that includes a calpain-like protease domain, a circularly permuted globin domain, and an IQ calmodulin-binding motif. Androglobin is predominantly expressed in the testes, particularly during the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, indicating its significant role in male fertility (Burmester2014Function; Hoogewijs2011Androglobin:). The protein is involved in critical processes such as sperm head shaping, acrosome reaction, and sperm motility, which are essential for proper sperm development and function (Keppner2021Androglobin). Androglobin's interaction with nitric oxide and its nitrite reductase activity suggest a role in nitric oxide homeostasis, important for germ cell viability and development (Reeder2024The). Additionally, its potential involvement in calcium signaling pathways, due to the presence of a calmodulin-binding domain, may influence its function in cellular processes (markworth2021expressionregulation; Reeder2024The). The protein's expression pattern and structural features imply specialized functions in reproductive tissues, potentially related to oxygen sensing and redox-regulated signaling (Hoogewijs2011Androglobin:).

## Structure
Androglobin (ADGB) is a chimeric mammalian globin characterized by a unique molecular structure. The protein is notably large, consisting of 1667 amino acids, and includes several distinct domains. It features an N-terminal calpain-like cysteine protease domain, a central permuted globin domain, and a potential calmodulin (CaM)-binding IQ motif, along with a large C-terminal tail of unknown identity (Keppner2021Androglobin; Reeder2024The). The globin domain of ADGB is circularly permuted, with a calmodulin binding domain situated between the H and A helices, stabilized by a disulfide bond similar to that found in neuroglobin (Reeder2024The).

The globin domain contains four cysteine residues, with specific cysteines (Cys787 and Cys978) predicted to form a disulfide bond, potentially stabilizing the heme pocket (Reeder2024The). The heme iron in ADGB binds nitric oxide in a five-coordinate complex, a feature common in heme proteins with nitric oxide storage functions (Reeder2024The). The protein exhibits rapid autoxidation and high nitrite reductase activity, suggesting a role in nitric oxide homeostasis (Reeder2024The).

ADGB's interaction with nitric oxide is atypical, with the heme group binding NO in a primarily pentacoordinate form, and the binding mechanism involves a conformational change from a closed to an open form of the protein (Reeder2024The). The presence of a calpain-like motif and a calmodulin binding domain suggests a functional mechanism involving calcium, which interacts with NO pathways (Reeder2024The).

## Function
The ADGB gene encodes androglobin, a chimeric protein with a unique structure that includes a calpain-like protease domain, a circularly permuted globin domain, and an IQ calmodulin-binding motif. This protein is predominantly expressed in the testes, particularly during the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis, suggesting a significant role in male fertility (Burmester2014Function; Hoogewijs2011Androglobin:). Androglobin is involved in processes such as sperm head shaping, acrosome reaction, and sperm motility, which are crucial for proper sperm development and function (Keppner2021Androglobin).

The protein exhibits atypical heme stabilization and interacts with nitric oxide (NO), suggesting a role in NO homeostasis, which is important for germ cell viability and development (Reeder2024The). Androglobin's nitrite reductase activity and rapid autoxidation further support its involvement in NO regulation (Reeder2024The). Additionally, the presence of a calmodulin-binding domain indicates a potential role in calcium signaling, which may influence its function in cellular processes (markworth2021expressionregulation; Reeder2024The). The protein's expression pattern and structural features imply specialized functions in reproductive tissues, potentially related to oxygen sensing and redox-regulated signaling (Hoogewijs2011Androglobin:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADGB (androglobin) gene have been linked to several reproductive and potential immunological conditions. In the context of male fertility, ADGB is crucial for spermatogenesis, and its deficiency leads to male infertility. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of ADGB results in malformed sperm, reduced testis weight, and decreased testosterone levels, indicating its essential role in sperm maturation and function (Keppner2021Androglobin). In humans, lower expression levels of ADGB have been observed in the spermatozoa of infertile men, suggesting a similar role in human fertility (markworth2021expressionregulation).

Beyond reproductive health, ADGB may also play a role in immune cell function. Although not fully elucidated, ADGB expression is influenced by transcription factors involved in B-cell development, such as Trim28 and PU.1, which are associated with B-cell derived malignancies like multiple myelomas and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (markworth2021expressionregulation). This suggests a potential, albeit hypothetical, involvement of ADGB in immunological processes and diseases. Further research is needed to clarify these associations and the broader clinical significance of ADGB.

## Interactions
Androglobin (ADGB) is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with members of the septin family. A notable interaction is with septin 10 (SEPT10), which plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis. This interaction is essential for sperm head shaping, acrosome reaction, and proper flagellum formation. The interaction between ADGB and SEPT10 has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments both in vivo and in vitro, indicating a robust association that persists even when certain domains of the proteins are truncated (Keppner2021Androglobin).

ADGB also interacts with calmodulin (CaM), a calcium-binding messenger protein. This interaction is involved in the proteolytic cleavage of SEPT10, which is dependent on the presence of CaM. The binding of ADGB to CaM has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid luciferase reporter gene assays (Keppner2021Androglobin).

These interactions highlight ADGB's role in the regulation of spermatogenesis and its potential involvement in calcium signaling pathways, which are critical for male fertility (Keppner2021Androglobin; Reeder2024The).
