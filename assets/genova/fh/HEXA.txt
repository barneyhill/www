# HEXA

## Overview
The HEXA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A, a lysosomal enzyme critical for the degradation of GM2 gangliosides. This gene is located on chromosome 15 and is essential for normal lipid metabolism, as it prevents the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the nervous system, thereby averting neurodegenerative disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease (Lemieux2006Crystallographic; Mistri2012Identification). The protein product, hexosaminidase subunit alpha, forms a heterodimer with the beta subunit encoded by the HEXB gene, creating a functional enzyme that is crucial for substrate specificity and catalysis (Maier2003The). The enzyme's activity is dependent on its dimerization, and proper glycosylation is necessary for lysosomal targeting (Lemieux2006Crystallographic). Mutations in the HEXA gene can lead to deficient enzyme activity, resulting in the clinical manifestations of Tay-Sachs disease (Ibrahim2023Biochemical).

## Structure
The HEXA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A, which is crucial for the degradation of GM2 gangliosides. The primary structure of the HEXA protein consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by 14 exons located on chromosome 15 q23-q24 (Mistri2012Identification). The secondary structure includes a (β,α)8-barrel motif, which is a common fold in glycosyl hydrolases, and is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic activity (Cordeiro2000The). 

The tertiary structure of the HEXA protein involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its function, although specific details are not provided in the context. The quaternary structure of beta-hexosaminidase A involves the assembly of the alpha subunit with the beta subunit, encoded by the HEXB gene, to form a functional heterodimeric enzyme (Maier2003The). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in lysosomal enzymes like beta-hexosaminidase A, although specific sites on the HEXA subunit are not detailed in the context (Maier2003The). The context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms of the HEXA protein.

## Function
The HEXA gene encodes the alpha subunit of the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), which is crucial for the lysosomal degradation of GM2 gangliosides. In healthy human cells, Hex A functions by removing the terminal non-reducing N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from GM2 gangliosides, a process essential for preventing the accumulation of these gangliosides in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Lemieux2006Crystallographic). This enzymatic activity is vital for lipid metabolism, as it converts GM2 gangliosides into GM3 gangliosides, thereby maintaining normal cellular function and preventing neurodegenerative disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease (Lemieux2006Crystallographic).

Hex A is a dimer composed of alpha and beta subunits, with the alpha subunit playing a key role in substrate specificity and catalysis. The active sites of Hex A involve specific residues that participate in substrate-assisted catalysis, with αGlu323 acting as a general acid-base residue (Lemieux2006Crystallographic). The enzyme's activity is dependent on its dimerization, as there is no evidence of active monomeric forms (Lemieux2006Crystallographic). Proper glycosylation of the alpha subunit is also crucial for its function, as it facilitates recognition by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor, which is involved in lysosomal targeting (Lemieux2006Crystallographic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HEXA gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the β-hexosaminidase A enzyme, are primarily associated with Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), a severe neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder. TSD is characterized by the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in lysosomes, particularly affecting neurons and leading to progressive neurological damage. The disease manifests in various forms, including infantile, juvenile, and adult, with the infantile form being the most severe. Symptoms include motor weakness, increased startle response, macular red spots, impaired vision, deafness, feeding problems, and seizures, eventually leading to a vegetative state and death by 2-4 years of age (Vahhab2020Analysis; Ibrahim2023Biochemical).

The HEXA gene is located on chromosome 15, and mutations can result in a defect in the α subunit, leading to deficient enzyme activity. Over 220 mutations have been documented, including missense, nonsense, splicing, small deletions, and gross deletions, affecting the protein's structure and function (Dastsooz2018Identification; Ibrahim2023Biochemical). Certain mutations are more prevalent in specific populations, such as the Ashkenazi Jewish and French Canadian communities (Cordeiro2000The; Vahhab2020Analysis). Genetic counseling and advanced diagnostic techniques, such as Next Generation Sequencing, are crucial for identifying these mutations and managing the disease (Ibrahim2023Biochemical).

## Interactions
The HEXA gene encodes the α-subunit of the β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme, which forms a heterodimer with the β-subunit encoded by the HEXB gene. This dimerization is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity, as the α-subunit alone is inactive. The α-subunit contains a positively charged binding pocket that interacts with negatively charged substrates, such as the sialic acid moiety in GM2 ganglioside, and is crucial for binding the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP) (Maier2003The; Tropak2016Construction).

The interaction between HexA and the GM2AP-GM2 complex is vital for the hydrolysis of GM2 ganglioside. GM2AP facilitates the removal of GM2 from the lysosomal membrane and presents it to HexA, forming a soluble, active quaternary complex in the lysosome. This complex positions the GM2 substrate for hydrolysis by the α-subunit's active site (Tropak2016Construction).

The α-subunit is also involved in forming hexosaminidase S (HexS), a homodimeric enzyme composed of two α-subunits. However, the assembly of HexA from α and β subunits is slower than the formation of HexB from two β subunits, leading to a pool of unassembled α subunits retained prelysosomally (Maier2003The).
