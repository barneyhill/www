# NDUFS5

## Overview
NDUFS5 is a gene that encodes the protein NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit S5, a component of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This protein is part of the twin Cx(9)C family and is localized on the intermembrane space side of complex I, where it plays a critical role in the electron transport chain by facilitating the formation of disulfide bonds (Elurbe2016The). NDUFS5 is involved in the late stages of complex I assembly, contributing to the stability and function of the enzyme complex, which is essential for ATP production through oxidative phosphorylation (Vogel2007Human; Mckenzie2010Assembly). The proper function of NDUFS5 is crucial for maintaining cellular energy metabolism, and its dysfunction is associated with various pathophysiological conditions, including heart failure and mitochondrial disorders such as complex I deficiency (Iwahana2020Novel; Koene2012Natural).

## Structure
The NDUFS5 protein is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. It is located on the intermembrane space (IMS) side of the complex and interacts with several core subunits, including ND6, ND4L, and ND2 (Padavannil2022The). The molecular structure of NDUFS5 includes an N-terminal coil, a disulfide cross-linked helix-turn-helix motif (α1-α2 S5), an α-helix (α3 S5), and a C-terminal coil. The N-terminal coil occupies space at the interface of the IMS and inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and interacts with multiple subunits such as ND2, NDUFC2, and NDUFB5 (Padavannil2022The).

NDUFS5 contains Cx9C domains, characterized by repeated double cysteine motifs that form disulfide bridges, stabilizing a helical hairpin structure. These cysteines are oxidized in the IMS, catalyzed by the MIA40/ERV1 disulfide bond relay, which is essential for their localization (Szklarczyk2011NDUFB7). The disulfide cross-linked helix-turn-helix motif interacts with NDUFA8, NDUFB5, ND2, and ND4L, while the α3 S5 helix interacts with ND4L, ND6, and NDUFA13 (Padavannil2022The). These interactions suggest that NDUFS5 plays a role in stabilizing the structure of complex I and facilitating its assembly (Padavannil2022The).

## Function
NDUFS5 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is a crucial component of the oxidative phosphorylation system in human cells. This enzyme complex is responsible for the oxidation of NADH and the transfer of electrons to ubiquinone, contributing to ATP production through the electron transport chain (Vogel2007Human). NDUFS5 is part of the hydrophilic peripheral arm of complex I, which contains redox-active cofactors and the NADH oxidation site (Wirth2016Structure).

In healthy human cells, NDUFS5 plays a role in the proper assembly of the peripheral arm of complex I. The loss of NDUFS5 can result in the accumulation of membrane arm intermediates and the failure to detect an active peripheral arm, indicating its importance in the assembly process (Vogel2007Human). This subunit is involved in maintaining the stability and function of complex I, which is essential for efficient ATP synthesis and cellular energy metabolism. Disturbances in the function of NDUFS5 can lead to increased production of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, contributing to conditions such as heart failure (Iwahana2020Novel).

## Clinical Significance
NDUFS5, a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of various diseases through its involvement in the electron transport chain. Alterations in the expression of NDUFS5 have been linked to heart failure, particularly in the context of left ventricular reverse remodeling (LVRR) in patients with advanced non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM). Studies have shown that NDUFS5 is upregulated in patients who do not experience LVRR, suggesting its potential role in heart failure progression through mechanisms involving increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis (Iwahana2020Novel). 

NDUFS5 is also associated with complex I deficiency, a mitochondrial disorder characterized by a range of clinical presentations, including Leigh syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative condition. Mutations in nuclear genes encoding complex I subunits, such as NDUFS5, can lead to complex I deficiency, resulting in conditions like neonatal cardiomyopathy and fatal infantile lactic acidosis (Koene2012Natural). The clinical significance of NDUFS5 in these disorders underscores its potential as a biomarker for predicting disease outcomes and as a target for therapeutic intervention (Iwahana2020Novel).

## Interactions
NDUFS5 is a subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which plays a critical role in the electron transport chain. This protein is part of the twin Cx(9)C family and is localized on the intermembrane space side of complex I, where it is involved in the formation of disulfide bonds, a characteristic feature of this family (Elurbe2016The). NDUFS5 is incorporated into the near-mature complex I at a late stage of assembly, indicating its role in the final steps of complex I maturation (Mckenzie2010Assembly).

Although NDUFS5 does not coprecipitate with the assembly factor Ndufaf1 and is not detectable in any assembly intermediates, its integration into complex I is essential for the proper function of the electron transport chain (Mckenzie2010Assembly). The downregulation of NDUFS5, along with other subunits of complex I, has been associated with impaired electron transfer and reduced ATP production, highlighting its importance in maintaining mitochondrial function (Xu2022Effect). Despite its critical role, specific protein-protein interactions involving NDUFS5 within complex I remain less characterized compared to other subunits.
