# ZNF385D

## Overview
ZNF385D is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 385D, a transcription factor involved in regulating gene expression through its interaction with DNA. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor due to its role in modulating the transcriptional activity of various genes. ZNF385D is expressed in several tissues, with notable functions in pancreatic β-cell differentiation, immune response regulation, and neurophysiological processes. It is implicated in the pathogenesis of conditions such as carotid atherosclerosis and neurodevelopmental disorders, including reading disability and language impairment. Additionally, alterations in ZNF385D expression have been associated with liver cancer prognosis, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Zhang2019Low; Kang2023Human; Tan2024Transcription).

## Function
ZNF385D (zinc finger protein 385D) is a transcription factor involved in various molecular processes, primarily within the nucleus of cells. It plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation by binding to DNA and influencing gene expression. This protein is particularly important in the differentiation and identity of pancreatic β-cells, where it is highly expressed and serves as a marker for these cells. Its expression is associated with enhanced β-cell differentiation, which is crucial for maintaining proper insulin production and glucose homeostasis (Kang2023Human; Kang2022Single).

In addition to its role in pancreatic cells, ZNF385D is involved in the immune system's response to inflammation and infection, which is critical in the pathogenesis of conditions like carotid atherosclerosis. It regulates a large network of genes, many of which are involved in immune-related pathways, suggesting its involvement in modulating immune responses and potentially providing a protective role against plaque formation in atherosclerosis (Tan2024Transcription).

ZNF385D is also implicated in neurophysiological processes, with its expression patterns suggesting a role in neuronal health and potentially influencing longevity (Szymczak2020DNA). These diverse functions highlight the gene's importance in both cellular and organismal biology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ZNF385D gene have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders. ZNF385D is associated with reading disability (RD) and language impairment (LI), particularly when these conditions occur together, suggesting a role in shared genetic pathways underlying these disorders (Eicher2013Genome‐wide). The gene has also been linked to schizophrenia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which share core impairments with RD and LI (Eicher2013Genome‐wide).

In the context of cardiovascular health, ZNF385D has been identified as a transcription factor involved in carotid atherosclerosis. It regulates a large network of genes associated with immune responses to inflammation, which are crucial in the development of atherosclerosis (Tan2024Transcription). Genetic polymorphisms in ZNF385D are associated with carotid intima-media thickness, a marker for atherosclerosis, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of this condition (Tan2024Transcription).

In liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the long non-coding RNA ZNF385D-AS2, related to ZNF385D, is downregulated and serves as an independent prognostic marker for poor overall survival. Its expression levels correlate with various clinical features, indicating its potential as a biomarker for liver cancer prognosis (Zhang2019Low).
