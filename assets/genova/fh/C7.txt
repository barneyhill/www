# C7

## Overview
The C7 gene encodes the complement component C7, a glycoprotein integral to the immune system's complement pathway. This protein is a key participant in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which plays a critical role in the immune response by forming pores in the membranes of target cells, leading to cell lysis. Structurally, complement C7 is characterized by its mosaic composition, including thrombospondin type-1 (TSP1) domains, low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDL) domains, and complement control protein (CCP) domains, which facilitate its function in MAC assembly and membrane binding (Lukassen2021Similarities). The protein is primarily synthesized by granulocytes, endothelial, and bone-marrow-derived cells, highlighting its role in local immune responses rather than systemic production by the liver (Massri2024Complement). Mutations in the C7 gene can lead to complement component C7 deficiency, increasing susceptibility to infections, particularly by Neisseria meningitidis, and have been implicated in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (Balduit2023Genetic; Zhang2018Complement).

## Structure
Complement C7 is a glycoprotein involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the immune system. The primary structure of C7 consists of a single polypeptide chain with 821 amino acids, including a 22-residue hydrophobic leader peptide. It contains 56 cysteine residues forming 28 disulfide bonds, which are crucial for its structural stability (DiScipio1988The). The protein is glycosylated at two sites, with carbohydrate attachments at positions 180 and 732 (DiScipio1988The).

The secondary structure of C7 is dominated by beta-sheets (38%) and beta-turns (24%), with minimal alpha-helical content (7%) (DiScipio1988The). Tertiary structure visualization shows C7 as a flexible, elongated molecule, capable of significant conformational changes upon binding with other complement components (DiScipio1988The).

C7 contains specific domains, including thrombospondin type-1 (TSP1) domains, low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDL) domains, and complement control protein (CCP) domains. These domains contribute to its role in MAC assembly and membrane binding (Lukassen2021Similarities). Post-translational modifications include glycosylation, with distinct patterns compared to other complement proteins like C6 (Lukassen2021Similarities). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with other complement proteins, forming the C5b-7 complex, which is essential for MAC assembly (DiScipio1988The).

## Function
Complement C7 is a crucial component of the complement system, specifically involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). C7 binds to the C5b-6 complex, facilitating the transition to an amphiphilic C5b-7 complex that can attach to target cell membranes. This attachment is essential for the subsequent insertion of C8 and polymerized C9, which together form transmembrane pores that disrupt the membrane permeability barrier, ultimately leading to cell lysis and death (DiScipio1988The; Massri2024Complement).

C7 is a mosaic protein composed of 821 amino acids and shares structural homology with other terminal complement components such as C8 and C9. Its structure includes cysteine-rich segments and hydrophobic zones, which are crucial for its membrane-binding capabilities (DiScipio1988The). The protein is primarily synthesized by granulocytes, endothelial, and bone-marrow-derived cells, and not the liver, indicating its role in local immune responses (Massri2024Complement).

In addition to its role in MAC assembly, C7 can form a complex with clusterin, a complement inhibitor, suggesting a regulatory function in preventing excessive complement activation and protecting host tissues from damage (Massri2024Complement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the C7 gene can lead to complement component C7 deficiency, which is associated with an increased risk of recurrent infections, particularly by Neisseria meningitidis. This is due to defects in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), crucial for immune defense. Individuals with C7 deficiency may experience recurrent systemic infections, although some remain asymptomatic, suggesting other genetic or environmental factors may influence disease manifestation (VÁZQUEZBERMÚDEZ2003Complement; Balduit2023Genetic; Barroso2010C7).

Several mutations have been identified in the C7 gene, including missense mutations like G357R and R499S, and nonsense mutations leading to premature stop codons, which result in truncated, non-functional proteins. These mutations can lead to undetectable levels of C7 in plasma, contributing to the deficiency (Rameix‐Welti2007Hereditary).

Alterations in C7 expression have also been linked to Alzheimer's disease, particularly in the Han Chinese population. The rs3792646 variant (p.K420Q) in the C7 gene is associated with early-onset Alzheimer's, affecting brain function and structure, such as hippocampal volume and working memory performance (Zhang2018Complement).

## Interactions
Complement C7 is involved in several interactions within the immune system. It is a crucial component of the membrane attack complex (MAC), where it interacts with other complement proteins such as C5b, C6, C8, and C9 to form a structure that can bind to and disrupt target cell membranes (DiScipio1988The). C7, along with C5b and C6, forms the C5b-7 complex, which is capable of binding to phospholipid membranes, facilitating the insertion of C8 and C9 to form a transmembrane pore (DiScipio1988The).

C7 also forms a complex with clusterin, an inhibitory complement regulator, in circulation. This C7-clusterin (C7-CLU) complex suggests a regulatory role for C7 beyond its participation in MAC assembly. The interaction with clusterin may help modulate complement activity by scavenging MAC complexes, thus preventing excessive complement activation (Massri2024Complement). The presence of C7 in this complex was confirmed through various biochemical techniques, including mass spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography, indicating that the interaction is specific and not due to polymorphisms in C7 (Massri2024Complement).
