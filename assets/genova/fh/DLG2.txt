# DLG2

## Overview
DLG2 is a gene that encodes the protein discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 2, also known as post synaptic density 93 (PSD-93). This protein is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, which plays a pivotal role in synaptic organization and signaling within the central nervous system. DLG2 is primarily expressed in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses, where it functions as a scaffold protein, facilitating the assembly of signaling complexes essential for synaptic plasticity and transmission. The protein is characterized by its modular structure, including PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase-like domains, which enable it to interact with a variety of synaptic proteins, such as neurotransmitter receptors and cytoskeletal elements. These interactions are crucial for maintaining synaptic integrity and are implicated in various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (Ali2018Identification; Sanders2022Transcriptional; Reggiani2017Novel).

## Structure
The DLG2 protein, also known as post synaptic density 93 (PSD-93), is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. It is characterized by a modular structure that includes several key domains: three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase (GK) like domain (Ali2018Identification; Reggiani2017Novel). The PDZ domains are involved in binding to specific C-terminal sequences of target proteins, such as inwardly rectifying K+ channels and the GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors (Ali2018Identification). The SH3 domain is a protein-protein interaction module, while the GK domain, although catalytically inactive, binds phosphorylated proteins (Ali2018Identification).

DLG2 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with variable N-terminal domains. These include palmitoylated isoforms (α1 and α2), an L27 domain-containing isoform (β), and others like γ, δ, and ε (Ali2018Identification). The L27 domain is crucial for forming complexes with proteins like LIN7A, affecting cell polarity and signaling (Keane2021The). Isoform variability is also achieved by alternative splicing of exons coding for the linker region between the SH3 and GK domains, which may facilitate binding to different interaction partners (Ali2018Identification).

## Function
The DLG2 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, primarily functioning as a postsynaptic scaffold protein in neurons. It plays a critical role in the organization and signaling of synapses by interacting with neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes to form signaling complexes in the postsynaptic density (Ali2018Identification). DLG2 is involved in the trafficking of NMDA and AMPA type glutamate receptors to the synapse, which is essential for excitatory synaptic transmission (Ali2018Identification).

DLG2 is expressed in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic excitatory brain synapses, where it binds to multiple proteins, including cytoskeleton proteins and signaling complexes, contributing to the development, plasticity, and stability of synapses (Reggiani2017Novel). It is also part of the Scrib signaling module, which regulates cell polarity, differentiation, and migration during development (Sanders2022Transcriptional).

In the striatum, DLG2 is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of synapses, particularly in spiny projection neurons, and is involved in the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission (Yoo2022A). Its deficiency can lead to reduced synaptic density and altered expression of synapse-related molecules, affecting cognitive and motor functions (Yoo2022A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DLG2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Genetic variations at the DLG2 locus have been linked to schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson's disease. These variations often result in a loss of function in one copy of the gene, contributing to cognitive impairments observed in these conditions (Griesius2022Reduced). 

Haploinsufficiency of DLG2 is associated with intellectual disability, autism, seizures, and psychiatric disorders. Specific deletions in the gene have been documented in patients presenting with developmental delays, learning disabilities, and dysmorphic features (Hollenbeck2017Clinical). In schizophrenia, de novo copy number variants (CNVs) affecting DLG2 have been identified, suggesting a pathogenic role in the disorder (Kirov2011De).

In animal models, DLG2 deficiency leads to behaviors associated with ASD, such as reduced sociability and increased repetitive behaviors, due to synaptic dysfunction in the dorsal striatum (Yoo2020A). These findings underscore the gene's role in synaptic plasticity and its potential impact on neurodevelopmental disorders (Yoo2020A).

## Interactions
DLG2, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions critical for synaptic organization and signaling. It interacts with DSCAM, a protein that regulates dendrite arborization and spine formation, and this interaction is validated using proximity ligation assays (PLA) (Viard2022Chr21; Viard2019Chr21). DLG2 also interacts with other members of the DLG family, including DLG1, DLG3, and DLG4, forming complexes that are localized to dendritic spines (Viard2022Chr21).

DLG2 is part of a synaptic complex that includes proteins such as DYRK1A, DLGAP1, and SHANK3, which are associated with a high risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Viard2022Chr21). It interacts with GRIN2A and GRIN2B, subunits of the NMDA receptor, which are crucial for synaptic transmission and plasticity (Viard2022Chr21; Viard2019Chr21). In neuroblastoma, DLG2 isoform 7 interacts with the LIN7 protein family, particularly LIN7A, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis (Keane2021The).

DLG2's interactions are significant in the context of intellectual disability, autism, and late-onset Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its role in cognitive functions and synaptic plasticity (Viard2022Chr21; Viard2019Chr21).
