# RTKN2

## Overview
RTKN2 (rhotekin 2) is a gene that encodes the rhotekin 2 protein, which is a key component of the Rho GTPase signaling pathway. This pathway is integral to the regulation of cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The rhotekin 2 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining cell shape and motility, which are essential for normal cellular function and development (LIAO2016Silencing). RTKN2 is notably expressed in CD4+ T cells, where it plays a role in activating the NF-κB pathway, a critical signaling cascade for immune response regulation (Myouzen2012Functional). The gene's involvement in these pathways suggests its importance in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular integrity. Additionally, RTKN2 has been implicated in various cancers and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (WEI2016Knockdown; Hu2022Rhotekin).

## Function
RTKN2 (rhotekin 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the Rho GTPase signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The RTKN2 protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to maintaining cell shape and motility, essential for normal cellular function and development (LIAO2016Silencing).

In healthy human cells, RTKN2 is highly expressed in CD4+ T cells and is involved in the activation of the NF-κB pathway, a critical signaling pathway for immune response regulation (Myouzen2012Functional). This pathway is significant for modulating immune responses and inflammation, which are vital for maintaining homeostasis and responding to external stimuli (Myouzen2012Functional). RTKN2 acts as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) with cis-regulatory effects, influencing gene expression levels and potentially enhancing NF-κB activity in a dose-dependent manner (Myouzen2012Functional).

While the specific function of RTKN2 in healthy cells is not fully elucidated, its involvement in these pathways suggests a role in modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular integrity through its interactions with Rho GTPases and the NF-κB pathway (Myouzen2012Functional).

## Clinical Significance
RTKN2 (rhotekin 2) is implicated in several diseases due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RTKN2 is overexpressed in 83% of cases, promoting cell proliferation and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis, suggesting its role as an oncogene and a potential therapeutic target (WEI2016Knockdown). In bladder cancer, RTKN2 is similarly upregulated, and its silencing results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its function as a tumor promoter (LIAO2016Silencing).

RTKN2 is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where it is identified as a susceptibility gene. Variants in RTKN2 are linked to increased RA risk, potentially through the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is crucial for RA pathogenesis (Myouzen2012Functional). In gastric cancer, RTKN2 enhances radioresistance and promotes cancer progression via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Zhao2022RTKN2). Additionally, RTKN2 is involved in endometrial carcinoma, where its overexpression promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis (Hu2022Rhotekin). These findings highlight RTKN2's significant role in various cancers and autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
RTKN2 (rhotekin 2) is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing various cellular processes. It is known to interact with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a crucial pathway for cell proliferation and survival in cancer. RTKN2 modulates this pathway by affecting the expression of key components such as β-catenin, C-Myc, and Cyclin D1. Knockdown of RTKN2 leads to decreased expression of these proteins, indicating its role in promoting their activity (Zhang2023RTKN2; Zhao2022RTKN2).

RTKN2 is also a target of microRNAs, which regulate its expression. For instance, miR-181 directly targets RTKN2, leading to its downregulation and subsequent suppression of the NF-kB signaling pathway in ovarian cancer cells. This interaction results in decreased cell growth and invasiveness, highlighting RTKN2's role as an oncogene in this context (Lin2018MicroRNA181). Similarly, miR-187-3p targets RTKN2 in hepatocellular carcinoma, affecting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and influencing cancer progression (Huang2020CircRNA).

RTKN2's involvement in these pathways and interactions with microRNAs underscores its significance in cancer biology, making it a potential therapeutic target.
