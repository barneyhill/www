# PELI1

## Overview
PELI1, or pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in various cellular processes, including immune signaling, DNA damage response, and inflammation. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, such as the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and a RING-like domain, which are essential for its function in ubiquitination. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, PELI1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, by facilitating the ubiquitination of key signaling molecules. This activity is crucial for modulating immune responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis. PELI1's involvement in DNA repair processes further underscores its importance in genomic stability. Clinically, PELI1 is implicated in various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, making it a significant focus of research for potential therapeutic interventions (Yan2023Biology; Ha2019Pellino1; Humphries2015Molecular).

## Structure
PELI1, or pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is characterized by several structural domains that contribute to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The protein contains a core forkhead-associated (FHA) domain in its N-terminal region, which is crucial for substrate recognition. This domain is a phosphothreonine-binding module that interacts with phosphorylated target proteins, such as IRAK1, and is characterized by a unique 'wing' or appendage formed by two inserted fragments tightly bound to the FHA domain (Yan2023Biology; Humphries2015Molecular).

The C-terminal region of PELI1 features a RING-like domain, which is essential for its E3 ligase activity. This domain contains conserved cysteine and histidine residues that coordinate zinc atoms, facilitating the ubiquitination process through K11, K48, and K63 linkages (Yan2023Biology; Humphries2015Molecular). 

PELI1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation at specific serine and threonine residues, which are critical for its activation. Key phosphorylation sites include Ser-76, Ser-78, Thr-80, Ser-82, Thr-86, Thr-288, and Ser-293 (Smith2009Identification; Humphries2015Molecular). These modifications enhance PELI1's interaction with E2-conjugating enzymes and its overall E3 ligase activity (Smith2009Identification).

## Function
PELI1, or pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in immune signaling and DNA damage response. In immune cells, PELI1 is involved in the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, which are crucial for inflammatory responses. It facilitates the ubiquitination of RIP1, a key step in the activation of NF-κB, particularly in the TLR3 and TLR4 signaling pathways (Moynagh2014The; Humphries2015Molecular). PELI1 also regulates the degradation of c-Rel in T cells, preventing excessive NF-κB activation (Yan2023Biology).

In the context of DNA damage, PELI1 is recruited to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and is activated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation. It mediates the ubiquitination of NBS1, facilitating the formation of the MRN complex, which is essential for ATM activation and homologous recombination repair (Ha2019Pellino1). This function is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutations that could lead to cancer (Ha2019Pellino1).

PELI1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing processes such as inflammation, apoptosis, and DNA repair, thereby playing a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and immune function (Yan2023Biology).

## Clinical Significance
The PELI1 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in regulating inflammation and immune responses. In cancer, PELI1 is associated with tumor progression and therapy resistance. It promotes metastasis and chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer by stabilizing SNAIL/SLUG and interacting with EGFR, contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Yan2023Biology). In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high PELI1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and bone marrow involvement, facilitating BCL6 ubiquitination and activation of B-cell signaling pathways (Yan2023Biology; Choe2016PELI1).

PELI1 also plays a role in autoimmune diseases. It negatively regulates noncanonical NF-κB signaling, which is crucial in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PELI1 deficiency leads to increased autoantibody production and exacerbates lupus-like symptoms in mice, suggesting its protective role against lupus-like autoimmunity (Liu2018Peli1).

In cardiovascular diseases, PELI1 is pathogenic in infarction by promoting inflammation and apoptosis, and its silencing can improve cardiac function (Yan2023Biology). Additionally, PELI1 is involved in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, where it contributes to pathogenesis by impairing microglial phagocytosis (Yan2023Biology). These findings highlight PELI1 as a potential therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
PELI1, also known as Pellino1, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that participates in various protein interactions, playing a crucial role in signaling pathways related to inflammation, immune responses, and cancer. PELI1 interacts with nibrin (NBS1), facilitating its ubiquitination and the assembly of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, which is essential for ATM activation and DNA repair processes (Yan2023Biology). It also binds to phosphorylated P53, promoting the ubiquitination and nuclear export of MDMX, thereby activating P53 for DNA damage repair (Yan2023Biology).

In the context of breast cancer, PELI1 interacts with EGFR, stabilizing it through K63-linked polyubiquitination, which enhances EGFR activation and promotes cancer cell aggressiveness (Qi2023PELI1). PELI1 also interacts with IRAK1 and IRAK4, forming complexes crucial for signal transduction in pathways like IL-1R and TLRs, which are essential for the activation of downstream signaling molecules such as NF-kB and MAPK (Yan2023Biology).

PELI1 is involved in the ubiquitination of RIPK1, promoting the formation of the necrosome and the execution of necroptosis by facilitating the binding of activated RIPK1 with RIPK3 (Wang2017PELI1). It also interacts with HSP90, affecting microvascular injury through ER stress by modulating IRE1α activation (Zhao2019Peli1).
