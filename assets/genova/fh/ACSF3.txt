# ACSF3

## Overview
ACSF3 is a gene that encodes the mitochondrial enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3, which is categorized as a malonyl-CoA synthetase. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis by catalyzing the conversion of malonate to malonyl-CoA, a key intermediate in the synthesis of fatty acids within the mitochondria (Witkowski2011Mammalian). The protein is highly specific for malonate and methylmalonate and is exclusively localized in the mitochondria, where it is essential for generating octanoyl precursors necessary for lipoylation, a critical post-translational modification of mitochondrial proteins (Witkowski2011Mammalian). Beyond its role in fatty acid synthesis, ACSF3 is involved in detoxifying malonate, thereby preventing the disruption of mitochondrial respiration (Bowman2019Role). Mutations in the ACSF3 gene are linked to Combined Malonic and Methylmalonic Aciduria (CMAMMA), a metabolic disorder with variable clinical presentations (Levtova2018Combined).

## Function
The ACSF3 gene encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that functions as a malonyl-CoA synthetase, playing a crucial role in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of malonate to malonyl-CoA, which serves as a chain extender unit in the synthesis of fatty acids within the mitochondria, a process distinct from the cytosolic fatty acid synthesis pathway (Witkowski2011Mammalian). ACSF3 is highly specific for malonate and methylmalonate and is localized exclusively in the mitochondria, where it is essential for generating octanoyl precursors necessary for the formation of lipoyl moieties, crucial for the post-translational modification of several mitochondrial proteins (Witkowski2011Mammalian).

In addition to its role in fatty acid synthesis, ACSF3 is involved in detoxifying malonate, a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. By converting malonate to malonyl-CoA, ACSF3 helps prevent the disruption of normal mitochondrial respiration and maintains cellular metabolism (Bowman2019Role). The enzyme's activity is consistent with physiological concentrations of malonate, indicating its functional relevance in normal cellular metabolism (Witkowski2011Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ACSF3 gene are associated with Combined Malonic and Methylmalonic Aciduria (CMAMMA), a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of malonic acid (MA) and methylmalonic acid (MMA) in the body. This condition is generally considered benign, with most patients being asymptomatic or experiencing mild symptoms such as developmental delays, neurological issues, and metabolic crises (Levtova2019Combined; Levtova2018Combined). The clinical presentation of CMAMMA is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms, and is distinct from classical methylmalonic acidemia (Wang2021Combined).

The ACSF3 gene encodes a mitochondrial acyl-CoA synthetase necessary for the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, which is crucial for mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and protein lipoylation. Mutations in ACSF3 can lead to the accumulation of upstream metabolites like MA and MMA, which have been associated with neurotoxicity and mitochondrial toxicity in vitro (Levtova2018Combined). Despite the benign nature of CMAMMA, the potential for undiagnosed subclinical complications and the possibility of clinical manifestations later in life exist (Levtova2018Combined). The most common mutations identified in CMAMMA patients are c.1075G > A (p.E359K) and c.1672C > T (p.R558W) (Levtova2018Combined).

## Interactions
ACSF3 interacts with several proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism. It has been shown to physically interact with SIRT3, a mitochondrial deacetylase, in the context of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). SIRT3 regulates the acetylation of ACSF3, affecting its stability and activity. Specifically, SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of ACSF3 at lysine residue K565 is crucial for its degradation, indicating a negative regulatory role of SIRT3 on ACSF3 expression (Sun2020Sirtuin).

ACSF3 is also involved in mitochondrial protein malonylation, a process essential for cellular metabolism. It is required for the incorporation of malonate into mitochondrial proteins, suggesting its role in forming multiprotein complexes within the mitochondria (Bowman2017The). Although specific direct interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, ACSF3's function in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis implies interactions with components of this pathway, such as ACC1, which provides malonyl-CoA for mitochondrial biogenesis (Monteuuis2017A).

The protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it interacts functionally with molecules like ATP, Mg2+, and CoA during its enzymatic activity (Witkowski2011Mammalian).
