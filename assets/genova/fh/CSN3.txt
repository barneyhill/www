# CSN3

## Overview
The CSN3 gene encodes the protein casein kappa, which is a crucial component of the COP9 signalosome complex, a multi-protein complex involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and signal transduction. Casein kappa functions as a regulatory subunit within this complex, influencing the stability and activity of other proteins through interactions with the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the cullin-RING ligase family of ubiquitin E3 complexes (Zarich2019The). The gene's expression and function are significant in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and embryonic development, where it plays a role in cell proliferation and survival (Otaegui2007Increased; Yan2003COP9). Understanding the mechanisms by which CSN3 and casein kappa operate provides insights into their potential roles in disease and development.

## Clinical Significance
The CSN3 gene, also known as casein kappa, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression levels. In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), increased expression of CSN3 has been observed in patients during relapses, suggesting a potential role in the disease's progression or resolution. This elevated expression is not due to DNA polymorphisms but rather regulatory changes, indicating a dynamic response to disease activity (Otaegui2007Increased). The study suggests that CSN3 may have a protective role during the resolution of MS relapses, although its exact function in autoimmunity remains to be fully elucidated (Otaegui2007Increased).

In the realm of developmental biology, the CSN3 gene is essential for early embryonic development. Disruption of the Csn3 gene in mice leads to embryonic lethality, highlighting its critical role in maintaining cell proliferation and the integrity of the COP9 signalosome complex (Yan2003COP9). This disruption results in developmental arrest and increased cell death, underscoring the gene's importance in embryogenesis (Yan2003COP9). While CSN3's role in human diseases is not fully understood, its involvement in these processes suggests potential implications for developmental disorders.

## Interactions
CSN3, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex, interacts specifically with the histone-like domain (HD) of the human Sos1 (hSos1) protein. This interaction was identified using a yeast two-hybrid system and confirmed through in vitro pull-down assays and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The interaction between CSN3 and the HD region of Sos1 is significant for the stability and homeostasis of Sos1, as it regulates Sos1's degradation and intracellular levels (Zarich2019The).

CSN3 is also involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where it regulates the cullin-RING ligase family of ubiquitin E3 complexes. The CSN3-associated protein kinase D (PKD) can phosphorylate Sos1, affecting its stability. Knockdown of PKD or CSN3 increases Sos1 degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway, suggesting that the CSN/PKD complex plays a role in stabilizing Sos1 proteins (Zarich2019The).

In addition, CSN3 interacts with the NDP region of hSos1, as demonstrated by in vitro binding experiments and in vivo assays in HeLa cells. This interaction is influenced by cellular conditions such as serum stimulation (Zarich2019The).
