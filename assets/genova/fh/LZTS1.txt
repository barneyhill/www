# LZTS1

## Overview
LZTS1, or leucine zipper tumor suppressor 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. The LZTS1 protein is characterized by its leucine-zipper motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and is a member of the 'Fezzin' family, which includes LZTS2 and LZTS3. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability by regulating the activity of Cdk1, a key kinase in mitosis, and is involved in neuronal development by influencing microtubule dynamics and cytoskeletal organization (Vecchione2007Fez1Lzts1; Kawaue2019Lzts1). The gene is frequently downregulated or mutated in various cancers, such as lung, breast, and bladder cancers, underscoring its significance as a tumor suppressor (Nonaka2005Reduced; Chen2008Downregulation; Vecchione2002FEZ1LZTS1).

## Structure
The LZTS1 protein, encoded by the LZTS1 gene, is composed of 596 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 67 kDa. It features two leucine-zipper motifs, which are structural motifs involved in protein-protein interactions (Vecchione2007Fez1Lzts1). These motifs are part of the protein's secondary structure, contributing to its ability to form homo or heterooligomers with other proteins in the LZTS family, such as LZTS2 and LZTS3 (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization).

The protein also contains multiple potential phosphorylation sites for kinases like PKA, CDC2, and PKC, indicating that post-translational modifications play a role in its function (Vecchione2007Fez1Lzts1). LZTS1 is a member of the 'Fezzin' family and possesses a characteristic Fez1 domain, a coiled-coil region with an internal leucine zipper motif, and a PDZ domain at its C-terminus (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization).

LZTS1 has several splice variant isoforms, which can influence its functional interactions and roles in cellular processes (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). Despite its structural similarities to transcription factors, LZTS1 lacks the DNA recognition sub-domain typically found upstream of a leucine-zipper motif (Vecchione2007Fez1Lzts1).

## Function
The LZTS1 gene, also known as FEZ1, plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. It is involved in maintaining proper Cdk1 activity, which is essential for the correct timing of mitosis exit and chromosome segregation. LZTS1 interacts with Cdk1 and Cdc25C, stabilizing their interaction and ensuring high Cdk1 activity during the M phase. This interaction prevents premature Cyclin B1 degradation and misaligned chromosomes, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Vecchione2007Fez1Lzts1a).

In the absence of LZTS1, there is an impaired interaction between Cdk1 and Cdc25C, leading to increased phosphorylation of Cdk1 and decreased levels of Cdc25C. This results in faster mitotic progression, improper chromosome segregation, and increased susceptibility to aneuploidy, a condition often associated with cancer (Vecchione2007Fez1Lzts1a).

LZTS1 is also involved in neuronal development, where it regulates neuronal delamination and the generation of outer radial glial-like cells during cerebral development. It is associated with microtubule components, influencing microtubule assembly and cytoskeletal dynamics (Kawaue2019Lzts1).

## Clinical Significance
The LZTS1 gene, also known as FEZ1, is frequently downregulated or mutated in various human cancers, contributing to tumorigenesis. In lung cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), a significant reduction or absence of LZTS1 expression is observed, with 26% of primary lung cancer specimens showing no protein expression and 42% showing a strong reduction. This loss of expression is associated with higher tumor grading and reduced mortality in patients with strong LZTS1 expression, suggesting its role as a prognostic indicator (Nonaka2005Reduced).

In breast cancer, LZTS1 downregulation is linked to lymph node metastasis. Studies show that 50% of breast cancer tissues exhibit reduced LZTS1 mRNA levels, and 72% show reduced protein expression. This downregulation is often due to promoter methylation, which correlates with cancer progression and metastasis (Chen2008Downregulation). Similarly, in breast invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC), 62% of tissues show loss or downregulation of LZTS1, which is significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (Wang2015Loss).

LZTS1 is also implicated in bladder cancer, where its expression is frequently lost or reduced. Restoration of LZTS1 expression in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) cells inhibits cell growth and tumorigenicity, highlighting its tumor suppressor role (Vecchione2002FEZ1LZTS1).

## Interactions
LZTS1 (leucine zipper tumor suppressor 1) is known to participate in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression. LZTS1 interacts with Cdk1, a key mitotic kinase, and this interaction is essential for maintaining proper Cdk1 activity during the M phase of the cell cycle. The absence of LZTS1 impairs the interaction between Cdk1 and Cdc25C, a phosphatase that activates Cdk1, leading to decreased Cdk1 activity and improper mitotic progression (Vecchione2007Fez1Lzts1a).

LZTS1 also interacts with microtubules, as it binds to the N-terminal region of EF1γ, a protein associated with microtubule components. This interaction suggests a role for LZTS1 in microtubule dynamics, which is important for mitosis regulation (Ishii2001FEZ1LZTS1). Additionally, LZTS1 is involved in neuronal development, where it interacts with proteins at apical junctions, such as ZO1, indicating its role in neuronal delamination and migration (Kawaue2019Lzts1).

LZTS1 is also part of the 'Fezzin' family of proteins, which includes LZTS2 and LZTS3, and can form homo or heterooligomers. These interactions are significant for its function in both cancer suppression and neuronal development (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization).
