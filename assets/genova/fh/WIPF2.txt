# WIPF2

## Overview
WIPF2, or WAS/WASL interacting protein family member 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The protein, also referred to as WIPF2, is a cytoplasmic component that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, including cell movement, shape, and signaling. It is particularly significant in immune cell functions, such as lymphocyte proliferation, motility, and synapse formation, by promoting actin polymerization through interactions with proteins like WASP and N-WASP and the ARP2/3 complex (Culibrk2019Phagocytosis; Pankewycz2012Inhibiting). WIPF2 is also involved in pathogen internalization and has been implicated in the phagocytosis of Aspergillus fumigatus by epithelial cells (Culibrk2019Phagocytosis). Its interactions and regulatory roles in actin dynamics make it a protein of interest in the study of immune responses and cellular development.

## Function
WIPF2 (WAS/WASL interacting protein family member 2) is a crucial component in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, which is essential for various cellular processes such as movement, shape, and signaling. It interacts with proteins like WASP and N-WASP, promoting actin polymerization through the ARP2/3 complex, which is vital for lymphocyte functions including proliferation, motility, synapse formation, cellular polarity, and cytotoxicity (Pankewycz2012Inhibiting). WIPF2 is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences processes like endocytosis and cell migration, impacting immune responses and development (Culibrk2019Phagocytosis).

In T cells, WIPF2 is involved in signaling events that lead to changes in mRNA expression and protein content during activation. Its downregulation upon T-cell activation suggests a regulatory role in immune responses, potentially through mechanisms like growth factor receptor internalization and membrane ruffling (Pankewycz2012Inhibiting). The presence of miRNA binding sites within the WIPF2 mRNA 3' UTR indicates that miRNAs may modulate its expression, affecting immune function (Pankewycz2012Inhibiting).

WIPF2 also plays a role in the internalization of pathogens by epithelial cells, as seen in its involvement in the phagocytosis of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia by human bronchial epithelial cells, where it acts as an upstream regulator of the Arp2/3 complex (Culibrk2019Phagocytosis).

## Clinical Significance
WIPF2 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular processes. In cervical cancer, somatic mutations in WIPF2 have been associated with responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). These mutations may correlate with chemotherapy sensitivity or resistance, suggesting that WIPF2 could influence treatment outcomes (Tian2021A). In breast cancer, WIPF2 has been identified as a regulator of vimentin expression, which is crucial for epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to cancer metastasis. High expression of WIPF2 is associated with better relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients, indicating its potential prognostic value (Lehtinen2012Highthroughput).

In the context of atherosclerosis, WIPF2 expression is upregulated by PCSK9 inhibitors, which are used to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques. This suggests a role for WIPF2 in plaque stability and cardiovascular health (Zhao2024PCSK9i). Although WIPF2 is mentioned in the context of endocytosis pathways in Fabry disease, specific clinical implications of WIPF2 mutations in this condition are not detailed (Jehn2021αGalactosidase). Overall, alterations in WIPF2 expression or mutations can impact cancer progression and cardiovascular disease, highlighting its clinical significance.

## Interactions
WIPF2 interacts with several proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton dynamics, notably N-WASP, a key player in actin polymerization. WIPF2 is crucial for the recruitment and activation of N-WASP at the bacterial pole, which is necessary for actin tail formation and motility in Shigella flexneri infections (Michard2019WIPF2). The interaction between WIPF2 and N-WASP is essential for the initiation and elongation of actin tails, as WIPF2 promotes N-WASP activation (Michard2019WIPF2). The WH1 domain of N-WASP, which binds WIPF2, is critical for the efficient formation of ARP2/3-dependent actin networks (Michard2019WIPF2).

WIPF2 also plays a role in the phagocytosis of Aspergillus fumigatus by human bronchial epithelial cells, where it mediates actin polymerization through the Arp2/3 complex. This interaction is crucial for the internalization of conidia, as WIPF2 localizes transiently to the site of A. fumigatus adhesion (Culibrk2019Phagocytosis). Additionally, WIPF2 is involved in T-cell receptor signaling and actin reorganization, interacting with WASP and N-WASP to promote the stability of the WASP complex, which is essential for various lymphocyte responses (Pankewycz2012Inhibiting).
