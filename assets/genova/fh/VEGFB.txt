# VEGFB

## Overview
Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the vascular endothelial growth factor family, which is primarily involved in cellular survival mechanisms rather than angiogenesis. The protein, also known as VEGF-B, is categorized as a growth factor and plays a significant role in inhibiting apoptosis, particularly in neuronal and cardiovascular tissues. VEGFB produces two isoforms, VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186, through alternative splicing, each with distinct structural and functional properties. These isoforms interact with receptors such as VEGFR-1 and neuropilin-1 to mediate their biological effects, including promoting cell survival and regulating metabolic processes. VEGFB's involvement in oxidative stress response and mitochondrial gene regulation further underscores its importance in maintaining cellular health, making it a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular conditions (Li2008VEGFB; Bry2014Vascular; Eriksson1999Structure).

## Structure
The VEGFB gene encodes a protein that is part of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, which plays a crucial role in endothelial cell physiology. The gene is composed of seven exons and spans approximately 4 kb of DNA. VEGFB produces two isoforms, VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186, through alternative splicing of mRNA. These isoforms share an identical N-terminal domain encoded by exons 1-5 but differ in their C-terminal domains due to differential use of the remaining exons (Eriksson1999Structure).

VEGF-B167 has a basic and hydrophilic C-terminal domain, which remains cell-associated unless treated with heparin or high salt concentrations. In contrast, VEGF-B186 has a hydrophobic C-terminal domain and is not cell-associated upon secretion. VEGF-B186 is also O-glycosylated, unlike VEGF-B167 (Eriksson1999Structure). Both isoforms form disulfide-linked homodimers, with VEGF-B167 having a molecular mass of 21 kDa and VEGF-B186 having a mass of 32 kDa when secreted (Eriksson1999Structure).

The protein contains conserved cysteine residues involved in dimer formation, which is a characteristic feature of the PDGF/VEGF family (Olofsson1998Vascular). These structural features are crucial for the protein's function and interaction with receptors.

## Function
VEGFB (vascular endothelial growth factor B) is a member of the VEGF family, primarily known for its role in inhibiting apoptosis rather than promoting angiogenesis, which is common among other VEGF family members. In healthy human cells, VEGFB functions by suppressing the expression of BH3-only proteins and other apoptotic genes through its interaction with the VEGFR-1 receptor, thereby promoting cell survival (Li2008VEGFB). This anti-apoptotic effect is particularly significant in neuronal cells, where VEGFB can protect against apoptosis without inducing angiogenesis, making it a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases (Li2008VEGFB).

VEGFB is also involved in metabolic processes, particularly in tissues with high energy demands such as the heart and skeletal muscle. It is linked to mitochondrial gene regulation and is upregulated by the transcription factor PGC-1α, which is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism (Bry2014Vascular). Additionally, VEGFB has been identified as a potent antioxidant, upregulating key antioxidant genes like glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxiredoxins, which help protect cells from oxidative stress (Chen2019Novel; Arjunan2018VEGFB). This antioxidative function is crucial for maintaining cellular health, particularly in the retina, where VEGFB helps prevent degeneration (Arjunan2018VEGFB).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in VEGFB expression have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In cancer, VEGFB is associated with metastasis through a VEGF-A-independent mechanism. High VEGFB expression correlates with increased metastasis and poorer survival rates in cancer patients, such as those with lung squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. VEGFB promotes metastasis by increasing vascular leakiness and reducing perivascular cell coverage, facilitating tumor cell intravasation and dissemination (Yang2015VEGFB). 

In neurodegenerative diseases, VEGFB plays a protective role against apoptosis. It inhibits the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, offering potential therapeutic benefits in conditions like stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). VEGFB treatment has been shown to protect neurons from degeneration and reduce brain damage in ischemic conditions, highlighting its potential in neuroprotection without inducing angiogenesis (Li2008VEGFB; Chen2019Novel).

VEGFB also impacts cardiovascular health by maintaining blood vessel integrity. While not essential for blood vessel growth, it is crucial for their survival under stress, preventing regression and degeneration in pathological conditions (Zhang2009VEGFB). These roles underscore the importance of VEGFB in various diseases, making it a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
VEGFB interacts primarily with the VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), a member of the Class III receptor tyrosine kinases. This interaction is crucial for mediating VEGFB's biological effects, including its role in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell survival. VEGFB binds to VEGFR-1 using two symmetrical binding sites at the ends of its homodimer structure, involving specific amino acid residues such as Asp63, Glu64, and Glu67, which contribute to receptor affinity (Iyer2006Crystal; Olofsson1998Vascular). The binding of VEGFB to VEGFR-1 activates downstream signaling pathways, such as ERK1/2 and Akt, which are involved in antiapoptotic processes (Li2008VEGFB).

VEGFB also interacts with neuropilin-1 (NP-1), which, along with VEGFR-1, is critical for its effects on vascular survival. Blocking these interactions with neutralizing antibodies reduces the expression of prosurvival genes and diminishes VEGFB's protective effects on retinal vasculature (Zhang2009VEGFB). Despite its involvement in angiogenesis, VEGFB does not promote undesired angiogenesis in the eye, as it does not affect normal blood vessel density or pathological angiogenesis in the retina (Li2008VEGFB). These interactions highlight VEGFB's role in cellular survival mechanisms without inducing angiogenesis at effective doses.
