# EPPK1

## Overview
EPPK1 is a gene that encodes the protein epiplakin 1, a member of the plakin family of cytoskeletal linker proteins. Epiplakin 1 is characterized by its unique structure, which consists solely of plakin repeat domains (PRDs) and lacks the actin- and microtubule-binding domains typical of other plakins (Ratajczyk2022A; Fuchs2022Comparative). This protein is primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cell structure and integrity by interacting with keratin intermediate filaments in a calcium-dependent manner (Ratajczyk2022A). EPPK1 is involved in cellular stress responses and has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it influences processes such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression (Yang2023Androgen; Arimura2024Elucidating). The gene exhibits a high degree of polymorphism, with variations in the number of PRDs, which may contribute to its diverse functional roles (Ratajczyk2022A).

## Structure
Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1) is a unique member of the plakin family, characterized by its structure composed solely of plakin repeat domains (PRDs) (Ratajczyk2022A; Fuchs2022Comparative). Unlike other plakins, EPPK1 lacks actin- and microtubule-binding domains and the plakin domain, which are common in this protein family (Ratajczyk2022A). The human EPPK1 gene exhibits a high degree of polymorphism, with variants containing between 9 to 17 PRDs, resulting from variable copy numbers of nearly identical PRDs at the C-terminus (Ratajczyk2022A).

The PRDs in EPPK1 are involved in binding to intermediate filaments, such as keratins, and are evolutionarily conserved across species (Fuchs2022Comparative). These domains are crucial for the protein's role in maintaining the structural integrity of epithelial cells, particularly under stress conditions where EPPK1 is recruited to keratin filaments (Ratajczyk2022A). The protein's interaction with keratin filaments is calcium-dependent, with EPPK1 translocating to these filaments upon elevated intracellular calcium levels (Ratajczyk2022A).

EPPK1 does not undergo alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms, as its entire coding sequence is contained within a single exon (Fuchs2022Comparative). This structural simplicity contrasts with the complex functional roles EPPK1 plays in cellular dynamics and stress response.

## Function
Epiplakin 1 (EPPK1) is a cytoskeletal linker protein primarily expressed in epithelial tissues, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cell structure and integrity. In healthy human cells, EPPK1 is involved in the dynamics of keratin intermediate filaments, which are essential for the structural stability of epithelial cells. Under normal conditions, EPPK1 is diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and does not associate with keratin filaments. However, in response to elevated intracellular calcium levels, such as during cellular stress, EPPK1 rapidly translocates to keratin filaments, suggesting a role in stabilizing the keratin network and reducing keratin dynamics (Ratajczyk2022A).

EPPK1's association with keratin filaments is calcium-dependent, as demonstrated by its translocation upon calcium elevation and inhibition by calcium chelators (Ratajczyk2022A). This dynamic interaction is thought to contribute to the structural integrity and function of keratin networks, potentially affecting cellular resilience against mechanical stress (Ratajczyk2022A). Additionally, EPPK1 is implicated in maintaining epithelial cell polarity, with its expression positively correlated with epithelial polarity and negatively correlated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Geay2023Plakins).

## Clinical Significance
EPPK1 (epiplakin 1) has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process in cancer metastasis. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), EPPK1 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, particularly in early-stage cases. Knockout studies in LUAD cell lines have shown that loss of EPPK1 leads to a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), reduced cell proliferation, and invasion, suggesting its role in promoting cancer progression (Arimura2024Elucidating). 

In cervical cancer, EPPK1 expression is upregulated and correlates with increased cell proliferation through the p38 signaling pathway. This upregulation is mediated by KLF5, which binds to the EPPK1 promoter, enhancing its expression and contributing to tumor growth (Ma2021KLF5mediated). 

EPPK1 mutations have also been linked to poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where they are associated with shorter overall survival (Song2024Genomic). In bladder cancer, EPPK1 is activated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), promoting cell proliferation and invasion via the MAPK/JUP signaling pathway (Yang2023Androgen). These findings highlight EPPK1's potential as a therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
EPPK1 (epiplakin 1) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In bladder cancer (BLCA), EPPK1 interacts with the protein JUP, which is involved in cell adhesion. This interaction is crucial for promoting cell proliferation and invasion, as EPPK1 activation by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) enhances JUP expression through the p38 MAPK/c-JUN signaling pathway (Yang2023Androgen). The interaction between EPPK1 and JUP is significant for tumor progression and metastasis, suggesting that EPPK1 may regulate cell invasion through JUP (Yang2023Androgen).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), EPPK1 is associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process critical for cancer metastasis. Knockout studies in LUAD cell lines have shown that EPPK1 influences the expression of several genes, including E-cadherin, p53, Vimentin, and MYC, indicating its role in promoting EMT and cancer development (Arimura2024Elucidating).

EPPK1 also interacts with keratin filaments in a calcium-dependent manner. Under stress conditions, elevated intracellular calcium levels trigger EPPK1 to associate with keratin filaments, reducing keratin dynamics and stabilizing the keratin network (Ratajczyk2022A). This interaction is reversible and highlights EPPK1's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis during stress (Ratajczyk2022A).
