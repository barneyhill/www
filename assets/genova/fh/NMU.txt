# NMU

## Overview
Neuromedin U (NMU) is a gene that encodes the neuropeptide known as neuromedin U, which is a member of the neuropeptide family involved in a variety of physiological processes. The NMU gene is responsible for producing a peptide that acts primarily through two G-protein-coupled receptors, NMUR1 and NMUR2, to exert its biological effects. Neuromedin U is characterized by its highly conserved C-terminal region, which is crucial for its interaction with these receptors and subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways. This neuropeptide is implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction, energy homeostasis, and hematopoiesis, among other functions. Additionally, NMU has been associated with pathological conditions, including cancer and metabolic disorders, where it influences tumor progression and energy balance (Malendowicz2021Neuromedins; Brighton2004Neuromedin; Szekeres2000Neuromedin).

## Structure
Neuromedin U (NMU) is a peptide with a highly conserved structure across species, particularly at its C-terminal region, which is crucial for its biological activity. The primary structure of human NMU is an icosapentapeptide, meaning it consists of 25 amino acids, with a notable absence of internal di-basic cleavage sites (Brighton2004Neuromedin). The C-terminal pentapeptide sequence, Phe-Arg-Pro-Arg-Asn-NH2, is identical across species, highlighting its importance for NMU's function (Brighton2004Neuromedin). 

The secondary and tertiary structures of NMU are not explicitly detailed in the available context, but the peptide's ability to contract smooth muscle suggests a specific conformation that facilitates receptor binding and activation. The C-terminal region's amidation, particularly of the terminal asparagine, is essential for preventing ionization and enhancing receptor interaction, which is a critical post-translational modification for NMU's bioactivity (Brighton2004Neuromedin).

NMU does not have a quaternary structure as it functions as a single peptide chain. The peptide's structure-activity relationship studies indicate that modifications in the C-terminal region significantly reduce its function, underscoring the importance of its conserved sequence for biological activity (Brighton2004Neuromedin).

## Function
Neuromedin U (NMU) is a neuropeptide that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It acts as a potent agonist at the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM3, now known as NMUR1, and is involved in smooth muscle contraction and modulation of steroid secretion from the adrenal cortex (Szekeres2000Neuromedin). NMU is widely expressed in human tissues, with high levels in the intestine, pituitary, and several brain regions, supporting its characterization as a gut-brain peptide (Szekeres2000Neuromedin).

NMU is also implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis, particularly in food intake and body weight management. It interacts with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the hypothalamus, and its anorexigenic effects are primarily mediated through the NMUR2 receptor (Malendowicz2021Neuromedins). In the context of hematopoiesis, NMU functions as a cofactor during the early stages of erythropoiesis, enhancing the formation of erythroid progenitors such as BFU-E and CFU-E in the presence of erythropoietin (EPO) and stem cell factor (SCF) (Gambone2011The). NMU's expression in bone marrow suggests a potential role in hematopoietic function (Szekeres2000Neuromedin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the NMU gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In cancer, NMU is associated with increased malignancy and poor prognosis. It is overexpressed in several cancers, including breast, pancreatic, and endometrial cancers, where it promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to therapies. In breast cancer, high NMU expression is linked to resistance to HER-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as lapatinib and trastuzumab, and is considered an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes, particularly in HER2-positive and luminal A subtypes (Rani2014Neuromedin). In endometrial cancer, NMU signaling enhances cell motility and proliferation, contributing to tumor progression and poor survival rates (Lin2016NMU).

NMU also plays a role in metabolic disorders. It regulates feeding behavior and energy homeostasis, with NMU knockout mice exhibiting obesity and hyperphagia. Variants in the NMU gene have been linked to obesity and metabolic conditions in humans (Teranishi2021Neuromedin). In myeloid leukemias, NMU acts as an autocrine growth factor, promoting the proliferation of leukemia cells (Shetzline2004Neuromedin). These findings highlight NMU's potential as a therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
Neuromedin U (NMU) interacts with two primary G-protein-coupled receptors, NMUR1 and NMUR2, which are involved in various signaling pathways. NMU binding to these receptors leads to increased intracellular calcium levels through the activation of phospholipase C and the inhibition of cAMP accumulation. This interaction also activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, contributing to NMU's role in physiological functions such as feeding, energy balance, and smooth muscle contraction (Raddatz2000Identification; Martinez2015Neuromedin).

In cancer, NMU is known to promote cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis. It enhances tumor formation and metastasis, with its effects in non-small cell lung carcinoma being mediated by a novel heterodimer formed by GSHR1b and NTSR1, rather than NMUR1 or NMUR2 (Martinez2015Neuromedin). NMU also interacts with the metastasis suppressor RhoGDI2, promoting tumor formation and metastasis, and is involved in the c-Met pathway in pancreatic cancer (Martinez2015Neuromedin).

Additionally, NMU has been identified as the cognate ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor FM-3, inducing specific cellular responses such as intracellular calcium mobilization and arachidonic acid metabolite release (Fujii2000Identification).
