# RUFY2

## Overview
RUFY2 is a gene that encodes the protein RUN and FYVE domain containing 2, which is involved in intracellular trafficking and cellular signaling. This protein is characterized by the presence of an N-terminal RUN domain, two coiled-coil domains, and a C-terminal FYVE domain, which collectively facilitate its interactions with small GTPases and its role in autophagosome formation and membrane trafficking (Kitagishi2013RUFY; Char2020The). RUFY2 is predominantly expressed in the brain, lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, indicating its involvement in various physiological processes (Char2020The). The protein's expression is regulated by microRNA miR-155, linking it to immune regulation (Char2020The). Alterations in the RUFY2 gene have been associated with several cancers, suggesting its potential role in tumorigenesis and as a therapeutic target (Miao2020As; Zheng2020LncRNAs).

## Structure
RUFY2 is a protein characterized by the presence of an N-terminal RUN domain, two coiled-coil domains, and a C-terminal FYVE domain. The RUN domain is involved in interactions with small GTPases, such as Rab33A, and plays a role in autophagosome formation by associating with the Golgi complex (Kitagishi2013RUFY; Char2020The). The FYVE domain binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, suggesting a role in cytoplasmic membrane trafficking (Char2020The). The coiled-coil domains, particularly CC1, are implicated in Rab33 binding, contributing to the protein's function in intracellular trafficking (Fukuda2011Genomewide).

RUFY2 is predominantly located in the nucleus and is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (Char2020The). The protein is subject to regulation by microRNA miR-155, which affects its expression levels (Char2020The). Mutations in the rufy2 gene are frequently observed in cancer cells, often leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and reduced expression (Char2020The). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. Splice variant isoforms of RUFY2 may exist, potentially altering its structure and function.

## Function
RUFY2, also known as Leucine zipper FYVE-finger protein (LZ-FYVE), is involved in intracellular trafficking and cellular signaling. It contains two N-terminal leucine zipper domains and a C-terminal FYVE-finger domain, which suggest a role in membrane trafficking in differentiated cells. RUFY2 interacts with the Golgi complex-associated Rab33A, a small GTPase involved in autophagosome formation, indicating its role in autophagy through interactions with Rab33A and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) on omegasomes (KerenKaplan2022RUFY3; Char2020The).

The protein is primarily expressed in the brain, lung, liver, and gastrointestinal tract after development, suggesting its involvement in various physiological processes in these tissues (Char2020The). RUFY2 is also implicated in endosomal dynamics, promoting endosomal fusion and interacting with motor proteins like kinesin, which suggests a role in vesicular and organelle transport (Char2020The). The expression of RUFY2 is regulated by microRNA miR-155, which is involved in immune cell development and inflammatory responses, highlighting its potential role in immune regulation (Char2020The).

## Clinical Significance
RUFY2 has been implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and genetic rearrangements. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), RUFY2 is identified as a differentially expressed gene with lower expression levels compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor. Higher expression of RUFY2 is associated with better overall survival in GBM patients, indicating its beneficial role in this context (Zheng2020LncRNAs).

In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), RUFY2 is involved in novel gene rearrangements, specifically the RUFY2-RET fusion. This fusion, identified in PTC and previously in non-small cell lung cancer, involves the RET tyrosine kinase domain and a RUN domain from RUFY2. The RUFY2-RET fusion may lead to constitutive activation of RET, contributing to oncogenic signaling pathways (Staubitz2019Novel).

RUFY2 is also frequently mutated in colorectal cancer and is implicated in tumorigenesis in lung adenocarcinoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Miao2020As). These findings suggest that RUFY2 alterations can significantly impact cancer development and progression, warranting further investigation into its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
RUFY2, also known as Leucine zipper FYVE-finger protein (LZ-FYVE), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in intracellular trafficking and autophagy. It contains a RUN domain that specifically associates with the Golgi complex-associated Rab33A, a small GTPase involved in autophagy regulation. This interaction suggests that RUFY2 may contribute to autophagosome formation through its association with Rab33A and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) on omegasomes (Char2020The; KerenKaplan2021RUFY3).

RUFY2 also interacts with the Etk tyrosine kinase, which is involved in regulating various cellular processes, indicating a potential role in signaling pathways related to endosomal trafficking (Kitagishi2013RUFY). The protein's expression is modulated by microRNA miR-155, a key regulator of immune cell development and inflammatory responses, suggesting a link between RUFY2 and immune system functions (Char2020The).

Despite its homology to other RUFY family members, RUFY2 does not interact with ARL8, a small GTPase involved in lysosomal positioning, distinguishing its functional interactions from those of RUFY3 and RUFY4 (KerenKaplan2022RUFY3).
