# RBM48

## Overview
RBM48 is a gene that encodes the RNA binding motif protein 48, a nuclear protein involved in various RNA-related processes. The protein is characterized by a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which is essential for its role in RNA binding and regulation. As a member of the RNA-binding domain (RBD) superfamily, RBM48 is implicated in the regulation of RNA biogenesis, stability, function, transport, and cellular localization. It plays a significant role in splicing, particularly as a minor spliceosome factor involved in U12-type intron splicing, which is crucial for the maturation of certain mRNA precursors. The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as ARMC7, suggest its involvement in complex RNA processing activities. RBM48 is essential for cell proliferation, and its dysregulation has been associated with various diseases, including cancer, where it is often amplified (Hart2015Systematic; Franklin2019Androgenic).

## Structure
The RBM48 gene encodes a 413-amino acid protein known as RNA binding motif protein 48 (RBM48), which has a molecular weight of approximately 48 kDa. The protein contains a single RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain located at the amino terminus, specifically between residues 78 and 177. The RRM is a conserved domain typically consisting of 80-90 amino acids and is crucial for binding single-stranded RNA. This domain is part of the larger RNA-binding domain (RBD) superfamily, which includes numerous proteins involved in various aspects of RNA biology, such as biogenesis, stability, and transport (Franklin2019Androgenic).

RBM48 is suggested to play a role in the minor spliceosome, particularly in U12-type intron splicing, as mutations in the gene can lead to aberrant splicing of these introns. The protein may also have anti-apoptotic activity, as its knockout in certain cell lines results in signs of apoptosis (Franklin2019Androgenic). While specific details on the tertiary and quaternary structures of RBM48 are not provided, its interaction with other proteins, such as ARMC7, suggests it may be part of a protein complex involved in RNA-related functions (Hart2015Systematic).

## Function
RBM48 (RNA binding motif protein 48) is a nuclear protein involved in various RNA-related processes within human cells. It contains a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain, which is crucial for its role in RNA binding and regulation (Franklin2019Androgenic). RBM48 is implicated in the regulation of RNA biogenesis, stability, function, transport, and cellular localization. It plays a significant role in splicing, particularly as a minor spliceosome factor involved in U12-type intron splicing, a process essential for the maturation of certain mRNA precursors (Franklin2019Androgenic).

In human cell lines, RBM48 has been identified as an essential gene for cell proliferation. Its nuclear localization and interaction with other proteins, such as ARMC7, suggest that it may be part of a protein complex involved in RNA processing or splicing (Hart2015Systematic). The protein's essentiality is highlighted by its anti-proliferative effects when targeted by CRISPR-Cas9 technology, indicating its critical role in maintaining cellular functions (Hart2015Systematic).

RBM48's involvement in RNA processing and its essential nature in cell proliferation underscore its importance in cellular biology and its potential implications in disease contexts, such as cancer, where it is often amplified (Hart2015Systematic).

## Clinical Significance
RBM48 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its role in RNA processing and gene expression regulation. Alterations in RBM48 expression have been associated with cancer proliferation. Studies have shown that RBM48 is amplified in various cancer tissues and cell lines, suggesting a potential role in tumor cell proliferation. It interacts with ARMC7, forming a protein complex that may be essential for RNA metabolism and transcription, which is crucial for cancer cell growth (Hart2015Systematic; Hart2015High-Resolution).

In the context of renal ciliopathies, RBM48 has been identified as a novel candidate gene potentially associated with nephronophthisis-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC). Whole exome sequencing studies have highlighted RBM48 in consanguineous families with childhood-onset renal issues, although further functional evidence is needed to confirm its pathogenicity in these conditions (Braun2016Whole).

RBM48 expression is also influenced by androgens, which may play a role in the development of sexually dimorphic neural circuits in the brain. This androgenic regulation could impact neural development and function, although specific diseases directly linked to RBM48 expression changes in the brain have not been identified (Franklin2019Androgenic).

## Interactions
RBM48 is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, primarily within the nucleus. It has been identified as a U12 splicing factor, suggesting its involvement in RNA splicing processes. In particular, RBM48 interacts with ARMC7, another essential gene, forming a potential novel protein complex with an RNA-related role in tumor cells (Hart2015Systematic). This interaction indicates that RBM48 may play a part in cell proliferation and cancer development.

In the context of colorectal cancer, RBM48 is part of a regulatory network involving the exosomal lncRNA G016261 and miR-150-5p. This network suggests that RBM48 expression is modulated by these molecules, impacting cancer cell differentiation and proliferation (Zhao2022Identification).

RBM48 is also involved in the cellular stress response, where it is co-regulated by the YTHDC1 and SRSF9 pathways during stress recovery. This regulation involves the splicing of specific pre-mRNAs, including RBM48 intron 3, mediated by nuclear stress bodies (Gavrilova2023On). These interactions highlight RBM48's role in RNA processing and its potential impact on cellular functions under stress conditions.
