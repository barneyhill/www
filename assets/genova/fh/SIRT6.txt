# SIRT6

## Overview
SIRT6 is a gene that encodes the sirtuin 6 protein, a member of the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases. The sirtuin 6 protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability, regulating metabolism, and modulating inflammation. It is characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes a Rossmann fold domain and a zinc-binding domain, which are essential for its enzymatic functions as both a deacetylase and a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (Beauharnois2013Sirtuin; Liu2020Emerging). SIRT6 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, telomere maintenance, and chromatin regulation, and its activity is linked to aging and age-related diseases (Beauharnois2013Sirtuin; Liu2020Emerging). Alterations in SIRT6 expression or function are associated with several pathological conditions, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Li2022SIRT6).

## Structure
The SIRT6 protein is composed of 355 amino acids and is characterized by a unique molecular structure. It features a large Rossmann fold domain and a smaller zinc-binding domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and structural stability (Beauharnois2013Sirtuin; Liu2020Emerging). The Rossmann fold consists of six parallel β-sheets and several α-helices, forming the NAD+ binding site and a hydrophobic pocket for acyl chains of SIRT6 substrates (Fiorentino2021Emerging). Unlike other sirtuins, SIRT6 lacks a conserved cofactor binding loop for NAD+ binding, instead having a stable single helix that allows high-affinity NAD+ binding even without an acetylated substrate (Gertler2013SIRT6; Beauharnois2013Sirtuin).

The N-terminal extension (residues 1-42) is important for chromatin association and catalytic activity, while the C-terminal extension (residues 277-355) contains a nuclear localization signal (Khan2018A; Liu2020Emerging). SIRT6 functions as both a deacetylase and a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, with its deacetylase activity being highly substrate-specific (Beauharnois2013Sirtuin). The protein is involved in post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation, which regulate its activity and interactions (Beauharnois2013Sirtuin).

## Function
SIRT6 is a member of the sirtuin family of proteins, which are NAD+-dependent deacetylases involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, SIRT6 plays a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by participating in DNA repair mechanisms, including base excision repair and the repair of double-strand breaks through homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (Beauharnois2013Sirtuin; Liu2020Emerging). It deacetylates histones H3K9 and H3K56, which is essential for telomere maintenance and function, thereby preventing chromosomal fusions and genomic instability (Tennen2011SIRT6; Liu2020Emerging).

SIRT6 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it influences chromatin structure and gene expression. It regulates glucose metabolism by suppressing glycolytic genes and enhancing insulin sensitivity, which is vital for maintaining metabolic health (Beauharnois2013Sirtuin; Liu2020Emerging). SIRT6 also modulates inflammation by interacting with transcription factors such as NF-κB, thereby repressing inflammatory gene expression (Beauharnois2013Sirtuin).

The protein's activity is linked to aging processes, as it promotes resistance to DNA damage and oxidative stress, contributing to a normal replicative lifespan and preventing premature senescence (Beauharnois2013Sirtuin; Roichman2021Restoration).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the SIRT6 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions due to its role in genomic stability, metabolism, and inflammation. SIRT6 deficiency in mice leads to severe metabolic defects, including reduced serum IGF-1 levels and impaired glucose homeostasis, which are linked to aging-like degenerative pathologies and early death (Mostoslavsky2006Genomic). In humans, reduced SIRT6 expression is observed in failing hearts, and its deficiency is associated with myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure (Li2022SIRT6).

In cancer, SIRT6 exhibits both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive activities. Its expression levels and functional alterations can significantly impact cancer development and progression. For instance, SIRT6 overexpression supports tumor growth in prostate cancer, while its knockdown increases apoptosis (Li2022SIRT6). In colon cancer, SIRT6 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumorigenesis, although higher expression is linked to better prognosis (Li2022SIRT6).

SIRT6 is also implicated in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), where it regulates glucose metabolism, impacting glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity (Liu2020Emerging). In osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, reduced SIRT6 levels correlate with increased disease severity, while its overexpression can mitigate inflammation and disease progression (Li2022SIRT6).

## Interactions
SIRT6 is involved in numerous protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It forms a significant interaction with Ras-GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), which is dependent on SIRT6's enzymatic activity. This interaction is conserved across different cell types and is disrupted in catalytically deficient SIRT6 mutants (Miteva2014A). SIRT6 also interacts with YLPM1, a telomerase modulator, and this interaction is similarly dependent on its catalytic activity (Miteva2014A).

SIRT6 is known to interact with nucleosome core particles, forming a 2:1 enzyme:nucleosome complex through asymmetric binding. This interaction is facilitated by the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of SIRT6, which recognizes nucleosomal DNA, promoting high-affinity binding and efficient deacetylation of histones (Liu2020Multivalent).

SIRT6 also interacts with histone methyltransferases such as Suv39h1, playing a role in chromatin regulation. This interaction involves the C-terminal catalytic SET domain of Suv39h1 and is crucial for regulating the NF-κB pathway (SantosBarriopedro2018SIRT6dependent). Additionally, SIRT6 interacts with proteins involved in DNA repair, such as PARP1 and XRCC6, and is associated with chromatin assembly through interactions with histone proteins (Lee2014Comparative).
