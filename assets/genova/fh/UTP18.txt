# UTP18

## Overview
UTP18 is a gene that encodes the UTP18 small subunit processome component, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is a part of the small subunit processome, a nucleolar multi-protein complex essential for the maturation of pre-ribosomal RNA into the 18S ribosomal RNA, a critical component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. UTP18 is characterized by a WD40 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, and plays a significant role in both nucleolar and cytoplasmic functions, including the regulation of translation initiation under stress conditions (Yang2014A; Zhang2016Integrative). The protein's involvement in various cellular processes and its overexpression in several cancers underscore its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention (Yang2014A; Ashby2022Structural).

## Structure
UTP18 is a protein component of the small subunit processome, playing a crucial role in ribosome biogenesis. The protein features a WD40 domain, which is a common structural motif involved in protein-protein interactions. This domain adopts a seven-bladed β-propeller structure, with each propeller composed of four antiparallel β strands. The side surface at blade 6 is highly conserved and likely functions as a binding site for other molecules, while the top surface is positively charged and likely binds to RNA (Zhang2016Integrative).

The N-terminal region of UTP18 contains three segments that facilitate interactions with other proteins, including an Mtr4 arch interacting motif (AIM) (Barandun2017The). UTP18 interacts with several subunits of the UtpA and UtpB complexes, as well as the U3 snoRNP component Nop58, stabilizing a single-stranded region of the 5' ETS and interacting with Snu13 (Barandun2017The).

In the context of the UTPB complex, UTP18 primarily uses its M domain to associate with the tandem WD domain of Utp21, and it interacts with Utp6 and Utp21 (Zhang2016Integrative). The protein's structure is crucial for interlocking the two largest subcomplexes of the SSU processome (Barandun2017The).

## Function
UTP18 is a crucial component of the small subunit processome, a nucleolar multi-protein complex involved in ribosome biogenesis. Its primary function in healthy human cells is the cleavage of pre-ribosomal RNA to produce the 18S ribosomal RNA, a key component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. This process is essential for the formation of functional ribosomes, which are critical for protein synthesis and cellular growth (Yang2014A; Zhang2016Integrative).

In addition to its nucleolar role, UTP18 is also localized in the cytoplasm, suggesting it may have functions beyond ribosome assembly. It has been shown to increase internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation, a mechanism that initiates protein synthesis independently of the 5' cap structure of mRNA. This function is particularly relevant under stress conditions, where UTP18 can enhance the translation of specific mRNAs, thereby promoting cell survival and growth (Yang2014A).

UTP18 interacts with several cytoplasmic proteins involved in translation initiation, such as eIF2B, eIF3B, and PTBP1, indicating its involvement in the translation process. These interactions suggest that UTP18 plays a role in regulating translation, particularly under conditions favoring IRES-dependent mechanisms (Yang2014A).

## Clinical Significance
UTP18 is implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression, which is associated with increased tumor growth and aggressiveness. In neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast carcinoma, UTP18 is frequently overexpressed, correlating with higher histologic grades and decreased survival rates. In medulloblastoma, high UTP18 expression is linked to a higher risk of relapse and metastasis (Yang2014A). Overexpression of UTP18 enhances the translation of IRES-containing transcripts, promoting stress resistance and growth, which is co-opted by cancers for tumorigenesis (Yang2014A).

In colon adenocarcinoma, high UTP18 expression is associated with higher survival rates, although its deletion inhibits the growth of some cell lines, indicating a complex role in cancer progression (Hu2019Identification). UTP18's interaction with Hsp90 is crucial for its role in translation and stress response, and inhibition of Hsp90 affects UTP18's localization and function (Yang2014A). Structural variants affecting UTP18 have been identified in multiple myeloma, suggesting its involvement in gene deregulation and disease progression (Ashby2022Structural). These findings highlight UTP18 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer.
