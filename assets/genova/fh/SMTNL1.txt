# SMTNL1

## Overview
The SMTNL1 gene encodes the smoothelin-like 1 protein, which is a regulatory protein involved in smooth muscle function and insulin sensitivity. As a member of the smoothelin family, SMTNL1 is characterized by its calponin homology domain and calmodulin-binding sites, which facilitate its interactions with proteins such as tropomyosin and calmodulin (UlkeLemée2011Mapping; UlkeLemée2017Binding). SMTNL1 plays a crucial role in modulating muscle contractility and cytoskeletal dynamics by influencing myosin phosphatase activity and actin-myosin interactions (Major2021SmoothelinLike). Additionally, SMTNL1 acts as a transcriptional co-regulator, enhancing insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle and endometrial epithelial cells (Major2021SmoothelinLikea; Keller2024Smoothelinlike). Its involvement in these processes underscores its importance in maintaining vascular and metabolic health, with potential implications for therapeutic interventions in conditions such as hypertension and insulin resistance (Keller2024Smoothelinlike; Turner2019Smoothelinlike).

## Structure
The smoothelin-like 1 (SMTNL1) protein is characterized by several structural features that contribute to its function in smooth muscle regulation. It contains a calponin homology (CH) domain, which is involved in its interactions with other proteins such as tropomyosin (Tpm) and calmodulin (CaM) (UlkeLemée2011Mapping; UlkeLemée2017Binding). SMTNL1 has two distinct calmodulin-binding sites: a classic CaM-binding domain (CBD1) located between amino acids 310-325 and an IQ motif (CBD2) between amino acids 439-457, both of which are situated in the carboxy-terminal region (UlkeLemée2017Binding).

Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification of SMTNL1, particularly at the Ser301 site, which enhances its binding affinity to tropomyosin by altering the electrostatic properties or conformation of the Tpm-binding surface (UlkeLemée2017Binding). This phosphorylation also affects SMTNL1's interaction with calmodulin, reducing its affinity for CaM when phosphorylated (UlkeLemée2017Binding).

The SMTNL1 gene does not appear to produce multiple isoforms, as a single transcription start site has been identified, although the possibility of multiple C-terminal splice variants cannot be excluded (UlkeLemée2011Mapping). The protein's structure and modifications play a crucial role in its regulatory functions in muscle contractility and insulin sensitivity.

## Function
Smoothelin-like protein 1 (SMTNL1) plays a significant role in regulating muscle function and insulin sensitivity in healthy human cells. In smooth muscle cells, SMTNL1 modulates contractility by interacting with tropomyosin and calmodulin, with its binding regulated by phosphorylation. This interaction influences the actin-myosin interactions crucial for muscle contraction and relaxation (UlkeLemée2017Binding). SMTNL1 is also involved in the regulation of myosin phosphatase activity, which is essential for muscle contraction and cytoskeletal dynamics (Major2021SmoothelinLike).

In skeletal muscle, SMTNL1 acts as a transcriptional co-regulator, promoting insulin sensitivity by enhancing the expression of glucose transporters and insulin receptor substrates, which are vital for glucose uptake and metabolism (Major2021SmoothelinLikea). It also influences muscle fiber type conversion and metabolic properties, impacting muscle phenotype and glucose homeostasis (Major2021SmoothelinLikea).

In endometrial epithelial cells, SMTNL1 enhances insulin sensitivity and modulates contractile properties, which is crucial for maintaining cellular function under insulin-resistant conditions. It promotes glycogen synthesis and storage, contributing to glucose homeostasis (Keller2024Smoothelinlike). SMTNL1's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining muscle function and metabolic balance in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SMTNL1 gene have been implicated in various health conditions, particularly those related to vascular and metabolic disorders. Deletion of SMTNL1 enhances myogenic reactivity in mesenteric arteries, leading to increased vascular contractility and hypercontractility, which could contribute to conditions like hypertension and other vascular diseases (Turner2019Smoothelinlike). The absence of SMTNL1 affects the balance between myosin light chain kinase and myosin light chain phosphatase, promoting vessel constriction and altering vascular tone, which are critical factors in blood pressure regulation (Turner2019Smoothelinlike).

In the context of metabolic health, SMTNL1 plays a role in insulin sensitivity. Overexpression of SMTNL1 in endometrial epithelial cells has been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, suggesting its potential therapeutic relevance in managing insulin resistance and conditions like gestational diabetes (Keller2024Smoothelinlike). SMTNL1's modulation of insulin signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and Akt-1, highlights its significance in maintaining glucose homeostasis (Keller2024Smoothelinlike). These findings suggest that SMTNL1 could be a target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic and vascular disorders.

## Interactions
Smoothelin-like protein 1 (SMTNL1) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. SMTNL1 interacts with myosin phosphatase (MP), specifically inhibiting its activity, which is crucial for muscle contraction and cytoskeletal regulation. This interaction affects the phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chain (MLC20), impacting muscle contraction and cell migration (Keller2024Smoothelinlike; Major2021SmoothelinLike).

SMTNL1 also binds to tropomyosin (Tpm) and calmodulin (CaM), with these interactions being mutually exclusive and regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of SMTNL1 at Ser301 by protein kinase A enhances its binding to Tpm while reducing its affinity for CaM. This suggests a competitive binding mechanism where SMTNL1 can cycle between Tpm-bound and CaM-bound states, depending on its phosphorylation status and intracellular calcium levels (UlkeLemée2017Binding).

In the context of insulin signaling, SMTNL1 interacts with IRS-1 and Akt-1, modulating their phosphorylation status and activity. This interaction is significant in improving insulin sensitivity, particularly under conditions of insulin resistance (Keller2024Smoothelinlike). SMTNL1's role as a transcriptional co-regulator of the progesterone receptor-B further highlights its involvement in hormone-dependent cellular processes (Major2021SmoothelinLikea).
