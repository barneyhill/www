# ZFP82

## Overview
ZFP82 is a gene that encodes the ZFP82 zinc finger protein, which is categorized as a zinc finger protein due to its characteristic structural motifs that facilitate binding to DNA and other proteins. This protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the context of cancer biology. ZFP82 is involved in modulating the stability and activity of the p53 protein, a key tumor suppressor, by interacting with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Through these interactions, ZFP82 influences the transcriptional activation of p53 target genes, thereby promoting apoptosis and enhancing the chemosensitivity of cancer cells, especially in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ye2024Zinc). The gene's expression is often downregulated in cancer due to promoter methylation, which has significant implications for tumor progression and treatment response, making ZFP82 a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for therapeutic intervention (Ye2018The; ye2024Zinc).

## Clinical Significance
ZFP82, a zinc finger protein, is implicated in various cancers due to its role as a tumor suppressor gene. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ZFP82 is frequently downregulated due to promoter CpG island methylation, which is associated with tumor progression and resistance to apoptosis (Ye2018The). This methylation is observed in a significant proportion of ESCC samples, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Ye2018The). The downregulation of ZFP82 is also linked to chemotherapy resistance in esophageal cancer, as its methylation status correlates with patient response to treatment (ye2024Zinc).

ZFP82 interacts with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to regulate p53 protein stability, enhancing chemosensitivity in esophageal cancer cells. Overexpression of ZFP82 leads to the downregulation of HDAC3, increasing the stability and acetylation of wild-type p53, which promotes apoptosis and enhances the effectiveness of chemotherapy (ye2024Zinc). The loss of ZFP82 expression due to methylation can be reversed by demethylation treatments, restoring its tumor-suppressing functions (ye2024Zinc). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ZFP82 in cancer diagnosis and treatment, particularly in enhancing chemotherapy efficacy and serving as a prognostic marker.

## Interactions
ZFP82, a zinc finger protein, interacts with several key proteins and plays a significant role in regulating p53 protein stability in esophageal cancer cells. It interacts with Histone Deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) at both transcriptional and protein levels. ZFP82 downregulates HDAC3, which leads to the translocation of HDAC3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, reducing its interaction with p53. This results in increased p53 stability and acetylation, enhancing the chemosensitivity of tumor cells by promoting apoptosis (ye2024Zinc).

ZFP82 also disrupts the interaction between HDAC3 and p53, facilitating the activation of p53 downstream targets such as PUMA and Bax. This disruption enhances p53 recruitment to the promoter region of target genes, promoting their transcriptional activation (ye2024Zinc). Additionally, ZFP82's interaction with HDAC3 affects the stability of mutant p53 (mutp53) by downregulating HSP70 and increasing CHIP expression, which enhances the degradation of mutp53 and increases chemosensitivity (ye2024Zinc).

These interactions highlight ZFP82's role in modulating protein complexes and influencing gene expression, particularly in the context of cancer cell apoptosis and chemotherapy response.
