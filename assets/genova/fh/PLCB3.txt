# PLCB3

## Overview
PLCB3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme phospholipase C beta 3, a critical component in cellular signaling pathways. This enzyme is categorized as a phospholipase and is involved in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are key second messengers in various physiological processes (Lyon2013Structural). The protein is primarily associated with the plasma membrane and plays a significant role in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, influencing functions in the nervous and cardiovascular systems, as well as in hematopoietic cells (Lyon2013Structural). Mutations in the PLCB3 gene have been linked to specific clinical conditions, including spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with corneal dystrophy and ileal Crohn's disease, underscoring its importance in human health (Ando2024Ileal; BenSalem2017Defect).

## Structure
Phospholipase C beta 3 (PLCB3) is a multi-domain enzyme with a complex molecular structure. The protein includes a conserved catalytic core composed of a TIM-like barrel domain split into X and Y halves, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Lyon2013Structural). The X-Y linker region plays a significant role in autoinhibition by blocking the active site, preventing substrate access (Lyon2014Molecular). The N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is involved in regulatory protein-protein interactions rather than direct membrane association (Lyon2013Structural).

PLCB3 also contains EF hand repeats that serve as a structural scaffold and a C2 domain that contributes to regulatory binding sites (Lyon2013Structural). The C-terminal extension of PLCB3 includes a proximal C-terminal domain (CTD) with a primary Gαq binding site and an autoinhibitory helix, as well as a distal CTD important for membrane binding and maximal activity (Lyon2013Structural). The distal CTD forms an elongated helical bundle stabilized by coiled-coil interactions, similar to Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs domains (Lyon2013Structural).

The Hα2′ helix, located in the C-terminal extension, acts as a brake on enzyme activity by limiting optimal interactions with lipid bilayers (Lyon2014Molecular). The structure of PLCB3 is further regulated by interactions with G protein subunits, such as Gαq, which significantly activate the enzyme (Lyon2013Structural).

## Function
Phospholipase C beta 3 (PLCB3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in intracellular signaling by hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce the second messengers inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). These messengers are pivotal in the release of intracellular calcium and the activation of protein kinase C, which lead to significant cellular changes (Lyon2013Structural). PLCB3 is primarily active at the plasma membrane and is involved in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways, influencing numerous physiological processes (Lyon2013Structural).

In the nervous system, PLCB3 is involved in opioid-induced calcium release and mediates responses to noxious stimuli (Lyon2013Structural). In the cardiovascular system, it is associated with Gq-mediated cardiac hypertrophy (Lyon2013Structural). PLCB3 also plays a role in the regulation of myometrial contractility during pregnancy and labor, being essential for oxytocin-stimulated increases in intracellular calcium (Zhong2008Multiple). In hematopoietic cells, PLCB3 inhibits cell proliferation by interacting with the transcription factor Stat5 and its regulator SHP1, and it regulates chemotaxis in neutrophils (Lyon2013Structural). The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with scaffolding proteins and is subject to regulation by phosphorylation (Zhong2008Multiple; Kadamur2013Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PLCB3 gene have been linked to a novel form of spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with corneal dystrophy (SMDCD). This condition is characterized by severe skeletal abnormalities, corneal clouding, and developmental delays. The identified homozygous variant, c.2632G>T, leads to a loss of PLCB3 activity, resulting in the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and disorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton. This disruption in phosphoinositide signaling is crucial for bone, brain, and eye development, and the phenotype observed in patients includes short limbs, abnormal iliac bones, and vertebrae with wide intervertebral spaces (BenSalem2017Defect).

Alterations in PLCB3 expression are also implicated in ileal Crohn's disease. Reduced expression of PLCB3 leads to decreased activity of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and repair. This deficiency results in increased intestinal permeability, impaired stem cell function, and dysbiosis, contributing to the pathology of ileal Crohn's disease. Studies in PLCB3-deficient mice have shown increased susceptibility to colitis and severe intestinal inflammation, highlighting the gene's role in intestinal health (Ando2024Ileal).

## Interactions
PLCB3 interacts with the Gαq subunit of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, playing a crucial role in signal transduction. The interaction involves a helix-turn-helix motif in PLCB3, which provides a large binding surface for Gαq. This interaction is essential for the activation of PLCB3 and the subsequent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are key components in calcium signaling pathways (Waldo2010Kinetic).

Mutations in PLCB3, such as L859E, can disrupt its interaction with Gαq, leading to a loss of Gαq-mediated enzymatic activity. This highlights the importance of specific amino acid residues in maintaining the functional interaction between PLCB3 and Gαq (Waldo2010Kinetic; Rimessi2018PLCB3).

PLCB3 also interacts with Rac1, a small GTPase, in a signaling pathway that involves the activation of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) in neutrophils. This interaction is mediated through the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLCB3, which is crucial for its role in neutrophil function and chemokine-induced responses (Block2016Gnb).
