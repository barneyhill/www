# MYBPC3

## Overview
The MYBPC3 gene encodes the cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), a critical regulatory protein within the sarcomere of cardiac muscle cells. As a member of the myosin-binding protein C family, cMyBP-C plays a pivotal role in modulating cardiac muscle contraction by interacting with both myosin and actin filaments. This interaction is essential for the regulation of the rate and force of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation, thereby maintaining normal cardiac function (Moss2015Cardiac; Carrier2015Cardiac). The protein's function is further modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its binding properties and, consequently, cardiac contractility (Moss2015Cardiac). Mutations in the MYBPC3 gene are a significant cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and other cardiomyopathies, highlighting its clinical importance in cardiac health and disease (Marston2009Evidence; Tudurachi2023An).

## Structure
The MYBPC3 gene encodes cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), a multi-domain protein essential for cardiac muscle function. The primary structure of cMyBP-C consists of 1,274 amino acids organized into eight immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and three fibronectin type-III (FnIII) domains (Nadvi2016Clinically; Carrier2015Cardiac). The protein's secondary structure includes β-sheets and α-helices, with the C3 domain adopting an Ig-like fold characterized by a β-sandwich structure (Zhang2014Structural).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with specific features such as a 28-amino acid insertion within the C5 domain, which is unique to the cardiac isoform and affects its fold and stability (Nadvi2016Clinically; Carrier2015Cardiac). The quaternary structure of cMyBP-C includes its interaction with myosin and actin filaments, forming a bridge between the thick and thin filaments in the sarcomere (Doh2024Bringing).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating cMyBP-C's function, with phosphorylation sites located in the N-terminal region (Doh2024Bringing). Splice variants of MYBPC3 can lead to different isoforms, affecting the protein's structural and functional properties (Carrier2015Cardiac).

## Function
The MYBPC3 gene encodes cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), a crucial regulatory protein in cardiac muscle cells. cMyBP-C is primarily active in the sarcomere, the fundamental contractile unit of cardiac muscle cells, where it modulates the interaction between actin and myosin filaments. This modulation is essential for regulating the rate and force of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation (Moss2015Cardiac; Carrier2015Cardiac).

cMyBP-C influences cardiac contractility by binding to both myosin and actin, affecting the probability of cross-bridge interactions with actin. This interaction is crucial for the cooperative recruitment of cross-bridges to the thin filament, which is necessary for muscle contraction (Moss2015Cardiac; Kampourakis2014Myosin). Phosphorylation of cMyBP-C by protein kinase A (PKA) and calcium calmodulin kinase 2 delta (CaMK2δ) alters its binding properties, enhancing contractility by shifting its interaction from myosin to actin (Moss2015Cardiac).

In healthy cells, cMyBP-C's role in modulating contractility is vital for maintaining normal cardiac function. It ensures optimal power generation and efficiency of myocardial contraction at rest while providing reserve capacity for increased function under stress (Moss2015Cardiac). The phosphorylation of cMyBP-C is a key mechanism for modulating cardiac contractility in response to physiological stimuli, such as β-adrenergic stimulation (Moss2015Cardiac).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYBPC3 gene are a major cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition characterized by the thickening of the heart muscle, which can lead to diastolic dysfunction, progressive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death (Marston2009Evidence; Tudurachi2023An). These mutations are often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and are responsible for a significant proportion of sarcomere gene mutation-positive HCM cases (Tudurachi2023An). The clinical manifestations of HCM due to MYBPC3 mutations are highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to severe outcomes like arrhythmic syncope and sudden cardiac death (Tudurachi2023An).

MYBPC3 mutations can also lead to other cardiomyopathies, including dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and restrictive cardiomyopathy. In DCM, MYBPC3 mutations are among the most frequent genetic causes, contributing to heart failure and adverse cardiac events (Ehlermann2008Adverse). The gene is also implicated in left ventricular non-compaction, a condition that can result in severe neonatal cardiomyopathy (Tudurachi2023An).

The pathogenic mechanism of MYBPC3 mutations often involves haploinsufficiency, where reduced levels of functional MyBP-C protein lead to cardiac dysfunction (Marston2009Evidence). This can result from premature termination codons that cause RNA degradation and reduced protein synthesis (Helms2020Effects).

## Interactions
MYBPC3, or myosin binding protein C3, is a cardiac-specific protein that interacts with several other proteins within the sarcomere, the fundamental unit of muscle contraction. It primarily interacts with myosin and actin, playing a crucial role in regulating cardiac muscle contraction and stability (Carrier2015Cardiac). MYBPC3 is also involved in interactions with molecular chaperones, particularly the HSP70 family, including HSC70. These chaperones are essential for the protein's degradation pathway, with HSC70 being a significant player in the proteasomal degradation of both wild-type and mutant MYBPC3 (Glazier2018HSC70).

Mutations in MYBPC3 can alter its interaction with these chaperones. For example, the Ile154Leufs*5 mutation decreases interaction with HSP70/HSC70, while the Trp1098* mutation increases it (Glazier2018HSC70). The interaction with HSC70 is crucial for maintaining sarcomere proteostasis, and disruptions in this interaction due to mutations may contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (Glazier2018HSC70). Additionally, MYBPC3 interacts with small heat shock proteins like αB-crystallin and HSP27, which help prevent the aggregation of unfolded proteins, although these interactions are significantly reduced in truncated MYBPC3 mutants (Glazier2018HSC70).
