# DIRAS1

## Overview
DIRAS1 (DIRAS family GTPase 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which are pivotal in regulating intracellular signaling pathways. The DIRAS1 protein is characterized by its low intrinsic GTPase activity and its predominant existence in a GTP-bound form, which allows it to function as a tumor suppressor by antagonizing RAS-mediated signaling pathways, such as the ERK/MAPK pathway (Li2018The). This antagonism is crucial for modulating cell growth, migration, and survival, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. Additionally, DIRAS1 plays a significant role in autophagy, a process that can lead to cell death, by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT1 and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways, which results in the upregulation of autophagy-related genes (Sutton2018RASrelated). The gene's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in normal cellular function and its potential implications in cancer biology, where its expression is often altered (Zheng2017Methylation).

## Structure


## Function
DIRAS1 (DIRAS family GTPase 1) is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which are involved in intracellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, DIRAS1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth, migration, and survival by modulating various signaling pathways. It is characterized by low GTPase activity and predominantly exists in a GTP-bound form, which allows it to antagonize RAS-mediated ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. This antagonism reduces the ability of RAS to activate downstream targets such as Elk-1, thereby functioning as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting oncogenic signaling pathways (Li2018The).

DIRAS1 also influences autophagy, a cellular process that can lead to cell death, by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT1 and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways. This inhibition results in the upregulation of autophagy-related genes, which are regulated by transcription factors like FOXO3 and TFEB. The role of DIRAS1 in autophagy suggests its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting cell survival under stress conditions (Sutton2018RASrelated). The protein's activity in these pathways highlights its importance in cellular processes that are critical for normal cell function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
DIRAS1 is implicated in several cancers due to alterations in its expression and epigenetic modifications. In gliomas, DIRAS1 acts as a tumor suppressor, and its decreased expression is linked to higher-grade tumors like glioblastoma. This downregulation is often due to promoter hypermethylation, contributing to chemoresistance by affecting the p53-mediated DNA damage response (Bergom2016The; RothhammerHampl2021Frequent). In colorectal cancer, DIRAS1 is frequently silenced through promoter hypermethylation, which correlates with poor prognosis, advanced TNM stage, and reduced survival. Demethylation agents can reverse this silencing, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach (Zheng2017Methylation).

In ovarian cancer, DIRAS1 is downregulated, and its re-expression inhibits cancer cell growth by inducing autophagy, a process crucial for tumor suppression. This downregulation is associated with decreased progression-free and overall survival in patients (Sutton2018RASrelated). The gene's role in autophagy and its impact on signaling pathways like PI3K-AKT1 and RAS-MAPK highlight its significance in cancer biology. Overall, DIRAS1's tumor-suppressive functions are compromised in various cancers due to epigenetic alterations, leading to enhanced tumor progression and resistance to therapy.

## Interactions
DIRAS1, a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. DIRAS1 is known to antagonize RAS-mediated signaling pathways, such as the ERK/MAPK pathway, by reducing RAS's ability to activate downstream targets like Elk-1 (Li2018The). It also inhibits the activity of oncogenic small GTPases and NF-κB transcription by binding nonproductively to the smg GDP dissociation stimulator (smgGDS) protein, an atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Li2018The).

Experimental studies have shown that DIRAS1 interacts with Ras binding domains, such as Raf-RBD, with a preference for the GTP-bound form over the GDP-bound state, indicating specificity in its interactions (Kiel2007A). DIRAS1 also plays a role in inhibiting the AKT1-MTOR and RAS-MAPK signaling pathways, which leads to the modulation of autophagy-related transcription factors FOXO3 and TFEB, thereby influencing the transcription of autophagy-related genes (Sutton2018RASrelated).

Despite these findings, the precise molecular mechanisms and physical interactions of DIRAS1 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain partially understood, necessitating further research to elucidate its full range of interactions (Li2018The).
