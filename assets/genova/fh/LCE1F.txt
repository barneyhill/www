# LCE1F

## Overview
LCE1F, or late cornified envelope 1F, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the late cornified envelope (LCE) family, which is integral to the formation and maintenance of the skin's protective barrier. The LCE1F protein is categorized as a structural protein, contributing to the integrity of the epidermis by participating in the formation of the cornified envelope, a key component of the skin barrier (Lin2023Environmental). This gene is part of the Epidermal Differentiation Complex (EDC), a cluster of genes essential for skin barrier function and epidermal differentiation (oh2016role). LCE1F is coexpressed with genes involved in the DNA damage response, indicating a potential role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Xu2020The). Additionally, its interaction with PRMT5 suggests involvement in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation (Yabuta2018Late).

## Interactions
LCE1F is part of the late cornified envelope (LCE) gene family, which plays a role in the formation of the cornified envelope, a critical component of the skin barrier. While specific interactions of LCE1F are not extensively detailed, it is known to be part of the Epidermal Differentiation Complex (EDC), which includes various genes involved in skin barrier formation and function (oh2016role). The LCE proteins, including LCE1F, are involved in the structural integrity of the epidermis, contributing to the formation of the cornified envelope (Lin2023Environmental).

LCE1F is coexpressed with other genes involved in the DNA damage response, such as GADD45A, TP53I3, and CDKN1A, suggesting a potential regulatory role in processes like cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage (Xu2020The). Although specific protein-protein interactions for LCE1F are not detailed, its coexpression with these genes indicates it may participate in complex regulatory networks within the cell. The interaction of LCE1F with PRMT5, a protein involved in histone methylation, is noted, suggesting a role in chromatin modification and gene expression regulation (Yabuta2018Late).
