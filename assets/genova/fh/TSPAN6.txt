# TSPAN6

## Overview
TSPAN6 is a gene that encodes the protein tetraspanin 6, a member of the tetraspanin family characterized by four transmembrane domains. Tetraspanin 6 is involved in the organization of membrane microdomains and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including exosome release, synaptic transmission, and immune response modulation. It interacts with several proteins, such as syntenin-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), influencing pathways related to cell proliferation, tumor growth, and neurodegenerative processes (Guix2017Tetraspanin; Humbert2022TSPAN6). TSPAN6 is implicated in several diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, where it acts as a tumor suppressor in some contexts while promoting disease progression in others (Zhang2024TSPAN6; Humbert2022TSPAN6). Its role in synaptic regulation also links it to neurological conditions such as epilepsy and mental retardation (Perot2020Tetraspanin).

## Structure
Tetraspanin 6 (TSPAN6) is a member of the tetraspanin family, characterized by four transmembrane domains. These domains are connected by extracellular and intracellular loops, with the long extracellular loop containing a conserved cysteine-cysteine-glycine sequence, which is crucial for protein folding and function through the formation of disulfide bonds (Murru2018Tetraspanins; Perot2020Tetraspanin). TSPAN6 is 245 amino acids long and has an atomic mass of 27.6 kDa (Perot2020Tetraspanin).

The C-terminal end of TSPAN6 contains a PDZ-binding motif, which interacts with the PDZ module of the cytosolic adapter protein syntenin. This interaction is essential for the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and exosome secretion (Guix2017Tetraspanin). TSPAN6 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation, which influence its interactions and the assembly of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (Murru2018Tetraspanins).

TSPAN6 does not show significantly higher expression in a specific tissue and is located on the X chromosome (Perot2020Tetraspanin). It plays a role in synaptic transmission regulation and is linked to conditions such as epilepsy, mental retardation, and Alzheimer's disease (Perot2020Tetraspanin).

## Function
Tetraspanin 6 (TSPAN6) is a transmembrane protein involved in various cellular processes, primarily through its role in organizing membrane microdomains and facilitating protein interactions. TSPAN6 is active in the plasma membrane and is implicated in the regulation of exosome release and lysosomal degradation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments. It interacts with the cytosolic adapter protein syntenin, which is crucial for the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) destined for exosome secretion. This interaction is necessary for the stabilization of the TSPAN6-syntenin complex, which plays a significant role in exosome biogenesis (Guix2017Tetraspanin).

TSPAN6 also affects the autophagic flux by impairing the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, leading to the accumulation of enlarged endosomal compartments and affecting the degradation of APP-CTF (Guix2017Tetraspanin). In neurons, TSPAN6 is involved in synaptic transmission, acting as a negative regulator. Its deletion in hippocampal neurons increases basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation, suggesting a role in synaptic regulation (Perot2020Tetraspanin). TSPAN6 is also involved in modulating immune responses, particularly by limiting RIG-I-induced IFN-β production, which acts as a negative feedback mechanism to prevent overstimulation of innate immune responses (Perot2020Tetraspanin).

## Clinical Significance
TSPAN6 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In cancer, TSPAN6 acts as a tumor suppressor, particularly in RAS-driven cancers. Its expression is crucial in suppressing tumor growth and metastasis in pancreatic and lung cancers. Low TSPAN6 expression is associated with poor prognosis and increased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures, which correlate with reduced survival in non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinomas (Humbert2022TSPAN6). Conversely, in glioblastoma, TSPAN6 is overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is linked to poor outcomes (Zhang2024TSPAN6).

In neurodegenerative diseases, TSPAN6 is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. It modulates amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, leading to increased amyloid-beta (Aβ) production. Overexpression of TSPAN6 impairs autophagy, resulting in the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments and enhanced Aβ secretion, contributing to AD progression (Guix2017Tetraspanin). TSPAN6 is also linked to epilepsy and mental retardation, with deletions observed in female patients, suggesting a role in synaptic transmission regulation (Perot2020Tetraspanin). These findings highlight TSPAN6's significant role in various pathological conditions through its impact on cellular signaling and protein processing pathways.

## Interactions
TSPAN6 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It physically interacts with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), inhibiting the EGFR-RAS-ERK signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and tumor growth (Humbert2022TSPAN6). This interaction is specific, as TSPAN6 does not interact with the DLG1-SCRIB complex, indicating that it regulates EGFR-RAS signaling through a distinct pathway (Humbert2022TSPAN6).

TSPAN6 also interacts with syntenin-1, a cytosolic adapter protein, through its PDZ-binding motif. This interaction is essential for the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and exosome biogenesis, highlighting TSPAN6's role in exosome release (Guix2017Tetraspanin). The interaction with syntenin is crucial for the ESCRT-independent formation of ILVs, which are destined for exosome secretion rather than degradation (Guix2017Tetraspanin).

In glioblastoma, TSPAN6 interacts with CDK5RAP3, a co-activator of the STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction enhances the activation of STAT3, promoting cell migration and invasion, which are key processes in cancer progression (Zhang2024TSPAN6). These interactions underscore TSPAN6's involvement in both cancer biology and neurodegenerative processes.
