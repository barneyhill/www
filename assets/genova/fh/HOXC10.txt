# HOXC10

## Overview
HOXC10 is a gene that encodes the homeobox C10 protein, a member of the Hox family of transcription factors. These proteins are characterized by a conserved homeodomain that facilitates DNA binding, playing a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development and cell differentiation (Rezsohazy2015Cellular). The HOXC10 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and differentiation, particularly in mesenchymal stem cells where it influences osteogenesis (Steens2022HOX). It is subject to post-translational modifications and degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is crucial for its function in cell cycle progression (Gabellini2003Early). Aberrant expression of HOXC10 has been implicated in several cancers, where it can influence tumor progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Li2019HOXC10; Peng2020HOXC10).

## Structure
HOXC10 is a member of the homeobox gene family, characterized by a conserved 60-amino acid homeodomain responsible for DNA binding. The primary structure of HOXC10 includes this homeodomain, which is crucial for its function as a transcription factor (Rezsohazy2015Cellular). The secondary structure of the homeodomain typically involves alpha helices that facilitate DNA interaction. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices to enable specific DNA binding, although detailed structural information specific to HOXC10 is not provided in the context.

HOXC10 contains conserved motifs adjacent to the homeodomain, which are important for its regulatory functions. These motifs include potential phosphorylation sites that may modulate the protein's activity by altering DNA-binding affinity (Guerreiro2012Regulatory). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are suggested to play a role in the regulation of HOXC10's function, particularly in its rib-repressing activity (Guerreiro2012Regulatory).

The protein is also subject to degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, involving D-box motifs that are essential for its ubiquitin-dependent degradation during mitosis (Gabellini2003Early). This degradation is crucial for cell cycle progression, linking developmental regulation with cell cycle control (Gabellini2003Early). Information on splice variant isoforms of HOXC10 is not provided in the context.

## Function
HOXC10 is a member of the Hox family of transcription factors, which play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during development. In healthy human cells, HOXC10 is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly during mitosis. It is specifically targeted for degradation early in mitosis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, a process regulated by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC). This degradation is essential for proper cell cycle progression, as failure to degrade HOXC10 can delay the transition from metaphase to anaphase, leading to mitotic accumulation (Gabellini2003Early).

HOXC10's degradation is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase APC in conjunction with E2 enzymes UbcH5 and UbcH10, and involves two functional destruction boxes necessary for its ubiquitylation (Gabellini2003Early). The protein's interaction with the APC subunit CDC27 and its reduced degradation in APC-depleted extracts further support its role in cell cycle regulation (Gabellini2003Early).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, HOXC10 is expressed in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and is involved in maintaining cellular identity and regulating differentiation, particularly in bone marrow-derived MSCs where it influences osteogenesis (Steens2022HOX).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HOXC10 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including breast, ovarian, gastric, cervical, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In breast cancer, HOXC10 is associated with estrogen regulation and endocrine resistance, with its expression being preferentially found in estrogen receptor-positive cells. Loss of HOXC10 expression can lead to increased cell growth and resistance to estrogen deprivation, contributing to treatment resistance (Pathiraja2014Epigenetic).

In ovarian cancer, overexpression of HOXC10 is linked to poor prognosis and enhanced metastasis, partly through the regulation of the EMT-related gene Slug. This suggests that HOXC10 could be a target for therapeutic intervention in ovarian cancer (Peng2020HOXC10).

In gastric cancer, HOXC10 is overexpressed and correlates with increased cell proliferation and migration. Its expression is associated with proinflammatory cytokines and the NF-κB signaling pathway, indicating its role in cancer progression (Li2019HOXC10).

In cervical cancer, HOXC10 is highly expressed in invasive squamous cell carcinomas and enhances cell motility and invasion, suggesting its role as a mediator of cancer progression (Zhai2007Gene).

In NSCLC, elevated HOXC10 expression is linked to aggressive tumor behavior and poor survival outcomes, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2020Epigenetic).

## Interactions
HOXC10, a member of the Hox family of transcription factors, is involved in several interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function in cell cycle progression and development. During mitosis, HOXC10 is targeted for degradation by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process involves the interaction of HOXC10 with the APC subunit CDC27, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Gabellini2003Early). HOXC10 contains two functional D-box motifs that are essential for its recognition and degradation by the APC, indicating a specific regulatory interaction with this complex (Gabellini2003Early).

HOXC10 also interacts with nucleic acids, as it has been isolated for its ability to bind to the human origin of DNA replication at the lamin B2 locus, suggesting a potential role in DNA replication (Gabellini2003Early). In the context of breast cancer, HOXC10 is transcriptionally regulated by estrogen through interactions with estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and histone methylases MLL3 and MLL4, which bind to estrogen response elements in the HOXC10 promoter (Ansari2011HOXC10). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of HOXC10 in cellular processes.
