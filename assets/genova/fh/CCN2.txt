# CCN2

## Overview
CCN2, also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is a gene that encodes a matricellular protein involved in a wide array of cellular processes. The protein, cellular communication network factor 2, is characterized by its tetramodular structure, which includes domains that facilitate interactions with cell surface receptors and extracellular matrix components. As a matricellular protein, CCN2 plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration, as well as in the regulation of extracellular matrix production and turnover. It is particularly significant in the development and maintenance of skeletal and nervous systems, influencing processes such as ossification and neuronal survival. CCN2's interactions with integrins and other proteins underscore its involvement in complex signaling pathways that are crucial for both physiological and pathological processes, including fibrosis and cancer (Kaasbøll2018Connective; Leguit2021CCN2; Kubota2014Cellular).

## Structure
The CCN2 protein, also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is characterized by a tetramodular structure consisting of four distinct domains: the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) domain, the von Willebrand factor type C (VWC) domain, the thrombospondin type 1 (TSP1) domain, and the C-terminal cysteine knot (CT) domain (Kubota2014Cellular; Yeger2007The). These domains are connected in tandem and are crucial for the protein's interactions with various molecular counterparts, including cell surface receptors and extracellular matrix components (Kubota2007Role).

The primary structure of CCN2 is rich in conserved cysteine residues, which are essential for maintaining its proper tertiary structure through intramodular interactions (Kubota2007Role). The protein is secreted, as indicated by an N-terminal signal peptide, and can exist in monomodular or dimodular fragments due to enzymatic cleavage (Kubota2014Cellular). These fragments may have unique biological functions (Yeger2007The).

CCN2 can form dimers, suggesting a quaternary structure, and undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, which can influence its function. Splice variants of CCN2 may exist, potentially altering its functional properties (Kubota2014Cellular).

## Function
CCN2, also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is a matricellular protein that plays a significant role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, survival, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) production (Leguit2021CCN2). CCN2 functions in an autocrine or paracrine manner, interacting with cell surface receptors, growth factors, and ECM proteins to influence signal transduction and matrix turnover (Leguit2021CCN2).

In the skeletal system, CCN2 is crucial for cartilage and bone development, particularly in processes such as endochondral and intramembranous ossification. It promotes the proliferation, maturation, and hypertrophy of growth-plate chondrocytes and supports energy metabolism in these cells (Kubota2014Cellular). CCN2 also plays a role in joint development and is involved in the regulation of osteoblast function and cartilage maintenance (HallGlenn2011Roles).

In the central nervous system, CCN2 is involved in the postnatal development of neurons, particularly in the olfactory bulb, where it regulates the survival of inhibitory interneurons through TGF-β-mediated apoptotic signaling (Kubota2014Cellular). In the pancreas, CCN2 is important for the development of the islets of Langerhans, particularly in the proliferation of β-cells, which are essential for insulin production and glucose homeostasis (Kubota2014Cellular).

## Clinical Significance
The CCN2 gene, also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In neuromuscular diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), overexpression of CCN2 is linked to muscle atrophy and fibrosis. Blocking CCN2 with an antibody has shown potential in ameliorating disease symptoms, suggesting its role as a therapeutic target (Rebolledo2021Driving). In muscular dystrophies like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), elevated CCN2 levels correlate with disease severity and contribute to fibrotic and inflammatory responses (Rebolledo2021Driving).

CCN2 is also associated with various cancers. In breast cancer, its overexpression enhances cell migration and angiogenesis, while in colorectal cancer, it may play an oncogenic role (LI2015Emerging). In hepatocellular carcinoma, increased CCN2 expression is linked to cancer progression and drug resistance (Yeger2021The). Additionally, CCN2 is involved in ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, where it contributes to abnormal extracellular matrix accumulation and neovascularization (Yan2013Cysteine‐rich). These findings highlight the significant role of CCN2 in the progression of fibrotic diseases and cancer.

## Interactions
CCN2, also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), is involved in various protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its biological functions. It interacts with transmembrane integrins, such as integrin αvβ3, which is important for its functions in cellular activities like fibroblast migration and osteoclast differentiation (Kaasbøll2018Connective). CCN2 also binds to extracellular matrix proteins, including proteoglycans, and potentially interacts with BMP-2 and BMP-4, although the latter interaction is debated (Kaasbøll2018Connective).

The protein's domain III, known as TSP-1, binds and modulates the function of VEGF 165, and MMP-mediated cleavage of CCN2 can release VEGF 165, reactivating its angiogenic activity (Kaasbøll2018Connective). CCN2 also interacts with dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), receptor-activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK), and osteoprotegerin, promoting osteoclastogenesis (Kubota2014Cellular).

CCN2's interactions extend to other CCN family members, such as CCN3, which can modulate its function (Kubota2014Cellular). These interactions are part of a complex regulatory network that influences CCN2's expression and function, highlighting its role in various physiological and pathological processes (Kubota2014Cellular).
