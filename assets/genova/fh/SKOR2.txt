# SKOR2

## Overview
SKOR2, or SKI family transcriptional corepressor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional repression within the nucleus. The SKOR2 protein functions as a transcriptional corepressor, playing a critical role in regulating gene expression by interacting with various transcription factors. It is notably involved in the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway, where it influences cell proliferation and differentiation processes. The degradation of SKOR2, mediated by interactions with proteins such as Merlin and Arkadia, is essential for proper TGF-β signaling, particularly in the context of Schwann cell proliferation. Dysregulation of SKOR2 has been implicated in neurological disorders, including congenital ataxia, and is associated with cerebellar developmental abnormalities (Valence2019Exome; Tang2024Interactions). Additionally, SKOR2 is part of a transcription factor network in the midbrain that regulates the development of GABAergic neurons, which are important for REM sleep regulation (Kirjavainen2022Gata2).

## Function
SKOR2 (SKI family transcriptional corepressor 2) is a protein that functions as a transcriptional corepressor, primarily active in the nucleus. It plays a significant role in regulating gene expression by interacting with other transcription factors. In the context of NF2-associated Schwann cell proliferation, SKOR2 is involved in the TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. Merlin, encoded by the NF2 gene, facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of SKOR2 by Arkadia, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This degradation is crucial for the activation of TGF-β-responsive gene expression by phosphorylated SMAD proteins (p-SMAD2/3), which is essential for controlling cell proliferation (Tang2024Interactions).

In healthy human cells, the degradation of SKOR2 is necessary for proper SMAD-dependent TGF-β signaling, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Disruption of this process, such as through NF2 mutations, leads to increased SKOR2 stability, decreased TGF-β signaling, and enhanced Schwann cell proliferation (Tang2024Interactions). SKOR2's role in these molecular processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal cellular functions and its potential implications in disease when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SKOR2 gene have been implicated in congenital ataxia (CA), a neurological disorder characterized by early cerebellar symptoms. A study identified a homozygous null variant of SKOR2 in a patient with CA, who exhibited symptoms such as neonatal hypotonia, psychomotor delay, scoliosis, nystagmus, mild intellectual disability, and nonprogressive ataxia. MRI findings revealed cerebellar dysplasia, particularly in vermian lobules IV to VIII. This suggests that SKOR2 mutations can lead to cerebellar developmental diseases (Valence2019Exome).

SKOR2 is also involved in the regulation of Schwann cell proliferation through its interactions with Merlin and Arkadia. In the context of NF2-associated schwannomatosis, a disorder caused by mutations in the NF2 gene, SKOR2's degradation is crucial for proper TGFβ signaling. Disruption of this process due to NF2 mutations leads to abnormal Schwann cell proliferation, highlighting SKOR2's role in tumor suppressor pathways (Tang2024Interactions).

While SKOR2 has not been directly linked to cancer progression, its role in neurodevelopmental processes and potential involvement in cerebellar disorders underscore its clinical significance (Rass2022The). Further research is needed to confirm its role in these conditions.

## Interactions
SKOR2 (SKI family transcriptional corepressor 2) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of NF2-associated Schwann cell proliferation, SKOR2 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein Merlin and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Arkadia. Merlin facilitates the degradation of SKOR2 in the nucleus through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a process mediated by Arkadia, which ubiquitinates SKOR2. This degradation is crucial for enhancing TGF-β signaling, which is important for regulating cell proliferation (Tang2024Interactions).

A mutation in the NF2 gene, specifically the p.L64P mutation, disrupts the interaction between Merlin and Arkadia, leading to the accumulation of SKOR2 in the nucleus and impaired TGF-β signaling. This disruption results in abnormal Schwann cell proliferation, highlighting the importance of SKOR2's interaction with Merlin and Arkadia in maintaining normal cell signaling and proliferation control (Tang2024Interactions).

In the midbrain, SKOR2 is part of a transcription factor network involving Gata2 and Nkx2-2, which regulates the development of a specific subtype of GABAergic neurons. These neurons are implicated in REM sleep regulation, and SKOR2 expression is dependent on Nkx2-2 (Kirjavainen2022Gata2).
