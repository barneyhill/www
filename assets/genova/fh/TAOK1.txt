# TAOK1

## Overview
TAOK1, or Thousand and one amino-acid kinase 1, is a gene that encodes the serine/threonine-protein kinase known as TAO kinase 1. This kinase is a member of the Ste20-like kinase family and is involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, microtubule dynamics, and actin cytoskeleton modulation (Woerden2021TAOK1; Hu2021Clinical). TAO kinase 1 is expressed predominantly in the brain, where it plays a critical role in neuronal development and function, influencing processes such as neurite outgrowth and axonal transport (Woerden2021TAOK1). Dysregulation of TAOK1 has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as in various cancers, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and normal physiological function (Fang2020The; Cavalli2024Heterozygous).

## Structure


## Function
TAOK1, or Thousand and one amino-acid kinase 1, is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in several critical cellular processes. In healthy human cells, TAOK1 plays a significant role in regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (Hu2021Clinical). It is involved in the phosphorylation of microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK), affecting microtubule dynamics by modulating tau and other microtubule-associated proteins (Hu2021Clinical). TAOK1 also interacts with Spred-1 to inhibit TESK1, thereby modulating actin dynamics through the activation of Cofilin (Hu2021Clinical).

TAOK1 is highly expressed in the human brain, where it is crucial for neuronal maturation and cortical development. It influences neurite outgrowth, axonal transport regulation, and differentiation of PC12 cells through the activation of PAR-1 (Woerden2021TAOK1). The kinase is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, contributing to stress response, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Woerden2021TAOK1). Dysregulation of TAOK1 can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal neuronal function and brain health (Woerden2021TAOK1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TAOK1 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). These disorders often present with developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, macrocephaly, hypotonia, and dysmorphic facial features (DulovicMahlow2019De; Cavalli2024Heterozygous). TAOK1 mutations can lead to cortical migration defects, as evidenced by cases of periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH), a brain malformation due to defects in neuronal migration (Cavalli2024Heterozygous).

De novo and inherited variants in TAOK1 have been linked to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including global developmental delay, joint laxity, and feeding difficulties (Hunter2022Inherited). Functional studies have shown that TAOK1 mutations can result in decreased mRNA levels and altered mitochondrial morphology, affecting neuronal development and function (Lintas2021Genotype–Phenotype; DulovicMahlow2019De).

TAOK1 is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, where it contributes to tau phosphorylation, a process involved in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic dysfunction (Fang2020The). Additionally, TAOK1 dysregulation is linked to various cancers, including breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, where it may play a role in tumor progression (Fang2020The).

## Interactions
TAOK1 interacts with a variety of proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It phosphorylates microtubule-binding proteins, including tau, which leads to microtubule instability and disassembly. This interaction is crucial for cytoskeleton dynamics and neuron development (Fang2020The). TAOK1 also interacts with the atypical Rho family protein Rnd3, facilitating its translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, which contributes to spindle positioning and cytokinesis (Fang2020The; Garg2020Rnd3).

In the context of immune responses, TAOK1 is involved in the TBK1-IRF3 signaling axis, promoting the formation of the TBK1-IRF3 complex and subsequent IRF3 phosphorylation, which is crucial for antiviral defense. TAOK1 binds TBK1 through its catalytic domain, and its kinase activity is necessary for promoting virus-induced type I IFN production (Luo2023Ste20Like). TAOK1 also interacts with dynein, facilitating the trafficking of TBK1 to the perinuclear region, which is essential for virus-mediated IRF3 activation (Luo2023Ste20Like).

TAOK1 acts as a negative regulator of IL-17-mediated signal transduction by preventing the formation of the IL-17 receptor and Act1 complex, thus inhibiting IL-17-associated inflammation (Fang2020The). It also enhances LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages by interacting with TRAF6 and TPL2 (Zhu2020TAOK1).
