# F7

## Overview
The F7 gene encodes coagulation factor VII (FVII), a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the initiation of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. This gene is located on chromosome 13 and is primarily expressed in the liver, where it is synthesized as an inactive zymogen. Upon vascular injury, FVII is activated to its enzymatically active form, FVIIa, which then forms a complex with tissue factor (TF) exposed at the site of injury. This TF/FVIIa complex is crucial for the conversion of factor X to its active form, factor Xa, ultimately leading to thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation. The F7 gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple mRNA transcripts, although these typically encode the same mature protein. Mutations in the F7 gene can lead to Factor VII deficiency, a rare bleeding disorder with variable clinical manifestations (Hagen1986Characterization; O’Hara1987Nucleotide; Mariani2009Factor).

## Structure
The F7 gene encodes coagulation factor VII, a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein involved in blood coagulation. The mature protein consists of 406 amino acids and is synthesized as a single-chain zymogen, which is activated to factor VIIa by proteolytic cleavage. This cleavage results in a two-chain structure: a light chain and a heavy chain, held together by a disulfide bond (Hagen1986Characterization; O’Hara1987Nucleotide).

The light chain contains a gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, essential for calcium ion binding, and two epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains, which facilitate interactions with phospholipid membranes and other proteins in the coagulation cascade (Newman2023A; Hagen1986Characterization). The heavy chain contains the serine protease domain, which is responsible for the protein's catalytic activity (Hagen1986Characterization).

Post-translational modifications include gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, crucial for the protein's function in binding calcium ions and interacting with tissue factor (Hagen1986Characterization). The F7 gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different mRNA transcripts, although two of these encode an identical mature protein (Newman2023A; Pshenichnikova2023Molecular). The protein's structure allows it to interact with tissue factor, inducing allosteric changes that enhance its protease activity (Newman2023A).

## Function
The F7 gene encodes coagulation factor VII (FVII), a crucial protein in the blood coagulation process. FVII is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease synthesized in the liver and circulates in the plasma as an inactive zymogen. Upon vascular injury, FVII is activated to its active form, FVIIa, primarily by factor Xa. This activation is essential for initiating the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation (shahbazi2019factor; Mariani2009Factor).

FVIIa forms a complex with tissue factor (TF), a membrane protein exposed at injury sites. This TF/FVIIa complex acts as an enzyme to convert factor X (FX) into its active form, FXa, in the presence of calcium ions. FXa then participates in the formation of the prothrombin-activating complex, which converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin subsequently converts fibrinogen into fibrin fibers, leading to clot formation and maintaining hemostasis (shahbazi2019factor; Mariani2009Factor).

The FVII protein structure includes a signal peptide, a propeptide sequence, two epidermal growth factor-like domains, and an activation peptide. The catalytic regions exhibit serine protease activity, which is crucial for its function in coagulation (shahbazi2019factor).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the F7 gene, which encodes coagulation factor VII, lead to Factor VII deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder. This condition is characterized by a wide range of clinical symptoms, from asymptomatic cases to severe bleeding episodes, including life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages and gastrointestinal bleeding (GiansilyBlaizot2001Analysis; Mariani2009Factor). The disorder is marked by prolonged prothrombin time (PT) with normal activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (Mariani2009Factor).

The genetic mutations associated with Factor VII deficiency are diverse, with missense mutations being the most common, followed by splicing-site changes, nonsense mutations, and small deletions (Halimeh2023Genotype–Phenotype; Mariani2009Factor). The clinical phenotype can vary significantly even among patients with the same mutation, suggesting the influence of other genetic components or environmental factors (Mariani2009Factor).

In some populations, specific mutations are more prevalent, such as the Ala244Val mutation in Moroccan and Iranian Jewish patients and the Cys310Phe mutation in Druze patients (Fromovich‐Amit2004Characterization). These mutations can affect the binding of factor VII to tissue factor, impacting its catalytic efficiency and leading to varying clinical presentations (Fromovich‐Amit2004Characterization).

## Interactions
Coagulation factor VII (F7) interacts primarily with tissue factor (TF) to initiate the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. The binding of FVIIa, the active form of F7, to TF is crucial for triggering the coagulation cascade. This interaction involves a large interface that stabilizes the active conformation of FVIIa, enhancing its catalytic activity (Persson2001Substitution). Met-306 in the serine protease domain of FVIIa is a key residue involved in the allosteric enhancement of FVIIa's activity upon TF binding. Mutations at this position, such as Met306Asp, significantly reduce the TF-induced stimulation of FVIIa, indicating the importance of Met-306 in the communication between TF and the catalytic center of FVIIa (Persson2001Substitution).

The interaction between FVIIa and TF also involves the γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing domain of FVIIa, which is essential for protein-protein interactions necessary for the optimal activation of factor X (FX) (Persson2001Substitution). The TF/FVIIa complex is the main initiator of coagulation, activating more TF-bound FVII and small amounts of FX and FIX, leading to thrombin generation (Persson2010Recombinant). These interactions are crucial for the recognition and activation of macromolecular substrates by the FVIIa-TF complex (Persson2001Substitution).
