# SLC2A14

## Overview
SLC2A14 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 2 member 14 (GLUT14), which is a member of the facilitated membrane glucose transporter family. This protein is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transporters, characterized by its role in the passive transport of glucose across cell membranes. GLUT14 shares a high degree of homology with GLUT3, suggesting a similar function in glucose transport, although its specific physiological roles remain to be fully elucidated (Amir2016The; Mueckler2013The). The gene is primarily expressed in the testis and brain, with additional expression in the small intestine, liver, and kidney, indicating potential specialized roles in these tissues (Amir2016The). SLC2A14 has been implicated in various diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, highlighting its clinical significance and the necessity for further research into its function and regulation (Infante2015Identification).

## Structure
The SLC2A14 gene encodes the GLUT14 protein, a member of the facilitated membrane glucose transporter family. The primary structure of GLUT14 is highly homologous to GLUT3, suggesting a similar function in glucose transport (Amir2016The). The protein is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transporters, characterized by 12 transmembrane spans built from a replicated trimer substructure (Holman2020Structure). This structure facilitates the transport of substrates like hexoses and myo-inositol.

The SLC2A14 gene exhibits tissue-specific exon utilization and alternative splicing, particularly in the 5' region. In testicular tissue, exons five to nine are utilized, and exon ten serves as a major alternative transcriptional start site. The shorter isoform skips exon eleven, creating a start codon in exon ten, while the longer isoform uses a start codon in exon eleven (Amir2016The). These splice variants may alter the protein's structure and function.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are common in class 1 GLUTs, including GLUT14, and affect their detection in experiments (Holman2020Structure). The protein's quaternary structure details are less defined, but it may involve interactions with other proteins or forming homodimers.

## Function
The SLC2A14 gene encodes the GLUT14 protein, a member of the facilitated membrane glucose transporter family, which is involved in the transport of glucose across cell membranes. GLUT14 is homologous to GLUT3, suggesting it may have a similar function in glucose transport, although this has not been experimentally confirmed (Amir2016The). The gene is primarily expressed in the testis and brain, with significant expression also observed in the small intestine, liver, and kidney (Amir2016The). 

GLUT14 is a class 1 glucose transporter, sharing 95% sequence identity with GLUT3, indicating it may have arisen from a gene duplication event (Mueckler2013The). The protein is part of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transporters, which facilitate the passive movement of glucose down concentration gradients, crucial for maintaining blood glucose levels and supporting cellular metabolic processes (Holman2020Structure). 

The SLC2A14 gene exhibits tissue-specific expression and alternative splicing, particularly in the brain and testicular tissues, which may indicate specialized roles in these areas (Amir2016The). Despite its potential importance, the specific physiological substrates and functions of GLUT14 in healthy human cells remain largely uncharacterized (Mueckler2013The).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC2A14 gene, encoding the glucose transporter GLUT14, has been implicated in several diseases due to its role in glucose metabolism. Alterations in SLC2A14 expression have been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in SLC2A14 has been linked to AD pathology, suggesting that changes in glucose transport may contribute to neurodegenerative processes (Infante2015Identification). 

In the context of Parkinson's disease (PD), SLC2A14 has been identified as a candidate gene through blood transcriptome analysis. The gene showed differential expression in both idiopathic and LRRK2-associated forms of PD, indicating its potential involvement in PD pathogenesis related to glucose metabolism and oxidative stress (Infante2015Identification).

In Turner Syndrome (TS), a copy number polymorphism (CNP) involving SLC2A14 has been associated with left-sided heart lesions and an increased risk of acute aortic dissection. This suggests that SLC2A14 may act as a genetic modifier influencing cardiovascular risk in TS (Prakash2016Autosomal).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of SLC2A14 in various conditions, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its role in disease mechanisms.
