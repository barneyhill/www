# TMEM200B

## Overview
TMEM200B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 200B, which is part of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling and transport. The TMEM200B protein is implicated in several biological pathways and may have significant roles in cellular communication and homeostasis. Although the specific functions of TMEM200B are not fully elucidated, its involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway suggests a potential role in cellular growth and differentiation (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is necessary to fully understand the diverse functions and clinical implications of TMEM200B.
