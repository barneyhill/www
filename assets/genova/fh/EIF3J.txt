# EIF3J

## Overview
The EIF3J gene encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit J, a critical component of the eIF3 complex, which is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The protein encoded by EIF3J is involved in the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex and plays a pivotal role in mRNA recruitment to the ribosome, acting as a regulatory checkpoint to ensure that translation initiation occurs only when all necessary components are present (Merrick2018Protein). EIF3J interacts with the 40S ribosomal subunit, particularly influencing the start-site selection and preventing leaky scanning, which underscores its importance in maintaining the fidelity of translation initiation (Brito2020Structure). Additionally, EIF3J is implicated in ribosome recycling, further highlighting its role in the efficient and accurate synthesis of proteins (Valášek2017Embraced).

## Structure
The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit J (EIF3J) is a component of the eIF3 complex, which plays a significant role in the initiation of protein synthesis. EIF3J is known to interact with the 40S ribosomal subunit, particularly near the decoding center, where it may influence start-site selection and prevent leaky scanning (Brito2020Structure). The N-terminal domain (NTD) of EIF3J interacts with ribosomal proteins eS30, uS12, and 18S rRNA, while its C-terminal domain bridges the head and body of the 40S subunit by interacting with rRNA h34 (Brito2020Structure).

Although detailed atomic resolution structures of EIF3J are not available, its C-terminal segment has been mapped to the A-site and the mRNA entry channel of the 40S subunit, suggesting direct contact with the ribosomal decoding center (Fraser2007Quantitative). EIF3J is described as a loosely attached subunit within the eIF3 complex, located near the mRNA exit (Bakti2024Assembly). The interaction between EIF3J and other eIF3 subunits, as well as its role in ribosome recycling, is facilitated by its association with ABCE1, an ATPase involved in ribosome recycling (Brito2020Structure). Specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of EIF3J are not provided in the available literature.

## Function
EIF3J, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, plays a significant role in the initiation phase of protein synthesis in human cells. It is involved in the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) and aids in the recruitment of mRNA to the ribosome. EIF3J is loosely associated with other eIF3 subunits and enhances the affinity of interactions among the 43S components, contributing to the stability of the PIC (Merrick2018Protein). 

In the context of translation initiation, EIF3J is thought to regulate mRNA recruitment by impairing mRNA binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit unless the ternary complex (TC) is present. This suggests that EIF3J acts as a checkpoint to ensure mRNA is only recruited when necessary components are available, thus playing a role in the precise regulation of translation initiation (Merrick2018Protein). 

EIF3J is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to efficient translation initiation, impacting cellular growth and proliferation. Its role in translation termination and ribosomal recycling further underscores its importance in maintaining the fidelity and efficiency of protein synthesis (Valášek2017Embraced).

## Interactions
EIF3J, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, participates in several critical interactions that facilitate translation initiation. In yeast, EIF3J interacts with the RNA recognition motif (RRM) in eIF3b, specifically through a putative RNP1 element, which is essential for the proper binding of eIF3 to the 40S ribosomal subunit (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:). This interaction is crucial for maintaining wild-type 40S binding by eIF3, highlighting EIF3J's role in stabilizing the eIF3 complex on the ribosome.

In humans, EIF3J's association with the eIF3 complex is enhanced by mitogenic activation of T lymphocytes, which correlates with increased 40S binding by eIF3 and protein synthesis in activated T cells. This process appears to be linked to mTOR signaling, suggesting that EIF3J may play a role in translation regulation through mTOR pathways (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:).

EIF3J also engages in interactions with the 18S rRNA within 40S ribosomal complexes, indicating its involvement in ribosomal RNA interactions that are vital for translation initiation (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:). These interactions underscore EIF3J's multifaceted role in the assembly and function of the translation initiation machinery.
