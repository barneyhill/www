# OS9

## Overview
The OS9 gene encodes the OS9 endoplasmic reticulum lectin, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This protein is categorized as a lectin due to its ability to bind specific carbohydrate structures on glycoproteins. The OS9 protein is integral to the quality control system within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it identifies and targets misfolded glycoproteins for degradation, thus maintaining protein homeostasis. The protein's mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domain is essential for recognizing N-glycans with terminal α1,6-linked mannose, facilitating its role in the ERAD pathway (Christianson2008OS9; Mikami2009The). OS9's interactions with other ERAD components, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 and the scaffolding protein SEL1L, underscore its importance in the ubiquitination and retrotranslocation of misfolded proteins (Alcock2009Mammalian). Additionally, OS9 is implicated in broader cellular processes, including the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the degradation of hyperglycosylated proteins, highlighting its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis (Dersh2014OS9).

## Structure
The OS9 protein is characterized by its mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domain, which is crucial for its function in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This domain is involved in binding specific sugar structures on glycoproteins, particularly recognizing N-glycans with terminal α1,6-linked mannose (Mikami2009The). The MRH domain's sugar-binding specificity is similar to that of the yeast homolog Yos9p, although OS9 does not bind to mannose 6-phosphate (Mikami2009The).

OS9 is composed of two main domains: the MRH domain at the N-terminus and a C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain is intrinsically disordered, with a mixture of disordered peptide and α-helical structure, and is responsible for binding to the ER chaperone Grp94 (Seidler2014Characterization). The C-terminal extension (CTE) of OS9, despite having helical properties, shows poor conformational stability (Seidler2014Characterization).

OS9 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its interactions with other proteins (Seidler2014Characterization). The protein has multiple isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, which can affect its function and interactions (Mikami2009The).

## Function
The human gene OS9 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident lectin that plays a critical role in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. OS9 is involved in the quality control of glycoproteins by recognizing and binding to misfolded proteins, particularly those with specific N-glycan structures, through its mannose-6-phosphate receptor homology (MRH) domain (Ward2017The; Mikami2009The). This binding is essential for targeting these proteins for degradation, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis within the ER (Christianson2008OS9).

OS9 functions at an early step in the ERAD pathway, where it interacts with components of the ERAD machinery, such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 and the scaffolding protein SEL1L, to facilitate the ubiquitination and retrotranslocation of misfolded glycoproteins (Christianson2008OS9; Alcock2009Mammalian). The protein is upregulated in response to ER stress, indicating its role in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and its importance in adjusting the ERAD capacity according to cellular needs (Alcock2009Mammalian).

OS9 also plays a role in the degradation of hyperglycosylated proteins, such as GRP94, through a mechanism that may be independent of the proteasome and ERAD pathways, suggesting a lysosomal-like process (Dersh2014OS9). This highlights OS9's involvement in broader protein quality control processes within the ER.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the OS9 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB), OS9 plays a crucial role in the degradation of mutant neuroserpin, a process that is essential for preventing the accumulation of neuroserpin aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression of OS9 facilitates the clearance of these aggregates, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding (Schipanski2014The).

In the context of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), OS9 expression is regulated by the long non-coding RNA ENST00000480739. Higher levels of OS9 are associated with better patient survival outcomes, indicating that OS9 may act as a tumor suppressor. The loss of OS9 expression is linked to PDAC progression, advanced TNM stage, and metastasis, suggesting its role in inhibiting tumor invasion and metastasis (Sun2014A).

OS9 is also involved in the degradation of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the kidney. This interaction is significant for blood pressure regulation, and alterations in OS9 function could contribute to conditions like Bartter syndrome type 1, characterized by electrolyte imbalances and arterial hypotension (Seaayfan2016OS9).

## Interactions
OS9, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lectin, is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway and interacts with several proteins to facilitate the degradation of misfolded proteins. OS9 binds to ERAD substrates and interacts with the SEL1L adaptor protein, which connects it to the ER membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. This interaction is crucial for the degradation of misfolded proteins, such as mutant α1-antitrypsin (Christianson2008OS9). OS9 also associates with the ER chaperone GRP94, which is essential for the degradation process, and this interaction is independent of SEL1L, Hrd1, or XTP3-B (Christianson2008OS9; Seidler2014Characterization).

OS9 interacts with the immature forms of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) and the NaCl cotransporter (NCC), targeting them for ERAD (Seaayfan2016OS9). It also binds to the intracellular tail of meprin β, suggesting a role in ER-to-Golgi transport (Litovchick2002A). Additionally, OS9 interacts with the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), targeting its immature form (Ward2017The). These interactions highlight OS9's role in protein quality control and its involvement in various cellular processes.
