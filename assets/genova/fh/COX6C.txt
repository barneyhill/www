# COX6C

## Overview
Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6C (COX6C) is a gene that encodes a protein subunit of cytochrome c oxidase, also known as Complex IV, which is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This protein is integral to the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in cellular respiration by facilitating the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a critical step in ATP production (Dhar2013Bigenomic). As a component of the electron transport chain, COX6C is essential for energy metabolism in cells. The expression of COX6C is regulated by various transcription factors, including Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF-1) and Specificity protein 1 (Sp1), as well as microRNAs, which modulate its role in cellular responses to stress and infection (Dhar2008Nuclear; Othumpangat2014Lung). COX6C is involved in the assembly and function of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, interacting with other subunits to form a functional holoenzyme (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial). Its expression and interactions have clinical significance, being implicated in various diseases, including cardiovascular and kidney diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders (Wang2022Novel; Bi2018Genetic).

## Function
COX6C encodes a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), which is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme complex is crucial for cellular respiration as it facilitates the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, a critical step in ATP production. COX6C is active in the inner mitochondrial membrane, contributing to energy metabolism in cells (Dhar2013Bigenomic).

The regulation of COX6C is influenced by several transcription factors. Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF-1) plays a significant role in the transcriptional regulation of COX6C by binding to its promoter, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy production in neurons (Dhar2008Nuclear). Specificity protein 1 (Sp1) also regulates COX6C expression by binding to its promoter, affecting the transcription of all nucleus-encoded COX subunits, which are vital for the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Dhar2013Bigenomic).

In addition to transcriptional regulation, COX6C expression is modulated by microRNA, specifically miR-4276, which negatively regulates its expression. This regulation impacts cellular responses to influenza A infection, where higher COX6C expression correlates with reduced viral replication, suggesting a protective role against viral infection (Othumpangat2014Lung).

## Clinical Significance
The COX6C gene is implicated in various diseases through changes in its expression levels or interactions. In cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, COX6C is involved in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, with its downregulation linked to hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis (Wang2022Novel). In kidney diseases, particularly diabetic nephropathy, COX6C expression is elevated, suggesting its role in the OXPHOS pathway's contribution to the disease. Conversely, in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis, COX6C expression is downregulated, correlating with reduced OXPHOS activity and increased oxidative stress (Wang2022Novel).

In cancer, COX6C is associated with several types, including prostate, breast, and gastric cancers. In prostate cancer, its mRNA expression is upregulated in tumor tissues, potentially serving as a marker for energy metabolism alterations in cancer cells (Wang2022Novel). In breast cancer, COX6C is linked to chemoresistance, aiding in drug resistance by maintaining mitochondrial function and ATP production (Wang2022Novel). Additionally, COX6C expression is decreased in Alzheimer's disease, particularly in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, which are the most affected brain regions in the disease (Bi2018Genetic).

## Interactions
COX6C, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), is involved in several interactions within the COX complex. It interacts with COX2 and COX5A, contributing to the formation of the COX holoenzyme or Complex IV (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial). COX6C is part of an intermediate assembly group that includes MT-CO1, MT-CO2, COX5B, COX7C, and COX8A, indicating its role in the modular assembly of COX. This group is incorporated into the COX complex before MT-CO3, suggesting physical interactions among these proteins during assembly (Vidoni2017MR1S).

In yeast, COX6C is part of a high molecular weight assembly intermediate that includes Cox7, Cox7a, and Cox8, associated with the chaperone Pet100. The absence of Pet100 disrupts the interaction of this subcomplex with other subassemblies (TimónGómez2018Mitochondrial). COX6C is also involved in transcriptional regulation interactions within a transcription factory, where it interacts with other COX subunit genes, such as COX4i1 and COX8a, in a coordinated manner (Dhar2009Chromosome). These interactions are crucial for the precise regulation of COX subunit gene expression, which is essential for maintaining oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial ATP generation.
