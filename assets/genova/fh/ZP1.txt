# ZP1

## Overview
ZP1, or zona pellucida glycoprotein 1, is a gene that encodes a crucial glycoprotein component of the zona pellucida, an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte in mammals. The ZP1 protein plays a vital role in the structural integrity and function of the zona pellucida, which is essential for oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development. As a glycoprotein, ZP1 is involved in forming a three-dimensional matrix by crosslinking filaments composed of other zona pellucida proteins, such as ZP2 and ZP3, thereby facilitating sperm-oocyte recognition and preventing polyspermy (Cao2020Heterozygous; Xu2020A). The protein's structure includes a ZP domain, which is critical for its polymerization and interaction with spermatozoa, inducing the acrosome reaction necessary for fertilization (Ganguly2010“ZP). Mutations in the ZP1 gene are linked to reproductive disorders, highlighting its significance in fertility (Dai2019ZP1).

## Structure
The ZP1 protein is a key component of the zona pellucida, characterized by its complex molecular structure. It is synthesized as a 623-amino-acid polypeptide and undergoes glycosylation, with both asparagine-linked and serine/threonine-linked oligosaccharides (Litscher2020Zona). The primary structure of ZP1 includes a signal sequence at the N terminus, a ZP domain (ZPD) with ZP-N and ZP-C subdomains, a trefoil domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (IzquierdoRico2009Hamster; Litscher2020Zona).

The secondary structure of ZP1 features polyproline type II (PPII) helices in its proline-rich regions, contributing to the protein's flexibility and elasticity (Litscher2020Zona). The ZP-N and ZP-C subdomains adopt immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich folds, crucial for the protein's polymerization and structural integrity (Litscher2020Zona; Louros2013Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, the ZP-N subdomain contains an antiparallel β-sheet sandwich with disulfide bonds, while the ZP-C subdomain has a similar β-sandwich structure (Litscher2020Zona). The quaternary structure involves ZP1 forming a homodimer through disulfide bonds, which may cross-link ZP fibrils (Litscher2020Zona). The protein's amyloid-like properties facilitate the formation of unbranched fibrils, contributing to the zona pellucida's structural integrity (Litscher2020Zona).

## Function
The ZP1 gene encodes a glycoprotein that is a critical component of the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein matrix surrounding the plasma membrane of mammalian oocytes. In healthy human cells, ZP1 plays a significant role in the structural integrity and function of the zona pellucida, which is essential for oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryonic development (Xu2020A). ZP1 functions by covalently crosslinking ZP filaments, primarily composed of ZP2 and ZP3, into a three-dimensional matrix. This matrix forms a firm extracellular coat that is crucial for safeguarding oocyte development and ensuring proper oocyte-sperm recognition, which is vital for preventing polyspermy (Xu2020A).

ZP1 interacts with other zona pellucida proteins, such as ZP2, ZP3, and ZP4, to form long filaments essential for the assembly of the zona pellucida. This structure plays a significant role in fertilization processes, including sperm-oocyte recognition, binding, and fusion (Cao2020Heterozygous). The ZP1 protein is involved in forming the zona pellucida by crosslinking long filaments of zona pellucida proteins, which are secreted by growing oocytes (Huang2014Mutant). The presence of ZP1 is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the zona pellucida, which is necessary for successful oocyte development and fertility (Xu2020A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZP1 gene are associated with several reproductive disorders, primarily affecting female fertility. One significant condition linked to ZP1 mutations is Empty Follicle Syndrome (EFS), characterized by the failure to retrieve oocytes during assisted reproductive procedures despite normal ovarian reserves and hormone levels. Studies have identified various mutations in the ZP1 gene, including homozygous and compound-heterozygous variants, which often lead to truncated proteins or trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, disrupting the normal function of the zona pellucida (Dai2019ZP1; Xu2020A).

ZP1 mutations can also result in genuine empty follicle syndrome (GEFS) and oocyte degeneration. These mutations affect the expression and transportation of zona pellucida proteins, leading to disrupted communication between oocytes and cumulus cells, contributing to oocyte degeneration and empty follicles (Yang2021The). Additionally, ZP1 mutations have been linked to oocyte maturation defects, where oocytes fail to reach the metaphase II stage during in vitro fertilization cycles (Okutman2020Homozygous).

The clinical implications of ZP1 mutations underscore the importance of genetic screening for individuals experiencing infertility, as these mutations can significantly impact oocyte development and fertilization processes (Yuan2019Novel).

## Interactions
ZP1 (zona pellucida glycoprotein 1) is a crucial component of the zona pellucida, an extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte. It interacts with other zona pellucida proteins, such as ZP2 and ZP3, to form a structural matrix essential for oocyte protection and sperm binding during fertilization. In humans, the ZP domain of ZP1 has been shown to bind to the acrosomal cap of capacitated spermatozoa, inducing acrosomal exocytosis, a critical step in fertilization (Ganguly2010“ZP). This interaction is facilitated by the presence of both N- and O-linked glycosylation on ZP1, which is necessary for its binding to sperm and the subsequent acrosome reaction (Ganguly2010“ZP).

In Japanese quail, ZP1 interacts specifically with ZPC, another zona pellucida protein, to form the perivitelline membrane, which is analogous to the mammalian zona pellucida. This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of the membrane, as ZP1 and ZPC co-precipitate, indicating a specific binding relationship (Ohtsuki2004Involvement). The interaction between ZP1 and ZPC is essential for the formation of insoluble fibers in the perivitelline membrane, which is necessary for successful fertilization (Ohtsuki2004Involvement).
