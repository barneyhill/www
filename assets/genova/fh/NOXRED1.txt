# NOXRED1

## Overview
NOXRED1 is a gene that encodes the protein NADP dependent oxidoreductase domain containing 1, which is categorized as an oxidoreductase enzyme. This protein is integral to cellular redox reactions, utilizing NADP as a cofactor to facilitate these processes. It is primarily localized in the mitochondria, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular redox balance and energy production. The protein is involved in the conversion of glutamine to glutamate and subsequently to proline, a critical pathway for cellular growth and metabolism (Chen2019Genetic). Additionally, NOXRED1 is implicated in the cellular response to oxidative stress, helping to regulate the redox state of cells and prevent oxidative damage, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yuan2021BrainSpecific). The gene's function is essential for normal cellular operations, and its dysregulation may contribute to various disease states.

## Function
NOXRED1 (NADP dependent oxidoreductase domain containing 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in redox reactions, utilizing NADP as a cofactor. This protein plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular redox balance and energy production, primarily through its activity in the mitochondria. In healthy human cells, NOXRED1 is involved in the conversion of glutamine to glutamate and subsequently to proline, a process essential for cellular growth and metabolism (Chen2019Genetic). This conversion is part of the glutamine metabolism pathway, which is vital for various cellular functions, including energy production and the synthesis of other amino acids.

NOXRED1 is also implicated in the cellular response to oxidative stress, a condition where there is an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the ability of the body to counteract their harmful effects. By participating in oxidoreductase activity, NOXRED1 helps to regulate the redox state of cells, which is crucial for preventing oxidative damage and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Yuan2021BrainSpecific). The protein's activity in these processes underscores its importance in cellular health and its potential impact on disease states when dysregulated.
