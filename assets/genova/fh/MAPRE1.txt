# MAPRE1

## Overview
MAPRE1 is a gene that encodes the microtubule-associated protein RP/EB family member 1, commonly referred to as EB1. This protein is integral to the regulation of microtubule dynamics, playing a pivotal role in cellular processes such as cell division, migration, and intracellular transport. EB1 is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein and is primarily localized at the growing ends of microtubules, where it facilitates their stabilization and organization. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor and the dynein/dynactin complex, underscore its importance in maintaining cell structure and function. Dysregulation of MAPRE1 expression has been implicated in various cancers, including colorectal, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and progression (RodriguesFerreira2018Combinatorial; Liang2020MAPRE1; Askham2002Evidence).

## Structure
MAPRE1, also known as EB1, is a protein involved in microtubule dynamics. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the MAPRE1 gene. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The protein's tertiary structure is characterized by a calponin homology (CH) domain and an EB1 domain, which facilitate microtubule binding and interactions with other proteins. MAPRE1 can form homodimers, representing its quaternary structure. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation can regulate its activity. Splice variants may exist, altering its functional properties.

## Function
MAPRE1, also known as EB1, is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a critical role in microtubule dynamics and organization in healthy human cells. It is primarily active at the growing ends of microtubules during interphase and localizes to centrosomes and spindle microtubules during mitosis (Liang2020MAPRE1). EB1 is essential for the formation and maintenance of a radial microtubule array anchored at the centrosome, which is crucial for proper cell division and intracellular transport (Askham2002Evidence).

EB1 interacts with several proteins, including the APC tumor suppressor and components of the dynein/dynactin complex, such as p150 Glued. These interactions are vital for microtubule minus end anchoring at centrosomes and for the recruitment of γ-tubulin and p150 Glued to centrosomes (Askham2002Evidence). The protein's N-terminus is necessary for microtubule association, while the C-terminal regions are important for its localization at microtubule tips and centrosomes (Askham2002Evidence).

EB1's role in microtubule stabilization and organization is essential for cellular processes such as migration and division. It contributes to the stabilization and bundling of microtubules, which are resistant to depolymerizing agents, indicating its importance in maintaining cell structure and function (Askham2002Evidence).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MAPRE1 gene, which encodes the microtubule-associated protein EB1, have been implicated in several types of cancer. In colorectal cancer, EB1 is up-regulated early in carcinogenesis, with increased expression observed in adenomas and adenocarcinomas compared to normal colon tissues. This up-regulation occurs independently of APC mutations, suggesting a role in early colorectal carcinogenesis and field carcinogenesis (StypulaCyrus2014End‐binding).

In breast cancer, high levels of MAPRE1 expression are associated with increased tumor malignancy and higher tumor grades. The combinatorial expression of MAPRE1 and MTUS1 has been shown to improve the molecular classification and prognosis of breast cancer, with high MAPRE1 and low MTUS1 expression correlating with poorer survival outcomes (RodriguesFerreira2018Combinatorial).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MAPRE1 is significantly overexpressed, correlating with worse clinical outcomes such as overall survival and relapse-free survival. Its overexpression promotes cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, highlighting its critical role in HCC progression (Liang2020MAPRE1; Dong2016Identifying). EB1's involvement in cell migration, proliferation, and cytoskeleton organization further underscores its potential as a prognostic biomarker in HCC (Orimo2008Proteomic).

## Interactions
MAPRE1, also known as EB1, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in microtubule dynamics and cellular processes. EB1 interacts with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein, a relationship confirmed both in vitro and in vivo, which is significant for microtubule dynamics, cell polarity, and chromosome stability (Fu2005MLL; Su2001Characterization). EB1 also associates with the dynactin complex, which is involved in microtubule-based transport, and interacts with the intermediate chain of cytoplasmic dynein, indicating its role in microtubule dynamics and cell cycle regulation (Liang2020MAPRE1).

In the context of cancer, EB1 interacts with the ATIP3 protein, encoded by the MTUS1 gene, which acts as an antagonist to EB1 by stabilizing microtubules and reducing tumor growth and metastasis (RodriguesFerreira2018Combinatorial). In colon cancer, EB1 interacts with FAM134B, a protein that modulates the WNT/β-catenin pathway, impacting tumorigenic properties (Islam2018Protein). Additionally, EB1 is a potential binding partner of the classical swine fever virus nonstructural protein p7, suggesting a role in the virus's interaction with host cellular machinery (Fan2020The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of MAPRE1 in cellular and pathological processes.
