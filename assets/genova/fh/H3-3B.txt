# H3-3B

## Overview
The H3-3B gene encodes the H3.3 histone B protein, a variant of the canonical histone H3, which plays a pivotal role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. Unlike its canonical counterparts, H3.3 is incorporated into chromatin independently of DNA replication, allowing it to be deposited at active chromatin regions throughout the cell cycle. This replication-independent deposition is facilitated by specific chaperone proteins, such as HIRA, ATRX, and DAXX, which target H3.3 to particular genomic regions, including telomeres and pericentromeric heterochromatin (Klein2023Knockout; Filipescu2014Histone). The H3.3 protein is characterized by its unique amino acid sequence, which allows for various post-translational modifications that influence chromatin structure and gene transcription (Kumar2021Genes). These features make H3.3 essential for maintaining chromatin accessibility, transcriptional activation, and genomic stability, thereby playing a critical role in cellular function and integrity (Bryant2020Histone).

## Structure
The H3-3B gene encodes the H3.3 histone protein, which is a variant of the canonical histone H3. The H3.3 protein consists of 136 amino acids, with specific differences from the canonical H3.1 and H3.2 at positions 31, 87, 89, 90, and 96 (Kumar2021Genes). These differences contribute to its unique properties, such as its incorporation into chromatin independently of DNA replication (Szenker2011The).

The primary structure of H3.3 includes a histone tail and a histone fold domain, which is crucial for its interaction with DNA and other histones to form nucleosomes (Bryant2020Histone). The secondary structure of H3.3 features four α helices and two loop domains, which are typical of histone proteins (Bryant2020Histone).

H3.3 is subject to various post-translational modifications, including acetylation and methylation, which influence chromatin structure and gene transcription (Kumar2021Genes). These modifications occur on lysine residues and are associated with active chromatin states (Szenker2011The). The protein's structure allows it to be incorporated into chromatin in a DNA synthesis-independent manner, making it prevalent in actively transcribed regions (Szenker2011The).

## Function
The H3-3B gene encodes the histone variant H3.3, which plays a crucial role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation in healthy human cells. H3.3 is incorporated into chromatin independently of DNA replication, allowing it to be deposited at active chromatin regions throughout the cell cycle. This replication-independent deposition is facilitated by chaperone proteins such as HIRA, ATRX, and DAXX, which target H3.3 to specific genomic regions, including telomeres and pericentromeric heterochromatin (Klein2023Knockout; Filipescu2014Histone).

H3.3 is associated with transcriptionally active genes and is enriched at transcription start sites, playing a significant role in transcriptional activation and maintaining chromatin accessibility (Goldberg2010Distinct; Hake2006Histone). It is also involved in maintaining genome integrity by regulating chromatin structure and facilitating DNA repair processes (Klein2023Knockout). The presence of H3.3 at regulatory regions helps to mark these areas for active transcription, contributing to the regulation of gene expression and ensuring proper cell function (Bryant2020Histone). Overall, H3.3 is essential for chromatin organization, gene expression, and genomic stability in human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the H3-3B gene, which encodes the histone variant H3.3, have been linked to a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Germline mutations in H3-3B are associated with a previously unidentified neurodegenerative disorder characterized by developmental delay, neurodegeneration, epilepsy, and facial dysmorphism. These mutations lead to epigenetic dysregulation, affecting chromatin state and gene expression, and are distinct from those typically associated with cancer (Bryant2020Histone).

The mutations in H3-3B can disrupt nucleosome stability and protein interactions, resulting in a generalized loosening of chromatin structure. This disruption impacts processes that require the incorporation of H3.3 into the nucleosome, leading to clinical manifestations such as developmental delay, hypotonia, poor growth, oculomotor abnormalities, seizures, abnormal skull shape, and microcephaly (Bryant2020Histone).

In addition to neurodevelopmental disorders, mutations in H3-3B have been implicated in various cancers, including pediatric gliomas and chondroblastoma. These mutations can alter methylation and gene expression, contributing to tumor progression and treatment resistance (Di2023Involvement; Kumar2021Genes).

## Interactions
The H3-3B gene encodes the histone variant H3.3, which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. H3.3 specifically interacts with the death-associated protein DAXX, which acts as a histone chaperone facilitating the replication-independent deposition of H3.3 onto DNA. This interaction is essential for targeting H3.3 to PML nuclear bodies and pericentric DNA repeats, influencing transcription from these regions (Drané2010The). DAXX forms a stable complex with H3.3, preventing its association with the CAF-1 chaperone, which is specific for H3.1 (Drané2010The).

H3.3 also interacts with ATRX, an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor. The ATRX-DAXX complex is involved in chromatin remodeling and H3.3 deposition, particularly at telomeres, where it plays a significant role in the replication-independent chromatin assembly of H3.3 (Lewis2010Daxx; Goldberg2010Distinct). In the absence of DAXX, other chaperones such as NASP and CAF-1 can bind H3.3, indicating alternative pathways for its deposition (Drané2010The). These interactions highlight the specific role of H3.3 in chromatin dynamics and its regulation through various protein complexes.
