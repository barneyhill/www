# PIGU

## Overview
The PIGU gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class U protein, a critical component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex. This protein is integral to the biogenesis of GPI-anchored proteins, which are essential for various cellular functions, including signal transduction and membrane stability. PIGU is characterized as a transmembrane protein, featuring a unique structure with 12 transmembrane helices that facilitate its role in the assembly and stabilization of the GPI transamidase complex (Xu2022Molecular). The protein's function is vital for the proper attachment of GPI anchors to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, impacting the expression of over 150 GPI-anchored proteins (Knaus2019Mutations). Mutations in the PIGU gene can lead to glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis deficiencies, resulting in various clinical manifestations, including intellectual disabilities and cancer (Knaus2019Mutations; Cao2019PIGU).

## Structure
The PIGU protein is a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which plays a crucial role in the biogenesis of GPI-anchored proteins. Structurally, PIGU features a membrane core region composed of 12 transmembrane helices (TMHs) arranged into two concentric rings. The outer ring interacts with the transmembrane domains of other subunits, while the inner ring contains six short TMHs that create a hydrophobic void to attract amphipathic helices (Xu2022Molecular). This arrangement results in a surface with electrostatically negative dipole moments and acidic residues, contributing to the protein's function in the GPI-T complex (Xu2022Molecular).

PIGU's structure facilitates its role as a docking base for PIGT, aiding in the assembly and stabilization of the GPI-T complex. The protein's transmembrane domain is involved in forming a composite GPI-binding site, crucial for the anchoring process (Xu2022Molecular). Specific residues, such as F274 and W275 in the amphipathic helix 5 (AH5) of PIGU, are proposed to be important for GPI-binding, although they are located distally from the composite GPI-binding site (Xu2022Molecular).

## Function
The PIGU gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is essential for the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Knaus2019Mutations). This complex is responsible for linking GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) to the cell membrane, a process vital for the proper functioning of over 150 proteins involved in various cellular activities, including neuronal development and signal transduction (Knaus2019Mutations). The GPI transamidase complex is a heteropentameric structure composed of PIGK, PIGS, PIGT, GPAA1, and PIGU, with PIGU being the last component to associate with the core protein complex. It is believed to present the GPI lipid anchor to the transamidase complex in a productive conformation (Knaus2019Mutations).

In healthy cells, PIGU ensures the proper attachment of GPI-APs to the cell membrane, which is crucial for various cellular functions, including maintaining membrane stability and facilitating cell signaling (Knaus2019Mutations). The absence or malfunction of PIGU can lead to a reduction in the expression of GPI-APs on the cell surface, affecting cellular processes and leading to various disorders (Knaus2019Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGU gene are associated with glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis deficiencies (GPIBDs), which can lead to severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, brain anomalies, muscular hypotonia, scoliosis, and mild facial dysmorphism. These conditions are due to the impaired function of the GPI transamidase complex, which is crucial for anchoring proteins to the cell surface. Specific homozygous missense mutations, such as c.209T>A (p.Ile70Lys) and c.1149C>A (p.Asn383Lys), have been identified in individuals from different families, all presenting with these symptoms (Knaus2019Mutations).

In cancer, PIGU is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is associated with poor survival outcomes. Its overexpression provides prognostic information and can enhance the TNM staging system for HCC patients. PIGU has also been implicated in other cancers, such as bladder and prostate cancer, where it promotes oncogenic activities (Cao2019PIGU).

In colorectal cancer, PIGU is identified as a hub gene associated with KRAS mutations. It is significantly downregulated in KRAS mutant colorectal cancers, correlating with poor prognosis and tumor progression (Zhang2020Identification).

## Interactions
PIGU is a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex, which is crucial for the attachment of GPI anchors to proteins. Within this complex, PIGU interacts with other subunits such as PIGT, GPAA1, PIGK, and PIGS. PIGU and PIGT form a platform for the assembly of the GPI transamidase complex in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. PIGU's structure, featuring 12 transmembrane helices arranged into two concentric rings, facilitates interactions with the transmembrane domains of other subunits, creating a hydrophobic void that attracts amphipathic helices. This structural arrangement allows PIGU to recruit and stabilize other subunits, maximizing interaction surfaces and contributing to the structural integrity and function of the complex (Xu2022Molecular).

PIGU's interactions are essential for the docking of PIGT and the positioning of PIGK, which is important for substrate specificity. These interactions involve electrostatic complementation and hydrophobic interactions, enhancing the stability and activity of the GPI transamidase complex (Xu2022Molecular). Mutations in PIGU can impair the function of the GPI transamidase complex, leading to a reduction in the expression of GPI-anchored proteins and associated phenotypic effects (Knaus2019Mutations).
