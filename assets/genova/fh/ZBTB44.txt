# ZBTB44

## Overview
ZBTB44 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 44, which is a member of the zinc finger protein family. These proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate binding to DNA, and a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-Ã -brac) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions. The ZBTB44 protein is implicated in transcriptional regulation, where it may act as a transcriptional repressor or activator depending on the context. This protein plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation and proliferation, by modulating the expression of target genes. The precise biological functions and mechanisms of ZBTB44 are still under investigation, and its involvement in specific signaling pathways or diseases remains to be fully elucidated (Qiu2020aarFDC).
