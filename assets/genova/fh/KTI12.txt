# KTI12

## Overview
KTI12 is a gene that encodes the KTI12 chromatin-associated homolog, a regulatory protein involved in the modification of tRNA within the Elongator complex. This protein is characterized by its ATPase activity, which is crucial for its role in tRNA modification, particularly in the wobble positions of uridine bases, thereby influencing translation accuracy and efficiency (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12; Smejda2021Same). The KTI12 protein is composed of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain with ATPase activity and a C-terminal domain involved in tRNA binding (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12). It interacts with several components of the Elongator complex, such as ELP1, ELP2, and ELP3, and is implicated in various cellular processes, including transcriptional elongation and neuronal differentiation (Smejda2021Same). Alterations in KTI12 expression or function have been linked to neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12; Smejda2021Same).

## Structure
The KTI12 protein is a highly conserved eukaryotic protein composed of two distinct domains connected by a flexible linker. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of KTI12 contains a typical ATPase signature, characterized by a globular ATPase domain with five parallel β-sheets and eight α-helices surrounding a hydrophobic core. This domain includes a canonical P-loop motif, which is crucial for its ATPase activity (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12). The C-terminal domain (CTD) lacks an assigned enzymatic motif but is involved in tRNA binding, similar to the O-phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase (PSTK) (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12).

KTI12 remains monomeric in solution, unlike PSTK, which forms dimers (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12). The protein's ATPase activity is tRNA-dependent, specifically induced by tRNA Sec, and is essential for the Elongator complex's function in tRNA modification (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12). The structure of KTI12 is similar to PSTK, suggesting a shared evolutionary origin, although they do not share biological functions (Smejda2021Same). The protein's structure includes a nucleotide-binding pocket and a p-loop, with the K14 residue located in the p-loop, which is critical for ATPase activity (Krutyhołowa2020Fungal).

## Function
The KTI12 gene encodes a protein that functions as a regulatory factor within the Elongator complex, which is crucial for the modification of uridine bases in eukaryotic tRNAs. This modification is essential for the proper functioning of tRNA, particularly in the wobble positions, which affects translation accuracy and efficiency (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12; Smejda2021Same). KTI12 interacts with components of the Elongator complex, such as ELP1, ELP2, and ELP3, and this interaction is independent of its ATPase activity (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12; Smejda2021Same).

KTI12 is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional elongation and tRNA modification, and plays a role in neuronal differentiation, expansion, and survival (Smejda2021Same). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, with a minor fraction in the nucleus, suggesting its involvement in both cytoplasmic and nuclear processes (Smejda2021Same). KTI12's ATPase activity is triggered by tRNA binding, particularly with tRNA Sec, which enhances its enzymatic function (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12).

The proper regulation of the Elongator complex by KTI12 is linked to various human diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and organismal health (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12; Smejda2021Same).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the KTI12 gene have been associated with several human diseases, particularly severe neurological disorders and cancer. The KTI12 protein is a regulatory factor of the Elongator complex, which is crucial for modifying uridine bases in eukaryotic tRNAs. Disruptions in this modification process can lead to improper tRNA function, contributing to disease pathogenesis (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12; Smejda2021Same).

In cancer, the Elongator complex's role in neuronal differentiation and survival suggests that its inhibition could be a novel therapeutic approach. Specifically, targeting KTI12, which has a defined ATP binding pocket similar to protein kinases, may offer an alternative strategy for cancer treatment, particularly in combination with specific inhibitors to prevent resistant melanoma cell populations (Smejda2021Same).

KTI12 mutations can also disrupt its interaction with the Elongator complex, leading to phenotypes typical of tRNA modification defects. These defects are linked to altered metabolic profiles, indicating a potential connection between KTI12 function and metabolic regulation (Mehlgarten2017Use). The loss of U34 modifications in Elongator mutants is associated with various pathophysiologies, including neurodegenerative diseases (Krutyhołowa2020Fungal).

## Interactions
KTI12 is a regulatory protein that interacts with the Elongator complex, a multiprotein complex involved in tRNA modification. It directly interacts with the Elongator subunits ELP1, ELP2, and ELP3, with high confidence, and this interaction is conserved from yeast to humans (Smejda2021Same). KTI12's interaction with Elongator is independent of its ATPase activity, as both wild-type and ATPase-deficient mutants of KTI12 interact with Elongator at similar levels (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12).

KTI12 also interacts with the N-terminus of the Elp1 subunit, and this interaction is crucial for maintaining the phosphorylation patterns of Elp1, involving interactions with casein kinase 1 and protein phosphatase Sit4 (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12; Smejda2021Same). The protein's ATPase activity is tRNA-dependent and specifically induced by tRNA Sec, which is essential for its function in tRNA modification (Krutyhołowa2019Kti12).

Potential interactions with other proteins, such as MINDY-3, an ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase, have been identified, although direct interaction with KTI12 was not confirmed, suggesting an indirect interaction (Smejda2021Same). KTI12's interaction network includes proteins involved in vesicular transport, RNA metabolism, and deubiquitination (Smejda2021Same).
