# LGMN

## Overview
LGMN is a gene that encodes the protein legumain, a cysteine protease predominantly active in the lysosomes of human cells. Legumain is involved in the proteolytic processing of proteins, specifically cleaving peptide bonds at the carboxyl-terminal side of asparagine or aspartate residues, which is essential for the maturation of certain proteases and various cellular processes (Song2022The). It plays a significant role in the immune system by facilitating antigen processing for MHC class II presentation, thus aiding in immune response activation (Ozawa2019Legumain). Legumain is also implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, influencing the expression of structural proteins like collagen and fibronectin (Ozawa2019Legumain). The protein's activity is regulated by endogenous inhibitors, such as human type 2 cystatins, which modulate its function (Song2022The). LGMN's expression and activity are associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Robinson2024Enhanced; Khan2023Role).

## Structure


## Function
Legumain, encoded by the LGMN gene, is a cysteine protease primarily active in the lysosomes of healthy human cells. It is involved in the proteolytic processing of proteins, specifically cleaving peptide bonds at the carboxyl-terminal side of asparagine or aspartate residues (Song2022The). This activity is crucial for the maturation of certain proteases, such as cathepsins B, H, and L, which are important for various cellular processes (Song2022The).

In the immune system, legumain plays a significant role in antigen processing for MHC class II presentation, facilitating the activation of immune responses (Ozawa2019Legumain). It is abundantly expressed in various tissues, including the kidneys, placenta, spleen, and lymph nodes, and is less expressed in the nervous system (Song2022The). Legumain is initially synthesized as a proenzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum and becomes active in the acidic environment of lysosomes (Song2022The).

Legumain also contributes to extracellular matrix remodeling by influencing the expression of proteins such as collagen and fibronectin, which are essential for maintaining tissue structure and function (Ozawa2019Legumain). Its activity is regulated by endogenous inhibitors like human type 2 cystatins, which modulate its protease function (Song2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LGMN gene, which encodes the cysteine protease legumain, are implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In cancer, LGMN is overexpressed in several tumor types, including ovarian, breast, cervical, colon, prostate, and stomach cancers. High levels of LGMN expression correlate with advanced disease stages, increased cancer spread, and poor patient outcomes, as seen in ovarian and stomach cancers (Khan2023Role). LGMN promotes tumor invasion and metastasis by affecting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation and survival (Khan2023Role).

In glioblastoma, LGMN overexpression is associated with shorter patient survival and enhanced tumor progression. The LGMN pseudogene, LGMNP1, acts as a competitive endogenous RNA, sponging miR-495-3p and thereby increasing LGMN expression, which contributes to glioblastoma progression (Liao2020The).

In neurodegenerative diseases, enhanced LGMN activity is linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) associated with progranulin deficiency. This increased activity contributes to the pathological processing of TDP-43, a protein involved in neurodegeneration (Robinson2024Enhanced).

## Interactions
LGMN (legumain) is involved in various interactions with proteins that play significant roles in tumor development and progression. It interacts with integrins, such as integrin αvβ3 and integrin α5β1, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and endothelial cell permeability, which are crucial for tumor spread and metastasis (Shen2020Legumaindeficient; Khan2023Role). LGMN also forms complexes with matrix metalloproteinases, specifically MMP-2 and MMP-9, facilitating the breakdown and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, which supports cancer cell invasion and metastasis (Khan2023Role).

In the tumor microenvironment, LGMN is secreted into exosomes, which transport miRNA, mRNA, and proteins, promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis (Khan2023Role). It also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein P53, cleaving it and affecting its ability to inhibit oncogene transcription, thereby promoting tumor growth (Khan2023Role).

LGMN's interaction with integrin αvβ3 in tumor-associated macrophages affects STAT1 signaling, impacting tumor growth and cell senescence (Shen2020Legumaindeficient). These interactions highlight LGMN's role in the tumor microenvironment and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
