# PIN1

## Overview
The PIN1 gene encodes the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1, a pivotal enzyme involved in the regulation of protein function through the isomerization of phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motifs. This enzyme, categorized as a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, plays a crucial role in modulating protein conformation, thereby influencing protein stability, localization, and interaction dynamics. PIN1 is integral to various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, transcriptional control, and stress response, by interacting with key regulatory proteins such as cyclin D1, p53, and c-Myc (Hu2020Pinning; Liou2011Prolyl). The protein's activity is predominantly nuclear, where it facilitates mitotic regulation and mediates cellular responses to environmental stimuli (PolonioVallon2014ShaPINg). PIN1's dysregulation is implicated in several pathologies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (Maggio2023Role; Zannini2019Oncogenic).

## Structure
The PIN1 protein is characterized by its dual-domain structure, consisting of an N-terminal WW domain and a C-terminal peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) domain. The WW domain, spanning residues 1-39, is involved in protein-protein interactions and specifically binds to phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline (pS/T-P) motifs (Lee2022The). This domain is composed of a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Kowalski2002NMR). The PPIase domain, spanning residues 45-163, is responsible for the catalytic activity of the protein, facilitating the isomerization of peptide bonds (Lee2022The). It features a core β-sheet element composed of four antiparallel strands opposing an α-helix, forming a 'gripping hand' topology (Matena2018Structure).

The interaction between the WW and PPIase domains is mediated by a flexible linker, allowing for domain mobility and functional flexibility (Jacobs2003Peptide). The PPIase domain contains a catalytic tetrad, including Cys113, His59, His157, and Ser154, which coordinates the isomerization process (Lee2022The). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating PIN1's activity and interactions (Bayer2003Structural). The protein's structure is crucial for its role in cell cycle regulation and other cellular processes.

## Function
The PIN1 gene encodes a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase that plays a critical role in regulating protein function through the isomerization of phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motifs. This isomerization induces conformational changes in proteins, affecting their stability, localization, and interactions, which are crucial for various cellular processes (Hu2020Pinning; Liou2011Prolyl). PIN1 is involved in cell cycle regulation, particularly in the G1/S and G2/M phases, by modulating key regulators such as cyclin D1, RB, p53, and p27. It stabilizes cyclin D1 in the nucleus and promotes the hyperphosphorylation of RB, facilitating the G1-S transition (Lin2015Landscape).

In healthy human cells, PIN1 also influences transcription by interacting with transcription factors and co-regulators, affecting gene expression related to cell proliferation and differentiation (Hu2020Pinning). It stabilizes tumor suppressors like p53 by preventing their degradation, while promoting the degradation of oncogenic factors such as c-Myc (Hu2020Pinning). PIN1's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental changes, impacting processes like apoptosis and immune response (Hu2020Pinning). The protein is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it regulates mitosis and mediates stress responses (PolonioVallon2014ShaPINg).

## Clinical Significance
The PIN1 gene plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in protein regulation and signaling pathways. In cancer, PIN1 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor growth and progression by enhancing oncogenic signaling and inhibiting tumor suppressor pathways. This overexpression is linked to poor clinical outcomes in several cancers, including breast, prostate, and oral squamous carcinomas (Pu2020Prolyl; Zannini2019Oncogenic). PIN1's interaction with proteins like cyclin D1 and c-MYC promotes cell cycle progression and metabolic reprogramming, which are crucial for cancer cell proliferation (Pu2020Prolyl; Zannini2019Oncogenic).

In neurodegenerative diseases, alterations in PIN1 expression are also significant. In Alzheimer's disease, reduced PIN1 levels are associated with the accumulation of phosphorylated Tau proteins, contributing to disease progression (Maggio2023Role). In Parkinson's disease, PIN1's interaction with α-synuclein may influence the formation of Lewy bodies, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for alleviating disease symptoms (Maggio2023Role).

PIN1 is also implicated in cardiovascular diseases, where it regulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity, affecting vascular health and inflammation (Maggio2023Role). These diverse roles highlight PIN1's clinical significance across multiple pathologies.

## Interactions
The human gene PIN1 encodes the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1, which interacts with a variety of proteins, influencing their function and stability. Pin1 binds to phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline motifs, catalyzing conformational changes that affect protein interactions and activities. It interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), specifically binding to the C-terminal domain (CTD) at phosphorylated Ser2-Pro3 and Ser5-Pro6 motifs, which induces conformational changes that recruit transcription regulatory proteins (Hu2020Pinning). Pin1 also interacts with transcription factors such as ERα and c-Myc, enhancing their DNA binding and transcriptional activity through isomerization, which recruits coactivators like p300 and GCN5 (Hu2020Pinning).

Pin1 plays a role in the Notch1 signaling pathway by binding to Notch1, facilitating its processing and activation (Hu2020Pinning). It also interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), promoting its phosphorylation and inactivation, which is crucial for cell cycle progression (Rizzolio2012Retinoblastoma). In the context of DNA damage, Pin1 interacts with p53, enhancing its transactivation function and promoting the expression of target genes like MDM2 and p21 (Zheng2002The). These interactions highlight Pin1's significant role in modulating various cellular processes through its interactions with key regulatory proteins.
