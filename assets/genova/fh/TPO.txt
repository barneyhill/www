# TPO

## Overview
The TPO gene encodes the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, a critical component in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. Thyroid peroxidase is a transmembrane enzyme predominantly found in the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells, where it plays a vital role in the iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin and the coupling of iodotyrosine residues to form the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) (Le2015Modelling; Godlewska2019Thyroid). Structurally, thyroid peroxidase is characterized by a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-like domain, a complement control protein (CCP)-like domain, and an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, with the MPO-like domain being crucial for its enzymatic activity (Le2015Modelling). The enzyme's function is essential for normal metabolic regulation, growth, and development. Mutations in the TPO gene can lead to various thyroid disorders, including congenital hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Unknownauthors2017AssociationbetweenTPOAsn698ThrandThr725ProgenepolymorphismsandserumantiTPOlevelsinIranianpatientswithsubclinicalhypothyroidism; Rodrigues2005Mutation).

## Structure
Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is a 933 amino acid enzyme crucial for thyroid hormone biosynthesis. The primary structure of TPO includes a polypeptide chain encoded by the TPO gene, with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 107 kDa (Williams2019Structural; Kimura1987Human). The secondary structure of TPO is predominantly composed of alpha-helices, with some beta-sheet structures (Bresson2005Localization).

TPO's tertiary structure forms a globular shape, with several distinct domains: a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-like domain, a complement control protein (CCP)-like domain, and an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain (Le2015Modelling; Godlewska2019Thyroid). The MPO-like domain contains the active site, which includes a heme group covalently attached to specific residues, essential for its enzymatic function (Williams2019Structural). TPO is glycosylated at several sites, which is important for its stability and function (Baker2022CRYOelectron).

In terms of quaternary structure, TPO can exist as both a monomer and a dimer, with dimerization facilitated by a transmembrane helix containing a GxxxG motif (Le2015Modelling; Williams2019Structural). TPO also has several isoforms resulting from alternative splicing, contributing to its functional diversity (Godlewska2019Thyroida). These structural features are critical for TPO's role in thyroid hormone synthesis and its interaction with autoantibodies in autoimmune thyroid diseases (Williams2019Structural).

## Function
Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is an enzyme crucial for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones, which are essential for regulating metabolism, growth, and development in humans. TPO is localized in the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells, where it catalyzes the iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin and the coupling of iodotyrosine residues to form the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) (Le2015Modelling; Godlewska2019Thyroid). This process involves the oxidation of iodide ions to iodine atoms, which are then added to tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, producing iodotyrosine residues (Narumi2017Mild).

TPO functions as a transmembrane homodimer, largely extracellular, and is anchored to the apical membrane of thyroid follicle cells. Its structure includes a myeloperoxidase (MPO)-like domain, a complement control protein (CCP)-like domain, and an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, with the MPO-like domain being involved in the enzyme's catalytic activity (Le2015Modelling). TPO also exhibits catalase-like activity, consuming hydrogen peroxide in the absence of iodide, which prevents inhibition of dual oxidase (DUOX) proteins that provide the necessary hydrogen peroxide for thyroid hormone synthesis (Godlewska2019Thyroid).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene are associated with several thyroid-related conditions, primarily congenital hypothyroidism (CH). CH is characterized by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and insufficient thyroid hormone production, often due to defects in thyroid hormone biosynthesis where TPO plays a crucial role (Abramowicz1992Identification; Rodrigues2005Mutation). TPO mutations can lead to partial or total iodide organification defects, impacting the synthesis of thyroid hormones and resulting in conditions such as goiter and hypothyroidism (Kotani2003Partial; Narumi2017Mild).

In some cases, TPO mutations are linked to autoimmune thyroid diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease, where genetic variations in the TPO gene may contribute to the development of these conditions (Unknownauthors2017AssociationbetweenTPOAsn698ThrandThr725ProgenepolymorphismsandserumantiTPOlevelsinIranianpatientswithsubclinicalhypothyroidism). Additionally, TPO mutations have been associated with thyroid follicular cell carcinoma in certain dog breeds, suggesting a potential link between TPO gene alterations and thyroid cancer (Yu2021Deleterious).

The genetic heterogeneity of TPO defects underscores the importance of molecular testing for patients with thyroid dysfunctions, as these mutations can vary widely in their impact on thyroid hormone synthesis and clinical presentation (Rodrigues2005Mutation).

## Interactions
Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) is involved in several critical interactions essential for thyroid hormone synthesis. TPO interacts closely with dual oxidase (DUOX) proteins, which supply the hydrogen peroxide necessary for the iodination of thyroglobulin and the coupling of iodotyrosine residues to form thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (Godlewska2019Thyroid). The spatial interaction between TPO, DUOX, and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is crucial for minimizing oxidative damage from extracellular hydrogen peroxide. Cav-1 is required for the proper localization of TPO and DUOX at the apical pole of thyrocytes, and its down-regulation can lead to mislocalization, increased oxidative stress, and hypothyroidism (Godlewska2019Thyroid).

TPO also forms homodimers, which are sensitive to thionamide drugs like methimazole and propylthiouracil. These drugs can reduce TPO homodimerization, potentially affecting its enzymatic activity and immunomodulatory effects in autoimmune thyroid diseases (McDonald2009Thyroid). The dimerization of TPO is a stable interaction, resistant to denaturation by conventional reducing agents, indicating a robust structural configuration (McDonald2009Thyroid). These interactions highlight TPO's role in both thyroid hormone synthesis and its potential involvement in thyroid autoimmunity.
