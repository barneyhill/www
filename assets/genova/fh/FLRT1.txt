# FLRT1

## Overview
Fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 1 (FLRT1) is a gene that encodes a type-I single-pass transmembrane receptor protein, which plays a critical role in cell adhesion and neuronal migration, particularly during the development of the mammalian cerebral cortex. The FLRT1 protein is characterized by its extracellular domain containing leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and a fibronectin type III domain, which facilitate its interactions with various cellular partners. These interactions enable FLRT1 to function as a bimodal guidance system, providing both adhesive and repulsive signals that are essential for the proper migration and dispersion of neurons. Additionally, FLRT1 modulates fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling, thereby influencing key developmental processes such as cell proliferation and synaptogenesis (Peregrina2020FLRTing).

## Function
FLRT1 (fibronectin leucine-rich transmembrane protein 1) is a type-I single-pass transmembrane receptor protein involved in cell adhesion and neuronal migration during the development of the mammalian cerebral cortex. It functions as a cell adhesion molecule, regulating both radial migration and tangential dispersion of neurons. FLRT1 provides both repulsive and adhesive signals, depending on the cellular context and its binding partners, making it a bimodal guidance system for cortical neuron migration (Peregrina2020FLRTing).

The protein has an extracellular N-terminal region with 10 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), flanked by cysteine-rich regions and a fibronectin type III domain. It is glycosylated at two sites on its extracellular domain. The transmembrane helix of FLRT1 connects to a short intracellular domain that interacts with small Rho GTPases and modulates fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling through the MAPK pathway (Peregrina2020FLRTing).

FLRT1 is expressed in the nervous system and plays a significant role in modulating FGF/FGFR signaling, which is crucial for various developmental processes such as patterning, cell proliferation, survival, guidance, and synaptogenesis. It enhances FGF signaling by increasing phosphorylated ERK levels via MAPK activation, promoting neurite outgrowth in neurons (Peregrina2020FLRTing).

## Interactions
FLRT1, a member of the fibronectin leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein family, is involved in various protein-protein interactions that influence cellular processes such as adhesion and migration. FLRT1 interacts with Latrophilin proteins (LPHN1-3), which are adhesion-type G-protein-coupled receptors. This interaction is mediated by the extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of FLRT1, which can bind both homophilically and heterophilically to promote cell adhesion (Jackson2016Supercomplexes; Jackson2015Structural). 

FLRT1 also interacts with Unc5 receptors, which are involved in axon guidance and cell migration. These interactions occur at distinct sites on the LRR domain, with FLRT1 binding to Unc5 receptors to trigger repulsion, thereby influencing neuronal migration and clustering in the cerebral cortex (Jackson2016Supercomplexes; del2017Regulation). 

Additionally, FLRT1 is known to modulate fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling through its fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain, enhancing FGF signaling by increasing phosphorylated ERK levels via MAPK activation. This interaction promotes neurite outgrowth and is crucial for the regulation of radial migration and tangential dispersion of neurons (Peregrina2020FLRTing).
