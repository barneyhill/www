# TRNT1

## Overview
The TRNT1 gene encodes the enzyme tRNA nucleotidyl transferase 1, which is a member of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily. This enzyme plays a critical role in the maturation of tRNA molecules by catalyzing the addition of a CCA sequence to their 3' ends, a modification essential for proper tRNA function in protein synthesis. TRNT1 operates in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, ensuring the correct processing and stability of tRNAs necessary for cellular homeostasis and efficient protein synthesis (Sasarman2015The; Fatica2023TRNT1). Structurally, the TRNT1 protein is characterized by a sea-horse-shaped conformation with distinct domains responsible for its catalytic activity and tRNA binding (Meynier2024Structural). Mutations in the TRNT1 gene are linked to a rare multisystem disorder known as Sideroblastic Anemia with B-cell Immunodeficiency, Periodic Fevers, and Developmental Delay (SIFD), highlighting its clinical significance (Maccora2022Clinical).

## Structure
The TRNT1 protein has a sea-horse-shaped structure composed of four domains: head, neck, body, and tail. The head and neck domains are crucial for its catalytic function, with the head domain containing conserved catalytic residues and the neck domain having nucleobase-interacting residues (Leibovitch2019Analysis; Meynier2024Structural). The body and tail domains are involved in tRNA recognition and binding, with the tail domain forming a complementary surface to accommodate the T-loop of mitochondrial tRNA Ile (Meynier2024Structural).

The primary structure of TRNT1 is encoded by the TRNT1 gene, and its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets. The tertiary structure forms a specific three-dimensional shape necessary for its function, with the active site located at the interface between the head and neck domains, coordinating two Mg2+ ions (Meynier2024Structural). The I326T variant, located in the body domain, affects the enzyme's ability to form covalent dimers, suggesting a structural alteration in this domain (Leibovitch2019Analysis).

TRNT1 is part of the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily and is classified as a class II enzyme, featuring a well-conserved 25-kDa amino-terminal domain with defined sequence motifs crucial for its function (Leibovitch2019Analysis).

## Function
The TRNT1 gene encodes the tRNA nucleotidyl transferase enzyme, which is crucial for the maturation of both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs in human cells. This enzyme is responsible for the post-transcriptional addition of a CCA sequence to the 3' end of tRNAs, a modification necessary for aminoacylation, proper ribosomal positioning, and subsequent protein synthesis (Sasarman2015The; Fatica2023TRNT1). The CCA addition also acts as an anti-determinant for 3' endoribonuclease activity, protecting tRNAs from degradation (Fatica2023TRNT1).

TRNT1 functions in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria, ensuring the correct processing of tRNAs essential for protein synthesis (Sasarman2015The). The enzyme recognizes tRNA structures independent of their sequence by interacting with the sugar-phosphate backbone of the tRNA, selectively using cytidine triphosphate and adenosine triphosphate for this process (Sasarman2015The). TRNT1 also plays a role in repairing damaged CCA ends and in the quality control of unstable or hypomodified tRNAs (Leibovitch2019Analysis).

In healthy cells, TRNT1 helps maintain tRNA integrity and balance, which is essential for efficient protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Fatica2023TRNT1). Its activity is critical for maintaining normal mitochondrial translation and protein synthesis, impacting overall organismal health (Wedatilake2016TRNT1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TRNT1 gene are associated with a rare multisystem disorder known as Sideroblastic Anemia with B-cell Immunodeficiency, Periodic Fevers, and Developmental Delay (SIFD). This condition is characterized by a range of symptoms including microcytic anemia, recurrent fevers, developmental delays, and immunodeficiency (Maccora2022Clinical; Li2023Thalidomide). Patients may also experience additional symptoms such as retinitis pigmentosa, cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, seizures, cardiomyopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and brittle hair (Yang2020Novel). The severity of SIFD can vary, with some patients exhibiting a milder phenotype without sideroblastic anemia or periodic fevers (Yang2020Novel).

The pathogenesis of SIFD is linked to defects in oxidative phosphorylation and decreased enzymatic activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes, resulting from impaired mitochondrial translation due to defective CCA addition to mitochondrial tRNA (Sasarman2015The; Odom2021A). This leads to increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, causing overexpression of inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor (Chen2023Case).

Treatment options for SIFD include TNF inhibitors and bone marrow transplants, although their effectiveness varies (Giannelou2018Aberrant; Chen2023Case). The genetic diversity of TRNT1 mutations contributes to the heterogeneity of the syndrome, with different mutations leading to varying clinical outcomes (Li2023Thalidomide).

## Interactions
TRNT1, the enzyme responsible for adding CCA nucleotides to the 3' ends of tRNA molecules, plays a crucial role in tRNA maturation and mitochondrial function. It interacts with various tRNA molecules, particularly those with non-canonical structures, such as mitochondrial tRNA Ser(AGY), which lacks the D arm. This interaction is essential for the proper function and maturation of these tRNAs, as mutations in TRNT1 can impair the addition of the CCA tail, leading to defects in mitochondrial tRNA processing and protein synthesis (Sasarman2015The).

The I326T variant of TRNT1 has been studied for its reduced catalytic activity and thermal stability, which are linked to a conformational change. This variant affects the enzyme's ability to interact with tRNA, as evidenced by its inability to support growth in yeast when expressed from a weaker promoter. This suggests that both the expression level and cellular localization of TRNT1 are critical for its function (Leibovitch2019Analysis).

TRNT1 deficiency is associated with increased oxidative stress and tRNA cleavage, leading to the generation of tRNA-derived stress-induced RNA fragments. This indicates that TRNT1 interacts with tRNAs to protect them from degradation under stress conditions, highlighting its role in maintaining tRNA integrity (Fatica2023TRNT1).
