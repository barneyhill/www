# ARHGAP24

## Overview
ARHGAP24 is a gene that encodes the protein Rho GTPase activating protein 24, also known as FilGAP, which is a member of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by inactivating Rho family GTPases, particularly Rac1 and Cdc42, which are critical for cell shape and motility. FilGAP is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a GAP activity region, and a coiled-coil (CC) domain, which facilitate its function and interactions with other proteins (Nakamura2013FilGAP). The protein is highly expressed in podocytes of the kidney, where it maintains cellular integrity and function by modulating actin dynamics (Akilesh2011Arhgap24). Beyond its role in the kidney, ARHGAP24 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell polarity and morphology, and has been implicated in several diseases, such as cancers and kidney disorders, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Yang2022ARHGAP24; Xu2016ARHGAP24).

## Structure
The ARHGAP24 gene encodes a protein known as FilGAP, which is part of the ARHGAP family and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Rho family proteins. The protein structure includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a GAP activity region, a spacer, and a C-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain that facilitates protein dimerization (Nakamura2013FilGAP). The PH domain is suggested to bind strongly to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, based on its similarity to other known PH domains (Nakamura2013FilGAP). The GAP domain is responsible for stimulating the GTPase activities of Rac1 and Cdc42, with a preference for Rac1 in the presence of filamin A (FLNa) (Nakamura2013FilGAP).

FilGAP also contains a region of 319 amino acids between the GAP and CC domains, which includes multiple serine and threonine phosphorylation sites, indicating potential regulation by phosphorylation (Nakamura2013FilGAP). A point mutation in the GAP domain (Q158R) has been linked to a kidney disorder, highlighting its functional importance (Nakamura2013FilGAP). The existence of five isoforms of ARHGAP24 is suggested, although experimental confirmation is lacking for some isoforms (Nakamura2013FilGAP).

## Function
ARHGAP24 encodes a Rho GTPase-activating protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes, specialized cells in the kidney. This protein functions by inactivating Rac1 and Cdc42, small GTPases involved in controlling cell shape and motility, thereby maintaining the non-motile phenotype of podocytes (Akilesh2011Arhgap24). In healthy cells, ARHGAP24 inactivates Rac1, modulating actin dynamics and membrane ruffling, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and function of podocytes (Akilesh2011Arhgap24). The protein is highly expressed in the kidney, particularly in podocytes, where it helps regulate the balance between RhoA and Rac1 signaling pathways, crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of podocyte foot processes (Akilesh2011Arhgap24).

ARHGAP24 is also involved in the regulation of cell polarity, morphology, and cytoskeletal organization in other tissues. It acts as a specific GTPase activator for RAC, controlling actin remodeling by inactivating RAC, which suppresses leading edge protrusion and promotes cell retraction to achieve cell polarity (O’Brien2008Expression). The phosphorylation of ARHGAP24 by the RhoA effector kinase, ROCK, enhances its GAP activity, contributing to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (Akilesh2011Arhgap24).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ARHGAP24 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly cancers and kidney disorders. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ARHGAP24 is identified as a prognostic biomarker, with reduced expression linked to shorter progression-free survival and higher relapse rates. Low ARHGAP24 expression is associated with adverse features such as microvascular invasion and tumor recurrence, suggesting its role as a protective factor against tumor invasiveness and metastasis (Yang2022ARHGAP24).

In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), decreased ARHGAP24 expression correlates with poor survival outcomes. Overexpression of ARHGAP24 in RCC cell lines reduces cell growth and invasion, indicating its tumor suppressor role (Xu2016ARHGAP24). Similarly, in colorectal cancer, ARHGAP24 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis, potentially through the p53 pathway (Zhang2018ARHGAP24).

ARHGAP24 is also associated with familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disease. Mutations in ARHGAP24, such as the Q158R variant, disrupt its function in inactivating Rac1, leading to podocyte dysfunction and contributing to FSGS pathogenesis (Akilesh2011Arhgap24). In bladder cancer, ARHGAP24 is linked to a tumor-promoting microenvironment, influencing immune cell infiltration and tumor progression (Yang2021Transcriptomic).

## Interactions
ARHGAP24, also known as Rho GTPase activating protein 24, participates in several critical protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ARHGAP24 acts as a scaffold protein, facilitating the interaction between pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP1. This interaction promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PKM2, which is crucial for inhibiting β-catenin transactivation and reducing cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Yang2022ARHGAP24).

The C-terminal region of ARHGAP24 is essential for its scaffolding function, as it directly binds to PKM2 and WWP1. Deletion mutants lacking this domain fail to induce PKM2 ubiquitination, underscoring the importance of this region (Yang2022ARHGAP24). ARHGAP24 also interacts with Rac1, a Rho GTPase, and its inhibitory efficiency on Rac1 activity varies among different HCC cell lines, suggesting that the intracellular environment influences its function (Yang2022ARHGAP24).

In lung adenocarcinoma, ARHGAP24 expression is regulated by CBX3, which interacts with TRIM28, TRIM24, and RBBP4. These interactions repress ARHGAP24 expression, thereby influencing Rac1 signaling and promoting tumor progression (Jin2021Smoking-associated).
