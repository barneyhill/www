# CCZ1B

## Overview
The CCZ1B gene encodes the protein CCZ1 homolog B, which is involved in vacuolar protein trafficking and biogenesis. This protein is categorized as a component of the cellular machinery responsible for the transport and sorting of proteins to the vacuole, a critical process for maintaining cellular homeostasis and function. CCZ1 homolog B plays a significant role in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, facilitating the fusion of endosomes with lysosomes, which is essential for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The proper functioning of this protein is crucial for cellular processes such as autophagy and the response to nutrient availability, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism and health (Qiu2020aarFDC).
