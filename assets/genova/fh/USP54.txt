# USP54

## Overview
USP54 is a gene that encodes the protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 54, a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family. This protein functions as a deubiquitinase, specifically targeting K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are involved in non-degradative cellular processes such as intracellular trafficking, immune signaling, and genome maintenance (Wendrich2024Discovery). Structurally, ubiquitin specific peptidase 54 is characterized by a unique USP catalytic domain and a cryptic S2 ubiquitin binding site, which contribute to its specificity and catalytic efficiency (Wendrich2024Discovery). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including skeletal muscle and testis, suggesting specialized roles in these areas (Quesada2004Cloning). USP54 has been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer, particularly in the transition to castration-resistant prostate cancer, and is also involved in cellular responses to methylmercury toxicity (Lee2022Deubiquitinase; Zhou2024USP54).

## Structure
USP54 is a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease family, characterized by a unique molecular structure that includes a USP catalytic domain with a weakened S1 site. The protein adopts a fold consisting of hand, thumb, and fingers subdomains, with a distinct arrangement for the S1 ubiquitin binding site, which is rotated by approximately 30° compared to the common binding mode. This results in missing hydrophobic residues that typically contact Phe4 and a unique helix (α7.5) oriented away from ubiquitin (Wendrich2024Discovery).

The tertiary structure of USP54 includes three coordinated zinc ions, with one position unique to this protein. The catalytic activity is dependent on a unique Cys-loop, and the protein features a cryptic S2 ubiquitin binding site that facilitates efficient cleavage of K63-linked ubiquitin chains. This S2 site is located on the backside of the USP fingers subdomain and involves unique residues in USP54 (Wendrich2024Discovery).

USP54, along with its homologue USP53, contains an elongated Cys loop before the catalytic cysteine, flanked by conserved asparagine residues crucial for forming an oxy-anion hole, essential for catalytic activity (Wendrich2024Discovery).

## Function
USP54, a member of the ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family, is involved in the regulation of ubiquitination, a critical post-translational modification that influences protein stability, activity, and localization. Although initially classified as a non-protease homologue due to the absence of essential catalytic residues, recent studies have revealed that USP54 is an active deubiquitinase with specificity for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (Wendrich2024Discovery). This activity suggests a role in non-degradative processes such as intracellular trafficking, immune signaling, and genome maintenance (Wendrich2024Discovery).

Structurally, USP54 contains a USP catalytic domain with a unique arrangement of subdomains that affects its interaction with ubiquitin. The protein's ability to cleave K63-linked ubiquitin chains is mediated by a cryptic S2 ubiquitin binding site, crucial for its catalytic efficiency (Wendrich2024Discovery). USP54 is expressed at significant levels in specific tissues, such as skeletal muscle and testis, indicating a potentially specialized role in these areas (Quesada2004Cloning). The absence of deubiquitylating activity against certain substrates suggests that USP54 may have regulatory functions in healthy human cells (Quesada2004Cloning).

## Clinical Significance
USP54 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 54) has been implicated in the progression of prostate cancer, particularly in the transition from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Studies have shown that USP54 expression is significantly upregulated in CRPC tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression. This upregulation is more pronounced in advanced stages of prostate cancer, indicating that USP54 plays a crucial role in the proliferation of CRPC cells (Zhou2024USP54).

The gene's expression is positively correlated with androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which is essential for tumor growth under androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Knockdown of USP54 in CRPC cell lines has been shown to significantly reduce cell growth and proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in CRPC (Zhou2024USP54).

In a different context, USP54 has been identified as a key enzyme that modulates cellular response to methylmercury toxicity in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. This suggests that USP54 may also play a role in the regulation of proteins associated with methylmercury toxicity, although its clinical significance in this context remains to be fully understood (Lee2022Deubiquitinase).

## Interactions
USP54 has been identified to interact with charged multivesicular body proteins (CHMPs), which are components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. This interaction is facilitated by the microtubule interacting and transport (MIT) domains present in USP54, which bind to amphipathic helices known as MIT-interacting motifs (MIMs) found in CHMP proteins. The binding to CHMPs is a biochemical signature of MIT domains and may recruit proteins to endosomal components, allowing for the localization of enzymatic activities associated with MIT proteins (Rigden2009Ab).

USP54 also plays a role in the deubiquitination of K63-linked ubiquitin chains. It has a unique S2 ubiquitin binding site that is crucial for engaging these chains, characterized by hydrophobic interactions with the Ile44 patch of ubiquitin. This site is essential for the efficient catalysis of K63-linked ubiquitin chains, setting USP54 apart from other canonical ubiquitin-specific proteases (Wendrich2024Discovery). However, specific interactions of USP54 with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond ubiquitin have not been detailed in the available literature (Wendrich2024Discovery).
