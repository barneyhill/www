cysteine-aspartic acid protease that plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. The encoded protein cleaves and inactivates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase while it cleaves and activates sterol regulatory element binding proteins as well as caspases 6, 7, and 9. This protein itself is processed by caspases 8, 9, and 10. It is the predominant caspase involved in the cleavage of amyloid-beta 4A precursor protein, which is associated with neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease.
