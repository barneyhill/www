# RNLS

## Overview
The RNLS gene encodes the protein renalase, a flavoprotein that functions as an FAD-dependent amine oxidase. Renalase is primarily involved in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiac function, with significant expression in the kidneys and heart. It is secreted into the bloodstream and urine, where it plays a role in the metabolism of catecholamines, such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, although its precise mechanism of action remains to be fully elucidated (baroni2013new; Milani2011FADBinding). Structurally, renalase is characterized by a p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase fold topology and a Rossmann fold-based FAD-binding domain, distinguishing it from other monoamine oxidases (baroni2013new; Milani2011FADBinding). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as PMCA4b, underscore its role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly those related to cardiovascular and renal functions (Wang2015Identification). Additionally, alterations in RNLS expression and function have been linked to various clinical conditions, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and cardiac diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (FarzanehFar2010A; Guo2016Inhibition).

## Structure
Renalase, encoded by the RNLS gene, is a flavoprotein involved in blood pressure regulation and is characterized by its unique structural features. The primary structure of renalase includes a sequence of amino acids that form a signal peptide for secretion and a dinucleotide binding motif (baroni2013new). The secondary structure comprises a p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase fold topology with a Rossmann fold-based FAD-binding domain (Milani2011FADBinding). The tertiary structure reveals a monomeric protein with a bean-like elongated shape, featuring a large solvent-exposed active site cavity divided into aromatic and polar hemispheres (baroni2013new; Milani2011FADBinding).

Renalase lacks the 'aromatic cage' typical of monoamine oxidases, indicating functional differences (Milani2011FADBinding). It is classified as a member of the p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase superfamily, sharing structural similarities with MAO-like enzymes (baroni2013new). The protein is expressed in various tissues, with renalase1 being the most highly expressed isoform (baroni2013new). Despite its structural similarities to other flavoproteins, renalase's exact molecular mechanism and physiological substrates remain unclear (Milani2011FADBinding).

## Function
Renalase, encoded by the RNLS gene, is a flavoprotein involved in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiac function. It is primarily expressed in the kidneys and heart, and is secreted into the blood and urine. Renalase plays a significant role in lowering blood pressure by decreasing cardiac contractility and mean arterial pressure. It also exhibits protective effects against cardiac ischemia (baroni2013new).

Renalase is involved in the metabolism of catecholamines, such as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, although its exact mechanism remains unclear. It has been proposed to act as a catecholamine-degrading enzyme, potentially through O2- or NADH-dependent mechanisms (Milani2011FADBinding). However, studies have shown that recombinant renalase lacks amine oxidase activity and is not strictly specific for NADH, indicating a more complex role in cellular metabolism (baroni2013new).

The enzyme is part of the flavin protein superfamily and contains FAD cofactors. It catalyzes NADH- and NADPH-dependent diaphorase reactions, but the low catalytic efficiency suggests that nicotinamide dinucleotides are not its physiological substrates (baroni2013new; Milani2011FADBinding). Renalase's activity is associated with a decrease in the NAD/NADH ratio, suggesting its role in regulating extracellular NAD levels (baroni2013new).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNLS gene, which encodes renalase, have been implicated in various diseases. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), renalase is overexpressed and functions as a growth factor, promoting tumor cell survival and proliferation. Its high expression is inversely correlated with patient survival, suggesting a pathogenic role in cancer progression. Inhibition of renalase signaling has been shown to decrease tumor cell viability and induce apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in PDAC (Guo2016Inhibition).

A common missense polymorphism in the RNLS gene, Glu37Asp, is associated with cardiac conditions such as hypertrophy, dysfunction, and ischemia. This polymorphism results in decreased enzymatic activity, which may contribute to cardiovascular diseases by affecting catecholamine regulation. Individuals with the CC genotype of this polymorphism have increased odds of experiencing these cardiac conditions (FarzanehFar2010A).

Elevated renalase levels have also been observed in patients with acute coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), suggesting its role as a biomarker for ischemia. Renalase's anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties may offer cardioprotective effects in response to ischemic stress (Safdar2019Elevated).

## Interactions
Renalase (RNLS) is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. One of the key interactions identified is with PMCA4b, a plasma membrane calcium ATPase. This interaction was discovered using biotin transfer studies and mass spectrometry, and further confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunolocalization techniques (Wang2015Identification). PMCA4b acts as a receptor for renalase, mediating its effects on MAPK signaling pathways, which are crucial for cytoprotection and cell signaling (Wang2015Identification).

The study by Wang et al. demonstrated that the interaction between renalase and PMCA4b is specific, as down-regulation or inhibition of PMCA4b abrogated renalase-dependent MAPK signaling and cytoprotection (Wang2015Identification). The RP-220 peptide, a 20 amino acid segment of renalase, was used to probe and confirm the interaction with PMCA4b, showing that this peptide could mimic the full-length protein's protective effects against toxic and ischemic injury (Wang2015Identification).

Additionally, proteomic profiling has identified distinct sets of proteins that bind to renalase isoforms RNLS-1 and RNLS-2, suggesting that the C-terminal region of renalase is crucial for its specific interactions with cellular targets (Fedchenko2018Proteomic). These interactions highlight the role of renalase in physiological processes, particularly in cardiovascular and renal functions.
