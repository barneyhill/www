# TMEM255B

## Overview
TMEM255B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 255B, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including angiogenesis and tumor progression. TMEM255B has been identified as part of an 18-gene signature associated with recurrence-associated endothelial cells in prostate cancer, where it plays a role in promoting tumor growth and resistance to treatment (Lin2024An). The protein's function in endothelial cells includes facilitating tube formation, migration, and invasion, while its silencing can induce apoptosis, highlighting its significance in angiogenic activity (Lin2024An). Additionally, TMEM255B expression has been observed in other contexts, such as mesenchymal stem cell treatment in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, although its clinical implications in this area are not yet fully understood (Gramlich2020Systemic). Further research is needed to elucidate the complete range of functions and clinical significance of TMEM255B.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
TMEM255B has been implicated in the progression and recurrence of prostate cancer (PCa), particularly in relation to castration resistance. The gene is part of an 18-gene signature known as RAECsig, which is associated with recurrence-associated endothelial cells (RAECs) in PCa. Higher expression levels of TMEM255B within this signature correlate with increased angiogenic activity and tumor growth, suggesting its role in promoting PCa progression and resistance to treatment (Lin2024An). Silencing TMEM255B in endothelial cells has been shown to inhibit tube formation, migration, invasion, and induce apoptosis, indicating its involvement in angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation (Lin2024An).

In a separate study, TMEM255B expression was noted in the context of mesenchymal stem cell treatment in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, where its expression was altered, although the specific clinical implications in this context remain unclear (Gramlich2020Systemic). While TMEM255B has been studied in various contexts, its exact role and the full extent of its clinical significance require further investigation. Current research highlights its potential as a biomarker for predicting tumor recurrence and treatment resistance in prostate cancer.
