# PIP5K1A

## Overview
PIP5K1A is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type 1 alpha, a crucial kinase involved in phosphoinositide metabolism. This enzyme plays a significant role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid molecule that serves as a precursor for various signaling pathways, including those regulating calcium signaling and cytoskeletal organization (Hu2015Resolution). The protein encoded by PIP5K1A is characterized by its kinase domain and unique PIPK-specific subdomain, which facilitate its interaction with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the plasma membrane (Amos2019Membrane). PIP5K1A is involved in several cellular processes, including cell motility, growth, and signal transduction, particularly within the Wnt signaling pathway (Hu2015Resolution). Its clinical significance is underscored by its association with various cancers, where alterations in its expression can influence tumor progression and patient outcomes (Sarwar2018The; Wang2022PIP5K1α).

## Structure
The PIP5K1A protein is a kinase that plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide metabolism. Its primary structure includes a kinase domain with a unique PIPK-specific subdomain containing the 'DLKGS' sequence motif, which is thought to form a 'PIP-binding motif' (Amos2019Membrane; Hu2015Resolution). The secondary structure of PIP5K1A shares similarities with other protein kinases, including features like alpha helices and beta sheets, but it also possesses an additional N-terminal domain absent in other kinases (Hu2015Resolution).

The tertiary structure of PIP5K1A reveals a fold similar to protein kinases, with an unstructured activation loop that is believed to play a role in PIP binding and selectivity (Amos2019Membrane). The quaternary structure of PIP5K1A is characterized by its dimeric form, which is necessary for full catalytic activity. The dimerization occurs in a side-to-side manner, involving both N- and C-lobes, and is stabilized by hydrophobic and charged interactions (Hu2015Resolution).

PIP5K1A also interacts with the DIX domain of the Wnt signaling molecule dishevelled, which enhances its catalytic activity through dimerization and interaction (Hu2015Resolution). The protein's interaction with membranes is specific to those containing phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), facilitated by its activation loop and arginine- and lysine-rich regions (Amos2019Membrane).

## Function
The PIP5K1A gene encodes an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid molecule involved in various cellular functions. PIP2 is a substrate for phospholipase C, which generates second messengers important for calcium signaling and protein kinase activation (Hu2015Resolution). PIP5K1A is active at the plasma membrane, where it influences cell motility and growth by regulating cytoskeletal organization and membrane trafficking (Hu2015Resolution).

PIP5K1A is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, where its interaction with the protein Dishevelled (Dvl) enhances its catalytic activity, crucial for signal transduction processes that stabilize and accumulate β-catenin (Hu2015Resolution). The enzyme also plays a role in hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration, particularly in the context of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling. It facilitates the production of PIP2, which is converted to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), activating Akt and promoting cell proliferation (Tsai2017Regulation).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease, PIP5K1A enhances non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), reducing amyloid-beta production by shifting APP localization from endosomal compartments to the cell surface (Wu2020Phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PIP5K1A gene have been implicated in various cancers, notably breast cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In breast cancer, PIP5K1A is associated with poor outcomes, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, where 29% of cases show gene amplification. Elevated levels of PIP5K1A correlate with increased expression of phosphorylated AKT (pSer-473 AKT) and enhanced invasiveness of cancer cells. The PIP5K1A inhibitor ISA-2011B has shown potential in suppressing tumor growth and invasiveness by reducing pSer-473 AKT expression and its downstream effectors (Sarwar2018The).

In CRPC, PIP5K1A is crucial for tumor progression, acting as an upstream regulator of the androgen receptor (AR) and its target genes. Knockdown of PIP5K1A or inhibition with ISA-2011B suppresses CRPC cell growth and invasion. The N-terminal domain of PIP5K1A is essential for its oncogenic activity, affecting mRNA expression and protein stability. High expression of PIP5K1A in primary prostate cancer correlates with poor patient outcomes (Wang2022PIP5K1α).

In KRAS-mutant cancers, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PIP5K1A is identified as a specific vulnerability. Reducing PIP5K1A expression decreases oncogenic KRAS signaling, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in KRAS-driven cancers (Adhikari2018Interrogating).

## Interactions
PIP5K1A interacts with several proteins that regulate its kinase activity and cellular functions. It binds to the DIX domain of Dishevelled (DVL), which enhances its lipid kinase activity and substrate affinity. This interaction is crucial for PIP5K1A's role in Wnt signaling, as mutations in key residues like Glu-129 and Arg-197 significantly reduce binding to DVL DIX, impairing its function (Hu2015Resolution). PIP5K1A also interacts with small GTPases such as RAC1, ARF6, and ARF1, which can directly stimulate its lipid kinase activity. The interaction with RAC1 involves specific residues, such as Glu-61 in mouse PIP5K1B, corresponding to Glu-82 in zPIP5K1A (Hu2015Resolution).

PIP5K1A is identified as a specific vulnerability in KRAS G12V-transformed cells, indicating a preferential interaction with this oncogenic KRAS isoform. This interaction is mediated through the hypervariable region of KRAS, which contains basic amino acids facilitating binding to PIP5K1A (Adhikari2018Interrogating). PIP5K1A also associates with CLIC1, which recruits it to the plasma membrane to facilitate cell-matrix adhesion formation, a process crucial for tumor metastasis (Peng2021CLIC1). These interactions highlight PIP5K1A's role in various signaling pathways and cellular processes.
