# CORO7

## Overview
CORO7 is a gene that encodes the protein coronin 7, which is a member of the coronin family of proteins. Coronin 7 is characterized by the presence of WD40-repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and contribute to its role as a scaffold protein in various cellular pathways, including the Hippo signaling pathway (Park2021CORO7). This protein is primarily localized in the cytosol and the trans-Golgi network, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining Golgi structure and function, as well as in the anterograde transport of proteins (Rybakin2006Crn7). Coronin 7's interactions with the actin cytoskeleton and its involvement in post-Golgi trafficking underscore its importance in cellular transport and signaling pathways (Yuan2014K33Linked). Additionally, CORO7 has been implicated in the regulation of body weight and obesity, with alterations in its expression and methylation linked to metabolic conditions (Eriksson2015Implication).

## Structure
CORO7, also known as coronin 7, is a protein characterized by the presence of two WD40-repeat domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and forming a beta-propeller structure (Park2021CORO7). These domains are crucial for its function as a scaffold protein in various cellular pathways, including the Hippo signaling pathway (Park2021CORO7). The WD40-repeat domains contribute to the tertiary structure of CORO7, allowing it to interact with multiple proteins simultaneously, which is essential for its role in assembling protein complexes (Park2021CORO7).

CORO7 is localized to the cytosol and the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it plays a role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton and maintaining Golgi morphology (Park2021CORO7). Its localization to the Golgi membrane is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinase, indicating that post-translational modifications are important for its function (Park2021CORO7). The protein's interaction with the actin cytoskeleton is noted, although its role in Hippo pathway modulation is considered independent of actin stabilization (Park2021CORO7). The molecular structure of CORO7 itself, including its primary sequence or detailed three-dimensional conformation, is not explicitly detailed in the available context.

## Function
CORO7, also known as coronin 7, is a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining Golgi structure and function. It is involved in the anterograde transport of proteins from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, ensuring proper protein export and maintaining Golgi architecture (Rybakin2006Crn7). CORO7 interacts with the AP-1 adaptor complex at the Golgi, which is crucial for its localization and function in the Golgi apparatus (Rybakin2008Molecular). 

CORO7 is also implicated in the Hippo signaling pathway, where it acts as a scaffold protein facilitating the assembly of the core kinase complex. This role is essential for the activation of the Hippo pathway, which regulates cell growth and apoptosis (Park2021CORO7). 

Additionally, CORO7 undergoes K33-linked polyubiquitination, which is important for its role in post-Golgi trafficking. This modification aids in the recruitment of CORO7 to the trans-Golgi network, where it stabilizes F-actin to facilitate protein trafficking (Yuan2014K33Linked). These functions highlight CORO7's critical involvement in cellular transport and signaling pathways.

## Clinical Significance
The CORO7 gene has been implicated in the regulation of body weight and obesity. Studies have shown that alterations in the methylation of a specific CpG site associated with CORO7 are linked to obesity, particularly in children. Obese children exhibit lower methylation levels at this site, suggesting an epigenetic influence on obesity (Eriksson2015Implication). The gene's expression is notably high in brain regions involved in appetite and energy balance, such as the hypothalamus and locus coeruleus. Changes in dietary conditions, such as food deprivation, can decrease CORO7 expression in the hypothalamus, while ethanol treatment, which stimulates appetite, increases its expression in the locus coeruleus (Eriksson2015Implication).

In Drosophila, the CORO7 homologue Pod1 is involved in metabolic regulation, with its expression increasing on a high-calorie diet. Knockdown of Pod1 in neurons leads to increased resistance to starvation, indicating its role in metabolic homeostasis (Eriksson2015Implication). These findings suggest that alterations in CORO7 expression or methylation may be linked to obesity and related metabolic conditions, although specific diseases or conditions resulting from such alterations in humans are not detailed in the available excerpts.

## Interactions
Coronin 7 (CORO7) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. CORO7 interacts with the AP-1 adaptor complex, specifically binding to the m1-adaptin subunit, which is essential for its localization on Golgi membranes (Rybakin2008Molecular). This interaction is mediated by a tyrosine-288-based sorting signal (Rybakin2008Molecular). CORO7 also interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, binding directly to F-actin through its N-terminal WD domain, although it does not exhibit F-actin bundling activity (Shina2010A).

CORO7 undergoes K33-linked polyubiquitination, which facilitates its interaction with the clathrin adaptor protein Eps15 at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). This interaction is crucial for promoting F-actin assembly at the TGN, necessary for post-Golgi trafficking (Yuan2014K33Linked). CORO7 also interacts with N-WASP, a protein involved in actin polymerization, and this interaction is modulated by the small Rho GTPase Cdc42 (Bhattacharya2016Novel).

In the context of the Hippo pathway, CORO7 functions as a scaffold protein, interacting with key components such as SAV1, MST2, and LATS1, which are essential for the assembly and stabilization of the core kinase complex (Park2021CORO7). These interactions highlight CORO7's role in various cellular signaling and trafficking pathways.
