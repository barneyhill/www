# MYO15A

## Overview
The MYO15A gene encodes the motor protein myosin XVA, which plays a critical role in the auditory system by contributing to the development and maintenance of mechanosensory stereocilia in the inner ear. Myosin XVA is categorized as a motor protein, characterized by its ability to convert chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work, facilitating the transport of essential proteins to the tips of stereocilia. This transport is vital for the proper formation and function of hair bundles, which are necessary for hearing. The protein's structure includes several domains, such as the motor domain, IQ motifs, and a MyTH4-FERM domain, which are involved in actin binding and protein-protein interactions. Mutations in MYO15A are linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, underscoring its importance in auditory function (Delprat2004Myosin; Cirilo2021Functional; Houdusse2021The).

## Structure
The MYO15A gene encodes the protein myosin XVA, a motor protein crucial for the development and maintenance of mechanosensory stereocilia in the inner ear. Myosin XVA features a conserved motor domain, which is essential for its function as a molecular motor. This domain includes ATPase motifs that are critical for ATP binding and hydrolysis, influencing the protein's mechanochemical cycle (Gong2021Structural).

The protein structure includes several distinct domains, such as the Helix-Loop-Helix (HLH) motif, cardiomyopathy (CM) loop, and activation loop, which are involved in binding to filamentous actin (F-actin) (Gong2021Structural). The HLH motif, particularly residues I1641-P1671, plays a significant role in engaging with actin subunits, while the CM loop primarily engages in electrostatic interactions (Gong2021Structural).

Myosin XVA also contains IQ motifs that bind essential and regulatory light chains, contributing to its structural configuration. The protein's tail region includes a MyTH4-FERM domain, which is shared with other myosins and is involved in protein-protein interactions (Bird2014Chaperoneenhanced).

Splice variants of MYO15A result in different isoforms, with one isoform featuring a 133-kDa N-terminal domain crucial for maintaining stereocilia structure (Fang2015The). These structural features enable myosin XVA to perform its role in stereocilia protein trafficking and actin dynamics regulation.

## Function
The MYO15A gene encodes a myosin motor protein that is crucial for the elongation and maintenance of stereocilia in sensory hair cells of the inner ear. This protein, myosin XVA, plays a significant role in the proper formation and function of hair bundles, which are essential for hearing. MYO15A is involved in specifying the height of stereocilia and is necessary for the maturation and maintenance of these structures (Houdusse2021The).

MYO15A functions by transporting proteins such as whirlin and EPS8 to the tips of stereocilia, facilitating the extension of actin bundles. This transport is critical for maintaining the proper architecture of stereocilia, which are actin-based protrusions that convert mechanical signals into electrical signals in the auditory system (Cirilo2021Functional; Houdusse2021The). The gene has two isoforms, MYO15A-L and MYO15A-S, which are differentially localized during development, suggesting distinct roles in stereocilia elongation and maintenance (Houdusse2021The).

Mutations in MYO15A can lead to nonsyndromic hearing loss due to defects in stereocilia morphology, highlighting its essential role in auditory function (Cirilo2021Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYO15A gene are associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL), particularly the DFNB3 phenotype. These mutations can lead to severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss due to their impact on the development and elongation of stereocilia in cochlear hair cells, which are essential for normal auditory function (Yang2022Addition; Nal2007Mutational). MYO15A mutations are the third most frequent cause of ARNSHL in the Iranian population, following GJB2 and SLC26A4 (Mehregan2019Novel). 

The gene encodes myosin XVa, a motor protein that localizes to the tips of cochlear and vestibular hair cell stereocilia, crucial for detecting sound and head movement. Disruptions in this process due to MYO15A mutations can result in short stereocilia and auditory and vestibular dysfunctions (Mehregan2019Novel). The clinical presentation of MYO15A-related hearing loss can vary, with some individuals experiencing congenital, severe to profound hearing loss, while others may have milder phenotypes with residual hearing at low frequencies (Zhang2019Genotypephenotype). 

Cochlear implantation has been shown to be a successful intervention for individuals with MYO15A-associated hearing loss, highlighting the potential for treatment despite the genetic basis of the condition (Yang2022Addition; Miyagawa2015Mutations).

## Interactions
MYO15A, encoding the motor protein myosin XVa, is involved in several critical protein interactions essential for the development and function of stereocilia in the inner ear. Myosin XVa interacts directly with whirlin, a scaffold protein, at the tips of stereocilia. This interaction is crucial for hair bundle growth and involves the C-terminal MyTH4-FERM tail fragment of myosin XVa binding to specific regions of whirlin, such as the PR region and the PDZ1-PDZ2 region (Delprat2004Myosin). The SH3-MyTH4 region of myosin XVa also binds to the short isoform of whirlin, which can rescue growth defects in whirlin-deficient models (Delprat2004Myosin).

Myosin XVa also interacts with EPS8, an actin-binding and actin-capping protein, which is necessary for hearing. This interaction is part of a complex network that regulates actin filament elongation and stereocilia cohesion (Rehman2016Mutational). Additionally, myosin XVa is involved in a network with proteins like whirlin, EPS8, GPSM2, and GNAI3, forming an "elongation network" necessary for stereocilia biogenesis and the regulation of F-actin assembly (Gong2021Structural). These interactions highlight the role of MYO15A in auditory function and its impact when mutated.
