# F2RL2

## Overview
F2RL2 is a gene that encodes the protein known as protease-activated receptor 3 (PAR3), which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a hallmark of GPCRs, and plays a crucial role in thrombin signaling. PAR3 is primarily involved in the coagulation cascade, where it is activated by thrombin, leading to various intracellular signaling pathways. Although it is expressed at lower levels in human platelets compared to other protease-activated receptors, PAR3 is highly expressed in mouse platelets, where it modulates the sensitivity and response of other thrombin receptors. The gene's structure includes a small exon and a large exon, separated by a small intron, which contributes to its unique functional properties (Arachiche2017The; Chandrabalan2021Molecular).

## Structure
The F2RL2 gene encodes the protease-activated receptor 3 (PAR3), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. PAR3 is characterized by a primary structure consisting of 373 amino acids, with a sequence identity of 27% shared with PAR1 (Arachiche2017The). The protein features a seven transmembrane domain typical of GPCRs, along with an extracellular N-terminal domain, three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and an intracellular C-terminal domain (Chandrabalan2021Molecular). 

The N-terminal domain of PAR3 contains two thrombin recognition sites, including a cleavage site at lysine 38 and a hirudin-like sequence that binds thrombin's exosite I (Arachiche2017The). The C-terminal tail of PAR3 is notably shorter than that of PAR1, which likely influences its signaling capabilities (Arachiche2017The). 

PAR3 is involved in thrombin signaling and is expressed at lower levels on human platelets compared to PAR1. It does not have a defined signaling role in human platelets but is highly expressed in mouse platelets, where it regulates the sensitivity and response of PAR4 to thrombin (Arachiche2017The). The genomic structure of F2RL2 includes one small exon and one large exon, separated by a small intron of approximately 4.5 kb (Arachiche2017The).

## Clinical Significance
F2RL2, also known as Protease-Activated Receptor 3 (PAR3), has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), F2RL2 is identified as a hub gene related to CD4+ memory T cell infiltration, serving as a prognostic marker. Down-regulation of F2RL2 expression in rectal cancer has been observed, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression and prognosis (Tang2022Identification). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), F2RL2 is elevated in tumors and is considered a potential biomarker for early diagnosis, with its expression linked to tumor initiation and progression (Ren2023A).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), F2RL2 is noted as a promising biomarker, although it is rarely reported in glioma studies. It is involved in inflammatory reactions and immune responses, contributing to tumorigenesis and metastasis (Zhou2022A). In papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), F2RL2 showed the highest fold change among genes studied, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker for recurrence (BarrosFilho2020GADD45B). Additionally, F2RL2 is upregulated in prostate cancer among African American patients, suggesting a role in differential expression patterns between populations (Stevens2023Genomic).

## Interactions
The F2RL2 gene encodes the protease-activated receptor-3 (PAR3), which is involved in various protein interactions, particularly within the coagulation cascade. PAR3 is activated by thrombin, a key enzyme in the coagulation pathway, which cleaves the receptor to expose a tethered ligand that initiates intracellular signaling. This activation leads to insulin secretion through the phospholipase C pathway and calcium release from intracellular stores, highlighting its role in cellular signaling related to type 2 diabetes (Hänzelmann2015Thrombin).

F2RL2 is also associated with other proteins in the coagulation pathway, such as Coagulation Factor V (F5) and Protein C inhibitor (SERPINA5), as indicated by evolutionary rate covariation studies. These interactions suggest a role in the regulation of thrombin activity and potential implications in conditions like COVID-19, where systemic coagulopathy is a concern (Varela2021Evolutionary).

The receptor is part of a family of protease-activated receptors that can form complexes with other PARs, influencing thrombin signaling and interacting with G-proteins to affect various intracellular pathways. These interactions underscore the receptor's involvement in both coagulation and broader cellular signaling processes (Hänzelmann2015Thrombin).
