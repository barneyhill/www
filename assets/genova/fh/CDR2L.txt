# CDR2L

## Overview
CDR2L, or cerebellar degeneration related protein 2 like, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle regulation. The CDR2L protein is categorized as a regulatory protein, interacting with ribosomal proteins and playing a crucial role in maintaining normal ribosomal function and protein synthesis. It is implicated in pathways related to DNA replication, RNA processing, and cell cycle progression, and is known to interact with key cell cycle regulators such as Aurora kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases. CDR2L is also associated with calcium homeostasis in Purkinje cells, which may influence synaptic integrity and function. Clinically, CDR2L is significant in the context of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, where it is a target of the onconeural anti-Yo antibody, leading to autoimmune attacks on neural tissues (Schubert2014Paraneoplastic; Solheim2024Multiomics).

## Function
CDR2L (cerebellar degeneration related protein 2 like) is involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. In healthy human cells, CDR2L localizes to ribosomes and interacts with ribosomal proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining normal ribosomal function and protein synthesis. The protein is implicated in the regulation of pathways related to ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication, and RNA processing, which are upregulated at the transcript level, while pathways related to the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis are downregulated at the protein level (Solheim2024Multiomics).

CDR2L also interacts with key cell cycle regulators, including Aurora kinases, checkpoint regulators, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases, supporting cell cycle progression and preventing apoptosis in healthy cells (Solheim2024Multiomics). It is involved in c-Myc-dependent transcription, which is crucial for cell proliferation, and affects the balance of mRNAs and proteins in the cell (Solheim2024Multiomics). Additionally, CDR2L is associated with calcium homeostasis in Purkinje cells, potentially influencing synaptic integrity and function (Schubert2014Paraneoplastic). These functions highlight CDR2L's importance in cellular homeostasis and its potential impact on neurodegenerative processes.

## Clinical Significance
CDR2L is clinically significant in the context of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by tumor-induced autoimmunity against neural antigens, leading to the degeneration of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum. CDR2L is a major target of the onconeural anti-Yo antibody in PCD, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own neurons (Solheim2024Multiomics). Mutations or gains in the CDR2L gene, leading to higher protein expression or missense mutations, are characteristic of ovarian tumors associated with PCD and anti-Yo antibodies. These genetic alterations are not found in other ovarian carcinomas and may trigger immune tolerance breakdown, initiating autoimmune disease (Yshii2020Immunological).

The knockout of CDR2L in ovarian cancer cells results in dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and impaired cell proliferation, suggesting its role in cancer biology (Solheim2024Multiomics). CDR2L interacts with ribosomal proteins and affects the expression of multiple ribosome biogenesis factors, RNA processing factors, and translation initiation factors, indicating its involvement in maintaining the balance of protein synthesis and degradation (Solheim2024Multiomics). These interactions and alterations in CDR2L expression are implicated in the pathogenesis of PCD and potentially other neurological conditions (Solheim2024Multiomics).

## Interactions
CDR2L interacts with a variety of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, cell cycle regulation, and protein synthesis. In ovarian cancer cells, CDR2L has been shown to interact with ribosome biogenesis factors such as HEATR1, GTPBP4, PA2G4, PDCD11, SBDS, and UTP20, as well as nucleolar proteins like NOP56 and NOP58 (Solheim2024Multiomics). It also interacts with RNA helicases including DDX17, DDX21, DDX3X, and DHX29, and WD repeat-containing proteins such as WDR18, WDR36, and WDR43 (Solheim2024Multiomics). 

CDR2L is associated with several eukaryotic initiation factors, including EIF4G2, EIF2A, EIF3L, and EIF6, and cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, suggesting a role in protein synthesis and cell cycle progression (Solheim2024Multiomics). It also interacts with components of the minichromosome maintenance protein complex, including MCM2, MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, and MCM7 (Solheim2024Multiomics). 

In the context of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, CDR2L antibodies have been shown to affect calcium signaling pathways in Purkinje cells, interacting with proteins like PKCγ and calpain-2, which are associated with neuronal death pathways (Schubert2014Paraneoplastic). These interactions highlight CDR2L's involvement in both cancer and neurological conditions.
