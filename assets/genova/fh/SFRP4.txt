# SFRP4

## Overview
SFRP4, or secreted frizzled-related protein 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the SFRP family, which is known for its role in modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. The protein SFRP4 functions as an extracellular antagonist of Wnt signaling, primarily by binding to Wnt ligands and preventing their interaction with Frizzled receptors. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for maintaining cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. SFRP4 is characterized by its cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and netrin-like domain (NLD), which are essential for its interaction with Wnt ligands and its biological functions. The gene and its encoded protein have been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including adipogenesis, metabolic disorders, and cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and biomarker in disease contexts (Perumal2017The; Yam2005Genomic; Guan2018Differential).

## Structure
The secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is characterized by its distinct molecular structure, which includes two primary domains: a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and a netrin-like domain (NLD). The CRD is homologous to the Wnt-binding site of Frizzled receptors and plays a crucial role in modulating Wnt signaling by acting as an antagonist (Perumal2017The; Yam2005Genomic). The NLD is implicated in matrix stability and cell motility, and recent studies have highlighted its role in mediating biological effects, such as inhibiting cell proliferation and migration in mesothelioma cells (Perumal2017The).

SFRP4 is secreted and can undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which may affect its stability and function. The protein may exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which results in transcripts with truncated open reading frames. Despite these truncations, the CRD and NLD domains remain preserved across variants, indicating their essential functional roles (Yam2005Genomic). The full-length protein is involved in various biological processes, including apoptosis and carcinogenesis, and is regulated by transcriptional factors such as CREB (Yam2005Genomic).

## Function
Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is a member of the SFRP family that modulates Wnt signaling, a pathway crucial for various cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. SFRP4 acts as an extracellular antagonist of Wnt signaling by binding to Wnt ligands, thereby preventing their interaction with Frizzled receptors. This regulation is essential for maintaining tissue development and homeostasis, particularly in bone and adipose tissue (Guan2018Differential).

In adipose tissue, SFRP4 plays a significant role in adipocyte differentiation. It is involved in the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes, with its expression increasing during this process, especially in visceral adipose tissue (Guan2018Differential). SFRP4 has a depot-specific role in adipogenesis, promoting differentiation in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) while having an inhibitory role in the early stages of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) adipogenesis (Guan2018Differential).

SFRP4 is also associated with metabolic functions, as its elevated levels are linked to insulin resistance and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. It influences glucose tolerance and insulin secretion, indicating its involvement in metabolic homeostasis (Guan2018Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SFRP4 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In breast cancer, SFRP4 is generally downregulated, and its overexpression is associated with a favorable prognosis, including longer overall survival and better relapse-free survival. This suggests that SFRP4 could serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in breast cancer (Wu2020Comprehensive). In endometrial stromal sarcomas, SFRP4 is significantly downregulated, correlating with increased β-catenin levels, which are involved in tumorigenesis. This downregulation suggests a potential tumor suppressor role for SFRP4 in these sarcomas (Hrzenjak2004Inverse).

In gliomas, particularly high-grade astrocytomas, SFRP4 expression is reduced, which may contribute to the loss of its antagonistic role in Wnt signaling, a pathway crucial in glioma pathogenesis (Kafka2024SFRP4). In prostate cancer, specific polymorphisms in the SFRP4 gene are associated with increased cancer risk, and increased expression of SFRP4 is observed in certain genotypes, indicating its potential role in the disease's etiology (NATARAJAN2020Study).

SFRP4 mutations have also been linked to Pyle disease, a rare genetic disorder characterized by bone abnormalities. Compound heterozygous missense mutations in SFRP4 have been identified in individuals with this condition, highlighting its importance in skeletal development (SowińskaSeidler2020The).

## Interactions
Secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is known to interact with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors. SFRP4 modulates Wnt signaling by binding to Wnt ligands, such as Wnt3a, thereby preventing their interaction with Frizzled receptors. This interaction inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including proliferation and differentiation (Perumal2017The; Bukhari2019Secreted).

SFRP4 contains a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) and a netrin-like domain (NLD), both of which play roles in its interactions. The CRD is essential for antagonizing Wnt ligands, while the NLD is involved in Wnt binding and can induce apoptosis and increase intracellular calcium levels, activating Wnt/Ca2+ signaling (Bukhari2019Secreted). In mesothelioma cells, SFRP4 interacts with Wnt3a, leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration, primarily through its NLD (Perumal2017The).

In prostate cancer, SFRP4 overexpression is associated with increased localization of β-catenin and cadherins to the cell membrane, suggesting a role in modulating cell adhesion and reducing metastatic potential (Horvath2007Secreted). These interactions highlight SFRP4's role as a regulator of Wnt signaling and its potential therapeutic implications in cancer.
