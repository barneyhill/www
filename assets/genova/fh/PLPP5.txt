# PLPP5

## Overview
PLPP5, or phospholipid phosphatase 5, is a gene that encodes a member of the phospholipid phosphatase family, which is involved in the regulation of lipid signaling pathways. The protein product of PLPP5 is an enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by dephosphorylating phospholipids, thereby influencing cellular processes such as membrane dynamics and signal transduction. This enzyme is particularly important in the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, impacting cellular homeostasis and cell growth. PLPP5 is active in cellular membranes and is involved in the metabolism of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid that affects cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The gene's expression is dynamically regulated, especially in response to muscle injury, suggesting its involvement in tissue repair and regeneration processes (Contreras2023Singlecell).

## Function
PLPP5 (phospholipid phosphatase 5) is involved in the regulation of lipid signaling pathways, primarily through its enzymatic activity in dephosphorylating phospholipids. It plays a crucial role in converting phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol, which impacts cellular processes such as membrane dynamics and signal transduction. This activity is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and influencing cell growth and survival (Contreras2023Singlecell).

In healthy human cells, PLPP5 is active in cellular membranes, where it participates in the metabolism of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive phospholipid involved in cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The enzyme's role in LPA catabolism is particularly noted in fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) and tenocytes, indicating its involvement in muscle regeneration and the regulation of LPA signaling during tissue repair processes (Contreras2023Singlecell).

PLPP5's expression is dynamically regulated in response to muscle injury, with transient downregulation observed following damage and recovery at later regenerative stages. This suggests that PLPP5 may influence the activation and proliferation of progenitor cells during muscle regeneration, contributing to the cellular response to tissue damage (Contreras2023Singlecell).

## Clinical Significance
PLPP5, also known as phospholipid phosphatase 5, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in regulating cancer-related signaling pathways. In breast cancer, PLPP5 is involved in the JAK/STAT, MAPK, and protein kinase C pathways. Its overexpression is associated with increased cell proliferation and survival, while its knockdown leads to decreased growth and increased apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines (Zhao2023Singlecell; Voutsadakis2021Amplification). PLPP5 is also amplified and overexpressed in pancreatic and small cell lung cancer cell lines, promoting cell proliferation and survival (Voutsadakis2021Amplification).

The gene is located in the chromosomal region 8p11.23, which is frequently amplified in various cancers, including breast, squamous lung, esophageal, and urothelial carcinomas. This amplification is particularly noted in the luminal B subtype of breast cancer and is associated with increased distant recurrence events (Voutsadakis2021Amplification). In Chinese breast cancer patients, PLPP5 is frequently affected by copy number variations, with a frequency of 6% (Lang2020Characterization).

PLPP5 has also been suggested as a potential biomarker for major depressive disorder, particularly in middle-aged and older patients, although its role in this condition is less well-defined (Yamagata2017Identification).
