# SLC22A17

## Overview
SLC22A17 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 22 member 17, which is a part of the solute carrier family 22. This protein functions primarily as a receptor, specifically known as the lipocalin-2 receptor, and is involved in the endocytosis of iron-bound lipocalin, playing a crucial role in iron homeostasis (Engelhart2019Reclassification). Unlike typical members of its family, SLC22A17 has a unique structural topology with only nine transmembrane regions, which may influence its transport mechanisms and binding sites (Jacobsson2007Identification). The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney and brain, where it contributes to nutrient absorption, waste removal, and immune responses (Nigam2018The; Yee2021Emerging). Additionally, SLC22A17 is implicated in several pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and various cancers, where its expression and interaction with other proteins can affect disease progression and serve as potential therapeutic targets (Siddiqui2023Nerve; Lavoro2024Identification).

## Structure
The SLC22A17 protein, part of the solute carrier family 22, exhibits a unique molecular structure compared to other family members. It features an all-α architecture with a large transmembrane central helical bundle, an intracellular small helical domain, and two extracellular loop regions (Garrido‐Arandia2019Interaction). Unlike typical SLC22 family members, which generally have 12 transmembrane domains, SLC22A17 has a deviant topology with only 9 transmembrane regions (Jacobsson2007Identification). This structural deviation suggests potential differences in transport mechanisms and binding sites.

The protein's interaction with the allergen Alt a 1 involves a symmetrical arrangement of the Alt a 1 tetramer on the receptor, with specific contact regions (Garrido‐Arandia2019Interaction). The structural model of SLC22A17 includes contributions from polar residues such as S150, S151, and T152 in the extracellular domain, which may be crucial for recognition by SLC22A17 (Garrido‐Arandia2019Interaction). SLC22A17 is also known as the lipocalin-2 receptor, involved in endocytosis of iron-bound lipocalin, indicating its role in iron homeostasis (Engelhart2019Reclassification). The protein's structure and function are influenced by its role as an endocytosed receptor rather than a typical transporter.

## Function
SLC22A17, a member of the solute carrier family 22, functions primarily as a receptor for lipocalin-2 (LCN2), also known as NGAL. This interaction is crucial for the endocytosis of iron-free and iron-bound lipocalin, indicating a role in iron transport and homeostasis (Nigam2018The). The protein is highly expressed in the choroid plexus, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of iron levels in the brain (Nigam2018The).

In healthy human cells, SLC22A17 is implicated in the transport of organic ions across cell membranes, influencing nutrient absorption and waste removal. It is primarily active in the kidney and brain, where it plays a role in cellular uptake and detoxification processes (Yee2021Emerging). The protein's function extends beyond classical organic anion transporters, as it is involved in broader physiological processes such as cell differentiation and systemic homeostasis (Nigam2018The).

SLC22A17 also interacts with allergens, such as Alt a 1 from the fungus Alternaria, in the airway epithelium. This interaction can lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, indicating a role in immune responses and potential implications for respiratory allergies (Garrido‐Arandia2019Interaction).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SLC22A17 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and various cancers. In the context of AD, elevated levels of Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), which interacts with the SLC22A17 receptor, are associated with reduced neurogenic capacity and the presence of neuritic plaques. This suggests that targeting the SLC22A17 receptor could enhance neurogenesis and potentially reduce amyloid pathology and Tau phosphorylation in AD, offering a potential therapeutic route (Siddiqui2023Nerve; Siddiqui2022Ngfr).

In cancer, SLC22A17 expression is dysregulated across multiple types, including cutaneous melanoma (CM), where it is significantly downregulated. DNA methylation patterns in the SLC22A17 gene, particularly hypomethylation in promoter regions and hypermethylation in body regions, have been identified as potential biomarkers for CM. These methylation changes are associated with the gene's expression and may influence cancer progression and prognosis (Lavoro2024Identification). Additionally, SLC22A17 has been linked to other malignancies such as glioma, endometrial cancer, and gastric cancer, where its altered expression may play a role in disease pathogenesis (Schröder2023Lipocalin).

## Interactions
SLC22A17, also known as solute carrier family 22 member 17, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function and role in various biological processes. One significant interaction is with the Alt a 1 protein, a major allergen from the fungus Alternaria alternata. This interaction occurs in the human airway epithelium, where Alt a 1 binds to SLC22A17, facilitating its transport through the epithelial monolayer and inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL8, IL33, and IL25. This interaction is crucial for understanding the allergen's entry into cells and its role in immune responses (Garrido‐Arandia2019Interaction).

SLC22A17 also interacts with siderocalin, a natural ligand, which competes with Alt a 1 for binding. This competitive binding suggests that siderocalin can inhibit the interaction between Alt a 1 and SLC22A17 (Garrido‐Arandia2019Interaction).

In the context of cancer, SLC22A17 is part of a network involving LCN2 and MMP9, where it is negatively correlated with these proteins in tumor samples, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression (Candido2022Bioinformatic). Additionally, SLC22A17 is involved in iron homeostasis through its interaction with NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), affecting tumor cell survival and apoptosis (Candido2022Bioinformatic).
