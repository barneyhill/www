# PCBP2

## Overview
PCBP2, or poly(rC)-binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including mRNA stabilization, translation regulation, and iron homeostasis. The protein, categorized as an RNA-binding protein, is characterized by its three K-homology (KH) domains, which facilitate its interaction with pyrimidine-rich sequences in mRNA, thereby influencing mRNA stability and translation (Yuan2021Advances; Du2007Xray). PCBP2 plays a critical role in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway, impacting cell growth and proliferation (Li2016Poly(rC)). Additionally, it functions as a molecular chaperone for intracellular iron, highlighting its diverse roles in cellular homeostasis (Yuan2021Advances). The protein's involvement in various interactions with nucleic acids and proteins underscores its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer and placental development disorders (Georgiadou2021Knockdown; Han2013RNAbinding).

## Structure
PCBP2, or poly(rC)-binding protein 2, is characterized by its three K-homology (KH) domains, which are essential for its RNA-binding capabilities. Each KH domain follows a β1α1α2β2β3α3 motif, consisting of three alpha helices and an antiparallel beta sheet, contributing to the protein's secondary structure (Yuan2021Advances). The KH1 domain can dimerize, forming a homodimer through strong intermolecular interactions, which include an anti-parallel arrangement of the longest alpha helix and beta strand, resulting in a six-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet (Du2007Xray). This dimerization is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions involving specific residues such as Leu-14, Ile-16, and Phe-72 (Du2007Xray).

The KH domains are separated by variable length insert sequences, and the KH1 domain can interact with the KH2 domain, suggesting a dynamic quaternary structure (Yuan2021Advances; Du2007Xray). PCBP2 also contains two nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, with NLS1 located between the KH2 and KH3 domains, and NLS II on the KH3 domain, facilitating its nuclear localization (Yuan2021Advances). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and interactions. Alternative splicing may result in different isoforms, potentially altering its structure and function.

## Function
Poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in mRNA regulation by binding to pyrimidine-rich regions in the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, such as α-globin and β-globin, enhancing their stability. PCBP2 also negatively regulates the mRNA expression of G protein-coupled receptor 56 (GPR56) by promoting mRNA degradation, acting as an anti-hypertrophic factor in cardiomyocytes (Yuan2021Advances).

PCBP2 is crucial in the Hippo signaling pathway, which regulates cell growth and proliferation. It interacts with core components of the Hippo pathway, including Mst1, Mst2, and Sav1, stabilizing Mst1 and preventing its cleavage, which enhances Hippo signaling and suppresses the activity of transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (Li2016Poly(rC)Binding page 0 of 8; Li2016Poly(rC)Binding page 4 of 8). This regulation is essential for controlling cell growth and preventing excessive proliferation (Li2016Poly(rC)Binding page 6 of 8).

Beyond mRNA regulation, PCBP2 functions as a molecular chaperone for intracellular iron, facilitating iron entry into ferritin and regulating iron transport through interactions with divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and ferroportin (Yuan2021Advances). These activities highlight PCBP2's critical role in maintaining mRNA stability, translation, and iron homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
PCBP2 (poly(rC) binding protein 2) has significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly in cancer and placental development disorders. In cancer, PCBP2 is often overexpressed and contributes to tumor progression. In glioma, PCBP2 is upregulated in advanced stages, promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis, which correlates with poorer prognosis (Yuan2021Advances; Han2013RNAbinding). In breast cancer, PCBP2 protein levels are increased due to post-transcriptional modifications, enhancing oncogenic and metastatic capacities (Wang2021PCBP2Posttranscriptional). High PCBP2 expression is also linked to poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it contributes to cell growth and resistance to sorafenib treatment (Zhang2016Overexpression).

In placental development, PCBP2 plays a crucial role in extravillous trophoblast (EVT) differentiation. Its knockdown disrupts EVT differentiation, which is essential for proper placental development, potentially contributing to pregnancy complications like HELLP syndrome (Georgiadou2021Knockdown). These findings highlight PCBP2's potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in various cancers and its role in placental development disorders.

## Interactions
PCBP2, or poly(C)-binding protein 2, is involved in various interactions with both proteins and nucleic acids. It contains three KH domains that are crucial for binding poly(C) sequences in DNA and RNA with high specificity. The KH1 and KH2 domains of PCBP2 can form an intramolecular pseudodimer, which is significant for its regulatory functions. This pseudodimerization involves a large hydrophobic surface that facilitates protein-protein interactions, while the opposite surface is available for D/RNA binding (Du2008Structure).

PCBP2 interacts with C-rich sequences in mRNAs, such as those found in α-globin and β-globin mRNAs, stabilizing them and influencing their translation. It also binds to C-rich sequences in viral RNAs, such as poliovirus mRNA, affecting viral translation and replication (Du2005Crystal; Du2008Structure). The KH1 domain of PCBP2 has been shown to interact with a 7-nucleotide DNA sequence, specifically recognizing cytosine residues through hydrogen bonds, which suggests a role in telomere/telomerase regulation (Du2005Crystal).

In glioma cells, PCBP2 interacts with mRNAs involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation, such as FHL3, modulating their expression and impacting glioma growth (Han2013RNAbinding).
