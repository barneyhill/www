# PIGC

## Overview
The PIGC gene encodes the phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class C protein, a critical component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycan transferase enzyme complex. This protein is integral to the biosynthesis of GPI anchors, which are essential glycolipids that attach proteins to the cell membrane, facilitating various cellular processes such as protein sorting, trafficking, and signal transduction (Wu2020The; Zhao2022Phosphatidylinositol). The PIGC protein is characterized by its transmembrane nature, with eight hydrophobic regions that anchor it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where it plays a scaffolding role in the GPI-GnT complex (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes). Mutations in the PIGC gene can lead to defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis, resulting in clinical conditions such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis defect-16 (GPIBD 16) and have been implicated in cancer progression, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhao2022Phosphatidylinositol; Edvardson2016Mutations).

## Function
The PIGC gene encodes a protein that is a crucial subunit of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycan transferase (GPI-GnT) enzyme complex, which is involved in the biosynthesis of GPI anchors. These anchors are glycolipids that tether proteins to the cell membrane, playing significant roles in protein sorting, trafficking, and signal transduction (Wu2020The; Zhao2022Phosphatidylinositol). The PIGC protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it participates in the initial steps of GPI anchor formation. This process involves the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI), a critical step in the GPI biosynthesis pathway (Murakami2005The; Tiede1999Biosynthesis).

In healthy human cells, the proper function of PIGC ensures the stability and function of GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface, which are involved in various cellular processes, including immune response and cell signaling (Wu2020The; Zhao2022Phosphatidylinositol). Mutations in the PIGC gene can disrupt this pathway, leading to defects in GPI anchor biosynthesis and associated clinical conditions, such as glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis defect-16 (GPIBD 16) (Wu2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIGC gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis. Defects in this process can lead to inherited GPI deficiency (IGD) syndromes, which often present with developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. Specifically, mutations such as homozygous p.L189W and compound heterozygous p.L212P/p.R21X have been identified in patients exhibiting global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, and drug-responsive seizure disorders (Edvardson2016Mutations). These mutations impair the biosynthesis of GPI anchors, resulting in reduced surface expression of GPI-anchored proteins (Edvardson2016Mutations).

Alterations in PIGC expression levels have also been linked to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High PIGC expression is associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including overall survival and disease-free survival, and is correlated with immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (Zhao2022Phosphatidylinositol). These findings suggest that PIGC not only plays a role in genetic disorders but also in cancer progression, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in HCC (Zhao2022Phosphatidylinositol).

## Interactions
PIGC, a key component in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, participates in several critical protein interactions. It forms a complex with PIG-A, PIG-H, and hGPI1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is essential for the first step of GPI biosynthesis. This complex exhibits GPI-GlcNAc transferase activity, crucial for transferring GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI) (Watanabe1998The). PIGC does not directly associate with PIG-L, which is involved in the subsequent step of GPI synthesis, indicating that the first and second steps are independent (Watanabe1998The).

PIGC is also characterized by its hydrophobic nature, with eight transmembrane regions, and it plays a scaffolding role, anchoring the transferase complex to the ER membrane. This structural role facilitates interactions with other protein components, maintaining the integrity and proper localization of the complex (Eisenhaber2003Enzymes). Although direct pairwise interactions between PIGC and PIG-A or PIG-H were not detected, the presence of hGPI1 stabilizes the complex, underscoring hGPI1's role in facilitating these interactions (Watanabe1998The).
