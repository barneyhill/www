# WTAP

## Overview
WTAP (Wilms' tumor 1 associated protein) is a gene that encodes a nuclear protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA processing and cell cycle regulation. The WTAP protein is a key component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, which is responsible for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNA, a critical process affecting mRNA stability, splicing, and translation. Structurally, WTAP forms a homodimer and interacts with other proteins such as METTL3 and METTL14 to facilitate m6A methylation. It also plays a role in alternative splicing and is essential for normal cellular function and early embryonic development. WTAP's involvement in RNA processing and its interactions with various proteins underscore its importance in gene expression regulation. Clinically, WTAP is implicated in several cancers, where its dysregulation can contribute to tumor progression and chemoresistance (Xie2019Physiological; Schöller2018Interactions; Horiuchi2013Identification).

## Structure
The WTAP protein forms a saddle-shaped homodimer through coiled-coil interactions, with each monomer consisting of four tandem helices (H1-H4) and three linkers (L1-L3) (Su2022Cryo-EM). The dimerization is facilitated by strong monomer-monomer interactions, including an interface area of approximately 4620 Å², comprising three salt bridges, eight hydrogen bonds, and extensive non-bonded contacts (Su2022Cryo-EM). WTAP has a positively charged patch around the H2-L2-H3 turn, composed of highly conserved residues, indicating functional importance (Su2022Cryo-EM).

The secondary structure features a sharp turn between helices H2 and H3 at a 53° angle, stabilized by two hydrophobic cores involving residues such as W145, F147, and L142 (Su2022Cryo-EM). The tertiary structure includes a hydrophobic ring around W145 and π-π stacking interactions between F147 and P149 (Su2022Cryo-EM).

In the quaternary structure, WTAP forms an asymmetric homodimer with VIRMA, adopting a flag-and-pole-like architecture within the m6A writer complex (Yan2022AIempowered). WTAP interacts with METTL3 and METTL14, forming a complex crucial for m6A writer activity (Su2022Cryo-EM). The N-terminal region of WTAP includes a nuclear localization signal essential for its nuclear import and interaction with METTL3 (Schöller2018Interactions).

## Function
WTAP (WT1 associated protein) is a nuclear protein that plays a significant role in RNA processing and cell cycle regulation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the stabilization of cyclin A2 mRNA, which is crucial for the G2/M transition in the cell cycle, thereby influencing cell proliferation (Horiuchi2013Identification; Horiuchi2006Wilms’). WTAP forms a complex with several splicing regulators, including BCLAF1 and THRAP3, and localizes to nuclear speckles, which are sites of gene expression regulation (Horiuchi2013Identification). This complex is implicated in post-transcriptional regulation processes such as pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stabilization, polyadenylation, and mRNA export (Horiuchi2013Identification).

WTAP is also a component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, which catalyzes N6-methyladenosine (m6A) formation, affecting mRNA stability and degradation (Xie2019Physiological). It acts as a splicing regulator, contributing to proteome diversity by being involved in the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA species (Xie2019Physiological). WTAP's role in alternative splicing and cell cycle regulation is evolutionarily conserved and is critical for early embryo development and normal cellular function (Horiuchi2013Identification).

## Clinical Significance
WTAP (WT1 associated protein) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in RNA methylation and gene expression regulation. In endometrial carcinoma, WTAP is upregulated, activating the NF-κB pathway and contributing to chemoresistance to cisplatin (Huang2022The). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), WTAP overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and correlates with FLT3-ITD mutations, affecting m6A methylation of MYC mRNA and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (Naren2020High). In colorectal cancer, WTAP interacts with CA4, influencing the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, crucial for cancer progression (Xie2019Physiological; Huang2022The).

WTAP is also overexpressed in gastric cancer, where it is linked to poor prognosis and influences tumor-associated T lymphocyte infiltration (Li2020High). In hepatocellular carcinoma, WTAP promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition, contributing to cancer progression (Liu2021miR1395p). Additionally, WTAP gene variants are associated with hepatoblastoma susceptibility, particularly in young children (Zhuo2020WTAP). These findings highlight WTAP's significant role in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
WTAP (WT1 associated protein) is involved in several key interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and m6A methylation. WTAP is a crucial component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, where it interacts with METTL3 and METTL14 to facilitate m6A modifications on mRNAs. This complex is essential for mRNA stability, localization, and translation efficiency (Schöller2018Interactions). WTAP's interaction with METTL3 is mediated by the first 150 amino acids, particularly the N-terminal coiled coil region, while the leader helix at the N terminus of METTL3 serves as the interaction surface for WTAP (Schöller2018Interactions).

WTAP also interacts with the circular RNA circ0008399 in bladder cancer cells, promoting the assembly of the WTAP/METTL3/METTL14 complex, which enhances global m6A modification levels. This interaction is crucial for the stability and expression of certain mRNAs, such as TNFAIP3, contributing to cancer cell survival and chemoresistance (Wei2021Circ0008399).

Additionally, WTAP associates with the Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) protein, interacting specifically with the C-terminus of WT1. This interaction is confirmed both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a potential role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing (Little2000Identification). WTAP is also part of a complex known as MACOM, which includes proteins like Virma, Hakai, Rbm15, and Zc3h13, indicating functions beyond m6A methylation (Sorci2018METTL3).
