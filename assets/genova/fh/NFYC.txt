# NFYC

## Overview
The NFYC gene encodes the nuclear transcription factor Y subunit gamma, a critical component of the NF-Y transcription factor complex. This complex is a heterotrimer composed of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression by binding to CCAAT motifs in DNA. The NF-YC subunit, characterized by its histone fold motifs, is essential for dimerization with NF-YB and subsequent DNA binding, facilitating transcriptional regulation of genes involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and differentiation (Takenoyama2005A; Bernardini2018The). NFYC is implicated in oncogenesis and metabolic regulation, with its dysregulation associated with diseases such as liver hepatocellular carcinoma and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Bezzecchi2020NFY; Tan2021Systemic). Through its interactions with other transcription factors like c-MYC and p53, NFYC is integral to complex transcriptional networks, underscoring its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (chiaramonte2015biochemical).

## Structure
The NFYC gene encodes a subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor, which is a heterotrimeric complex composed of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits. The NF-YC subunit contains histone fold motifs that are essential for dimerization with NF-YB, facilitating the subsequent association with NF-YA for DNA binding (Takenoyama2005A). This histone fold domain is related to core histones H2A/H2B and is involved in DNA binding through interactions with backbone phosphates (Bernardini2018The).

The NF-YC subunit possesses two activation domains rich in glutamine and hydrophobic residues, spanning residues 150 to 335. These domains are crucial for cooperative interactions among NF-Y proteins and influence DNA curvature, which is significant for transcription regulation (Takenoyama2005A). A point mutation in the NFYC gene, resulting in a glutamine to lysine substitution at position 279, has been identified in a specific lung carcinoma case, generating a tumor-specific antigen recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes (Takenoyama2005A).

The NF-Y complex, including NF-YC, is involved in regulating cell-cycle promoters and has been implicated in oncogenesis, although specific structural details of NF-YC's tertiary structure are not provided in the available context (Takenoyama2005A).

## Function
NFYC is a subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor complex, which plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by binding to CCAAT motifs in DNA. This binding is essential for the transcriptional regulation of various genes, including those associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II, type I collagen, and albumin (chiaramonte2015biochemical). NFYC, along with NF-YB, forms a dimer that is structurally similar to histone proteins H2A and H2B, which is crucial for DNA binding and interaction with other transcription factors (chiaramonte2015biochemical).

The NF-Y complex, including NFYC, is involved in broader regulatory networks through its interaction with other transcription factors such as c-MYC and p53, suggesting its role in cell cycle regulation and cellular proliferation (chiaramonte2015biochemical). NFYC is also implicated in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and energy production, highlighting its role in metabolic pathways (chiaramonte2015biochemical).

In healthy human cells, NFYC is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression necessary for normal cellular functions, including cell cycle progression and differentiation (chiaramonte2015biochemical).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NFYC gene have been implicated in various cancers, particularly liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NFYC, along with other NF-Y subunits, is overexpressed in HCC, with significant expression noted in iCluster1 and iCluster3 subtypes. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, especially in tumors with TP53 mutations, which are prevalent in HBV-related HCC (Bezzecchi2020NFY). NFYC's role in cancer is further supported by its involvement in cell cycle regulation and its potential as an oncogene, as its inactivation can prevent the initiation and maintenance of certain cancers (Belluti2018An).

In addition to its role in cancer, NFYC is also implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). It is predicted to regulate a substantial number of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes involved in apoptosis, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of HCM through apoptosis regulation (Tan2021Systemic). The dysregulation of NFYC expression or its interactions may thus contribute to the development and progression of both cancer and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
NFYC, a subunit of the NF-Y transcription factor complex, plays a crucial role in gene regulation through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. NFYC forms a heterodimer with NFYB, which is essential for the recruitment of NFYA to form the complete NF-Y complex. This complex binds specifically to CCAAT motifs in DNA, a common element in eukaryotic promoters, influencing the transcription of various genes (Belluti2018An; Gnesutta2017Crystal).

NFYC also interacts with other transcription factors, such as c-MYC and p53, through its C-terminal alpha helix, which is important for these interactions (chiaramonte2015biochemical). In the context of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) transcription, NFYC interacts with Regulatory Factor X (RFX) proteins. Specifically, NFYC binds to RFXANK/B, which mediates the interaction between NFY and RFX, although NFYC does not directly interact with RFX5 or RFXAP (JabraneFerrat2002Major).

The NFYC gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms that may have distinct roles in transcriptional regulation, depending on the cell type (chiaramonte2015biochemical). These interactions highlight NFYC's role in complex transcriptional networks and its importance in cellular processes.
