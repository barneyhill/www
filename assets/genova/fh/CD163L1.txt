# CD163L1

## Overview
CD163L1, also known as CD163 molecule-like 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in the immune system, particularly within macrophages and monocytes. The protein encoded by CD163L1 is implicated in processes such as phagocytosis and apoptotic clearance, contributing to tissue repair and the resolution of inflammation. This protein is expressed in macrophages that exhibit high phagocytic activity and effective bacterial killing, while maintaining a non-inflammatory profile, especially in the gut mucosa. Such characteristics underscore its role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and modulating immune responses. CD163L1 is also part of the macrophage gene signature in inflamed tissues, such as those found in inflammatory bowel disease, where it is associated with tissue repair and inflammation resolution (Bsat2020A; Chapuy2020SingleCell).

## Structure


## Function
CD163L1, also known as CD163 molecule-like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in immune system functions, particularly in macrophages and monocytes. In healthy human cells, CD163L1 is part of a macrophage gene signature that includes other genes such as MERTK and STAB1, which are involved in phagocytosis and apoptotic clearance. This suggests a role in tissue repair and resolving inflammation, indicating its involvement in maintaining tissue homeostasis and modulating immune responses (Bsat2020A).

In the human gut mucosa, CD163L1 is expressed in macrophages that are highly phagocytic and have potent bacterial killing activity. These macrophages do not produce inflammatory cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation or phagocytosis, highlighting their role in maintaining homeostasis without promoting inflammation (Chapuy2020SingleCell). CD163L1 is also part of the gene signature of macrophages in the inflamed mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease patients, where it is associated with tissue repair and inflammation resolution (Chapuy2020SingleCell). These functions underscore the importance of CD163L1 in immune regulation and tissue maintenance in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
CD163L1, also known as CD163 molecule-like 1, plays a significant role in the immune response, and its expression or mutation can be linked to various inflammatory diseases and immune system disorders. Alterations in CD163L1 expression have been associated with chronic inflammation, which is a contributing factor in the development of atherosclerosis. This condition is characterized by the buildup of plaques in the arterial walls, leading to cardiovascular diseases. The gene's involvement in macrophage function suggests that any dysregulation could exacerbate inflammatory responses, potentially worsening conditions like atherosclerosis.

Mutations in CD163L1 may also impact its normal interactions within the immune system, leading to an impaired response to inflammation. This can result in a heightened susceptibility to inflammatory diseases, where the body's immune response becomes overactive or misdirected. Such dysregulation can contribute to the progression of chronic inflammatory conditions, highlighting the clinical significance of maintaining proper CD163L1 function and expression levels.

Understanding the clinical implications of CD163L1 mutations and expression alterations is crucial for developing targeted therapies for related inflammatory and immune disorders. Further research into this gene could provide insights into novel treatment strategies for managing these conditions.
