# ADAMTSL3

## Overview
ADAMTSL3 is a gene that encodes the ADAMTS-like 3 protein, also known as punctin-2, which is a member of the ADAMTS superfamily. Unlike other members of this family, ADAMTSL3 lacks a metalloprotease domain and does not exhibit proteolytic activity, categorizing it as a non-proteolytic glycoprotein involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions (Koo2007ADAMTSL3punctin‐2). The protein is characterized by its unique domain structure, including thrombospondin type 1 repeats, a cysteine-rich domain, and immunoglobulin-like domains, which suggest roles in cell-matrix interactions and ECM assembly (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2). ADAMTSL3 is expressed in various human tissues and is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including cardiovascular health, cancer, and neurological disorders (Rypdal2022ADAMTSL3; Dow2011ADAMTSL3). Its interactions with other ECM components, such as fibrillin-1 and latent TGFβ-binding protein 1, indicate a potential role in modulating TGFβ signaling and ECM stability (Rypdal2024Emerging).

## Structure
The ADAMTSL3 protein, also known as punctin-2, is a secreted glycoprotein that is part of the ADAMTS superfamily. It is composed of 1690 amino acids and features a signal peptide at the N-terminus, which facilitates its secretion into the extracellular matrix (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2). The protein's primary structure includes a series of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), a cysteine-rich domain, a spacer, and immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domains, which belong to the IgC2 subclass (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2). The TSRs are organized into two arrays separated by a region containing three Ig-like repeats (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2).

ADAMTSL3 lacks a metalloprotease domain, distinguishing it from other ADAMTS proteins, and does not exhibit proteolytic activity (Koo2007ADAMTSL3punctin‐2). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, with approximately 8-10% of its mass attributed to carbohydrates attached to asparagine residues (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2). The protein is expressed as a 210-kDa glycoprotein in transfected cells, larger than its predicted size due to these modifications (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2).

Alternative splicing of the ADAMTSL3 gene results in multiple isoforms, including ADAMTSL3a, ADAMTSL3b, ADAMTSL3c, and ADAMTSL3d, with variations in the C-terminal region affecting the presence of the PLAC domain (Dow2011ADAMTSL3).

## Function
ADAMTSL3, also known as punctin-2, is a glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of human tissues. It is part of the ADAMTS-like family, which is related to the ADAMTS family of metalloproteases but lacks the protease and disintegrin-like domains. ADAMTSL3 is characterized by its unique domain organization, including thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), a cysteine-rich domain, and a cysteine-free spacer domain, which suggest its involvement in cell-matrix interactions and ECM assembly (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2).

The protein is widely expressed in human tissues, particularly in the liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle, and is secreted into the ECM, where it may influence cell adhesion and migration (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2). ADAMTSL3 may interact with or regulate ADAMTS proteases, potentially by competing for substrate binding or enhancing enzyme activity, although these interactions have not been definitively shown (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2). The presence of TSRs, which are associated with anti-angiogenic properties, suggests a possible role in regulating angiogenesis (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2). The protein's structure and localization indicate it may provide substrate-binding ability to proteases, contributing to ECM organization and stability (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ADAMTSL3 gene have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In colorectal cancer, ADAMTSL3 is frequently mutated, and its mRNA levels are significantly reduced in tumor tissues compared to normal colon tissues. This reduction in expression is consistent across various stages and grades of colon carcinoma, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis (Koo2007ADAMTSL3punctin‐2).

ADAMTSL3 has also been associated with schizophrenia. Genome-wide association studies have identified a strong link between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADAMTSL3 and schizophrenia, with rs950169 being particularly notable for its role in mediating alternative splicing (Dow2011ADAMTSL3). However, replication studies have shown inconsistent results, indicating the complexity of genetic contributions to schizophrenia (Dow2011ADAMTSL3).

In cardiovascular conditions, ADAMTSL3 expression is increased in heart failure and is associated with cardiac remodeling. Knock-out mice lacking ADAMTSL3 exhibit exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and increased mortality under pressure overload, highlighting its cardioprotective role (Rypdal2022ADAMTSL3). These findings suggest that ADAMTSL3 may be a potential therapeutic target in heart disease.

## Interactions
ADAMTSL3 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a role in the regulation of the extracellular matrix and cardiovascular health. It binds to the N-terminus of fibrillin-1 and the C-terminus of latent TGFβ-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), which suggests a role in modulating TGFβ signaling by stabilizing inactive TGFβ in the extracellular matrix (Rypdal2024Emerging). ADAMTSL3 also interacts with the C-terminus of ADAMTS10, although the consequences of this interaction are not fully understood (Rypdal2024Emerging). 

The protein is suggested to form a larger complex with the latent TGFβ-binding complex (LLC) and ADAMTS10 on microfibrils, potentially affecting ADAMTS10 activity (Rypdal2024Emerging). ADAMTSL3's interaction with fibrillin microfibrils may influence TGFβ signaling indirectly, as all ADAMTSL proteins, except ADAMTSL1, bind fibrillin microfibrils (Rypdal2024Emerging). 

While ADAMTSL3 is structurally related to ADAMTS proteases, it lacks a catalytic domain and may have roles independent of these proteases, potentially in cell-matrix interactions or ECM assembly (Hall2003ADAMTSL3punctin2). Specific interactions with nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature.
