# PFDN4

## Overview
PFDN4 is a gene that encodes the protein prefoldin subunit 4, which is a crucial component of the prefoldin complex, a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding. The prefoldin complex is a heterohexameric structure that assists in the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins by stabilizing and transporting them to the chaperonin CCT (TCP-1 ring complex) for further folding. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing aggregation, particularly of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin (PayánBravo2018Functional; Liang2020The). Beyond its role in protein folding, PFDN4 is involved in the assembly of other cytoplasmic complexes and interacts with nuclear RNA polymerases and transcription factors, influencing gene expression (PayánBravo2018Functional). Dysregulation of PFDN4 has been associated with various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, underscoring its importance in cellular health and disease mechanisms (The; p&gt; Mo2020&lt; Liang2020The).

## Function
PFDN4 encodes prefoldin subunit 4, a component of the prefoldin complex, which plays a crucial role in protein folding within eukaryotic cells. The prefoldin complex is a heterohexameric structure composed of six subunits, including PFDN4, and is involved in the cytosolic chaperonin pathway. This complex assists in the proper folding of newly synthesized proteins by stabilizing and transporting unfolded or partially folded proteins to the chaperonin CCT (TCP-1 ring complex) for further folding. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing protein aggregation, which is particularly important for cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin (PayánBravo2018Functional; Liang2020The).

PFDN4, as part of the prefoldin complex, is also involved in the assembly of other cytoplasmic complexes and plays a role in gene expression processes by interacting with nuclear RNA polymerases and transcription factors (PayánBravo2018Functional). The prefoldin complex is active in the cytoplasm and has been implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of protein localization and GTPase activity (Ke2022Comprehensive). The proper functioning of PFDN4 is vital for cellular health, as its dysregulation is associated with several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (The; p&gt; Mo2020&lt; Liang2020The).

## Clinical Significance
PFDN4 (prefoldin subunit 4) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer, high PFDN4 expression is associated with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. It influences resistance through the CREBP1/AURKA pathway, affecting the efficacy of drugs like doxorubicin and paclitaxel (Wang2024PFDN4). PFDN4 is also highly expressed in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), where it correlates with poor overall survival and is linked to tumor grades (Dai2021Identification).

In colorectal cancer, PFDN4, along with CYP24A1 and associated long noncoding RNAs, serves as a potential diagnostic biomarker, distinguishing cancerous tissues from normal ones (Sadeghi2020Novel). In prostate cancer, PFDN4 is targeted by miR-26a, which regulates extracellular vesicle secretion. The suppression of PFDN4 by miR-26a reduces tumor growth, suggesting its role in cancer progression through EV-mediated pathways (Urabe2020miR26a).

Overall, PFDN4's dysregulation is linked to tumor progression and resistance to treatment, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in various cancers.

## Interactions
PFDN4, a subunit of the prefoldin complex, participates in several protein interactions essential for its function as a molecular chaperone. The prefoldin complex is a heterohexamer composed of six subunits, including PFDN4, which collaborates with other subunits such as PFDN1, PFDN2, PFDN3, PFDN5, and PFDN6 to assist in the proper folding of cytoskeletal proteins like actin and tubulin (The; p&gt; Mo2020&lt; Liang2020The). This complex interacts with the cytoplasmic chaperone protein TCP-1 (CCT), facilitating the folding process by preventing premature aggregation of these proteins (Liang2020The).

PFDN4 is also involved in the regulation of protein levels within the prefoldin complex through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which helps maintain the stability and function of the complex (The; p&gt; Mo2020&lt). In the context of cancer, PFDN4 has been implicated in interactions that influence tumor progression and prognosis, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers (Dai2021Identification; Ke2022Comprehensive).

Additionally, the prefoldin complex, including PFDN4, interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL), stabilizing it against aggregation and degradation, which is crucial for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Chesnel2020The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PFDN4 in cellular processes and disease mechanisms.
