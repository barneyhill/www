# LUC7L

## Overview
The LUC7L gene encodes a protein known as LUC7-like, which is a critical component of the RNA splicing machinery in human cells. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is part of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, playing a pivotal role in the early stages of spliceosome assembly. LUC7-like is involved in the selection of the 5′ splice site and the transition from the E complex to the B complex during splicing, interacting with U2 and U6 snRNAs (Daniels2021Functional; Tufarelli2001Characterization). The protein is characterized by zinc finger motifs and nuclear localization signals, which facilitate its function in RNA binding and nuclear transport (Tufarelli2001Characterization). LUC7-like is implicated in preventing cryptic intronic polyadenylation and regulating circular RNA biogenesis, thereby influencing gene expression and RNA processing (Daniels2021Functional). The gene's expression is tissue-specific, and its protein product is highly conserved across species, underscoring its essential role in cellular function (Tufarelli2001Characterization).

## Structure
The LUC7L protein is encoded by the LUC7L gene located on human chromosome 16. It is a 371 amino acid protein characterized by several structural motifs that contribute to its function in RNA splicing. The protein includes a C2H2 zinc finger motif encoded by exon 8, which is involved in RNA binding, and a C3H zinc finger motif encoded by exons 3 and 4 (Tufarelli2001Characterization). These zinc finger domains are crucial for the protein's interaction with RNA, particularly in the context of splice site selection (Puig2007The).

The LUC7L protein also contains two overlapping bipartite nuclear localization signals encoded by exons 9-11, which facilitate its transport into the nucleus, and a coiled-coil motif in the region encoded by exon 6, which may be involved in protein-protein interactions (Tufarelli2001Characterization). The presence of arginine-serine (RS) and arginine-glutamate (RE) repeats in the C-terminal region suggests a role in pre-mRNA splicing, similar to SR proteins (Tufarelli2001Characterization).

LUC7L exists in multiple splice variant isoforms, which are tissue-specific, indicating regulated expression (Tufarelli2001Characterization). These isoforms may affect the protein's function and interactions, contributing to its role in splicing regulation. The protein is highly conserved across species, showing partial homology to the yeast Luc7p splicing factor (Tufarelli2001Characterization).

## Function
The LUC7L gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in RNA splicing regulation within human cells. It is a component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex, which is crucial for the early stages of spliceosome assembly. LUC7L interacts with U2 and U6 snRNAs, facilitating the transition from the E complex to the B complex during splicing, and is involved in the selection of the 5′ splice site (Daniels2021Functional; Tufarelli2001Characterization).

LUC7L predominantly binds deep within introns, often more than 500 nucleotides away from annotated splice sites, and interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) proteins at U-rich stretches. This binding pattern suggests a role in preventing cryptic intronic polyadenylation, which can reduce gene expression (Daniels2021Functional). LUC7L is also implicated in the regulation of circular RNA biogenesis and may contribute to U1 snRNP telescripting, a process that inhibits cryptic polyadenylation sites within introns (Daniels2021Functional).

The protein is active primarily in the nucleus, where it influences RNA processing and splicing regulation, impacting cellular functions and potentially contributing to tissue-specific splicing events (Daniels2021Functional; Tufarelli2001Characterization).

## Interactions
LUC7L, a component of the spliceosome complex, interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids involved in RNA splicing. It predominantly binds deep within introns, often near cryptic 5′ splice sites and polyadenylation sites, suggesting a role in preventing cryptic intronic polyadenylation usage (Daniels2021Functional). LUC7L interacts with components of the CFIm polyadenylation complex, including CFIm25/NUDT21, CFIm68/CPSF6, and CFIm59/CPSF7, indicating its involvement in inhibiting cryptic PASs (Daniels2021Functional).

LUC7L is part of the U1 snRNP complex, interacting with U1-70K and U1 snRNA, but unlike LUC7L2 and LUC7L3, it is not enriched at 5′ splice sites. Instead, it binds more often in introns and interacts with hnRNP proteins at U-rich stretches (Daniels2021Functional). LUC7L shows a preference for binding with hnRNP proteins, while LUC7L2 and LUC7L3 interact more with SR family proteins (Daniels2021Functional).

The interactions of LUC7L with U2 and U6 snRNAs suggest its involvement in the transition of the spliceosome from the E complex to the B complex (Daniels2021Functional). These interactions highlight LUC7L's role in RNA splicing regulation and its potential involvement in alternative splicing, ALU exonization, and circular RNA biogenesis (Daniels2021Functional).
