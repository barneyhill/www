# SLC38A8

## Overview
SLC38A8 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 38 member 8 (SNAT8), which functions as a sodium-dependent amino acid transporter. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter, consisting of 11 transmembrane domains, and is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system and retina. SNAT8 plays a vital role in the transport of neutral amino acids, particularly glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are crucial for retinal development and function (Ren2024Novel; Weiner2020The). Mutations in the SLC38A8 gene are linked to foveal hypoplasia and other ocular disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal foveal structure and function (Schiff2021Novel; Weiner2020The). The gene's expression is highly specific to the eye, highlighting its critical role in ocular health (Schiff2021Novel).

## Function
The SLC38A8 gene encodes a protein that is part of the solute carrier family 38, specifically functioning as a sodium-dependent amino acid transporter. This protein, known as SNAT8, is primarily expressed in the central nervous system and retina, where it plays a crucial role in foveal development and retinal function (Ren2024Novel; Weiner2020The). SLC38A8 is involved in the transport of neutral amino acids, with a high preference for glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are essential for axonal projection and orientation selectivity in the retina (Ren2024Novel). The protein consists of 11 transmembrane domains and is expressed in the photoreceptor layer of the retina, indicating its role in retinal development and function (Kuht2020SLC38A8; Weiner2020The).

Mutations in SLC38A8 are associated with foveal hypoplasia, a condition characterized by the lack of foveal depression and often linked with other ocular disorders such as congenital nystagmus and optic nerve decussation defects (Schiff2021Novel; Weiner2020The). The gene's expression is specific to the eye, suggesting its critical role in maintaining normal foveal structure and function (Schiff2021Novel).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC38A8 gene are associated with several ocular conditions, primarily foveal hypoplasia, which affects the development of the fovea in the eye. This condition often results in vision problems such as nystagmus and reduced visual acuity. Patients with SLC38A8 mutations typically exhibit high grades of foveal hypoplasia, infantile nystagmus, and chiasmal misrouting, as detected by visual evoked potentials (VEP) (Kuht2020SLC38A8). The gene is linked to FHONDA syndrome, characterized by foveal hypoplasia, optic nerve decussation defects, and anterior segment dysgenesis (Kuht2020SLC38A8).

In some populations, such as those of Jewish Indian ancestry, a specific homozygous missense mutation (c.95T>G, p.Ile32Ser) in SLC38A8 has been identified, which fully segregates with isolated foveal hypoplasia and is associated with a high carrier rate (Schiff2021Novel; Perez2013Isolated). This mutation is located in a conserved region within the first transmembrane domain of the protein, suggesting its critical role in ocular development (Perez2013Isolated).

The pathogenicity of SLC38A8 mutations is further supported by findings in various populations, indicating a potential founder mutation and highlighting the gene's role in ocular and possibly neurological development (Weiner2020The).
