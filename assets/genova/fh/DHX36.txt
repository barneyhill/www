# DHX36

## Overview
DHX36 is a gene that encodes the DEAH-box helicase 36, a member of the DEAH-box family of RNA helicases. This protein is primarily involved in the unwinding of G-quadruplex (G4) structures in both DNA and RNA, which are secondary nucleic acid formations that influence various cellular processes such as transcription, replication, and translation. DEAH-box helicase 36 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and plays a vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating translation efficiency and mRNA stability. It is particularly significant in the context of telomere maintenance and the innate immune response, where it functions as part of a complex that senses double-stranded RNA. The protein's ability to resolve G4 structures is crucial in both cancer biology and neurological disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Bonaventure2022DExH/D-box; Murat2018RNA; Antcliff2021G-Quadruplexes).

## Function
DHX36, also known as DEAH-box helicase 36, is a crucial RNA helicase involved in the unwinding of G-quadruplex (G4) structures in both DNA and RNA. These G4 structures are secondary nucleic acid formations that play significant roles in various cellular processes, including transcription, replication, genomic stability, and translation (Antcliff2021G-Quadruplexes). In healthy human cells, DHX36 is ubiquitously expressed and is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is involved in the regulation of translation by resolving RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) located in the 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) of mRNAs, which can influence translation efficiency (Murat2018RNA).

DHX36 plays a pivotal role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by modulating the translation efficiency of mRNAs, particularly those containing rG4s. It prevents the stalling of the preinitiation complex, facilitating proper translation initiation (Murat2018RNA). The helicase is also involved in mRNA degradation by binding to AU-rich elements in the 3′ region of mRNAs and plays a role in cap-dependent and cap-independent recruitment of mRNA to ribosomes (Antcliff2021G-Quadruplexes). DHX36's activity is crucial for processes such as telomere maintenance, where it resolves G4 RNA structures, aiding in reverse transcription by telomerase, which is vital for protecting chromosome ends during mitosis (Antcliff2021G-Quadruplexes).

## Clinical Significance
The DHX36 gene, encoding the DEAH-box helicase 36, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in resolving G-quadruplex structures in nucleic acids. Alterations in DHX36 expression levels have been linked to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where high expression is associated with poor overall survival, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (Cui2021The). DHX36 acts as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC, and its knockdown leads to increased cell migration, tumor growth, and altered sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs (Cui2021The).

In breast cancer, DHX36 is associated with tumor suppression and improved patient survival, highlighting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Antcliff2021G-Quadruplexes). The gene is also implicated in neurological diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where it modulates repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation of GGGGCC repeats linked to the C9orf72 gene (Tseng2021The). In Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), DHX36 influences RAN translation from CGG repeats, affecting the translation process and potentially contributing to disease pathology (Tseng2021The). These findings suggest that DHX36's role in resolving G-quadruplex structures is critical in both cancer and neurological disorders.

## Interactions
DHX36, also known as DEAH-box helicase 36, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a crucial role in cellular processes. It is a part of the DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 complex, which acts as a sensor for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and is involved in the innate immune response. This complex operates independently of the RIG-I, MDA-5, or TLR3 pathways and is essential for the interferon response upon poly(I:C) transfection or influenza A virus (IAV) infection (Bonaventure2022DExH/D-box). DHX36 also interacts with RIG-I in the absence of viral infection and forms complexes with viral RNAs and protein kinase R (PKR) during infections with IAV or Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (Bonaventure2022DExH/D-box).

In the context of translation regulation, DHX36 interacts with RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) in the 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) of mRNAs. This interaction is crucial for modulating translation efficiency and ribosome distribution, particularly in transcripts with structured 5′-UTRs enriched in cancer pathways (Murat2018RNA). DHX36 is also associated with stress granules, where it interacts with RNA through a unique N-terminal RNA-binding domain, which is essential for its specificity for G4-loops (Shih2014Human).
