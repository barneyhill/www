# PPM1E

## Overview
PPM1E is a gene that encodes the protein phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1E, a serine/threonine phosphatase belonging to the PPM family. This protein is characterized by its requirement for magnesium or manganese ions to facilitate its catalytic activity, distinguishing it as a member of the PP2C family of phosphatases (Vaneynde2022The; Kamada2020Metaldependent). The PPM1E protein plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), which are crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and synaptic plasticity, respectively (Kamada2020Metaldependent; Voss2011Ppm1E). The protein's activity and localization are modulated by proteolytic processing and post-translational modifications, which influence its function in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Kamada2020Metaldependent; Voss2011Ppm1E). PPM1E's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its significance in health and disease, with implications for cancer progression, metabolic disorders, and neurological conditions (Kamada2020Metaldependent; Chen2017AMPKα).

## Structure
PPM1E is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that belongs to the PPM family, characterized by its dependence on Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions for catalytic activity. The protein contains a conserved catalytic core typical of the PP2C family, which is essential for its phosphatase function (Vaneynde2022The; Kamada2020Metaldependent). PPM1E is known to undergo proteolytic processing, resulting in a C-terminally truncated form that exhibits higher enzymatic activity compared to the full-length protein. This truncated form, hCaMKP-N(1-559), retains the N-terminal side and shows a preference for phospho-Thr residues (Ishida2013An).

The protein also contains two nuclear localization signals near the C-terminus, which are important for its subcellular localization. Proteolytic processing can remove these signals, leading to translocation to the cytosol (Kamada2020Metaldependent; Voss2011Ppm1E). PPM1E is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which can increase its activity (Kamada2020Metaldependent). The protein's structure includes a Glu- and Pro-rich region in the N-terminus, which may influence its biological functions and interactions (Chuman2008Characterization).

## Function
PPM1E is a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a crucial role in regulating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, a key energy sensor in cells. It dephosphorylates AMPK at the Thr172 site on the AMPKα subunit, leading to its inactivation. This dephosphorylation is essential for controlling AMPK activity, which is involved in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis (Voss2011Ppm1E). PPM1E interacts specifically with AMPKα2-containing complexes, which are important for glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (Voss2011Ppm1E).

PPM1E is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and its activity is dependent on the presence of Mg2+ and/or Mn2+ ions. It is not inhibited by common phosphatase inhibitors like okadaic acid (Voss2011Ppm1E). The protein's activity and localization are influenced by its cleavage into different fragments and by polyubiquitylation, which may regulate its phosphatase activity (Voss2011Ppm1E).

In addition to its role in AMPK regulation, PPM1E is involved in the dephosphorylation and downregulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), impacting processes such as synaptic plasticity and cytoskeletal dynamics (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

## Clinical Significance
PPM1E is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in cellular signaling pathways. In human gastric cancer, PPM1E is upregulated, leading to the dephosphorylation of AMPKα at Thr-172 and subsequent activation of mTORC1, which promotes cancer cell proliferation. This suggests that PPM1E plays a critical role in the progression of gastric cancer by modulating the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway (Chen2017AMPKα).

In the context of metabolic disorders, PPM1E negatively regulates AMPK activity, which is crucial for maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. Inhibition of PPM1E has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for enhancing AMPK activation, which could improve metabolic outcomes in conditions like type 2 diabetes (Voss2011Ppm1E).

PPM1E's role in neurological conditions is also notable, as alterations in its expression or function have been associated with mood disorders, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases. These associations highlight the importance of PPM1E in maintaining normal neurological functions and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in these disorders (Kamada2020Metaldependent).

## Interactions
PPM1E, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It is known to dephosphorylate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), specifically at the AMPKα-Thr172 site, which is crucial for regulating cellular energy homeostasis. PPM1E interacts with AMPKα2, contributing to its dephosphorylation and thus modulating AMPK activity (Voss2011Ppm1E). The interaction between PPM1E and AMPK is weak, but it plays a significant role in the regulation of AMPK phosphorylation levels, particularly in response to metabolic stressors like phenformin, an AMPK activator (Voss2011Ppm1E).

PPM1E also interacts with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), such as CAMK4, and is involved in their inactivation. This interaction suggests a role for PPM1E in calcium signaling pathways (Kamada2020Metaldependent). Additionally, PPM1E is known to interact with 14-3-3 proteins, which are involved in various cellular processes, including stress response and neuronal signaling. These interactions highlight the diverse roles of PPM1E in cellular regulation and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in metabolic and signaling disorders.
