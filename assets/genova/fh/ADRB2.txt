# ADRB2

## Overview
The ADRB2 gene encodes the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in the sympathetic nervous system. This receptor is integral to cellular signaling, mediating physiological responses to catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. The β2AR is primarily located in the cell membrane and is involved in various critical functions, including smooth muscle relaxation, bronchodilation, and metabolic regulation (Panebra2010Common; Barnes1995Betaadrenergic). Structurally, the receptor is characterized by seven transmembrane helices, forming a helical bundle typical of class A GPCRs, and it can form dimers, which are essential for its signaling and regulatory functions (Cherezov2007High-Resolution). The ADRB2 gene and its encoded receptor are of significant clinical interest due to their involvement in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, with various polymorphisms affecting receptor function and disease susceptibility (Toraih2014Beta2Adrenergic; Li2018A).

## Structure
The ADRB2 gene encodes the β2-adrenergic receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in cellular signaling. The primary structure of ADRB2 consists of 442 amino acids, including a palmitic acid covalently bound to Cys 341 and an acetamide molecule bound to Cys 265 (Cherezov2007High-Resolution). The secondary structure is characterized by seven transmembrane helices forming a helical bundle, typical of class A GPCRs (Cherezov2007High-Resolution). 

The tertiary structure of ADRB2 reveals a ligand-binding pocket accessible due to the second extracellular loop, which is stabilized by disulfide bridges and a helical segment (Cherezov2007High-Resolution). The receptor's structure shows proline-induced kinks in helices II, V, VI, and VII, facilitating structural rearrangements necessary for G protein activation (Cherezov2007High-Resolution). 

In terms of quaternary structure, the β2-adrenergic receptor can form dimers, with potential dimerization sites suggested at the helix I-helix VIII interface (Cherezov2007High-Resolution). Cholesterol plays a role in receptor signaling and dimerization, with its depletion affecting G protein coupling (Cherezov2007High-Resolution). Common post-translational modifications include glycosylation, as seen at Asn187, which was mutated to Glu for crystallization (Cherezov2007High-Resolution).

## Function
The ADRB2 gene encodes the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a crucial role in the sympathetic nervous system by mediating responses to catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. This receptor is primarily active in the cell membrane and is involved in various physiological processes, including smooth muscle relaxation, bronchodilation, and metabolic regulation (Panebra2010Common).

In airway smooth muscle cells, activation of β2AR by β-agonists leads to increased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which activate protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates proteins that inhibit myosin light chain phosphorylation and phosphoinositide hydrolysis, promoting muscle relaxation and bronchodilation (Barnes1995Betaadrenergic). This process is essential for respiratory function and is particularly important in conditions like asthma (Barnes1995Betaadrenergic).

In cardiomyocytes, β2AR activation enhances cardiac contractility, contributing to heart function (Panebra2010Common). The receptor's ligand-binding occurs in a pocket formed by residues of the transmembrane domains, and its expression is regulated by various polymorphisms that can influence receptor density and responsiveness (McGraw1998Polymorphisms; Panebra2010Common). These molecular activities underscore the receptor's role in cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene have been associated with several diseases, particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular conditions. The ADRB2 gene encodes the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, which plays a crucial role in regulating airway smooth muscle tone. Variations in this gene can influence receptor function and disease susceptibility.

In COPD, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ADRB2 gene, such as rs12654778, have been linked to reduced expression of the gene and decreased promoter activity, potentially contributing to the disease's onset (Li2018A). The Thr164Ile polymorphism is associated with reduced lung function and an increased risk of COPD, with carriers showing significantly higher odds of developing the disease (Thomsen20112adrenergic). Other polymorphisms, such as Arg16Gly and Gln27Glu, have been studied for their impact on COPD severity and treatment response, with mixed results across different populations (Vacca2009Polymorphisms; Hussein2017Beta).

In cardiovascular diseases, the Gln27Glu polymorphism has been associated with acute myocardial infarction, where the Glu27 allele appears protective against the condition (Toraih2014Beta2Adrenergic). These genetic variations can affect receptor sensitivity and response to adrenergic drugs, influencing clinical outcomes in both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

## Interactions
The ADRB2 gene encodes the β2-adrenergic receptor, which is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function and regulation. One significant interaction is with the ERM-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), a member of the NHERF protein family. EBP50 binds to the β2-adrenergic receptor through a PDZ domain, which is essential for the receptor's endocytic sorting and recycling. This interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of Serine 411 by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), particularly GRK-5, which can disrupt the interaction and affect receptor trafficking (Cao1999A).

The β2-adrenergic receptor also interacts with the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), a membrane fusion regulatory ATPase. This interaction is crucial for the receptor's internalization and recycling processes. NSF binds to the receptor's carboxyl terminus, forming a complex with αSNAP and SNARE proteins, which is essential for membrane fusion events during intracellular trafficking (Cong2001Binding). Mutations affecting NSF binding, such as the L412A mutation, impair receptor recycling, highlighting NSF's role as a key determinant in the receptor's fate post-internalization (Cong2001Binding). The ADRB2 receptor does not interact with nucleic acids according to the provided context.
