# TMEM179B

## Overview
TMEM179B is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 179B, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and cell communication. The specific functions and interactions of transmembrane protein 179B remain under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in pathways that are significant for cellular homeostasis and development. Understanding the role of TMEM179B and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its potential implications in health and disease, as alterations in transmembrane proteins are often linked to pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
