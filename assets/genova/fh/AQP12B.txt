# AQP12B

## Overview
Aquaporin 12B (AQP12B) is a gene that encodes the protein aquaporin 12B, which is a member of the aquaporin family of transmembrane water channel proteins. These proteins are integral to cellular water homeostasis, facilitating the transport of water and, in some cases, small solutes across cell membranes. Aquaporin 12B is predominantly expressed in specific tissues and is thought to play a role in maintaining water balance and possibly in other physiological processes, although its precise functions and regulatory mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The study of AQP12B and its encoded protein is ongoing, with research focusing on its potential implications in various physiological and pathological contexts (Qiu2020aarFDC).
