# CENPM

## Overview
CENPM, or centromere protein M, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the proper functioning of the centromere, a key structure in chromosome segregation during cell division. The protein CENPM is a component of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) and plays a critical role in the assembly and stability of the kinetochore, which is essential for accurate mitosis and maintaining genomic stability (Reinhold2011Identification). As a part of the CENPA nucleosome-associated complex (NAC), CENPM interacts with other centromere proteins, such as CENPA, CENPC, CENPI, and CENPH, to ensure proper attachment of spindle microtubules to chromosomes (Liu2020Upregulation). Beyond its fundamental role in cell division, CENPM is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Liu2020Upregulation; Wu2024Identification).

## Function
Centromere protein M (CENPM) is a crucial component of the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), playing a vital role in the assembly and function of the kinetochore, a structure essential for chromosome segregation during cell division. In healthy human cells, CENPM is involved in stabilizing centromeric chromatin and ensuring the proper attachment of microtubules to chromosomes, facilitating accurate mitosis and maintaining genomic stability (Reinhold2011Identification). 

CENPM interacts with other centromere proteins such as CENPA, CENPC, CENPI, and CENPH to form a complex that is crucial for maintaining kinetochore and spindle microtubule attachment during metaphase (Liu2020Upregulation). This interaction is essential for proper chromosome segregation, preventing aneuploidy, which is the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes and can lead to unequal chromosome separation during mitosis (Liu2020Upregulation).

CENPM is also expressed in B-lymphoid cells, where it participates in the immune response (Xiao2019Upregulation). Proper regulation of CENPM is essential to prevent aneuploidy, a condition that can lead to cancer (Xiao2019Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
CENPM (centromere protein M) plays a significant role in various cancers due to its altered expression levels rather than mutations. In breast cancer, CENPM overexpression in MCF7 cells enhances cell proliferation and reduces apoptosis, contributing to tumor growth. This overexpression is associated with increased expression of proliferation markers like Ki67 and PCNA, and accelerates cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, leading to higher tumorigenicity (Liu2020Upregulation). CENPM mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in 14 types of human cancer, including breast cancer, and is positively associated with patient mortality (Liu2020Upregulation). 

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CENPM upregulation is linked to tumor progression and poor survival, mediated through the CDC20/MYBL2/Wnt signaling pathway (Wu2024Identification). Similarly, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), CENPM is significantly upregulated and associated with higher pathological stages and poor survival rates. It promotes cell proliferation, affects cell cycle progression, and enhances migration and invasion capacity through the AKT1/mTOR signaling pathway (Qi2022The). These findings suggest that CENPM could serve as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target in these cancers.

## Interactions
CENPM, or centromere protein M, is a component of the CENPA nucleosome-associated complex (NAC), which is essential for kinetochore assembly and chromosome segregation during cell division. It interacts with other centromere proteins, including CENPA, CENPC, CENPI, and CENPH, forming a complex that maintains kinetochore and spindle microtubule attachment during metaphase (Liu2020Upregulation). 

In the context of cancer, CENPM has been shown to interact with several proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), CENPM interacts with CDC20 and MYBL2, which are central regulators of cell proliferation and differentiation. These interactions activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, promoting tumor growth and metastasis (Wu2024Identification). 

In breast cancer, CENPM is associated with a network of genes, including RAD51, KIF4A, RACGAP1, SPAG5, HMMR, CDC25C, CKS2, ERCC6L, and SHCBP1, which are involved in DNA replication, repair, and chromosome segregation (Liu2020Upregulation). These interactions suggest that CENPM plays a role in regulating tumorigenesis by altering cell cycle-associated proteins.
