# PHF21A

## Overview
PHF21A is a gene that encodes the PHD finger protein 21A, a non-catalytic protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. The protein is characterized by its PHD zinc finger domain, which allows it to function as a histone reader by specifically recognizing unmethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me0). This interaction is crucial for its role in the CoREST-related protein complex, which is involved in neuron-specific gene repression and chromatin modification (Kim2012Translocations; Kim2019Disruption). PHF21A is expressed in various isoforms, including a canonical form and a neuron-specific form, each differing in their DNA-binding capabilities due to the presence or absence of an AT-hook motif (Porter2023A). The gene is highly expressed in the human fetal brain, indicating its importance in early development, and mutations in PHF21A are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and craniofacial anomalies (Labonne2015A; Kim2019Disruption).

## Structure
The PHF21A protein is characterized by several functional domains that contribute to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It contains two leucine zipper domains (LZD1 and LZD2), an AT-hook motif, and a PHD zinc finger domain. The PHD finger domain is crucial for binding to unmethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me0), a key interaction for its function in chromatin modification (Kim2012Translocations; Kim2019Disruption). The AT-hook motif facilitates DNA binding by interacting with AT-rich sequences, although a specific mutation (Gly429Ser) in this motif can hinder DNA interaction by creating a charge repulsive environment (Kim2019Disruption).

PHF21A exists in different isoforms, including a canonical form (PHF21A-c) and a neuron-specific form (PHF21A-n). PHF21A-c includes the AT-hook motif, while PHF21A-n lacks this motif due to a neuron-specific microexon, affecting its DNA-binding capability (Porter2023A). Despite this, both isoforms retain the ability to bind H3K4me0 through the PHD domain (Porter2023A).

The protein also features an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) at its C-terminus, which provides flexibility and facilitates interactions with other proteins involved in cell signaling and chromatin remodeling (Kim2019Disruption). This region is suggested to be intolerant to truncation, indicating its importance in maintaining protein function (Kim2019Disruption).

## Function
PHF21A encodes a protein that functions as a histone reader, specifically recognizing unmethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me0) as part of the CoREST-related protein complex. This complex is involved in neuron-specific gene repression through histone-demethylation activity, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Kim2012Translocations). PHF21A is not a catalytic enzyme but acts as a 'reader' in the KDM1A multiprotein complex, which is essential for normal cognitive function and craniofacial development (Kim2019Disruption).

In healthy human cells, PHF21A is necessary for maintaining the correct dosage required for effective repression of certain genes, such as SCN3A, by ensuring LSD1 promoter occupancy and proper gene regulation (Kim2012Translocations). The protein predominantly resides in the nuclei of cells, where it is involved in chromatin association and transcriptional regulation (Kim2012Translocations). PHF21A's function is conserved across species, as demonstrated by experiments in zebrafish, where suppression of phf21a led to developmental abnormalities (Kim2012Translocations). The gene's expression is notably high in the human fetal brain, indicating its importance in early human development (Kim2019Disruption).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PHF21A gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders and physical anomalies. These include syndromic intellectual disability, craniofacial anomalies, epilepsy, hypotonia, and neurobehavioral problems such as autism spectrum disorder (Kim2019Disruption). The gene's haploinsufficiency is a key mechanism underlying these conditions, as a single functional copy of the gene is insufficient for normal function (Labonne2015A). 

PHF21A mutations, particularly those that are de novo and truncating, have been linked to intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies, as seen in Potocki-Shaffer syndrome (PSS) (Kim2012Translocations; Lee2022Novel). The gene is part of the KDM1A histone demethylase complex, and its disruption can lead to misregulation of neuronal genes, contributing to the observed phenotypes (Labonne2015A; Kim2012Translocations).

In addition to genetic mutations, alterations in PHF21A expression levels can also lead to developmental issues. For instance, reduced expression of PHF21A is linked to developmental delays and craniofacial anomalies (Labonne2015A). The gene's expression is particularly high in the fetal brain, cerebellum, occipital lobe, and hippocampus, regions associated with learning and memory, which aligns with the neurological symptoms observed in patients with PHF21A mutations (Kim2019Disruption).

## Interactions
PHF21A is a component of the LSD1-CoREST complex, which plays a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It interacts with LSD1 and CoREST, forming a multiprotein complex that is involved in the demethylation of histone H3K4me2, a process crucial for transcriptional repression (Porter2023A; Butera2022PHF21A). PHF21A specifically binds to unmethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me0) through its PHD finger domain, acting as a 'reader' within the KDM1A multiprotein complex (Kim2012Translocations; Kim2019Disruption).

The protein exists in two isoforms: PHF21A-c, which contains an AT-hook motif allowing DNA binding, and PHF21A-n, a neuron-specific isoform lacking this motif but retaining the ability to recognize H3K4me0 (Porter2023A). The AT-hook motif in PHF21A-c is essential for its DNA-binding ability, as mutations in this motif significantly reduce its binding affinity (Porter2023A).

PHF21A is also part of the BRAF-histone deacetylase complex, which represses target-gene transcription by interacting with LSD1 and binding to unmethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me0) (Kim2012Translocations). This interaction is crucial for normal brain development and cognitive function, as evidenced by its role in the repression of neuronal gene expression (Kim2019Disruption).
