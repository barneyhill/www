# LUM

## Overview
The LUM gene encodes lumican, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) that plays a critical role in the structural organization and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Lumican is involved in collagen fibrillogenesis, influencing the formation and spacing of collagen fibrils, which is essential for maintaining the mechanical properties of various tissues (Nikitovic2008Lumican). As a proteoglycan, lumican is characterized by its core protein and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which facilitate interactions with other ECM components and cell surface receptors, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and adhesion (Nikitovic2008Lumican; Karamanos2018Proteoglycan). The protein is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including skin, cornea, and cartilage, underscoring its importance in tissue homeostasis and repair (Nikitovic2008Lumican). Additionally, lumican has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and high myopia, where its expression levels and genetic variations can influence disease progression and prognosis (Lin2009The; Xu2023LUM).

## Structure
Lumican (LUM) is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) with a core protein molecular weight of approximately 38-40 kDa, depending on its glycosylation state (Yamanaka2013Lumican; Karamanos2018Proteoglycan). The primary structure of lumican includes a signal peptide, a negatively charged N-terminal domain, a central region with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), and a C-terminal domain (Yamanaka2013Lumican; Nikitovic2008Lumican). The central core contains nine LRRs, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Karamanos2018Proteoglycan).

The secondary structure of lumican is characterized by β-sheets, typical of SLRPs, forming a curved solenoid fold (Iozzo2015Proteoglycan). The tertiary structure is arch-shaped, allowing the concave surface to bind collagen microfibrils, which is essential for its role in collagen fibrillogenesis (Nikitovic2008Lumican). Lumican functions as a monomer and does not have a quaternary structure.

Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation, with potential sites for keratan sulfate or oligosaccharide substitution, influencing its biological activity and interactions (Nikitovic2008Lumican; Karamanos2018Proteoglycan). These modifications are tissue-specific and can affect lumican's role in processes like tumor progression and wound healing (Yamanaka2013Lumican; Karamanos2018Proteoglycan).

## Function
Lumican (LUM) is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that plays a significant role in maintaining tissue structural homeostasis and modulating cellular functions. It is primarily involved in collagen fibrillogenesis, which is crucial for the structural integrity and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Lumican interacts with fibrillar collagens, modulating fibril formation and regulating interfibrillar spacings through its highly charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains (Nikitovic2008Lumican). This interaction is essential for maintaining the tensile strength and mechanical properties of tissues, as evidenced by lumican null mice that exhibit corneal opacity and skin and tendon fragility due to disorganized collagen fibers (Nikitovic2008Lumican).

In cell biology, lumican influences cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion. It acts as a matrikine, binding to cell surface receptors like integrins or growth factor receptors, thereby inducing intracellular signaling (Nikitovic2008Lumican). Lumican is expressed in various tissues, including skin, artery, lung, kidney, bone, aorta, and articular cartilage, indicating its widespread role in maintaining tissue homeostasis (Nikitovic2008Lumican). Its presence in the ECM and interaction with integrins play significant roles in modulating cell motility and invasiveness, impacting processes such as wound healing and tissue repair (Nikitovic2014Lumican).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LUM gene, which encodes lumican, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In gastric cancer, elevated LUM expression is associated with poor prognosis and shorter survival times, suggesting its role as an unfavorable prognostic marker. LUM expression is linked to immune cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, particularly with macrophages, which are significantly associated with gastric cancer prognosis (Xu2023LUM).

In colon cancer, lumican expression in epithelial cells is associated with longer disease-specific and disease-free survival in stage II patients, particularly those with microsatellite stable tumors. This suggests that lumican may serve as a positive prognostic marker in certain contexts (de2012Lumican).

Lumican also plays a role in high myopia, where specific polymorphisms in the LUM gene are linked to a genetic predisposition to the condition. These polymorphisms affect the structural integrity of the sclera, contributing to the development of high myopia (Lin2009The).

In melanoma, lumican inhibits metastasis by affecting cell signaling pathways and reducing the expression of proteins associated with cancer progression, such as cyclin D1 and cortactin (Karamanou2021Lumican).

## Interactions
Lumican (LUM) is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan that participates in various interactions with proteins, influencing cellular processes and extracellular matrix organization. It interacts with cell membrane receptors, such as integrins, affecting downstream signaling pathways like focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which is crucial for cell motility (Giatagana2021Lumican). In melanoma, lumican inhibits cell migration by affecting actin filaments, integrin ligation, and focal adhesion complexes, and by decreasing FAK phosphorylation (Giatagana2021Lumican). Lumican also acts as a competitive inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14), which is necessary for cell migration, thereby inhibiting melanoma cell migration (Giatagana2021Lumican).

In breast cancer, lumican influences the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by interacting with integrins and matrix metalloproteinases, particularly MMP-14, affecting cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Karamanou2020Epithelialtomesenchymal). It downregulates collagen-binding integrins (α1 and α2) and affects signaling pathways involving FAK, ERK1/2, MAPK, and AKT, leading to reduced cell migration (Karamanou2020Epithelialtomesenchymal).

In the cornea, lumican modulates Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) signaling, which is crucial for regulating inflammation and apoptosis. It binds to FasL, facilitating its presentation to Fas, thereby maintaining Fas expression and promoting apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine production (Vij2005Lumican).
