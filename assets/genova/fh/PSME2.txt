# PSME2

## Overview
PSME2 is a gene that encodes the proteasome activator subunit 2, a critical component of the 11S regulator complex, also known as the PA28 complex. This protein plays a significant role in the immunoproteasome, which is specialized for the generation of antigenic peptides necessary for immune surveillance and antigen presentation on MHC class I molecules. The PSME2 protein forms a heptameric ring structure, contributing to its function in facilitating the opening of the proteasome gate, thereby enhancing the degradation of ubiquitin-independent proteins. It is synthesized in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), underscoring its involvement in immune responses. PSME2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it maintains protein homeostasis and regulates various cellular processes. Its expression and activity are implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, where it serves as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target due to its role in modulating immune responses and tumor progression (Gomes2013Genetics; McCusker1999Organization; Wu2022PSME2).

## Structure
The PSME2 gene encodes the proteasome activator subunit 2, which is part of the 11S regulator complex. This protein is involved in the immunoproteasome, enhancing the generation of antigenic peptides. PSME2 forms a heptameric ring structure, contributing to its quaternary structure (Song1996A; Huber2017The). The gene consists of 11 exons and is 3.3 kilobases in length. The genomic sequence of PSME2 is nearly identical to its cDNA sequence, with a single nucleotide difference at position 751, resulting in an amino acid change from Threonine to Asparagine (McCusker1999Organization).

The PSME2 protein lacks the 'KEKE' motif found in its homolog PSME1, which may influence its functional interactions (McCusker1999Organization). The absence of this motif is notable in the context of its evolutionary divergence and functional specialization. PSME2 is synthesized in response to IFN-γ, indicating its role in immune responses (McCusker1999Organization). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can affect its activity and interactions, although specific sites and effects are not detailed in the provided context (Mittenberg2014Massspectrometric).

## Function
PSME2 encodes the proteasome activator subunit 2, which is a component of the 11S regulator complex, also known as the PA28 complex. This complex associates with the 20S proteasome core, playing a crucial role in the ubiquitin-independent degradation of proteins. PSME2 is particularly important in the immune response, as it facilitates the generation of peptide fragments for presentation on MHC class I molecules, a process essential for antigen processing and immune surveillance (Gomes2013Genetics).

In healthy human cells, PSME2 is involved in the assembly of the immunoproteasome, which is specialized for efficient antigen processing. The PA28 complex, composed of PA28α and PA28β subunits from the PSME1 and PSME2 genes respectively, replaces the 19S complex in many eukaryotic immunoproteasomes. This complex operates in an ATP-independent manner and is more efficient at generating antigen peptides compared to the 19S complex (Gomes2013Genetics).

PSME2 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes. Its activity is crucial for the proper functioning of the immune system, particularly in the context of presenting antigens to T cells (Gomes2013Genetics).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSME2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In ccRCC, PSME2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, as its high expression correlates with lower survival rates and increased tumor invasiveness. This is thought to occur through the regulation of BNIP3-mediated autophagy, which affects tumor cell invasiveness (Wang2021Increased). In NSCLC, PSME2 expression is also elevated in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and its overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and higher tumor mutation burden (Ma2024Comprehensive).

PSME2 is also associated with immune responses in cancer. In breast cancer, PSME2 is overexpressed and linked to immune-hot tumor microenvironments, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response (Wu2022PSME2). Additionally, PSME2 expression is correlated with immune cell infiltration and cytokine-related activity across various cancer types, indicating its role in modulating immune responses (Li2024PSME2). These findings highlight PSME2's potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
PSME2, also known as the proteasome activator subunit 2, is a component of the 11S proteasome activator complex, which plays a crucial role in protein degradation. It forms a heptameric ring with PA28α, facilitating the opening of the proteasome gate to enhance the degradation of ubiquitin-independent proteins (Bartolome2024Quantitative). PSME2 interacts with the 20S proteasome core, a major proteolytic system in eukaryotic cells, and is involved in the regulation of proteasome activity (Wang2021Increased).

In the context of viral infections, PSME2 has been identified as a key host factor in Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. It interacts with multiple JEV proteins, suggesting its significant role in the infection process and the host's immune response (Liu2023YWHAH). The study by Liu et al. highlights that PSME2 is continuously upregulated during JEV infection and is implicated in immunoproteasome assembly, which is essential for efficient antigen processing (Liu2023YWHAH).

PSME2 also shows interactions with other proteins involved in cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PSME2 is positively correlated with proteins such as PSMB9 and PSME1, and negatively correlated with the CFTR gene, indicating its involvement in cell cycle regulation and immune response pathways (Ma2024Comprehensive).
