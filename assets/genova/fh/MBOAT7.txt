# MBOAT7

## Overview
MBOAT7, or membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 7, is a gene that encodes the enzyme lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1), a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family. This enzyme is integral to lipid metabolism, specifically involved in the acyl-chain remodeling of phospholipids through the Lands cycle. MBOAT7 is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains, which anchor it to endomembranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid droplets, and mitochondria-associated membranes. The protein plays a crucial role in transferring polyunsaturated fatty acids, like arachidonic acid, to lysophosphatidylinositol, thereby maintaining the proper composition of phosphatidylinositol in cell membranes. This function is vital for various cellular processes, including brain development and hepatic lipid regulation. Alterations in MBOAT7 expression or mutations in the gene are linked to several diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and certain neurodevelopmental disorders (Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Caddeo2021LPIAT1MBOAT7; Yalnızoǧlu2019Expanding).

## Structure
The MBOAT7 protein, also known as lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1), is a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family involved in lipid metabolism. It is characterized by a complex structure with multiple transmembrane domains. Specifically, MBOAT7 is anchored to endomembranes by six transmembrane domains, as determined through a combination of in silico and in vitro analyses (Caddeo2019MBOAT7). 

The protein's tertiary structure includes a catalytic chamber formed by 11 transmembrane helical segments, with the catalytic His356 residue located within TM8 (Wang2022The; Wang2023The). The structure resembles a saddle shape, with two transmembrane bundles creating a central catalytic chamber, which is sealed by TM6, TM7, and TM8 (Wang2023The). 

MBOAT7 does not have a reported quaternary structure involving dimerization, unlike some other MBOAT family members (Wang2023The). The protein is involved in phosphatidylinositol remodeling, specifically acylating lyso-phosphatidylinositol with arachidonyl-CoA (Wang2023The). The study of MBOAT7 has also identified small-molecule inhibitors, which could serve as therapeutic agents (Wang2023The). 

No specific information on primary structure, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms is provided in the context.

## Function
MBOAT7, also known as lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1), is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the acyl-chain remodeling of phospholipids, particularly through the Lands cycle. This enzyme is part of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family and is primarily involved in transferring polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, to lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) (Caddeo2021LPIAT1MBOAT7; Wang2023The). MBOAT7 is highly expressed in the liver and brain, where it is crucial for maintaining the proper composition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in cell membranes, which is essential for various cellular functions (Caddeo2021LPIAT1MBOAT7).

The enzyme's activity is localized to endomembranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid droplets, and mitochondria-associated membranes (Caddeo2021LPIAT1MBOAT7). MBOAT7's catalytic mechanism involves a dyad of conserved residues, Asn321 and His356, which are essential for its enzymatic function (Wang2023The). The enzyme facilitates the reacylation of lyso-PI with arachidonyl-CoA, a process that is vital for the remodeling of PI and influences brain development and function (Caddeo2021LPIAT1MBOAT7; Wang2023The). Proper function of MBOAT7 is crucial for maintaining cellular lipid composition and is linked to the regulation of hepatic triglyceride content, impacting conditions like fatty liver disease (Caddeo2021LPIAT1MBOAT7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MBOAT7 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Mutations in MBOAT7 can lead to a phospholipid remodeling disease characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech and language delay, stereotypical behavior, ataxic gait, early onset epilepsy, and specific neuroimaging findings such as cerebellar atrophy and corpus callosum thinning (Yalnızoǧlu2019Expanding). These mutations are inherited in a recessive manner and include nonsense, frameshift, and missense mutations, as well as large deletions (Yalnızoǧlu2019Expanding).

Alterations in MBOAT7 expression, particularly the rs641738 C>T variant, are linked to liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), severe hepatic fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. This variant is associated with decreased MBOAT7 expression, leading to increased triglyceride accumulation, inflammation, and liver fibrosis (T; Korbecki2024Phospholipid; Teo2021rs641738C&gt). The rs641738 variant is also linked to higher liver fat content and advanced fibrosis in NAFLD, particularly in individuals of European descent (T; Mancina2016The; Teo2021rs641738C&gt). In cancer, MBOAT7 expression levels can influence tumor progression and prognosis, with both upregulation and downregulation being implicated in different cancer types (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

## Interactions
MBOAT7, also known as lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 (LPIAT1), is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in lipid metabolism. It interacts with acyl-CoA synthetases, particularly ACSL3 and ACSL4, which are enzymes responsible for converting free fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA. This interaction is facilitated by a scaffolding protein associated with monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation (MMD), which aids in the efficient transfer of reaction products (Korbecki2024Phospholipid).

MBOAT7 is also involved in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein complex that plays a role in inflammation. It can activate SREBP-1c, a transcription factor involved in lipid synthesis, indicating its role in lipid signaling pathways (Korbecki2024Phospholipid). Additionally, MBOAT7's function in lysosomal lipid homeostasis is linked to its role in the acylation of lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) in the endoplasmic reticulum, which affects lysosomal and mitochondrial lipids, impacting autophagy and fatty acid oxidation (Varadharajan2024Membranebound). These interactions highlight MBOAT7's involvement in complex lipid metabolic processes and its potential impact on cellular functions related to inflammation and lipid homeostasis.
