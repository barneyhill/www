# WDSUB1

## Overview
WDSUB1 is a gene that encodes the protein WD repeat, sterile alpha motif, and U-box domain containing 1. This protein is characterized by the presence of WD repeats, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a U-box domain, which collectively suggest its involvement in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. The U-box domain is particularly indicative of a role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a type of enzyme that facilitates the attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome. This function positions WDSUB1 as a potential regulator within ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathways. Genetic studies have linked WDSUB1 to various physiological traits, including associations with sudden cardiac death and ferritin levels, suggesting its involvement in cardiovascular and iron metabolism pathways (Timmer2021Genetic; BenAvraham2017The). Further research is required to fully elucidate the specific roles and interactions of the WDSUB1 protein (Hu2019GenomeWide).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
WDSUB1 is a gene encoding a protein that contains WD repeats, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a U-box domain, which are indicative of its potential roles in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitination processes. The U-box domain is a characteristic feature of E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are involved in tagging proteins for degradation. This suggests that WDSUB1 may participate in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathways, although specific interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids have not been detailed in the available literature (Hu2019GenomeWide).

In the context of genetic studies, WDSUB1 has been associated with various physiological traits and conditions. For instance, it has been linked to sudden cardiac death, suggesting a potential interaction with cardiovascular-related proteins or pathways (BenAvraham2017The). Additionally, WDSUB1 is implicated in the regulation of ferritin levels, with genetic variants near this gene showing significant associations with ferritin concentrations in blood donors (Timmer2021Genetic). These associations hint at possible interactions with proteins involved in iron metabolism, although the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify the specific protein interactions and functional roles of WDSUB1.
