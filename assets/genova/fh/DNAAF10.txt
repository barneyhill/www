# DNAAF10

## Overview
DNAAF10 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein axonemal assembly factor 10, which is integral to the assembly and function of dynein arms in cilia and flagella. This protein is categorized as a molecular chaperone, playing a pivotal role in the preassembly of dynein complexes within the cytoplasm. The preassembly is essential because cilia lack the capability to synthesize proteins, necessitating the transport of fully assembled dynein arms to the ciliary axoneme. DNAAF10 interacts with the R2TP complex, facilitating the recruitment of dynein clients to HSP90 for proper folding and assembly. This interaction is part of a network of dynein preassembly factors that ensure the correct folding, stabilization, and assembly of dynein heavy chains and other subunits. Proper functioning of DNAAF10 is crucial for ciliary motility, affecting processes such as fluid movement across epithelial surfaces and sperm motility. Mutations or defects in DNAAF10 can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a condition characterized by immotile cilia and associated clinical symptoms (Wang2022FBB18; Smith2022The).

## Function
DNAAF10, also known as dynein axonemal assembly factor 10, plays a critical role in the assembly and function of dynein arms, which are essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. In healthy human cells, DNAAF10 is involved in the preassembly of dynein complexes within the cytoplasm. This preassembly process is crucial because cilia lack the machinery to synthesize proteins, necessitating the assembly of dynein arms in the cytoplasm before their transport to the ciliary axoneme (Wang2022FBB18).

DNAAF10 interacts with the R2TP complex, a co-chaperone complex that includes proteins such as RUVBL1 and RUVBL2, to recruit dynein clients to HSP90 for proper folding and assembly. This interaction is part of a broader network of dynein preassembly factors (DNAAFs) that facilitate the folding, stabilization, and assembly of dynein heavy chains and other subunits (Wang2022FBB18). The proper functioning of DNAAF10 is vital for the motility of cilia, impacting processes such as fluid movement across epithelial surfaces and sperm motility. Defects in DNAAF10 or its associated pathways can lead to conditions like primary ciliary dyskinesia, characterized by immotile cilia and associated clinical symptoms (Smith2022The).
