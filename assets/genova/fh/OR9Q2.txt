# OR9Q2

## Overview
The OR9Q2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 9 subfamily Q member 2, a protein that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the olfactory system, where it plays a critical role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals. As a transmembrane protein, it is expressed in the olfactory epithelium and is particularly responsive to the odorant p-cresol, distinguishing it among the numerous olfactory receptors in humans (Shirai2023Functions). The OR9Q2 receptor is integral to the olfactory signaling pathway, utilizing calcium-mediated mechanisms to facilitate the perception of smell (Shirai2023Functions). While its primary function is related to olfaction, emerging research suggests potential implications in pathological contexts, such as cancer, although its clinical significance is not yet fully understood (Oh2024Genomic; Biradar2020Identification).

## Function
The OR9Q2 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which plays a crucial role in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. OR9Q2 is particularly sensitive to the odorant p-cresol, making it the most responsive receptor for this compound among the 378 human olfactory receptors tested in a study using HEK293T cells (Shirai2023Functions). The receptor is involved in olfactory signaling through calcium-mediated pathways, as demonstrated by calcium imaging experiments that measured intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to odorants (Shirai2023Functions).

The function of OR9Q2 is also linked to the enzymatic conversion of p-cresyl acetate (pCA) to p-cresol in the olfactory cleft mucus, which affects odor perception. OR9Q2 is not sensitive to pCA itself, indicating that its role is specifically in recognizing p-cresol, a metabolite of pCA (Shirai2023Functions). This receptor's activity is influenced by the amount of olfactory mucus, which can affect the amplitude of its response to odorants (Shirai2023Functions).

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the OR9Q2 gene, part of the olfactory receptor family, is not well-documented in terms of specific diseases or conditions resulting from its mutations. However, alterations in its expression have been observed in certain contexts. In a study on gastric cancer with bone metastasis, OR9Q2 was noted to have significantly reduced expression in the bone metastasis group compared to those without bone metastasis, suggesting a potential role in cancer progression (Oh2024Genomic). Despite this observation, the study did not establish a direct link between OR9Q2 mutations and specific diseases (Oh2024Genomic).

In the context of melanoma, OR9Q2 was identified among genes involved in the disease, with potential implications as a biomarker for diagnosis and therapeutic purposes. However, specific conditions related to mutations in OR9Q2 were not detailed (Biradar2020Identification).

Research on olfactory function has shown that OR9Q2 is sensitive to certain odorants, but no direct association with clinical conditions due to its mutations has been reported (Shirai2023Functions). Overall, while OR9Q2 may play a role in certain pathological contexts, its clinical significance remains to be fully elucidated.
