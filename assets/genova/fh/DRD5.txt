# DRD5

## Overview
The DRD5 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D5 (D5R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, specifically within the D1-like receptor subfamily. This receptor is integral to various physiological processes, including the regulation of blood pressure and sodium balance, as well as modulating neuronal signaling in the brain. The D5 receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which are typical of GPCRs, and shares significant sequence homology with the D1 receptor. Functionally, D5R plays a crucial role in counteracting the prohypertensive effects of the renin-angiotensin system by promoting the degradation of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and reducing oxidative stress through the regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity (Lu2013D5; Li2008Dopamine). In the central nervous system, D5R is involved in cognitive and emotional processes, with its expression in regions such as the cerebral cortex and hippocampus influencing behaviors and circadian rhythms (Hollon2002Mice). Genetic variations in DRD5 have been linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Zhao2014Relationship; Jang2024Clinical).

## Structure
The DRD5 gene encodes the D5 dopamine receptor, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) of the D1-like family. The receptor protein consists of 477 amino acids and shares 80% sequence identity in its seven transmembrane domains with the D1 receptor, with an overall amino acid homology of 50% (Sobell1995The). The primary structure of the D5 receptor includes these seven transmembrane domains, which are characteristic of GPCRs (Sobell1995The). 

The secondary structure of the D5 receptor likely involves alpha helices, typical of GPCRs, forming the transmembrane regions. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, essential for its function in signal transduction. Although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided, GPCRs often function as monomers or dimers.

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation may occur, affecting the receptor's function and localization, although specific modifications for DRD5 are not detailed in the provided context. The DRD5 gene was initially thought to be intronless but contains a small intron in the 5' untranslated region (Sobell1995The). There is no mention of splice variant isoforms in the context provided.

## Function
The DRD5 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D5 (D5R), a G protein-coupled receptor involved in several critical physiological processes. In healthy human cells, D5R plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and sodium balance, primarily through its interaction with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). D5R activation leads to the degradation of AT1R via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, reducing AT1R protein levels and counteracting the prohypertensive effects of the renin-angiotensin system (Li2008Dopamine). This mechanism is crucial for maintaining normal blood pressure, as evidenced by increased AT1R expression and hypertension in D5R knockout mice (Li2008Dopamine).

D5R is also involved in reducing oxidative stress by regulating the expression and activity of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an enzyme with antioxidant properties. In D5R-deficient mice, decreased HO-1 activity leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and hypertension, highlighting D5R's role in blood pressure regulation and oxidative stress reduction (Lu2013D5).

In the brain, D5R is implicated in modulating neuronal signaling, influencing cognition, emotion, and behavior. It is distributed in regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia, where it may regulate functions like circadian rhythms and female sexual behaviors (Hollon2002Mice).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and polymorphisms in the DRD5 gene have been investigated for their potential association with various neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite initial studies identifying several sequence changes in the DRD5 gene, including a nonsense mutation (C335X) and multiple missense mutations (A269V, N351D, S453C, P330Q), no statistically significant association with schizophrenia was found (Sobell1995The). However, a post-hoc analysis suggested that heterozygotes for the C335X mutation might have a vulnerability to mild impairment in frontal lobe function, though these results require cautious interpretation (Sobell1995The).

In the Han Chinese population, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DRD5 gene, such as rs77434921 and rs1800762, have been associated with an increased risk of paranoid schizophrenia, particularly in males (Zhao2014Relationship). The DRD5 gene has also been implicated in cervical dystonia, with certain polymorphisms linked to an increased risk of the disease (Brancati2003Role).

Additionally, the DRD5 rs6283 polymorphism has been associated with blepharospasm, particularly affecting treatment responses to botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) (Jang2024Clinical). These findings suggest that genetic variations in DRD5 may influence susceptibility to certain neurological and psychiatric conditions.

## Interactions
The dopamine receptor D5 (DRD5) is involved in several significant protein interactions. One notable interaction is with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), where DRD5 acts as a negative regulator of AT1R protein expression. This interaction is crucial for blood pressure regulation, as DRD5 mediates the degradation of AT1R via a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Activation of DRD5 leads to the dissociation of its interaction with AT1R and promotes the proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated AT1Rs, specifically affecting the glycosylated form of AT1R (Li2008Dopamine).

DRD5 also interacts with ubiquitin, enhancing the ubiquitination of AT1R at the plasma membrane, which is necessary for its degradation. This interaction is confirmed through Förster/fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, demonstrating increased energy transfer between AT1R and ubiquitin upon DRD5 activation (Li2008Dopamine).

In the context of autophagy, DRD5 negatively regulates this process. Overexpression of DRD5 in 293T cells leads to decreased levels of LC3-II, a marker of autophagic flux, indicating its role as a negative regulator of autophagy (Wang2018Dopamine).
