# KIRREL3

## Overview
KIRREL3 is a gene that encodes the protein kirre like nephrin family adhesion molecule 3, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein functions as a synaptic cell-adhesion molecule, playing a pivotal role in neuronal connectivity and synapse formation, particularly within the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory. Structurally, kirre like nephrin family adhesion molecule 3 is characterized by its five immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region with a PDZ domain-binding motif, which facilitates its interactions with other proteins (Roh2017Increased; Liu2015Autism). The protein's ability to form homodimers is essential for its function in neuronal wiring and synapse development (Wang2021Molecular). Mutations in KIRREL3 have been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining proper cognitive and behavioral functions (Liu2015Autism; Querzani2023KIRREL3related).

## Structure
The KIRREL3 gene encodes a synaptic adhesion protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The primary structure of KIRREL3 includes five immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region that ends with a type I PDZ domain-binding motif (Roh2017Increased; Liu2015Autism). The secondary structure features beta-sheets typical of immunoglobulin folds, contributing to its adhesive function (Roh2017Increased).

KIRREL3 forms homodimers through its extracellular domains, which is crucial for its role in neuronal wiring and synapse formation. The dimerization interface involves specific polar and hydrophobic interactions that prevent heterodimerization with other Kirrel proteins (Wang2021Molecular). This structural specificity is essential for the proper coalescence of axons into glomeruli in the olfactory system (Wang2021Molecular).

Post-translational modifications of KIRREL3 may include glycosylation, which can affect protein stability and interactions (Durcan2014Identification). Alternative splicing results in different isoforms, such as Kirrel3 A and B, which differ in their intracellular domains and potentially have divergent functions (Durcan2014Identification). These isoforms may influence the protein's localization and interaction with other cellular components.

## Function
KIRREL3, also known as kin of IRRE-like protein 3, is a synaptic adhesion molecule that plays a critical role in synapse formation and neuronal connectivity, particularly in the hippocampus, a brain region essential for learning and memory. It is involved in the development of mossy fiber (MF) synapses by facilitating the formation of MF filopodia, which are crucial for connecting dentate gyrus (DG) neurons to GABAergic neurons. This connection is vital for maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the hippocampus, which is necessary for proper neuronal function and cognitive processes (Martin2015The).

KIRREL3 is expressed in DG neurons and a subset of GABAergic interneurons, where it mediates trans-cellular homophilic binding, essential for synapse development. Its absence leads to morphological defects in MF filopodia, resulting in fewer and shorter filopodia, although it does not affect other synaptic structures like the main bouton area or postsynaptic spine density (Martin2015The). KIRREL3's role extends to the regulation of synaptic plasticity and axonal pathfinding, contributing to the proper assembly and function of neuronal circuits (Völker2018Neph2Kirrel3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the KIRREL3 gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Jacobsen syndrome. KIRREL3 encodes a synaptic cell-adhesion molecule, and its disruption can lead to significant neurocognitive delays and behavioral abnormalities (Liu2015Autism; Querzani2023KIRREL3related). In particular, KIRREL3 mutations have been linked to ASD-related symptoms, such as social and communicative deficits, repetitive behaviors, and sensory abnormalities, as observed in Kirrel3-knockout mice (Hisaoka2018Abnormal).

Jacobsen syndrome, characterized by deletions on chromosome 11q, often includes KIRREL3 haploinsufficiency, which may contribute to neurocognitive delays and ASD (Guerin2012Interstitial). The gene's interaction with proteins such as MAP1B, MYO16, and CASK suggests its involvement in synaptic function and neuronal development, with disruptions potentially leading to ID and ASD (Liu2015Autism; Bhalla2008Alterations). Variants of KIRREL3 have also been associated with childhood apraxia of speech, cerebellar hypoplasia, and mild dysmorphic features, expanding the clinical spectrum of KIRREL3-related disorders (Querzani2023KIRREL3related).

## Interactions
KIRREL3, a synaptic cell-adhesion molecule, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for neurodevelopment. It interacts with the microtubule-associated protein light chain (MAP1BLC1) and an unconventional myosin protein (MYO16) through its extracellular domain (ECD) (Liu2015Autism). These interactions are significant for synaptic actin cytoskeleton regulation, with MAP1B involved in neuronal morphogenesis and MYO16 in PI3K signaling (Liu2015Autism). The intracellular domain (ICD) of KIRREL3 interacts with ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, beta 1 polypeptide (ATP1B1), ubiquitin-fold modifier conjugating enzyme 1 (UFC1), and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), which are associated with synaptic function and energy regulation (Liu2015Autism).

KIRREL3 also interacts with nephrin, a protein expressed in developing muscle spindles, which is significant for the adhesion of nerve fibers to muscle fibers during development (Komori2008Expression). This interaction is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays, indicating a role in axonal pathfinding and synapse formation (Komori2008Expression). These interactions suggest that KIRREL3 plays a role in synapse structure and function, potentially linking it to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism and intellectual disability (Liu2015Autism).
