# FCN1

## Overview
The FCN1 gene encodes the protein ficolin 1, also known as M-ficolin, which is a crucial component of the innate immune system. Ficolin 1 is a pattern-recognition molecule that plays a significant role in the lectin complement pathway by binding to specific carbohydrate structures on the surface of pathogens, thereby facilitating their opsonization and clearance. This protein is primarily expressed in bone marrow and peripheral leukocytes, including monocytes and granulocytes, and can be secreted or membrane-associated. Structurally, ficolin 1 is a multimeric protein composed of subunits that form trimeric structures, which further assemble into higher-order oligomers. These oligomers are essential for its function in the immune response. Ficolin 1 interacts with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASP)-1 and MASP-2, as well as immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), enhancing its role in pathogen recognition and immune modulation (Okuzaki2017FCN1; Ammitzbøll2012NonSynonymous; Liu2005Human).

## Structure
Ficolin 1, encoded by the FCN1 gene, is a multimeric protein composed of subunits approximately 34-35 kDa in size. The primary structure of ficolin 1 includes a polypeptide chain of 326 amino acids (Garred2009The). The protein features an N-terminal domain with cysteine residues, a collagen-like domain characterized by Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like binding (FBG) domain (Garred2009The). 

In terms of secondary structure, the collagen-like domain is notable for its Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats, which are typical of collagenous structures. Unlike other collagen-like proteins, ficolin 1 lacks the α-helical neck region between the collagen-like region and the recognition domain (Garred2009The). 

The tertiary structure includes the FBG domain, which is responsible for binding negatively charged carbohydrates, such as N-acetylglucosamine (Garred2009The). 

Ficolin 1 forms trimeric structures that further assemble into higher-order oligomers, typically composed of four or more trimers linked by disulfide bonds, similar to mannose-binding lectin (MBL) (Ammitzbøll2012NonSynonymous; Garred2009The). These oligomeric structures are crucial for its function in the immune system, particularly in the lectin pathway of the complement system (Ammitzbøll2012NonSynonymous). 

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common in ficolin 1, contributing to its stability and function.

## Function
The FCN1 gene encodes M-ficolin, a protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by participating in the lectin complement pathway. M-ficolin is a pattern-recognition molecule that binds to carbohydrate structures on the surface of pathogens, facilitating their opsonization and subsequent neutralization. This binding leads to the activation of the lectin complement pathway, which is an essential component of the immune response, helping to differentiate self from non-self and clear pathogens from the body (Ammitzbøll2012NonSynonymous; Katayama2018Ficolin-1).

M-ficolin is primarily expressed in bone marrow and peripheral leukocytes, including monocytes and granulocytes. It is secreted upon stimulation and can also be found as a membrane-associated protein on these cells (Ammitzbøll2012NonSynonymous). The protein has a specific ligand-binding ability for sialic acid, which is not shared with other ficolins, and it binds to capsulated bacteria like Group B Streptococcus (Ammitzbøll2012NonSynonymous). M-ficolin also interacts with C-reactive protein, enhancing its binding to bacteria, which suggests a role in both pathogen recognition and clearance (Ammitzbøll2012NonSynonymous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FCN1 gene, which encodes the protein ficolin-1, have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FCN1 expression is notably dysregulated, and its expression levels are linked to immune cell infiltration and treatment resistance. High FCN1 expression correlates with better outcomes in immune checkpoint blockade therapy, while low expression is associated with higher tumor stemness scores, indicating increased resistance to traditional therapies (Zhong2024Multiomics).

Polymorphisms in the FCN1 gene, such as the -144 C/A SNP, have been linked to severe pneumonia outcomes in children. The A/A genotype is associated with higher serum M-ficolin levels and increased severity of pneumonia, sepsis, and septic shock (Elkoumi2020Ficolin‐1).

In rheumatic fever (RF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), certain FCN1 polymorphisms are associated with increased susceptibility to these conditions. The c.-1981A and c.-144A alleles are linked to higher FCN1 expression and may offer protection against RF but increase susceptibility to RHD symptoms (Catarino2018Sickening).

In AML, lower serum ficolin-1 levels are observed in patients compared to healthy controls, and specific FCN1 haplotypes may be risk factors for AML, especially when complicated by severe infections (Sokołowska2020Associations).

## Interactions
FCN1, also known as ficolin-1 or M-ficolin, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in the immune system. It forms complexes with mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASP)-1 and MASP-2, which are essential for activating the lectin complement pathway (Liu2005Human). These interactions facilitate the conversion of proenzymes to active forms, leading to the activation of the complement system (Ammitzbøll2012NonSynonymous).

FCN1 also interacts with immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), particularly in the context of Kawasaki disease. The collagen-like domain of FCN1 binds to specific fragments of IgG1, such as the IgG-3 fragment, with the Myc-IgG-3-d domain showing the highest affinity (Okuzaki2017FCN1). This interaction is significant for the therapeutic effects of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy in Kawasaki disease patients, as FCN1 levels are reduced following treatment (Okuzaki2017FCN1).

Additionally, FCN1 binds to microbial carbohydrates, such as N-acetylglucosamine, facilitating opsonization and phagocytosis (Teh2000M‐ficolin). This binding capability allows FCN1 to recognize and interact with pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus (Liu2005Human).
