# WNT1

## Overview
The WNT1 gene encodes the protein Wnt family member 1, which is a pivotal component of the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical regulator of various cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion. Wnt family member 1 is a secreted signaling protein characterized by a high cysteine content, which is essential for its structural integrity and function (Mason1992Mutational). This protein interacts with Frizzled receptors on the cell surface, initiating a cascade that influences the stability of β-catenin, a key player in cell signaling and adhesion (Pennica1998WISP). Wnt family member 1 is particularly significant in neural development and organogenesis, and its dysregulation is implicated in various pathologies, including bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta (Mäkitie2017Impaired; SaitoDiaz2012The).

## Structure
The WNT1 protein is a member of the Wnt family, characterized by a sequence rich in cysteine residues, which are crucial for its structural integrity and function (Mason1992Mutational). The primary structure of WNT1 includes several conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, essential for maintaining the protein's tertiary structure (Mason1992Mutational). The secondary structure of WNT1 predominantly consists of random coils (42%), followed by alpha helices (35%), extended strands (16%), and beta turns (7%) (Mondal2022In).

WNT1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and palmitoylation, which are important for its secretion and function. Glycosylation occurs at several asparagine-linked sites, although it is not essential for the protein's biological activity (Mason1992Mutational). Palmitoylation, particularly in regions dependent on porcupine (PORCN), is crucial for WNT1 secretion (Mondal2022In).

In terms of quaternary structure, WNT1 interacts with frizzled receptors, specifically binding to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of these receptors, which is vital for its signaling role (Mondal2022In). These interactions are significant in the context of cellular signaling pathways and tumorigenesis (Mondal2022In).

## Function
The WNT1 gene encodes a protein that is a member of the Wnt family, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, WNT1 is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation. It functions by binding to Frizzled receptors on the cell surface, initiating a signaling cascade that inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). This inhibition leads to the stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which then translocates to the nucleus to interact with TCF/Lef1 transcription factors, activating target gene transcription (Hsu1998Modulation; Pennica1998WISP).

WNT1 also influences the stability and accumulation of catenins, such as β-catenin and plakoglobin, which are essential for cell adhesion and signaling pathways. By decreasing their degradation rate, WNT1 enhances cell-to-cell adhesion through the stabilization of cadherin-catenin complexes (Papkoff1996Wnt1). Additionally, WNT1 affects the tumor suppressor protein APC, stabilizing APC-catenin complexes and suggesting a regulatory mechanism for β-catenin turnover (Papkoff1996Wnt1).

The WNT1 protein is active at the cell membrane and is involved in processes like axis patterning and organogenesis, particularly influencing neural development (SaitoDiaz2012The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the WNT1 gene are associated with several bone-related diseases. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations, such as the C218G mutation, are linked to early-onset osteoporosis, a condition characterized by low bone mineral density and an increased risk of fractures (Katoh2017Molecular; Mäkitie2017Impaired). Homozygous loss-of-function mutations, like the S295X mutation, are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, a severe prenatal-onset osteoporotic disease marked by brittle bones (Katoh2017Molecular).

The WNT1 mutation also leads to significant spinal pathology. Individuals with a heterozygous WNT1 mutation exhibit a high prevalence of vertebral compression fractures, particularly in those over 50 years old, and increased thoracic kyphosis. These spinal issues are not observed in individuals without the mutation (Mäkitie2017Impaired).

The WNT1 gene plays a crucial role in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for bone metabolism, influencing bone formation, osteoclastogenesis, and cartilage homeostasis. Impaired WNT signaling due to WNT1 mutations results in defects in bone formation and an osteoporotic phenotype (Mäkitie2017Impaired).

## Interactions
WNT1 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It forms a stable complex with the 78-kDa binding protein BiP, which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and associates with misfolded or unassembled secretory proteins. This interaction requires WNT1 to enter the secretory pathway, as demonstrated by the absence of BiP association in cells expressing leaderless WNT1 proteins (Kitajewski1992Interaction).

WNT1 also influences the stability and formation of complexes involving β-catenin and cadherins. It stabilizes β-catenin binding to cadherins, enhancing cell-cell adhesion by increasing the stability of the β-catenin/cadherin complex at the cell surface. This stabilization is crucial for strengthening cell adhesion and is achieved without altering the synthesis rates of cadherins (Hinck1994Wnt1).

Additionally, WNT1 regulates the levels of catenins and their complexes with the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein. It increases the stability of APC-catenin complexes and elevates the steady-state levels of both catenins and APC. This regulation involves the accumulation of monomeric β-catenin, which is otherwise reduced by APC, suggesting that WNT1 inhibits the function of APC in degrading uncomplexed β-catenin (Papkoff1996Wnt1).
