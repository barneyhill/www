# PDCD1LG2

## Overview
PDCD1LG2 is a gene that encodes the protein programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2), a type I transmembrane protein involved in immune regulation. PD-L2 is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells and plays a critical role in modulating immune responses by interacting with the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells. This interaction is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity by inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation. PD-L2 has a higher binding affinity to PD-1 compared to its counterpart, PD-L1, due to unique structural features, which may have implications in immune tolerance and cancer immune evasion (Philips2020The). The gene's expression and its protein product are significant in various clinical contexts, including cancer prognosis and immune response modulation (Liang2021Programmed; Huang2020Prognostic).

## Structure
The PDCD1LG2 protein, also known as PD-L2, is a ligand for the PD-1 receptor and plays a crucial role in immune regulation. Structurally, PD-L2 is characterized by immunoglobulin-like domains in its extracellular region, which are essential for its interaction with PD-1 (Lázár-Molnár2008Crystal). The protein's structure includes a unique binding interface formed by the front β-sheets of both PD-1 and PD-L2 IgV domains. This interface involves residues from the GFCC' strands and CC', CC'', and FG loops of PD-1, which pack against the AGFC strands and FG loop of the PD-L2 IgV domain, burying a surface area of 1,915 Å² (Lázár-Molnár2008Crystal).

PD-L2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its stability and function. The protein may exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context. The structural insights into the PD-1/PD-L2 complex are significant for understanding the signaling mechanisms associated with PD-1 interactions and for designing novel immunotherapeutic tools (Tang2019A). The compact nature of the PD-1/PD-L2 complex, with an end-to-end distance of approximately 76 Å, distinguishes it from other immune checkpoint complexes (Lázár-Molnár2008Crystal).

## Function
PDCD1LG2, also known as PD-L2, is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in immune regulation by interacting with the PD-1 receptor on T lymphocytes. This interaction is crucial for modulating adaptive immunity and maintaining immune homeostasis. PD-L2 is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and some B cells, and it can be induced in other cell types by various stimuli, particularly Th2-associated cytokines (Chen2023The; Philips2020The).

PD-L2 binds to PD-1 with a higher affinity than PD-L1, another ligand for PD-1, due to unique structural features such as the W110 'elbow' and the C-D 'latch' that enhance its binding dynamics (Philips2020The). These structural adaptations are thought to have evolved in placental mammals, suggesting a role in immune tolerance during pregnancy (Philips2020The).

In healthy human cells, PD-L2 contributes to immune tolerance by inhibiting T cell proliferation and function, which is essential for preventing autoimmunity and maintaining self-tolerance (Philips2020The). Its expression in normal tissues, such as the urothelium, indicates a role in maintaining immune privilege in specific tissues (Dowell2021PDL2).

## Clinical Significance
PDCD1LG2, also known as PD-L2, plays a significant role in cancer progression and immune evasion. Alterations in PDCD1LG2 expression are linked to various cancer prognoses and immune interactions. In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), particularly among female never-smokers, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PDCD1LG2 gene, such as rs12237624 and rs78096119, are associated with increased cancer risk, especially in individuals with a history of pulmonary tuberculosis (Liang2021Programmed).

In colorectal cancer, PDCD1LG2 expression is inversely associated with lymphocytic reactions, which are linked to better patient survival, suggesting that PDCD1LG2 may suppress antitumor immunity (Masugi2017Tumor). In colon carcinoma, high PDCD1LG2 expression correlates with better overall survival, particularly in advanced stages, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Huang2020Prognostic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PDCD1LG2 expression is associated with recurrence events and immune infiltration, highlighting its role in immune escape mechanisms (Sheng2020Programmed). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PDCD1LG2 in cancer prognosis and treatment response.

## Interactions
PDCD1LG2, also known as PD-L2, is a ligand for the PD-1 receptor, which is expressed on T cells. This interaction plays a crucial role in inhibiting T cell activation and modulating immune responses. PD-L2, along with PD-L1, binds to PD-1, leading to the inhibition of T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated proliferation and cytokine production by CD4+ T cells (Latchman2001PD-L2). The engagement of PD-1 by PD-L2 can inhibit strong B7-CD28 signals at low antigen concentrations and reduce cytokine production at high antigen concentrations without inhibiting T cell proliferation (Latchman2001PD-L2).

PD-L2 interactions with PD-1 involve the recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which is phosphorylated upon PD-1 engagement. This suggests a mechanism for down-modulating TCR signaling events, similar to the B7–CTLA-4 pathway, which is involved in the induction of tolerance (Latchman2001PD-L2). PD-L2 is also expressed in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and other immune cells, where it correlates with immune and stromal scores in cancers, indicating its role in the tumor microenvironment (Lv2023Pancancer). The interaction between PD-L2 and PD-1 is stronger than that of PD-L1, which may help cancer cells evade the immune system (Lv2023Pancancer).
