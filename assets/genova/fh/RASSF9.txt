# RASSF9

## Overview
RASSF9 is a gene that encodes the protein Ras association domain family member 9, which is part of the Ras association domain family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a conserved Ras association (RA) domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions, particularly with members of the Ras family of proteins (Volodko2014RASSF). Unlike some other members of the RASSF family, RASSF9 lacks the SARAH domain, which is typically involved in interactions with Hippo kinases (Thillaivillalan2020RASSF). RASSF9 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues and plays a significant role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis by regulating keratinocyte growth and differentiation (Lee2011A). The protein's interactions with various signaling molecules, including Ras proteins and the kinase TAK1, underscore its involvement in critical cellular pathways that influence cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as its potential implications in cancer biology (Shi2021TAK1; Yuan2021RASSF9).

## Structure
RASSF9, also known as P-CIP1, is a member of the Ras association domain family of proteins. It contains a conserved Ras association (RA) domain located at the C-terminus, which is a characteristic feature of the RASSF family involved in protein-protein interactions (Volodko2014RASSF). The RA domain of RASSF9 shares structural characteristics with other RASSF proteins, such as the ubiquitin superfold (ββαββαβ), which is common among effector RAS-binding domains (Thillaivillalan2020RASSF). Unlike some other RASSF family members, RASSF9 lacks the SARAH domain, which is involved in interactions with Hippo kinases (Thillaivillalan2020RASSF).

RASSF9 is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissue, and its deficiency in mice suggests a role in epidermal development (Volodko2014RASSF). The protein interacts with RIT1, a member of the RAS family, and this interaction is characterized by specific amino acid deviations that affect binding affinity (Rezaei2021A). RASSF9 contains two negatively charged glutamic acids instead of positively charged lysine residues, which may influence its interaction with HRAS (Rezaei2021A). The RA domain of RASSF9 does not cluster with C-RASSFs but rather with RA domains from ASPP effectors (Thillaivillalan2020RASSF).

## Function
RASSF9, a member of the Ras-association domain family, plays a crucial role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis by regulating keratinocyte growth and differentiation. It is predominantly expressed in epithelial tissues, particularly in the epidermis, where it is active throughout the basal and suprabasal layers of the skin (Volodko2014RASSF; Lee2011A). RASSF9 influences keratinocyte proliferation by modulating the expression of p21Cip1, a cell cycle regulator. In the absence of RASSF9, p21Cip1 expression is downregulated, leading to increased keratinocyte proliferation and hyperplasia (Lee2011A).

RASSF9 is also involved in the differentiation of keratinocytes, as evidenced by its role in regulating the expression of differentiation markers such as loricrin and filaggrin. The absence of RASSF9 results in reduced expression of these markers, indicating defects in keratinocyte differentiation (Lee2011A). The protein's activity is linked to the modulation of Ras protein activity, which is involved in various cellular functions, including proliferation and differentiation (Lee2011A). Overall, RASSF9 is essential for the proper regulation of epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation, contributing to the maintenance of skin homeostasis (Lee2011A).

## Clinical Significance
RASSF9 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RASSF9 expression is upregulated, promoting tumor cell proliferation through the activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Knockdown of RASSF9 in NSCLC cells results in reduced cell proliferation, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yuan2021RASSF9). Conversely, in breast and gastric cancers, RASSF9 expression is decreased, where it acts to suppress cell proliferation, indicating a context-dependent role in cancer (Yuan2021RASSF9).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), RASSF9 is involved in tumor progression by enhancing cell proliferation. TAK1, a kinase, phosphorylates RASSF9, which disrupts its interaction with the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. This suggests that RASSF9's role in cancer can vary significantly depending on the cellular context and its interactions with other proteins (Shi2021TAK1).

RASSF9 has also been identified as a candidate susceptibility variant in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, although specific pathogenic mutations in this context are not well-documented (Donner2018Candidate).

## Interactions
RASSF9 interacts with several proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways. It has been shown to bind to Ras proteins, specifically N-Ras, K-Ras, and R-Ras, and can induce dimerization of RAS, promoting cell growth in certain cancers (Yuan2021RASSF9). RASSF9 also interacts with RIT1, a protein not previously reported as a RAS effector, with an affinity of 34 µM. This interaction was validated through residue-swapping experiments and cell-based pulldown assays, suggesting that RASSF9 and RIT1 interactions are physiologically relevant (Rezaei2021A).

TAK1, a serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylates RASSF9 at the serine residue 284 (S284). This phosphorylation disrupts RAS dimerization and inhibits the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, leading to reduced tumor cell growth. The interaction between TAK1 and RASSF9 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (Shi2021TAK1). These interactions highlight RASSF9's role in modulating key signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and tumor progression.
