# PGK1

## Overview
Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is a gene that encodes the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase 1, a key player in the glycolytic pathway. This enzyme is classified as a kinase due to its role in catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. PGK1 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with the exception of the testes, where a distinct isoform, PGK2, is present. Beyond its primary function in glycolysis, PGK1 is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA replication and repair, and has been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis and tumor growth. The enzyme's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications and interactions with other proteins, which can influence its role in cellular metabolism and disease states (Chiarelli2012Molecular; Fu2020Phosphoglycerate; Echaniz‐Laguna2019Phosphoglycerate).

## Structure
Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is a monomeric enzyme composed of 417 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 45 kDa. The enzyme features a conserved tertiary structure across species, characterized by two distinct α-helical domains connected by a hinge region (Fiorillo2018The; Valentini2013Protein). These domains form a bilobal shape, with the N-terminal domain binding 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) or 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG), and the C-terminal domain binding MgADP or MgATP (Chiarelli2012Molecular; Fiorillo2018The). The structure includes two Rossmann fold domains, separated by a cleft, which facilitates the enzyme's hinge-bending motion necessary for its catalytic activity (Valentini2013Protein).

PGK1 undergoes conformational changes between open, partially closed, and closed forms during its catalytic cycle, with substrate binding triggering these transitions (Fiorillo2018The). The structural integrity of PGK1 is maintained by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds, which are crucial for its stability and function (Valentini2013Protein). Common post-translational modifications of PGK1 include phosphorylation and acetylation, which may influence its activity and interactions. PGK1 does not typically form quaternary structures, functioning effectively as a monomer.

## Function
Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is a critical enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, primarily responsible for catalyzing the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate, a reaction that generates ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation. This step is essential for energy production in cells, particularly under anaerobic conditions (Chiarelli2012Molecular; Fu2020Phosphoglycerate). PGK1 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells, except in the testes where a PGK2 isoform is present (Echaniz‐Laguna2019Phosphoglycerate).

In addition to its role in glycolysis, PGK1 is involved in several other cellular processes. It can phosphorylate L-nucleoside analogues, which are used in antiviral and anticancer therapies, and participates in DNA replication and repair within mammalian cell nuclei (Chiarelli2012Molecular). PGK1 also exhibits thiol reductase activity on plasmin, leading to angiostatin formation, which inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth (Chiarelli2012Molecular).

PGK1 is a monomeric enzyme with two domains that bind different substrates, undergoing significant conformational changes during its catalytic cycle. It requires magnesium ions for activity and is activated by high concentrations of either 3-phosphoglycerate or MgATP, as well as low concentrations of various multivalent anions (Chiarelli2012Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PGK1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. PGK1 deficiency, a rare genetic disorder, results from mutations in the PGK1 gene located on the X chromosome. This condition is characterized by chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, neurological dysfunctions, and myopathy. The disease is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, predominantly affecting males, while females may be asymptomatic carriers. Clinical symptoms can vary widely, including exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, mental retardation, developmental delays, seizures, and ataxia (Svaasand2007Altered; Valentini2013Protein).

In cancer, PGK1 is implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. High expression levels of PGK1 are linked to poor survival outcomes in various cancers, including breast, head and neck, cervical, liver, and pancreatic cancers. In breast cancer, high PGK1 expression is associated with larger tumor size, advanced stages, and chemoresistance to paclitaxel treatment. It is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process, promoting metastasis through a feedback loop with HIF-1α (Fu2018PGK1; Sun2015Phosphoglycerate; Li2021Expression). PGK1's role in cancer metabolism and its interaction with tumor-associated factors make it a potential target for diagnosis and therapy (Fu2020Phosphoglycerate).

## Interactions
Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is involved in various protein interactions that extend beyond its traditional role in glycolysis. PGK1 interacts with Beclin1, a key protein in autophagy, under conditions of glutamine deprivation and hypoxia. This interaction is facilitated by PGK1's phosphorylation of Beclin1 at the S30 residue, which is crucial for autophagy initiation (Qian2017Phosphoglycerate). PGK1 also interacts with the VPS34-Beclin1 complex, enhancing autophagy under nutrient-deprived conditions (Qian2017Phosphoglycerate).

In cancer, PGK1 has been shown to phosphorylate PDHK1, inhibiting mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism and promoting lactate production, which supports tumor growth (Li2016MitochondriaTranslocated). PGK1's interaction with PDHK1 is crucial for regulating PDH activity, particularly under hypoxic conditions (Li2016MitochondriaTranslocated).

PGK1 also interacts with HIV-1 Tat Specific Factor 1 (HTATSF1) in lung cancer, where it translocates to the nucleus and influences cancer cell migration and metastasis (Chang2021Metabolic). Additionally, extracellular PGK1 interacts with neural membrane protein Enolase-2 (Eno2), promoting neurite outgrowth in motor neurons (Fu2023Extracellular).
