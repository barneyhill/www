# CCR4

## Overview
CCR4 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 4) is a gene that encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the immune system's regulation and function. The CCR4 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, which facilitate its role as a receptor on the surface of various immune cells, including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and airway epithelial cells. This receptor is pivotal in mediating the effects of chemokines, particularly CCL17 and CCL22, which are crucial for directing the movement and function of immune cells. CCR4's involvement in immune cell trafficking and its expression in specific cell types underscore its importance in maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance, as well as its role in inflammatory responses. Clinically, CCR4 is significant in the pathogenesis of certain lymphomas, such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, where it is often overexpressed or mutated, influencing disease progression and treatment outcomes (Kawano2019Clinical; Nicolay2021CCR4; Yoshie2021CCR4).

## Structure
CCR4 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 4) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane alpha-helices, which are aligned parallel and packed in a compact bundle. The extracellular face of CCR4 includes an extended, largely unstructured N-terminal region and three extracellular loops (ECL1, ECL2, and ECL3). These loops are connected by conserved disulfide bonds, specifically linking the N-terminus to ECL3 and ECL1 to ECL2. ECL2 is the longest loop and contains a β-hairpin structure (Stone2017Mechanisms).

The cytoplasmic face of CCR4 features three intracellular loops (ICL1, ICL2, and ICL3) and a C-terminal region, which is expected to contain an additional helix, known as helix 8, and a site for lipid anchor attachment (Stone2017Mechanisms). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and phosphorylation are common in GPCRs and can influence receptor function, although specific modifications for CCR4 are not detailed in the provided context.

CCR4 interacts with its ligands, CCL17 and CCL22, through its extracellular regions, playing a significant role in immune cell trafficking (Unknownauthors2005Leukocyte). The receptor's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in immune response regulation.

## Function
CCR4 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 4) is a protein that plays a significant role in the immune system by mediating the effects of chemokines, which are signaling proteins that guide the movement of immune cells. It is expressed on the surface of various cell types, including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and airway epithelial cells. In Tregs, CCR4 is crucial for their trafficking and function, particularly in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses. It facilitates the migration of Tregs to specific sites, such as mesenteric lymph nodes, where they suppress pathogenic effector T cells and prevent conditions like colitis (Yuan2007CCR4dependent).

In airway epithelial cells, CCR4 is involved in the response to the chemokine CCL17, leading to the induction of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide involved in inflammatory responses. This interaction is important for regulating inflammatory mediators in the respiratory system and may contribute to conditions such as asthma and allergic reactions (Bonner2013CCL17thymus). CCR4's role in these processes highlights its importance in immune surveillance and homeostasis, influencing both local and systemic immune responses.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CCR4 gene are clinically significant in several diseases, particularly in certain types of lymphomas. In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), including mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS), CCR4 is highly expressed on malignant T cells. This expression facilitates the migration of these cells to the skin, contributing to disease progression. The CCR4-CCL17/CCL22 axis is crucial in CTCL pathogenesis, promoting the migration and aggregation of malignant T cells and aiding immune evasion by recruiting regulatory T cells (Tregs) into the tumor microenvironment (Nicolay2021CCR4).

In adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), CCR4 is also highly expressed, and gain-of-function mutations in the gene are common. These mutations often truncate the carboxy terminus, preventing receptor internalization and enhancing cell migration toward its ligands, CCL17 and CCL22. Such mutations are found in a significant proportion of ATLL cases and are associated with increased cell proliferation and survival (Yoshie2021CCR4).

Therapeutically, CCR4 is targeted by mogamulizumab, a monoclonal antibody used in treating relapsed or refractory CTCL and ATLL. However, the presence of CCR4 mutations can affect the response to this treatment, with some mutations linked to poorer outcomes (Kawano2019Clinical).
