# PPP5C

## Overview
The PPP5C gene encodes the protein phosphatase 5 catalytic subunit (PP5), a serine/threonine phosphatase that plays a pivotal role in various cellular processes. PP5 is characterized by its structural domains, including a catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain with tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions (Das1998The; Yang2004Molecular). As a serine/threonine phosphatase, PP5 is involved in regulating signal transduction pathways, stress responses, and cell cycle progression by dephosphorylating key proteins (Neumann2021The). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing pathways such as glucocorticoid receptor signaling and DNA damage repair (Neumann2021The). PP5's interactions with various proteins, including heat shock proteins and transcription factors, underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer and other diseases (Liu2005Dephosphorylation; Golden2008The).

## Structure
The PPP5C gene encodes protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), a serine/threonine phosphatase characterized by distinct structural domains. The primary structure of PP5 includes a catalytic domain and an N-terminal regulatory domain composed of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Das1998The; Yang2004Molecular).

The secondary structure of the TPR domain consists of three tandem TPR motifs, each formed by a pair of antiparallel alpha-helices. These motifs create a right-handed superhelical structure with a concave and convex surface (Das1998The; Yang2004Molecular). The catalytic domain features a central beta-sandwich surrounded by alpha-helices, coordinating two metal ions essential for its enzymatic activity (Yang2004Molecular; Swingle2004Structural).

In terms of tertiary structure, the TPR and catalytic domains form autonomously folded structures. The TPR domain interacts with the phosphatase domain to maintain an autoinhibited conformation, blocking access to the catalytic site (Yang2004Molecular; Swingle2004Structural).

Quaternary structure interactions are observed in the crystal form, where PP5 forms dimers, although it behaves as a monomer in solution (Yang2004Molecular). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence PP5's activity and interactions (Sager2020Structure).

## Function
Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), encoded by the PPP5C gene, is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, PP5 plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating signal transduction pathways. It is involved in dephosphorylating stress-related kinases, which aids in stress response and cell cycle progression (Neumann2021The). PP5 is also implicated in DNA damage repair and influences transcription through interactions with cytosolic transcription factors like heat shock factor 1 (Neumann2021The).

PP5 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates pathways such as glucocorticoid receptor signaling. It forms complexes with heat shock proteins, such as HSP90, and glucocorticoid receptors, potentially influencing gene transcription by dephosphorylating the glucocorticoid receptor complex (Neumann2021The). This dephosphorylation may reduce the receptor's ability to transactivate genes in the absence of glucocorticoids (Neumann2021The).

In the context of cardiac function, PP5 is involved in dephosphorylating calcium regulatory proteins, which can impact cardiac health (Neumann2021The). Additionally, PP5 is known to dephosphorylate tau protein, a process that is crucial for maintaining normal tau activity and preventing pathological hyperphosphorylation (Liu2005Dephosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PPP5C gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, PPP5C is overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation and survival by regulating the phosphorylation of JNK and ERK1/2. Knockdown of PPP5C in prostate cancer cell lines results in inhibited cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Lv2018PPP5C). Similarly, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PPP5C acts as an oncogene. It is a direct target of microRNA-365b-3p, which is downregulated in NSCLC. Overexpression of miR-365b-3p or knockdown of PPP5C leads to reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating that PPP5C could be a promising therapeutic target in NSCLC (Zhang2021MicroRNA‑365b‑3p).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, PPP5C is widely expressed, and its knockdown inhibits cell growth and induces cell cycle arrest, highlighting its role in cancer progression (Feng2014Knockdown). PPP5C is also involved in stress-induced signaling networks and cancer, with its inhibition shown to enhance the effects of certain cancer treatments (D’Arcy2019The; Golden2008The). These findings underscore the clinical significance of PPP5C in cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PPP5C, or protein phosphatase 5 catalytic subunit, is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with Dvl2, a key component in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it dephosphorylates Dvl2 and regulates its phosphorylation state. This interaction is enhanced by Dvl2 phosphorylation and involves both the N-terminal TPR domain and the C-terminal phosphatase domain of PPP5C (Xie2018PP5).

PPP5C also interacts with SMAD2 and SMAD3 proteins in the transforming growth factor‐β (TGFβ) pathway, where it acts as a phosphatase, modulating TGFβ signaling by dephosphorylating SMAD3 (Bruce2012Protein). In the context of the ISOC channel, PPP5C interacts with FKBP51, which is crucial for inhibiting inter-endothelial cell gap formation and maintaining vascular permeability. This interaction is necessary for FKBP51-mediated inhibition of the ISOC channel (Hamilton2018Serinethreonine).

PPP5C is also known to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) through the GR-Hsp90 heterocomplex, where it dephosphorylates GR, affecting its activity and nuclear translocation (Golden2008The). Additionally, PPP5C interacts with DNA-PKcs, a key player in the DNA damage response, suggesting a role in dephosphorylating DNA-PKcs (Wechsler2004DNA–PKcs).
