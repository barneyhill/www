# LMNTD2

## Overview
The LMNTD2 gene encodes the protein lamin tail domain containing 2, which is a member of the lamin family of proteins. These proteins are integral components of the nuclear lamina, a dense fibrillar network inside the nucleus of eukaryotic cells that provides structural support and regulates essential cellular processes such as DNA replication and cell division. Lamin tail domain containing 2 is characterized by its unique tail domain, which distinguishes it from other lamin proteins and suggests specialized functions within the nuclear architecture. Although the precise biological roles of LMNTD2 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in maintaining nuclear integrity and potential interactions with other nuclear components are areas of active research. Understanding the function and regulation of LMNTD2 is crucial, as mutations or dysregulation of lamin proteins are often associated with a variety of human diseases, including muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies (Qiu2020aarFDC).
