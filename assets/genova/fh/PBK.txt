# PBK

## Overview
PDZ binding kinase (PBK), also known as T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to cell cycle regulation and mitosis. The protein product of the PBK gene, PDZ binding kinase, is characterized by its kinase activity and is known to play a crucial role in the phosphorylation of key proteins during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, thereby influencing chromosomal dynamics and mitotic progression (Park2006PDZBinding). PBK is highly expressed in proliferating cells, including neural progenitor cells and certain immune cells, and its activity is regulated through phosphorylation events that are cell cycle-dependent (Dougherty2005PBKTOPK). The kinase is also implicated in various cancers, where its overexpression is often associated with poor prognosis, highlighting its potential as a target for cancer therapy (Ohashi2016Overexpression; Wen2021An).

## Structure
PDZ-binding kinase (PBK), also known as T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), is a serine/threonine kinase with a primary structure consisting of 322 amino acids and a molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa (Gaudet2000Characterization). The protein includes conserved kinase subdomains and a C-terminal ETDV motif, which is crucial for binding to the PDZ2 domain of hDlg (Gaudet2000Characterization).

The secondary structure of PBK is characterized by 6 beta-strands and 14 alpha-helices, as revealed by the crystal structure of a mutant form of human PBK (T9E, T198E) determined at a resolution of 2.70 Å (Dong2016The). The tertiary structure shows that PBK can form an inactive dimer under alkaline conditions, with the N-terminus of one molecule joining the C-terminal region of the other, suggesting a possible interaction mode (Dong2016The).

PBK undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are cell cycle-dependent and crucial for its activation during mitosis (Gaudet2000Characterization). Phosphorylation events influence PBK's transition between monomeric and dimeric forms, with the active form being a monomer (Dong2016The). These structural features and modifications are significant for PBK's role in cell cycle regulation and its association with various cancers.

## Function
PBK (PDZ binding kinase), also known as T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK), is a serine-threonine kinase involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly during mitosis. It functions as a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) and is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. PBK plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation, especially in the G2/M phase, where it is involved in the phosphorylation of key proteins such as histone H3 at Ser 10, which is crucial for chromosomal dynamics and mitotic progression (Park2006PDZBinding).

In healthy human cells, PBK is essential for maintaining genomic stability and is highly expressed in proliferating cells, including neural progenitor cells and certain immune cells. It is activated by phosphorylation, particularly at the cyclinB/CDK1 site, and is involved in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which is crucial for cell cycle progression and proliferation (Dougherty2005PBKTOPK). PBK's activity is cell cycle-dependent, with increased expression during mitosis, indicating its role in cell proliferation and differentiation (Park2006PDZBinding).

PBK is also implicated in cytokinesis, where it promotes the process through phosphorylation of proteins like PRC1, ensuring proper cell division and proliferation (Hu2010PBKTOPK). Its expression is tightly regulated and is crucial for the self-renewal and proliferation of progenitor cells, particularly in neural tissues (Dougherty2005PBKTOPK).

## Clinical Significance
The PBK (PDZ binding kinase) gene is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression and interactions. Overexpression of PBK is observed in several cancer types, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), breast cancer, gastric carcinoma, and others, often correlating with poor prognosis and increased tumor malignancy (Ohashi2016Overexpression; Wen2021An). In LUAD, high PBK expression is linked to the proximal proliferative subtype, which is associated with a poor prognosis, while low expression is linked to better outcomes (Ma2023PBK). PBK's role in cancer progression is partly due to its involvement in oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and its potential to facilitate immune escape through hypoxic processes and HIF signaling (Ma2023PBK).

PBK also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, affecting the expression of p53's transcriptional targets like p21, which can lead to increased tumor cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy (Hu2010PBKTOPK). In gastric carcinoma, PBK overexpression serves as an independent prognostic factor for poor outcomes, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis (Ohashi2016Overexpression). Additionally, PBK mutations, such as the p.Gly43Arg variant, have been associated with kidney stone disease, affecting protein function and cellular signaling pathways (Nettuwakul2020A).

## Interactions
PBK (PDZ binding kinase) is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. One of the key interactions of PBK is with the tumor suppressor protein p53. PBK binds to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of p53, which is crucial for p53's role in regulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid analysis in HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells. The binding of PBK to p53 inhibits p53's transcriptional activation of the p21 gene, a key cell-cycle inhibitor, thereby modulating p53's function (Hu2010PBKTOPK).

PBK also interacts with the human Discs large (hDlg) protein, a tumor suppressor. This interaction requires the PDZ2 domain of hDlg and is mediated by the C-terminal ETDV motif of PBK. Mutations in this motif significantly reduce PBK's binding to hDlg (Gaudet2000Characterization).

In addition, PBK has been shown to interact with guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1) in ovarian cancer, suggesting a role in signal transduction pathways related to cancer progression (Sevciunaite2015Role). These interactions highlight PBK's involvement in various cellular pathways and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
