# FNDC11

## Overview
The FNDC11 gene encodes the protein fibronectin type III domain containing 11, which is a member of the fibronectin type III domain-containing protein family. This protein is characterized by the presence of fibronectin type III domains, which are commonly involved in cell adhesion and receptor binding processes. Although the precise biological functions of FNDC11 are not fully elucidated, proteins with fibronectin type III domains are often implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and cellular communication. The expression and regulation of FNDC11 may play a role in specific signaling pathways, potentially influencing cellular behavior and development (Qiu2020aarFDC). Further research is necessary to fully understand the functional implications of FNDC11 in health and disease.
