# IDH2

## Overview
The IDH2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 2, which is a critical component of cellular metabolism. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases and is primarily involved in the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, a reaction that generates NADPH. NADPH is essential for maintaining the redox balance within mitochondria, playing a pivotal role in protecting cells from oxidative stress by regenerating reduced glutathione (Yu2012SIRT3). IDH2 is also involved in the reductive carboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate under hypoxic conditions, supporting cellular growth and viability (Wise2011Hypoxia). Mutations in the IDH2 gene have been implicated in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia and gliomas, where they contribute to oncogenesis through the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (Medeiros2016Isocitrate; Ward2010The). These mutations highlight the gene's significance as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in oncology (Yang2012IDH1andIDH2Mutations).

## Structure
The IDH2 protein is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, utilizing NADP+ as a cofactor. Structurally, IDH2 forms a homodimer, with each subunit binding an isocitrate molecule and a Mg2+ ion in the active site. The enzyme is composed of three domains: a large domain, a small domain, and a clasp domain. These domains contribute to the enzyme's ability to bind substrates and cofactors effectively (Xu2017Studies).

Key residues involved in substrate binding include Thr117, Ser134, Arg140, Arg149, Lys251, Asp291, Asp314, and Asp318. The structure of the wild-type mIDH2 was determined at a resolution of 3.3 Å, while the K256Q mutant was resolved at 2.3 Å, highlighting structural changes due to mutations (Xu2017Studies). The enzyme's structure is similar to the closed form of isocitrate-bound porcine IDH2, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.3 Å in structural alignments (Xu2017Studies).

Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, play a significant role in regulating IDH2 activity. Acetylation mimics, like lysine-to-glutamine mutations, have been shown to affect the enzyme's conformation and activity, particularly at residues Lys256 and Lys413 (Xu2017Studies).

## Function
The IDH2 gene encodes the mitochondrial enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, which plays a critical role in cellular metabolism and redox balance. IDH2 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, a reaction that produces NADPH, an essential cofactor in maintaining the redox status within mitochondria (Yu2012SIRT3). NADPH is crucial for the regeneration of reduced glutathione (GSH) from its oxidized form (GSSG), thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress (Yu2012SIRT3).

The activity of IDH2 is regulated by acetylation at lysine 413, which decreases its catalytic efficiency. This acetylation can be reversed by the deacetylase SIRT3, enhancing IDH2 activity and promoting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, especially under conditions of low glucose or caloric restriction (Yu2012SIRT3). The deacetylation of IDH2 by SIRT3 is essential for maintaining cellular resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage, as it ensures adequate NADPH production for antioxidant defenses (Yu2012SIRT3).

In hypoxic conditions, IDH2 also facilitates the reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived alpha-ketoglutarate to citrate, supporting cell growth and viability by maintaining citrate levels when glucose-dependent pathways are limited (Wise2011Hypoxia).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IDH2 gene are clinically significant in several cancers, notably acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and gliomas. In AML, IDH2 mutations are found in approximately 20% of adult patients, particularly in cytogenetically normal cases. These mutations lead to the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which results in DNA and histone hypermethylation, disrupting normal hematopoietic differentiation and contributing to leukemogenesis (Medeiros2016Isocitrate; Ward2010The). IDH2 mutations, such as R140Q and R172K, are associated with a hypermethylation phenotype and are linked to specific gene expression profiles, which may affect prognosis and treatment outcomes (Figueroa2010Leukemic; Marcucci2010IDH1).

In gliomas, IDH2 mutations are less common than IDH1 mutations but are still significant. They are associated with distinct DNA methylation profiles and are found in a small percentage of primary and secondary glioblastomas, as well as low-grade gliomas. These mutations are linked to longer overall and progression-free survival compared to IDH1/2 wild-type gliomas (Wang2016The; Yan2009IDH1andIDH2Mutations). The presence of IDH2 mutations in gliomas and AML highlights their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets (Yang2012IDH1andIDH2Mutations).

## Interactions
Isocitrate dehydrogenase type 2 (IDH2) is involved in placental steroidogenesis as part of a multiprotein complex. This complex is located in the steroidogenic contact site (SCS) of human syncytiotrophoblast mitochondria, where IDH2 interacts with proteins involved in the transformation of cholesterol into progesterone (P4) (UrbanSosa2019Isocitrate). IDH2 provides NADPH necessary for the activity of cytochrome P450scc, which converts cholesterol into pregnenolone, a precursor of P4 (UrbanSosa2019Isocitrate). The study identified 321 proteins in the SCS, with 142 shared between different preparations, indicating a robust network of interactions (UrbanSosa2019Isocitrate).

IDH2 is associated with a complex of proteins with an apparent molecular mass of ~590 kDa, suggesting it interacts with other proteins such as cytochrome P450scc, adrenodoxin reductase, and adrenodoxin, which are crucial for steroidogenesis and ATP synthesis (UrbanSosa2019Isocitrate). The presence of calcium was found to inhibit IDH2 activity, confirming its role in the complex and its regulatory interactions (UrbanSosa2019Isocitrate). These interactions highlight IDH2's role in facilitating the efficient transformation of cholesterol into P4 within the mitochondria (UrbanSosa2019Isocitrate).
