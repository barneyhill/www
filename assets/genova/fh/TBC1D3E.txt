# TBC1D3E

## Overview
TBC1D3E is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 3E, which is part of the TBC1 domain family. This family is characterized by the presence of a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain, which is typically associated with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that regulate small GTPases involved in intracellular trafficking. The TBC1D3E protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of endosomal trafficking and signal transduction pathways. Its role in these processes suggests potential involvement in cellular growth and proliferation, although the specific mechanisms and pathways remain to be fully elucidated. Understanding the function and regulation of TBC1D3E is crucial, as alterations in its expression or activity may have implications for human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
