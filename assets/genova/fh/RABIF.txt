# RABIF

## Overview
RABIF is a gene that encodes the RAB interacting factor, a protein that functions primarily as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and a RAB-stabilizing holdase chaperone. This protein is integral to intracellular vesicle trafficking, interacting with RAB GTPases to regulate vesicle movement and membrane fusion, processes essential for cellular transport mechanisms such as endocytosis and exocytosis (Feng2024RABIF). RABIF is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by influencing mitochondrial function and energy regulation. The protein's interactions with various RAB proteins, including RAB10, underscore its involvement in metabolic processes, particularly glucose uptake and mitochondrial quality control (Feng2024RABIF). In pathological contexts, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, RABIF's expression levels and interactions have significant implications for cancer progression and treatment resistance, marking it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Feng2024RABIF).

## Structure


## Function
RABIF, also known as RAB interacting factor, is a protein that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and a RAB-stabilizing holdase chaperone. It plays a crucial role in intracellular vesicle trafficking by interacting with RAB GTPases, which are essential regulators of vesicle movement and membrane fusion (Feng2024RABIF). RABIF is active in the cytoplasm and Golgi apparatus, where it ensures proper vesicle transport, contributing to processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis.

In healthy human cells, RABIF is involved in cellular energy regulation and mitochondrial function, although its specific roles in non-cancerous cells are not extensively detailed in the available literature (Feng2024RABIF). The protein's involvement in mitophagy and glucose metabolism suggests it may help maintain cellular homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial quality and energy production. RABIF's interaction with RAB10, a RAB-stabilizing chaperone, is significant for glucose uptake, indicating its role in metabolic processes (Feng2024RABIF). While the precise organismal outcomes of these processes in healthy cells are not fully elucidated, RABIF's functions in vesicle trafficking and metabolism highlight its importance in maintaining cellular and metabolic balance.

## Clinical Significance
The RABIF gene has significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Alterations in RABIF expression are associated with poor prognosis in liver cancer patients. The gene is upregulated in HCC, and its high expression correlates with worse overall and disease-free survival outcomes (Feng2024RABIF). RABIF promotes HCC progression by regulating mitophagy and glycolysis, processes crucial for cancer cell energy homeostasis and growth (Feng2024RABIF). 

RABIF's role in drug resistance is particularly notable. It contributes to sorafenib resistance, a common issue in HCC treatment. Knockout of RABIF increases the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib, suggesting that targeting RABIF could enhance therapeutic efficacy (Feng2024RABIF). Mechanistically, RABIF influences mitochondrial function and glucose metabolism, interacting with proteins like STOML2 and affecting the processing of PGAM5, which is essential for mitophagy (Feng2024RABIF). 

The gene also affects glycolysis through the RABIF-RAB10 axis, impacting glucose uptake and glycolytic gene expression, which are vital for tumor growth (Feng2024RABIF). These findings highlight RABIF as a potential therapeutic target in HCC, particularly for overcoming drug resistance and inhibiting cancer progression.

## Interactions
RABIF, also known as RAB interacting factor, is involved in various protein interactions, particularly with members of the RAB family of small GTPases. RABIF functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAB13, facilitating its activation. This interaction is crucial for RAB13's role in cell migration, with RABIF acting both as a GEF at the cell periphery and as a chaperone in the cell body (Moissoglu2020Local). RABIF also interacts with other RAB proteins, such as RAB10, RAB1B, and RAB8B, as identified through immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (Feng2024RABIF).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), RABIF interacts with mitochondrial proteins like STOML2, ATP5B, and ATP5D, suggesting a role in mitochondrial function regulation. The interaction with STOML2 is particularly significant, as it mediates the formation of a protease complex involving presenilin-associated rhomboid-like protein (PARL), which is essential for mitophagy (Feng2024RABIF). RABIF's role as a chaperone is further supported by its ability to stabilize nucleotide-free forms of Rab proteins, preventing their degradation and aggregation in the cytosol (Takahashi2019Cytoplasmic).

RABIF may also associate with nascent RAB13 protein during translation, as suggested by the presence of GFP-RAB13 RNA in RABIF immunoprecipitates, although this interaction is disrupted by puromycin treatment, indicating it is not a direct RNA binding (Moissoglu2020Local).
