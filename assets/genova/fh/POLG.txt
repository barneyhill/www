# POLG

## Overview
The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma (pol γ), a critical enzyme responsible for the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This enzyme is categorized as a DNA polymerase and is the only polymerase found in mitochondria, highlighting its essential role in maintaining mitochondrial genome integrity (Hance2005Mitochondrial; Copeland2017DNA). The POLG protein comprises a polymerase domain and an exonuclease domain, which together facilitate high-fidelity DNA synthesis and proofreading activities (Hudson2006Mitochondrial). Functioning as part of a heterotrimeric complex, POLG interacts with two accessory subunits to enhance its processivity and stability (Hudson2006Mitochondrial). Mutations in the POLG gene are associated with a range of mitochondrial disorders, underscoring its clinical significance in neurodegenerative diseases and other mitochondrial pathologies (Wong2008Molecular; Copeland2011Defects).

## Structure
The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (pol γ), which is essential for mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. The primary structure of the POLG protein includes a polymerase domain and an exonuclease domain, which are crucial for its enzymatic activities (Hudson2006Mitochondrial). The secondary structure of POLG features alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the stability and function of the enzyme. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, allowing the protein to perform its catalytic functions effectively.

In terms of quaternary structure, POLG functions as part of a heterotrimeric complex, consisting of a catalytic subunit (p140) and two identical accessory subunits (p55) (Hudson2006Mitochondrial). The interaction between the catalytic and accessory subunits is crucial for the enzyme's processivity and stability. Mutations in the linker region between the exonuclease and polymerase domains, such as the A467T mutation, can disrupt this interaction, leading to reduced catalytic efficiency and associated mitochondrial disorders (Chan2005The).

Common post-translational modifications of POLG include phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions with other proteins. The protein's structure and function are tightly regulated to ensure the fidelity of mitochondrial DNA replication and repair.

## Function
The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma (PolG), which is the sole DNA polymerase found in mitochondria. This enzyme is crucial for the replication and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in healthy human cells (Hance2005Mitochondrial; Copeland2017DNA). PolG is a heterodimeric enzyme composed of a catalytic subunit and an accessory subunit, the latter enhancing its catalytic activity and processivity (Hance2005Mitochondrial; Hudson2006Mitochondrial). The catalytic subunit possesses DNA polymerase, 3'-5' exonuclease, and 5'-deoxyribose lyase activities, which are essential for maintaining mtDNA integrity (Longley1998Identification; Copeland2011Defects).

PolG's role in mtDNA replication and repair is vital for mitochondrial function, as mitochondria are responsible for producing over 90% of cellular ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (Copeland2017DNA). The enzyme's high fidelity in nucleotide selection and incorporation is partly due to its exonuclease activity, which reduces errors during DNA replication (Hance2005Mitochondrial). In healthy cells, PolG ensures the accurate replication and repair of mtDNA, which is crucial for cellular energy production and overall organismal health (Copeland2017DNA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POLG gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma, are a significant cause of inherited mitochondrial disorders. These mutations are linked to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome (AHS), progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), and ataxia-neuropathy syndromes (ANS) (Wong2008Molecular; Copeland2011Defects). Alpers syndrome, the most common autosomal recessive disorder caused by POLG mutations, is characterized by seizures, hepatic failure, and neurological decline (Wong2008Molecular). PEO, which can be inherited in both autosomal recessive and dominant forms, involves symptoms such as bilateral ptosis, muscle weakness, and exercise intolerance (Copeland2011Defects).

The A467T mutation in the POLG gene is notably common and leads to reduced enzyme activity, affecting DNA polymerase activity and interaction with the accessory subunit (Wong2008Molecular; Rahman2018POLG-related). Other mutations, such as Y955C, are associated with severe clinical presentations, including oxidative damage and potential progression to parkinsonism or premature ovarian failure (Copeland2011Defects; Rahman2018POLG-related). POLG mutations can also result in mtDNA depletion and multiple mtDNA deletions, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes (Rahman2018POLG-related).

## Interactions
POLG, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma, is involved in several critical interactions essential for mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance. It forms a holoenzyme complex with the accessory subunit POLG2, which enhances its processivity and catalytic efficiency (Park2023Structural). POLG also interacts with the mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB), which stimulates its polymerase and exonuclease activities. This interaction is crucial for organizing DNA topology and optimizing RNA primer usage during DNA replication (Park2023Structural).

POLG is part of a larger mitochondrial replisome complex that includes the Twinkle helicase. Twinkle, although lacking primase activity, works synergistically with POLG to facilitate efficient DNA synthesis. This interaction is vital for the asymmetric replication of mitochondrial DNA (Park2023Structural). The study by Liyanage et al. identified additional protein-protein interactions involving POLG, including interactions with Ruvbl2 and Ruvbl1, which are AAA+ ATPases potentially involved in mitochondrial DNA maintenance and repair (Liyanage2017Characterizing).

These interactions underscore the importance of POLG in maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity and highlight its role in complex protein networks within the mitochondria.
