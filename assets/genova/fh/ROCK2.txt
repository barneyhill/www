# ROCK2

## Overview
ROCK2, or Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes. The protein product of ROCK2 plays a critical role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton, cell polarity, and smooth muscle contraction, among other functions. It is characterized by a complex structure that includes a kinase domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a pleckstrin homology domain, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and interactions with other proteins (Hajdú2020Ligand-induced; Truebestein2015A). ROCK2 is activated by Rho GTPases, which bind to its Rho-binding domain, enhancing its catalytic activity and facilitating its involvement in processes such as cytokinesis and gene expression regulation (Chen2018ROCK2; Schofield2013Rhoassociated). The dysregulation of ROCK2 has been implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer, neurological disorders, and vascular diseases, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Sharma2020ROCK2selective; Wong2009Rhokinase).

## Structure
ROCK2, a serine/threonine kinase, is characterized by a complex molecular structure that includes several distinct domains. The primary structure of ROCK2 consists of a kinase domain at the N-terminus, a long coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal region containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a cysteine-rich zinc-finger domain (Hajdú2020Ligand-induced; Truebestein2015A). The coiled-coil domain is approximately 107 nm in length and acts as a molecular ruler, crucial for the spatial regulation of ROCK2's activity (Truebestein2015A).

The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional 3D shape, allowing for interactions with other proteins and substrates (Truebestein2015A). ROCK2 forms a constitutive dimer, indicating a quaternary structure that is essential for its enzymatic activity (Truebestein2015A).

ROCK2 is auto-inhibited in its native form, with the C-terminal region inhibiting the kinase domain. Activation occurs through the binding of Rho proteins, which induces conformational changes that disrupt this inhibitory interaction (Hajdú2020Ligand-induced). The protein's activity is not regulated by phosphorylation, as its activation loop is fully ordered and adopts an active conformation without the need for phosphorylation (Truebestein2015A).

## Function
ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a significant role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell polarity. It is involved in various cellular processes, including contraction, motility, morphology, and gene expression. ROCK2 is particularly important for smooth muscle contraction by modulating calcium sensitivity through the suppression of myosin light chain phosphatase activity, leading to increased myosin light chain phosphorylation (Amano2010Rho‐kinaseROCK:; Loirand2015Rho).

In keratinocytes, ROCK2 promotes cell adhesion to fibronectin and inhibits terminal differentiation, highlighting its role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis (Lock2009Distinct). In the context of T cells, ROCK2 interacts with phosphorylated STAT3 and co-occupies gene promoters in TH17-activated cells, influencing gene expression and playing a role in immune responses (Chen2018ROCK2).

ROCK2 is predominantly cytosolic but can translocate to the plasma membrane and associate with actin microfilaments upon activation. It is also involved in cytokinesis and localizes at the cleavage furrow, contributing to cell division and structural integrity (Julian2014Rho-associated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ROCK2 gene have significant clinical implications across various diseases. In cancer, ROCK2 is frequently overexpressed, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis. Specific mutations, such as Thr431Asn, Asp601Val, and Lys1083Met, affect ROCK2's dimerization, RhoA binding, and kinase activation, potentially promoting cancer progression. These mutations are notably associated with breast cancer metastasis and non-small cell lung cancer (Shahbazi2020Targeting; Wei2016Novel). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ROCK2 overexpression is linked to increased tumor invasion and metastasis, with studies showing that its knockdown reduces these aggressive behaviors (Wong2009Rhokinase).

In neurological disorders, ROCK2 is implicated in Parkinson's disease, where its activity contributes to neuronal growth inhibition and inflammation, leading to dopaminergic cell degeneration. Inhibition of ROCK2 has been shown to enhance neuron regeneration and improve symptoms (Sharma2020ROCK2selective). In Alzheimer's disease, ROCK2 is involved in amyloid-beta production and tau protein regulation, with its inhibition reducing amyloid-beta levels and promoting autophagy, which may have therapeutic potential (Sharma2020ROCK2selective).

ROCK2 also plays a role in vascular disorders, where its overactivity is associated with hypertension and atherosclerosis. Polymorphisms in ROCK2 can lead to increased arterial stiffening, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for vascular diseases (Sharma2020ROCK2selective).

## Interactions
ROCK2, a serine/threonine kinase, engages in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It specifically interacts with phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) in TH17-activated human T cells, forming a complex with JAK2 and STAT3, which is crucial for optimal STAT3 phosphorylation. This interaction occurs in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where ROCK2 and STAT3 co-occupy TH17/TFH gene promoters (Chen2018ROCK2). The selective ROCK2 inhibitor KD025 can down-regulate this activity, reducing STAT3 phosphorylation (Chen2018ROCK2).

ROCK2 also interacts with p300, a chromatin acetylation regulator, in the nucleus, which is involved in transcription regulation (Chen2018ROCK2). In the context of centrosome duplication, ROCK2's homolog, ROCK II, interacts with nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM/B23), a multifunctional protein involved in centrosome duplication. This interaction is enhanced when NPM/B23 is phosphorylated on Thr 199, leading to increased ROCK II activity and promoting centrosome duplication (Ma2006Interaction).

ROCK2's activity is also modulated by its interaction with Rho GTPases, such as RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC, which bind to its Rho-binding domain, enhancing its catalytic activity (Schofield2013Rhoassociated). These interactions highlight ROCK2's role in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and transcriptional processes.
