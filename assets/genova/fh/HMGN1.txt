# HMGN1

## Overview
HMGN1 is a gene that encodes the high mobility group nucleosome binding domain 1 protein, a non-histone chromosomal protein involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. The HMGN1 protein is characterized by its ability to bind specifically to nucleosomes, thereby influencing chromatin dynamics and accessibility. This protein plays a pivotal role in various DNA-dependent processes, including transcription, replication, and repair, by modulating nucleosome organization and enhancing DNA accessibility (Bustin2001Chromatin; Murphy2017HMGN1). HMGN1 is particularly active in the nucleus, where it interacts with chromatin to facilitate gene expression and maintain genomic stability. Its involvement in cellular processes extends to roles in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and stress responses, making it a significant factor in both normal cellular function and disease states, such as cancer and Down syndrome (Mowery2018Trisomy; Cuddapah2011Genomic).

## Structure
HMGN1 is a non-histone chromosomal protein that specifically binds to nucleosomes, influencing chromatin structure and function. The protein contains a conserved nucleosome-binding domain (NBD) enriched in positively charged residues, which includes the invariant core sequence RRSARLSA. This domain anchors HMGN1 to the nucleosome by interacting with the H2A/H2B acidic patch on the histone protein surface (Murphy2017HMGN1). The N-terminal portion of HMGN1 interacts with DNA near the dyad axis, contributing to its role in chromatin remodeling (Murphy2017HMGN1).

HMGN1 also features a less conserved regulatory domain enriched in negatively charged residues, which promotes DNA-dependent processes such as transcription, DNA replication, and repair (Murphy2017HMGN1). The protein's interaction with nucleosomes affects the phosphorylation of serine 1 in histone H2A, modulating chromatin accessibility and influencing post-translational modifications (Postnikov2006Chromosomal).

HMGN1 can form a ternary complex with histone H1 and nucleosomes, altering the nucleosome-dependent condensation of the H1 C-terminal domain, which affects chromatin compaction (Murphy2017HMGN1). The protein's interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) further highlights its role in chromatin dynamics and cellular processes (Postnikov2012The). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of HMGN1 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
HMGN1 is a chromatin-binding protein that plays a crucial role in modulating chromatin structure and function in healthy human cells. It binds specifically to nucleosome cores, influencing nucleosome organization and enhancing DNA accessibility, which facilitates transcription and replication processes (Bustin2001Chromatin). HMGN1 is enriched at active promoters and regulatory regions, such as CTCF and YY1 binding sites, where it stabilizes nucleosome positioning and maintains open chromatin structures conducive to gene expression (Cuddapah2011Genomic).

HMGN1 also plays a significant role in DNA repair, particularly in response to UV-induced damage. It reduces chromatin compaction, thereby enhancing the accessibility of damaged sites to the nucleotide excision repair machinery, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability (Birger2003Chromosomal). In embryonic stem cells, HMGN1 stabilizes nucleosome positioning at transcription start sites with CpG islands, maintaining DNase I hypersensitivity and facilitating chromatin remodeling (Deng2013HMGN1).

Overall, HMGN1 is involved in regulating gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility, impacting cellular differentiation, proliferation, and stress responses. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it interacts dynamically with chromatin to modulate its structure and function (Bustin2001Chromatin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HMGN1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In Down syndrome, individuals have an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to overexpression of HMGN1. This overexpression is linked to transcriptional amplification and changes in histone modifications, contributing to the increased risk of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in these individuals (Mowery2018Trisomy; Lane2014Triplication). HMGN1 overexpression in Down syndrome models results in global H3K27 hyperacetylation, which enriches cell-type-specific transcriptional programs, particularly in B cells (Mowery2018Trisomy).

In cancer, HMGN1 is implicated in various types, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In breast cancer, high cytoplasmic expression of HMGN1 is associated with increased lymphocyte infiltration around tumors (Nanduri2020Biological). In NSCLC, elevated serum levels of HMGN1 correlate with overall survival, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Nanduri2020Biological). HMGN1 is also identified as a potential chemotherapeutic target for lung adenocarcinoma due to its significant upregulation in cancerous tissues and involvement in DNA damage response pathways (Wu2023HMGN1).

The absence of HMGN1 in mouse models leads to increased tumorigenicity and sensitivity to ionizing radiation, indicating its role in protecting against radiation-induced cancer (Birger2005Increased).

## Interactions
HMGN1 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in chromatin dynamics and gene regulation. It enhances the binding of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to chromatin, which is crucial for DNA replication and repair. This interaction is facilitated by specific tetrapeptides in HMGN1, and the absence of these sequences abolishes the interaction. HMGN1 does not enhance PCNA binding to purified DNA, indicating a specific role in chromatin context (Postnikov2012The).

HMGN1 also interacts with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), particularly at the TFF1 promoter, suggesting a role in estrogen-mediated transcriptional activation. This interaction is mediated through the nucleosome-binding domain of HMGN1, and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirm the interaction in vivo (Zhu2007HMGN1).

During mitosis, HMGN1 undergoes phosphorylation, which inhibits its nuclear import and promotes interaction with 14.3.3 proteins. This interaction is specific to the phosphorylated form of HMGN1 and prevents its binding to nucleosomes, affecting its subcellular localization and function during cell division (PrymakowskaBosak2002Mitotic).
