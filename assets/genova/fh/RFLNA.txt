# RFLNA

## Overview
The RFLNA gene encodes the protein refilin A, which is integral to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in human cells. Refilin A is categorized as a cytoskeletal protein due to its role in modulating the structural organization of actin filaments. It interacts with filamin proteins, facilitating the transition from actin branching to bundling, which is essential for forming various actin structures, including perinuclear actin caps and basal stress fibers (Baudier2018The). This protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular processes such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and chondroprogenitor differentiation, impacting cell shape and transcriptional responses (Baudier2018The). Refilin A's interactions with filamin are crucial for maintaining cellular structural integrity and motility, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and pathological conditions (Baudier2018The).

## Function
The RFLNA gene encodes refilin A, a protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in healthy human cells. Refilin A interacts with filamin proteins, which are crucial for the structural organization of the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction modulates the actin-bundling properties of filamin, transforming it from a protein that mediates actin branching to one that facilitates actin bundling, which is essential for the formation of actin structures such as perinuclear actin caps and basal stress fibers (Baudier2018The).

Refilin A is involved in the spatiotemporal regulation of the actin-cytoskeleton, influencing various cellular processes, including the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chondroprogenitor differentiation. These processes are critical for cell fate determination and cytoskeletal dynamics, impacting cell shape changes and transcriptional responses to TGF-β signaling (Baudier2018The). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to cellular structural integrity and motility by maintaining cell shape and facilitating cellular interactions through its binding to actin filaments (Baudier2018The). The interaction between refilin A and filamin is reversible, allowing for dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton, which are crucial for proper skeletal development and mechanosensory functions (Baudier2018The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RFLNA (refilin A) gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. A study identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in RFLNA in a patient with spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome (SCT), a rare skeletal disorder. This mutation, [c.241delC, p.(Leu81Cysfs*111)], suggests that RFLNA is a causative gene for SCT, expanding the understanding of its genetic basis beyond the traditionally associated FLNB and MYH3 genes (Shimizu2019Identification).

In the context of cancer, RFLNA has been identified as a tumor oncogene in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Its up-regulation is associated with increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while reducing apoptosis, thereby promoting LUAD development and metastasis. This suggests that RFLNA could serve as a novel biomarker for LUAD, aiding in diagnosis and prognosis prediction (Shao2022Screening).

Additionally, RFLNA overexpression has been linked to cancer survival disparities in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), particularly in certain genetic ancestry groups. This overexpression is associated with an increased risk of cancer metastasis, highlighting its potential role in tumorigenesis (Lee2022Association).

## Interactions
Refilin A (RFLNA) is a protein that interacts with filamin proteins, playing a significant role in the regulation of the actin-cytoskeleton. RFLNA contains a conserved N-terminal domain that functions as a dimerization interface and a C-terminal domain with filamin-binding sites. These interactions are crucial for the stabilization of refilins, as they are rapidly degraded in the absence of filamin. The binding of refilin dimers to filamin can lock filamin into an open conformation, exposing cryptic F-actin-binding domains necessary for actin bundling (Baudier2018The).

Refilin A interacts with filamin by binding to specific domains on the filamin protein, particularly IgFLNA19-22, through its filamin-binding domains BD2 and BD4. This interaction enhances filamin's affinity for F-actin filaments, promoting filament stability and growth. The N-terminal domain of refilins also contains degradation signals, while the C-terminus harbors the filamin-binding domain (Baudier2018The).

The refilin-filamin axis is involved in the spatiotemporal regulation of the actin-cytoskeleton during cellular transitions, such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chondroprogenitor differentiation. This complex is associated with forming a perinuclear actin network, which is linked to nuclear shape changes and cell junction dissolution (Baudier2018The).
