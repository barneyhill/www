# IFT57

## Overview
IFT57 is a gene that encodes the intraflagellar transport 57 protein, a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically within the IFT-B complex. This protein is characterized by its coiled-coil domains and an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, which facilitate interactions with other IFT proteins, such as IFT38 and IFT80, contributing to the assembly and stability of the IFT-B2 subcomplex (Lacey2023The; Taschner2016Intraflagellar). The IFT57 protein plays a vital role in the bidirectional movement of protein complexes along microtubules within cilia, structures essential for cell signaling and movement (Krock2008The; Thevenon2016Autosomal). Mutations in the IFT57 gene have been linked to ciliopathies, such as oral–facial–digital syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in human health (Thevenon2016Autosomal).

## Structure
IFT57 is a protein involved in the intraflagellar transport system, specifically as part of the IFT-B complex. It is characterized by the presence of coiled-coil domains, which facilitate its interaction with other proteins within the complex. The protein contains an N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other IFT proteins, such as IFT38 and IFT80 (Lacey2023The; Taschner2016Intraflagellar). The CH domain of IFT57 forms a high-affinity interaction with the N-terminal WD40 repeat domain of IFT80, anchoring IFT57/38 in the IFT-B2 subcomplex (Lacey2023The).

IFT57 forms a heterodimer with IFT38 through coiled-coil interactions, contributing to the stability and function of the IFT-B2 complex (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). This dimerization is essential for the assembly and integrity of the IFT-B complex, as it mediates contacts between the IFT-B1 and IFT-B2 subcomplexes (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). The coiled-coil regions of IFT57/38 extend to interact with IFT88, forming an open cleft that accommodates other components of the IFT-B complex (Lacey2023The).

While specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of IFT57 are not extensively detailed, its domain organization and interactions within the IFT-B complex are well-documented (Lacey2023The; Taschner2016Intraflagellar).

## Function
IFT57 is a protein involved in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, which is essential for the proper functioning of cilia in human cells. Cilia are hair-like structures on the cell surface that play critical roles in cell signaling and movement. IFT57 is necessary for the assembly and maintenance of cilia, facilitating the bidirectional movement of protein complexes along microtubules within the ciliary axoneme and basal body (Krock2008The; Thevenon2016Autosomal).

In healthy cells, IFT57 is distributed throughout the primary cilium, indicating its role in intraflagellar transport. It is crucial for the proper assembly and function of cilia, as evidenced by its interaction with other IFT proteins, such as IFT20 and kinesin II, which are involved in the transport of vesicular cargo through the connecting cilium (Krock2008The; Thevenon2016Autosomal). IFT57 mediates the dissociation of kinesin II from the IFT particle, a process important for efficient IFT, and is necessary for ciliary elongation and the long-term maintenance of photoreceptor survival (Krock2008The).

The protein's role in ciliary transport is vital for maintaining normal cellular functions, particularly in the context of ciliopathies, where defects in ciliary transport can lead to various disorders (Thevenon2016Autosomal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IFT57 gene are associated with ciliary transport defects, contributing to a form of oral–facial–digital syndrome (OFDS) characterized by short stature and brachymesophalangia. This condition is linked to an autosomal recessive hypomorphic mutation in IFT57, which results in a partial splicing defect and reduced levels of IFT57 mRNA. The mutation leads to altered distribution of the IFT57 protein within cilia, specifically decreased staining at the ciliary tip and increased staining at the basal body, affecting intraflagellar transport (Thevenon2016Autosomal).

In a study involving a consanguineous family, a homozygous synonymous variation (c.777G>A, p.Lys259Lys) in IFT57 was identified, which affects splicing and leads to exon skipping. This mutation impacts RNA secondary structure and may influence the inclusion of adjacent exons, contributing to the clinical features of OFDS (Thevenon2016Autosomal). The research highlights the genetic heterogeneity of ciliopathies and suggests that IFT57 mutations are implicated in human pathology, specifically in a form of OFDS (Thevenon2016Autosomal). Despite the identification of this mutation, no additional causative mutations in IFT57 were found in a replication cohort of subjects with OFDS and Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (Thevenon2016Autosomal).

## Interactions
IFT57 is a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, specifically part of the IFT-B2 subcomplex. It forms a heterodimer with IFT38, which is crucial for the solubility and stability of IFT38, as IFT38 is otherwise insoluble when over-expressed alone (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). The IFT57/38 complex interacts with other proteins such as IFT172, IFT80, IFT54, and IFT20, forming a stable, high-molecular-weight subcomplex within the IFT-B2 complex (Taschner2016Intraflagellar).

IFT57 also plays a role in mediating interactions between the IFT-B1 and IFT-B2 subcomplexes. It binds directly to the IFT88/52 module of IFT-B1, which is essential for the formation of the complete IFT-B complex (Taschner2016Intraflagellar). In vertebrate photoreceptors, IFT57 is involved in the interaction between IFT20 and the IFT particle, facilitating the dissociation of kinesin II from the IFT particle, which is crucial for effective transport and maintenance of photoreceptor outer segments (Krock2008The). These interactions highlight the critical role of IFT57 in the assembly and function of the IFT complex.
