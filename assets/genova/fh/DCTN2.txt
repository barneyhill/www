# DCTN2

## Overview
DCTN2 is a gene that encodes the protein dynactin subunit 2, also known as dynamitin, which is a critical component of the dynactin complex. This complex is essential for intracellular transport processes, particularly those involving the motor protein dynein. Dynactin subunit 2 is characterized by its α-helical coiled-coil structure, which facilitates its interactions with other subunits within the dynactin complex, such as p150 Glued and p24/22, and contributes to the structural integrity and function of the complex (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). The protein plays a significant role in cellular activities, including mitosis, endocytosis, and autophagy, by mediating the movement of membrane vesicles along microtubules (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). Additionally, DCTN2 is involved in maintaining cell polarity and organizing signaling molecules at centrosomes and spindle poles, which are crucial for cell cycle progression and cytoplasmic organization (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). Mutations and dysregulation of DCTN2 have been implicated in various diseases, including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its clinical significance (Braathen2015Variants; Ullah2022A).

## Structure
The DCTN2 gene encodes the dynamitin protein, a subunit of the dynactin complex. Dynamitin is characterized by an α-helical coiled-coil structure, which contributes to its elongated form and facilitates its role in the dynactin complex (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). The protein self-associates into tetramers and interacts with other subunits such as p150 Glued and p24/22 through coiled-coil motifs, which are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the dynactin complex (Schroer2004DYNACTIN).

The N terminus of dynamitin is highly conserved and can bind to proteins like Zw10, calmodulin, and MacMARCKS, indicating its exposure on the dynactin surface. This region is also involved in alternative splicing, resulting in two isoforms of the protein (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). The C-terminal half of dynamitin is likely involved in interactions with other dynactin subunits, including p150 Glued, p24/22, and Arp1 rod subunits (Schroer2004DYNACTIN).

Dynamitin's structure and interactions are essential for its role in the dynactin complex, which is involved in dynein-mediated intracellular transport and cellular processes such as spindle formation during cell division (Li2021Binding).

## Function
DCTN2, also known as dynactin subunit 2, is a critical component of the dynactin complex, which plays a vital role in intracellular transport processes. In healthy human cells, DCTN2 is involved in the structural organization of the dynactin complex, contributing to its function as a multifunctional adapter protein that facilitates interactions between microtubules, motor proteins, and other cellular components (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). 

DCTN2 is essential for the movement of membrane vesicles along microtubules, a process crucial for cellular activities such as mitosis, endocytosis, and autophagy (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). It is part of the projecting arm of the dynactin complex, interacting with other subunits like p150 Glued and p24/22, which are important for microtubule binding and processivity (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). 

DCTN2 also plays a role in maintaining cell polarity and organizing signaling molecules at centrosomes and spindle poles, which is crucial for cell cycle progression and cytoplasmic organization (Schroer2004DYNACTIN). Its interactions with proteins such as Lis1 and NudE/Nudel are important for tethering cellular structures to microtubule ends, facilitating large-scale cellular movements (Schroer2004DYNACTIN).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DCTN2 gene have been implicated in various diseases. In Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a specific variant of DCTN2, c.337C>T, was identified in a Norwegian family. This variant segregated with the disease phenotype, suggesting a potential pathogenic role. The study noted that this variant was absent in control groups and major genetic databases, indicating its novelty and possible significance in CMT (Braathen2015Variants).

In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), DCTN2 is overexpressed and hypomethylated, correlating with poor progression-free survival. This aberrant expression pattern suggests that DCTN2 may play an oncogenic role in LIHC, contributing to poor clinical outcomes (Ullah2022A). The gene's overexpression is associated with advancing cancer stages and tumor grades, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Ullah2022A).

DCTN2 is also involved in centrosome amplification, particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes and cancer. The interaction between DCTN2 and ROCK1 is crucial for centrosome amplification, a feature linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis in cancer cells (Li2021Binding).

## Interactions
DCTN2, also known as dynactin subunit 2, is a component of the dynactin complex, which plays a crucial role in intracellular transport along microtubules. It interacts with the cytoskeletal motor protein dynein, facilitating microtubule-dependent transport processes. This interaction is essential for maintaining proper cellular transport and preventing protein aggregation, as evidenced by studies showing that knockdown of DCTN2 exacerbates TDP-43-mediated toxicity in Drosophila models of ALS/FTD (Ueda2024Dysregulation).

DCTN2 is also involved in the interaction with other components of the dynactin complex, such as DCTN1, and is part of the projecting side arm of the complex, which includes p150 Glued (DCTN1) and p22/24 (DCTN3) (Tey2016Mutation). In the context of centrosome amplification, DCTN2 interacts with ROCK1, a kinase involved in various cellular processes. This interaction is significant in the context of diabetes-associated centrosome amplification in colon cancer cells, where high glucose, insulin, and palmitic acid treatments increase the binding between DCTN2 and ROCK1 (Li2021Binding). The disruption of the ROCK1-DCTN2 complex through knockdown of either protein inhibits centrosome amplification, highlighting the importance of this interaction in cellular homeostasis (Li2021Binding).
