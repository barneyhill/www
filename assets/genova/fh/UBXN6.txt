# UBXN6

## Overview
UBXN6 is a gene that encodes the UBX domain protein 6, a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly those related to protein degradation and quality control. The protein is characterized by the presence of a UBX domain, which facilitates its interaction with the AAA-ATPase p97/VCP, a key player in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Rezvani2016UBXD; Schuberth2008UBX). UBX domain protein 6 is part of the UBXD1 subfamily and contains additional structural motifs, such as a PUB domain and an extended UBX (eUBX) domain, which enable it to participate in complex protein-protein interactions (Blueggel2023The). Functionally, UBXN6 is implicated in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, mitophagy, and autophagic processes, underscoring its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control (Guo2023Role; Mojumder2019Functional; Mengus2021VCPp97).

## Structure
UBXN6, also known as UBX domain protein 6, is characterized by the presence of a UBX domain, which is a structural motif of about 80 amino acids. This domain is a close structural homologue of ubiquitin but does not attach to proteins in a ubiquitin-like manner (Schuberth2008UBX). The UBX domain enables UBXN6 to bind to the AAA-ATPase p97/VCP protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, including the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway (Rezvani2016UBXD). UBXN6 is part of the UBXD1 subfamily, which is characterized by a high degree of sequence conservation and possesses a central PUB domain in addition to the carboxy-terminal UBX domain (Schuberth2008UBX).

The UBX domain in UBXN6 is involved in protein-protein interactions, specifically binding to the p97 protein at a hydrophobic pocket between the N and D1 domains (Schuberth2008UBX). UBXN6 also contains an extended UBX (eUBX) domain, which has ubiquitin-binding activity and is involved in receiving unfolded ubiquitinated substrates after they exit the p97 channel (Blueggel2023The). The protein's structure allows it to interact with both the N and C-terminal domains of p97, mediated by a VCP/p97-interacting motif (VIM) in the N-terminus and the PUB domain binding to the p97 C-terminus (Blueggel2023The).

## Function
UBXN6, also known as UBX domain protein 6, is involved in several cellular processes, primarily focusing on protein degradation and quality control. It interacts with the ATPase p97/VCP, playing a crucial role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis by eliminating misfolded proteins (Guo2023Role; Rezvani2016UBXD). UBXN6 is active in the cytoplasm and contributes to the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the extraction and degradation of misfolded proteins (Raman2015Systematic).

In the context of mitophagy, UBXN6 has been shown to compensate for the loss of UBXN1, another VCP cofactor, by restoring PRKN (Parkin) translocation to mitochondria, which is crucial for the initiation of mitophagy (Mengus2021VCPp97). This suggests that UBXN6 may have a redundant or compensatory role in mitochondrial quality control processes. Additionally, UBXN6 is implicated in lysosomal degradation and may participate in the clearance of cellular materials under conditions such as starvation, indicating its involvement in autophagic processes (Mojumder2019Functional). These functions highlight UBXN6's role in maintaining cellular stability and protein quality control.

## Interactions
UBXN6, also known as UBX domain protein 6, is involved in various protein-protein interactions within cellular processes. It is a part of the VCP-UBXD adaptor network, where it associates with multiple UBXD proteins, including FAF2 and ASPSCR1, suggesting a complex VCP-adaptor module (Raman2015Systematic). UBXN6 interacts with the N domain and the C-terminal portion of CDC-48, a protein involved in protein quality control and degradation, through a bipartite binding mechanism facilitated by its N and PUB domains (Mojumder2019Functional). This interaction is crucial for processes such as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), autophagy, and endosome-lysosome trafficking (Mojumder2019Functional).

In the context of viral inhibition, UBXN6 has been shown to significantly inhibit the production of lentiviral vectors, such as HIV, when co-transfected with these vectors, indicating its role in reducing viral titers (Hu2017Multiple). However, unlike other UBXN family members, UBXN6 does not inhibit NFκB activity by blocking IκBα degradation (Hu2017Multiple). These interactions highlight UBXN6's involvement in maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular stress responses.
