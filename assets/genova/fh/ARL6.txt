# ARL6

## Overview
The ARL6 gene encodes the protein ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6, a member of the ARF family of small GTPases, which are involved in intracellular trafficking processes. This protein plays a pivotal role in ciliary function and signaling pathways, particularly in the context of the BBSome complex, which is crucial for ciliary membrane trafficking and function. ARL6 is localized at the basal body of cilia and is essential for the recruitment of the BBSome to cilia, facilitating the transition between vesicular and intraciliary trafficking. Mutations in the ARL6 gene are linked to Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 3 (BBS3), a disorder characterized by a range of symptoms including obesity, retinal degeneration, and renal abnormalities, due to its impact on ciliary structure and function (Wiens2010BardetBiedl; Fan2004Mutations). The protein's structure, characterized by a central six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices, is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental biological role (Mourão2014Structural; Hemsworth2013Crystal).

## Structure
The ARL6 protein, also known as ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6, is a member of the ARF family of small GTPases. It adopts a classical small GTPase fold, characterized by a central six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices (Mourão2014Structural; Hemsworth2013Crystal). The protein includes defined switch I, switch II, and interswitch regions, which are crucial for its function in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (Hemsworth2013Crystal).

ARL6 interacts with the BBS1 component of the BBSome complex through specific regions, including helix α3, switch 2, and the loop preceding helix α1, while BBS1 adopts a seven-bladed WD40-like β-propeller fold (Mourão2014Structural). This interaction is essential for the recruitment of the BBSome to cilia, a key function of ARL6 (Mourão2014Structural).

The protein's structure is highly conserved across species, as demonstrated by the ability to form a chimeric complex between human and Chlamydomonas proteins (Mourão2014Structural). ARL6 may undergo post-translational modifications such as N-myristoylation, which aids in membrane interaction (Hemsworth2013Crystal). Specific mutations in ARL6 can disrupt its interaction with BBS1, affecting its role in ciliary trafficking (Mourão2014Structural).

## Function
The ARL6 gene, also known as BBS3, encodes a small GTPase that plays a crucial role in ciliary function and signaling pathways in human cells. ARL6 is localized at the basal body of cilia, specifically at the distal end near the transition fibers, which are part of the ciliary gate. This localization suggests its involvement in cilium formation and ciliary membrane trafficking, independent of the microtubule network (Wiens2010BardetBiedl). ARL6 is implicated in the transition between vesicular and intraciliary trafficking, potentially facilitating the movement of ciliary cargo and modulating cilium disassembly and length control (Wiens2010BardetBiedl).

ARL6 also plays a role in Wnt signaling, where its overexpression leads to an augmented response to canonical Wnt signals, possibly due to increased ciliary disassembly. This suggests that ARL6 may assist in the trafficking of ciliary membrane components, influencing the balance between canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling (Wiens2010BardetBiedl). The protein's function is crucial for maintaining ciliary structure and function, as mutations in ARL6 can lead to ciliary anomalies and are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Wiens2010BardetBiedl; Fan2004Mutations).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ARL6 gene are associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 3 (BBS3), a multisystemic disorder characterized by symptoms such as obesity, retinal degeneration, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, and cognitive impairment (Khan2013Novel; Fan2004Mutations). The ARL6 gene encodes a protein that is part of the RAS superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, which are involved in intracellular trafficking processes (Fan2004Mutations). Mutations in ARL6 can disrupt its GTP-binding ability, leading to ciliary dysfunction, which is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Li2012The; Kobayashi2009Biochemical).

Specific mutations, such as T31R, T31M, G169A, and L170W, have been shown to affect the stability and function of the ARL6 protein, resulting in its degradation by the proteasome (Kobayashi2009Biochemical). These mutations lead to a loss of function in the ARL6 protein, contributing to the clinical manifestations of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Kobayashi2009Biochemical). The ARL6 gene is also involved in the BBSome complex, which is essential for sorting membrane proteins to cilia, and its dysfunction can impair ciliary transport and signaling pathways, such as the Shh signaling pathway (Li2012The).

## Interactions
ARL6, also known as ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 6, is involved in several critical protein interactions, particularly with the BBSome complex, a group of proteins associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. In its GTP-bound form, ARL6 interacts with the BBS1 subunit of the BBSome, binding specifically to the β-propeller structure at blades 1 and 7. This interaction is essential for recruiting the BBSome to membranes, facilitating its import into cilia, which is crucial for ciliary function (Mourão2014Structural).

Mutations at the ARL6-GTP-BBS1 interface can disrupt this interaction, preventing BBSome recruitment to cilia and leading to associated pathologies (Mourão2014Structural). The interaction between ARL6 and BBS1 is conserved across species, as demonstrated by binding affinity studies (Mourão2014Structural).

ARL6 also interacts with liposomes, where its GTP-bound form is necessary and sufficient to recruit the BBSome. This recruitment is dependent on specific lipid compositions, particularly those containing negatively charged phospholipids like PI(3,4)P2, which enhance BBSome binding (Jin2010The). These interactions highlight ARL6's role in ciliary membrane trafficking and its importance in maintaining proper ciliary function.
