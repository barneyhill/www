# MDM1

## Overview
MDM1 is a gene that encodes the Mdm1 nuclear protein, which is a microtubule-binding protein involved in the regulation of centriole duplication and interorganelle communication. The Mdm1 protein plays a critical role in maintaining proper centriole number, essential for accurate cell division and genomic stability, by acting as a negative regulator of centriole duplication (Van2015MDM1). Additionally, Mdm1 functions as an ER-anchored transmembrane protein, facilitating interactions between the endoplasmic reticulum and vacuole/lysosome membrane contact sites, which are important for lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Henne2015Mdm1Snx13). Mutations in the MDM1 gene have been linked to diseases such as retinal degeneration and hereditary breast cancer, underscoring its significance in human health (Son2022Mdm1; Glentis2019Exome).

## Function
MDM1 is a microtubule-binding protein that plays a crucial role in regulating centriole duplication in human cells. It localizes to centrioles and associates with microtubules, particularly those with unique structural modifications, and is involved in maintaining proper centriole number, which is essential for cell division and preventing conditions such as aneuploidy (Van2015MDM1). MDM1 acts as a negative regulator of centriole duplication, potentially through its interaction with microtubules. Overexpression of MDM1 suppresses centriole duplication, while its depletion leads to the formation of immature centriole-like structures, indicating its role in ensuring proper cell cycle progression and centrosome integrity (Van2015MDM1).

MDM1 is expressed in multiple tissues, including breast tissue, and is evolutionarily conserved. It is predicted to be intolerant to homozygous or double heterozygous loss-of-function variants, highlighting its essential role in cellular function (Glentis2019Exome). The protein's binding to microtubules is essential for its function, and it is recruited to procentrioles near the onset of mitosis, serving as a signal for the completion of centriole duplication (Van2015MDM1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MDM1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly retinal degeneration and hereditary breast cancer. In the context of retinal degeneration, MDM1 is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of photoreceptor cells. Deficiency or mutations in MDM1, such as those observed in Mdm1 -/- mice, lead to specific intraflagellar transport defects, resulting in progressive retinal degeneration characterized by the loss of outer segments, inner segments, and the outer nuclear layer of the retina (Son2022Mdm1). A nonsense mutation in the MDM1 gene has been associated with age-related retinal degeneration in a mouse model, highlighting its role in retinal health (Chang2008Agerelated).

In hereditary breast cancer, MDM1 has been identified as a candidate risk gene. Loss-of-function variants in MDM1, such as MDM1:p.G394* and MDM1:p.R32fs, have been found in patients with a strong family history of breast cancer, suggesting a potential role in cancer susceptibility (Glentis2019Exome). These findings indicate that MDM1 mutations can contribute to the development of hereditary breast cancer, particularly in families without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.

## Interactions
MDM1 is a microtubule-binding protein that interacts with microtubules to negatively regulate centriole duplication. It binds directly to microtubules, stabilizing them and preventing centriole duplication when overexpressed. This interaction is crucial for its role as a negative regulator of centriole duplication, as demonstrated by experiments showing that MDM1 stabilizes microtubules even under conditions that typically lead to their depolymerization (Van2015MDM1).

MDM1 contains a conserved repeat motif necessary for efficient microtubule binding, which is also found in another microtubule-binding protein, CCSAP. Mutations in these motifs reduce MDM1's ability to colocalize with microtubules, highlighting their importance for binding activity (Van2015MDM1).

In addition to its role in microtubule interactions, MDM1 is involved in interorganelle tethering, particularly between the endoplasmic reticulum and vacuole/lysosome membrane contact sites. It functions as an ER-anchored transmembrane protein, interacting with the vacuole via its C-terminal Phox homology domain. This interaction is crucial for its role in lipid metabolism and interorganelle communication (Henne2015Mdm1Snx13).
