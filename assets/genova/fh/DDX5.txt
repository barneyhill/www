# DDX5

## Overview
DDX5 is a gene that encodes the protein DEAD-box helicase 5, a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases. This family is characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif, which is crucial for ATP-dependent RNA unwinding activities. DEAD-box helicase 5 is involved in various cellular processes, including RNA metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and genomic stability maintenance. It plays a significant role in resolving RNA:DNA hybrids, known as R-loops, and is implicated in pre-mRNA splicing, microRNA processing, and ribosomal RNA processing. The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and methylation, which influence its interactions and functional roles. DDX5 is also associated with cancer progression, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Li2023Role; Linder2011From; Mersaoui2019Arginine).

## Structure
DDX5, also known as DEAD-box helicase 5, is a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases, characterized by the conserved Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD) motif. The protein contains a helicase core with ATP and RNA binding sites, which are crucial for its function in RNA metabolism processes such as splicing and transcriptional regulation (Linder2011From). The helicase core consists of two recombinase A (RecA)-like domains, which form a cleft for ATP binding and hydrolysis, and RNA binding occurs on the opposite side of this cleft (Linder2011From).

DDX5 has a mammalian/avian-specific carboxy-terminal extension (CTE) that enhances its RNA unwinding activity, distinguishing it from its yeast ortholog, Dbp2 (Xing2017Characterization). This CTE is not present in simpler organisms like S. cerevisiae or C. elegans, indicating its evolutionary addition after the divergence of these lineages (Xing2017Characterization).

Post-translational modifications play a significant role in regulating DDX5's activity. Notably, phosphorylation of DDX5 on Tyr593 by c-Abl kinase is associated with cancer cell proliferation (Gustafson2010DEADbox). SUMO modification on Lys53, mediated by PIAS1, modulates its transcriptional activity and interaction with HDAC1 (Gustafson2010DEADbox).

## Function
The human gene DDX5 encodes DEAD-box helicase 5, a protein involved in various molecular processes essential for maintaining cellular function and genomic stability. DDX5 plays a critical role in resolving RNA:DNA hybrids known as R-loops, which can cause genomic instability if not properly managed. It facilitates the degradation of R-loops in an ATP-dependent manner, working in conjunction with the XRN2 exoribonuclease. This activity is crucial for preventing DNA double-strand breaks and ensuring proper transcriptional termination by aiding the release of RNA polymerase II at transcription termination regions (Mersaoui2019Arginine).

DDX5 is also involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism, including pre-mRNA splicing, alternative splicing, microRNA processing, and ribosomal RNA processing. It acts as a transcriptional cofactor, binding to several transcription factors to modulate transcription. DDX5 promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis, indicating a role in cellular metabolism (Xing2017Characterization).

The protein is active in the nucleus, where it unwinds RNA secondary structures, facilitating RNA processing and modification. Its activity is regulated by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which methylates DDX5 at its RGG/RG motif, a modification necessary for its interaction with XRN2 and effective R-loop resolution (Mersaoui2019Arginine).

## Clinical Significance
DDX5 (DEAD-box helicase 5) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in RNA processing and regulation. Alterations in DDX5 expression are associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression in several cancers, including breast, prostate, endometrial, gastric, esophageal, colorectal, glioma, lung adenocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer (Xu2022DDX5). In prostate cancer, particularly castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), DDX5 is significantly upregulated and correlates with increasing tumor grade, suggesting an oncogenic role (Li2023Role). 

DDX5 also plays a role in immune cell infiltration in tumors, with its expression positively correlating with the infiltration of CD8+ T cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and B cells in specific cancers (Liu2022Pancancer). Genetic alterations in DDX5, such as missense mutations and splice site mutations, are observed in various tumors and are associated with worse prognosis in terms of overall survival, disease-specific survival, and progression-free survival in cancers like sarcoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Liu2022Pancancer).

In colorectal cancer, DDX5 stabilizes PHGDH mRNA, promoting nucleotide metabolism and tumorigenesis, which is linked to poor prognosis (Li2023Role). These findings highlight DDX5 as a potential target for cancer therapy due to its involvement in cancer progression and immune suppression (Li2023Role).

## Interactions
DDX5, also known as DEAD-box helicase 5, is involved in numerous interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with the HIV-1 Tat protein and the cellular protein HEXIM1, enhancing Tat-dependent transcription. DDX5 does not interact with the P-TEFb components Cyclin T1 and CDK9, indicating specificity in its interactions (Sithole2020DDX5). In the context of spermatogonia, DDX5 interacts with proteins such as ELAVL1, PABP1, and SRSF3, which are involved in RNA stability and splicing, highlighting its role in RNA processing (Legrand2019DDX5).

DDX5 also interacts with METTL3, a component of the m6A writer complex, during viral infections, affecting RNA methylation and innate immunity. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer, which is enhanced during viral infections (Xu2021The). In the context of Sindbis virus infection, DDX5 interacts with the viral capsid protein and relocates to the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in the viral life cycle (Messmer2024DEAD). Additionally, DDX5 binds to U8 snoRNA, promoting RNA structure rearrangement within the 60S pre-ribosomal subunit, essential for ribosome biogenesis (Xu2022DDX5).
