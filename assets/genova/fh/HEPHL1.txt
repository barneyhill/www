# HEPHL1

## Overview
The HEPHL1 gene encodes the protein hephaestin like 1, also known as zyklopen, which is a member of the multicopper oxidase family. This protein is primarily involved in iron metabolism, facilitating the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+), a critical process for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. Hephaestin like 1 is characterized by its copper-binding sites, which are essential for its enzymatic activity, and it is predicted to be anchored to the plasma membrane. The protein is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, where it plays a significant role in hair follicle morphogenesis and the maintenance of normal hair structure. Mutations in the HEPHL1 gene can lead to hair abnormalities and are associated with conditions such as trichorrhexis nodosa and pili torti. Additionally, HEPHL1 influences the activity of other copper-dependent enzymes, suggesting its broader role in physiological processes involving cuproenzymes (Surbek2023Iron; Sharma2019Biallelic).

## Structure
The HEPHL1 protein is a multi-copper oxidase with a structure that includes copper-binding sites essential for its function. It contains at least one of each of three types of copper-binding sites: type I, type II, and binuclear type III. The type I copper site is crucial for electron acceptance, while the trinuclear cluster, comprising a type II and a binuclear type III site, reduces dioxygen to water (Sharma2019Biallelic). HEPHL1 shares structural similarities with ceruloplasmin, another multi-copper oxidase, which has three type I copper sites and a trinuclear cluster (Sharma2019Biallelic).

HEPHL1 is predicted to anchor to the plasma membrane due to a putative transmembrane region at the C-terminus (Sharma2019Biallelic). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including copper-dependent glycosylation, which is necessary for its maturation into a catalytically active holoenzyme (Sharma2019Biallelic). Mutations affecting these copper-binding sites, such as the maternal deletion of exon 5, lead to a loss of ferroxidase activity by disrupting copper binding and potentially affecting the overall protein structure (Sharma2019Biallelic). The precise function of glycosylated versus non-glycosylated forms of HEPHL1 remains to be fully elucidated (Sharma2019Biallelic).

## Function
The HEPHL1 gene encodes a protein known as Hephaestin like 1, or zyklopen, which is a member of the multicopper oxidase family. This protein plays a crucial role in iron metabolism by facilitating the oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+), a process essential for maintaining iron homeostasis in cells (Sharma2019Biallelic). HEPHL1 is involved in copper-dependent processes, including glycosylation and ferroxidase activity, which are important for its enzymatic function (Sharma2019Biallelic).

HEPHL1 is expressed in various tissues, including the placenta, mammary tissue, hair follicles, esophagus, skin, thyroid, and testis (Surbek2023Iron; Sharma2019Biallelic). In the skin, it is particularly active in the suprabasal layers and is a component of mature hair shafts, indicating its role in hair structure and development (Surbek2023Iron). The protein's activity is crucial for hair follicle morphogenesis and maintaining normal hair structure, as mutations in HEPHL1 can lead to hair abnormalities such as sparse, twisted, and brittle hair (Sharma2019Biallelic).

HEPHL1 also influences the activity of other copper-dependent enzymes, such as lysyl oxidase, which is involved in the cross-linking of collagen and elastin in connective tissues (Sharma2019Biallelic). This suggests a broader role for HEPHL1 in maintaining connective tissue integrity and possibly other physiological processes involving cuproenzymes (Sharma2019Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HEPHL1 gene are associated with a range of clinical conditions, primarily affecting hair and potentially other physiological systems. Biallelic variants in HEPHL1 impair its ferroxidase activity, leading to abnormal hair phenotypes such as sparse, twisted, brittle, and easily broken hair, as well as similar abnormalities in eyebrows and eyelashes. These hair conditions include trichorrhexis nodosa and pili torti, characterized by broken, nodular shafts and twisted, flattened hair shafts, respectively (Sharma2019Biallelic). Pili torti is linked to various neurological disorders and ectodermal dysplasias, including Björnstad syndrome, Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome, and Menkes disease (Sharma2019Biallelic).

In a clinical case, a child with compound heterozygous mutations in HEPHL1 presented with abnormal hair conditions and cognitive dysfunction. These mutations led to a loss of ferroxidase activity, resulting in intracellular iron accumulation and reduced lysyl oxidase activity, a copper-dependent enzyme (Sharma2019Biallelic). In Belted Galloway cattle, a nonsense variant in HEPHL1 causes congenital hypotrichosis, characterized by reduced hair growth, suggesting a similar role in hair development across species (Kuca2021A). These findings highlight the gene's importance in hair growth and its potential involvement in other copper-dependent processes.
