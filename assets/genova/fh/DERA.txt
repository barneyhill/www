# DERA

## Overview
The DERA gene encodes the enzyme deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase, a key player in cellular metabolism and stress response. This enzyme is categorized as an aldolase and is unique in its ability to catalyze reactions using an aldehyde as the natural donor, facilitating sequential aldol reactions. Deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase is involved in the glycolytic pathway, where it catalyzes the reversible reaction between acetaldehyde and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to produce 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate. This function is particularly crucial in human lung and liver tissues, where the enzyme helps mitigate stress-induced damage and supports cell survival under low-glucose conditions by enabling the utilization of deoxy nucleotides as an energy source. The enzyme's activity is also implicated in cancer biology, influencing cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis, thereby underscoring its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Gu2020Genetic; Haridas20182Deoxydribose5phosphate).

## Function
The DERA gene encodes the enzyme deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase, which plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and stress response in human cells. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible aldol reaction between acetaldehyde and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) to produce 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (DR5P) (Haridas20182Deoxydribose5phosphate). DERA is unique among aldolases as it uses an aldehyde rather than a ketone as the natural donor, allowing it to catalyze sequential aldol reactions (Haridas20182Deoxydribose5phosphate).

In human cells, DERA is most expressed in lung and liver tissues, where it contributes to the stress response by delaying or minimizing stress-induced damage (Haridas20182Deoxydribose5phosphate). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the survival of cells under low-glucose conditions, as it allows cells to utilize deoxy nucleotides as an energy source (Gu2020Genetic). Through its role in the glycolytic pathway, DERA affects cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis by converting thymidine-derived 2-deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate into intermediate metabolites necessary for cell survival (Gu2020Genetic). This function highlights DERA's importance in both normal cellular processes and pathological conditions.

## Clinical Significance
The DERA gene, encoding deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase, plays a significant role in cancer biology, particularly in melanoma. Genetic variants in DERA, such as the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12297652, have been identified as significant predictors of cutaneous melanoma-specific survival (CMSS). The presence of the G allele in this SNP is associated with an increased risk of CMSS, suggesting that alterations in DERA expression or function may impact melanoma progression and patient outcomes (Gu2020Genetic).

DERA's involvement in the glycolytic pathway allows cancer cells to utilize thymidine-derived metabolites for survival under low-glucose conditions. This metabolic adaptation can influence cancer cell growth, invasion, and metastasis. Inhibition of thymidine phosphorylase activity, which is related to DERA function, has been shown to suppress tumor growth by increasing apoptotic cells and potentially inhibiting angiogenesis in certain cancer types (Gu2020Genetic).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of DERA in cancer, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress, and suggest that genetic variants in DERA could serve as biomarkers for predicting melanoma survival outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the potential of targeting DERA in cancer therapy (Gu2020Genetic).
