# MORN1

## Overview
MORN1 is a gene that encodes the MORN repeat containing 1 protein, which is characterized by the presence of multiple MORN (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus) repeats. This protein is primarily known for its role as a scaffolding protein in the assembly and function of the basal complex in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The MORN1 protein is involved in critical protein-protein interactions that facilitate cell division by recruiting and localizing various components within the basal complex. It forms antiparallel dimers and can adopt different quaternary structures, which are influenced by factors such as zinc ions and post-translational modifications (Sajko2019Structures). MORN1's interactions with other proteins, including actinomyosin motility components and HAD phosphatases, underscore its essential role in organizing protein complexes necessary for cytokinesis and cell division (Lorestani2010A; Engelberg2016A).

## Structure
The MORN1 protein is characterized by multiple MORN (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus) repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions rather than lipid binding (Sajko2019Structures). The protein is composed of 15 consecutive 23-amino acid MORN repeats, forming an elongated and twisted β-sheet structure (Sajko2019Structures). Each MORN repeat consists of a β-hairpin followed by a loop, with conserved motifs such as GxG and YEGEW that stabilize the structure through hydrogen bonds and aromatic stacking interactions (Sajko2019Structures).

The MORN1 protein forms antiparallel dimers, with dimerization occurring via the C-terminal regions to create tail-to-tail dimers. These dimers can adopt extended or V-shaped quaternary structures, with the specific conformation influenced by the presence of zinc ions in some species (Sajko2019Structures). The dimer interface is stabilized by hydrophobic and aromatic π-stacking interactions, as well as hydrogen bonds and, in some cases, disulfide bridges (Sajko2019Structures).

Post-translational modifications, such as palmitoylation at a cysteine residue, may influence the protein's localization and function, although this is not confirmed for all species (Lorestani2010A). The protein's structure and interactions suggest a role in forming supramolecular assemblies (Sajko2019Structures).

## Interactions
MORN1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the assembly and function of the basal complex in Toxoplasma gondii, interacting with various proteins to facilitate cell division. It acts as a scaffolding protein essential for the recruitment and localization of other components within the basal complex, such as Centrin2, TgDLC, and intermediate filament-like proteins including IMC5, IMC8, IMC9, and IMC13 (Lorestani2010A; Engelberg2022Proteomic). MORN1 is also involved in interactions with actinomyosin motility components, including actin, ELC1, MyoA, and profilin family proteins, although the specificity of these interactions remains unclear (Lorestani2012Targeted).

The protein is part of the BCSC-1 complex, which is critical for maintaining the integrity of the basal complex during cell division. Its degradation leads to the loss of ring integrity in daughter cells (Engelberg2022Proteomic). MORN1 interacts with HAD phosphatases, such as HAD2a, which co-localizes with MORN1 and is essential for the assembly and contraction of the basal complex (Engelberg2016A). These interactions highlight MORN1's role in organizing protein complexes crucial for cytokinesis and cell division.
