# ROBO1

## Overview
ROBO1 is a gene that encodes the roundabout guidance receptor 1, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This receptor plays a pivotal role in axon guidance, neuronal development, and cell migration by mediating the Slit-Robo signaling pathway. The protein is characterized by its extracellular region, which includes immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domains essential for binding to Slit proteins, and an intracellular region with conserved cytoplasmic motifs that facilitate downstream signaling. ROBO1's interactions with various proteins, such as SLIT2 and Arl4A, are crucial for its function in modulating cellular responses, including cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal repulsion. Alterations in the ROBO1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, including myelodysplastic syndromes, cholangiocarcinoma, congenital heart disease, and certain cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Morlot2007Structural; Xu2015Wholeexome; Blockus2016SlitRobo; Andrews2006Robo1).

## Structure
ROBO1 is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It features an extracellular region composed of five immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and three fibronectin type III domains. The Ig domains are crucial for its function, with the first two Ig domains (Ig1 and Ig2) forming a canonical β-sandwich fold and being essential for binding to Slit proteins, particularly Slit2 (Morlot2007Structural). The Ig1 domain is the primary binding site for Slit2, involving specific residues such as Glu-72, Thr-86, and Asn-88 (Morlot2007Structural).

The intracellular region of ROBO1 contains conserved cytoplasmic motifs (CC motifs) that are involved in downstream signaling pathways. These motifs interact with various proteins to mediate cellular responses, such as cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal repulsion (Bisiak2019Structure).

ROBO1 can undergo post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is confirmed by the presence of specific glycoforms in the hRobo1-loop construct (Williams2022NMR). The protein can also form oligomeric assemblies, such as tetramers, which are important for its signaling function (Williams2022NMR). The structural flexibility and domain orientation of ROBO1 are influenced by interactions with heparan sulfate, which can rigidify the structure and affect its signaling capabilities (Williams2022NMR).

## Function
ROBO1 is a transmembrane receptor involved in several critical biological processes, including axon guidance, cell migration, and neuronal development. It plays a significant role in the Slit-Robo signaling pathway, which is crucial for axon pathfinding and neuronal migration in the forebrain. ROBO1 interacts with Slit ligands to regulate axon branching and commissural axon pathfinding, ensuring proper neural circuit formation (Blockus2016SlitRobo; Andrews2006Robo1).

In the context of cell migration, ROBO1 modulates the activity of Rho GTPases, such as Cdc42, which are essential for cell motility and actin reorganization. The interaction between ROBO1 and ADP-ribosylation factor-like 4A (Arl4A) enhances cell migration by promoting Cdc42 activation, while the binding of Slit2 to ROBO1 inhibits this process by increasing the association with srGAP1, a Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein (Chiang2019ADPribosylation).

ROBO1 is also involved in the migration and positioning of neurons in the developing neocortex, affecting both tangential and radial migration. It regulates the movement of interneurons independently of Slit signaling and influences the radial migration of projection neurons by modulating N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion (Gonda2020Beyond).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ROBO1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), mutations in ROBO1 impair the ROBO-SLIT2 signaling pathway, leading to an imbalance in cell growth and apoptosis, which may drive disease progression and increase the risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Xu2015Wholeexome). Low ROBO1 expression is linked to shorter overall survival in MDS patients, indicating its potential prognostic significance (Xu2015Wholeexome).

In cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), the ROBO1 E280* mutation disrupts the interaction with SLIT2, leading to a loss of tumor-suppressive effects, increased cell proliferation, and angiogenesis (Zhou2022ROBO1). ROBO1 is also implicated in congenital heart disease, such as tetralogy of Fallot and septal defects, where loss of function variants affect cardiac development (Kruszka2017Loss).

In prostate cancer, particularly among African American patients, low ROBO1 expression and promoter methylation are associated with aggressive cancer subtypes and poor outcomes (Ferrari2020Identifying). ROBO1 mutations are also linked to pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS), affecting axon pathfinding and potentially leading to ocular anomalies (Bashamboo2017Mutations).

## Interactions
ROBO1, a transmembrane receptor, interacts with several proteins that influence its role in cell migration and axon guidance. One key interaction is with the extracellular matrix protein SLIT2, which binds to ROBO1 and modulates its interactions with other proteins. This binding reduces the association between ROBO1 and Arl4A while increasing its association with srGAP1, leading to the downregulation of Cdc42 activation and cell motility (Morlot2007Structural; Chiang2019ADPribosylation).

ROBO1 also interacts with Arl4A, a protein that promotes cell migration by activating Cdc42. The interaction between Arl4A and ROBO1 is crucial for Cdc42 activation, as it decreases the association of ROBO1 with srGAP1, a Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein, thereby enhancing cell migration (Chiang2019ADPribosylation).

In the context of cancer, ROBO1 interacts with SLIT2 to inhibit tumor cell metastasis. This interaction is part of the SLIT-ROBO pathway, which is involved in modulating chemokine activation and cellular migration, critical processes in cancer progression (Sengupta2020Structural). The interaction between ROBO1 and SLIT2 is stabilized by heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which enhance the stability of the complex (Morlot2007Structural).
