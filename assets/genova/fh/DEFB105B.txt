# DEFB105B

## Overview
DEFB105B is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 105B, a member of the beta-defensin family, which is characterized by small, cationic peptides with antimicrobial properties. These peptides are integral to the innate immune system, primarily functioning in epithelial cells to protect against microbial pathogens by disrupting their membranes. The DEFB105B gene is located on chromosome 8p23.1, a region known for its complex genomic architecture, including segmental duplications and copy number variations. These genetic features contribute to the diversity in immune responses and disease susceptibility among individuals. The protein defensin beta 105B plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and inflammatory processes, underscoring its importance in maintaining homeostasis and defending against infections (Forni2015Determining; Taudien2004Polymorphic; Hollox2008Directional).

## Function
DEFB105B encodes a member of the beta-defensin family, which are small cationic peptides involved in the innate immune response. These peptides are primarily active in epithelial cells and play a crucial role in defending against pathogens by disrupting microbial membranes. The beta-defensins, including DEFB105B, are known for their antimicrobial properties, which are essential for maintaining homeostasis in healthy human tissues (Forni2015Determining).

The DEFB105B gene is located within a complex genomic region on chromosome 8p23.1, which is characterized by segmental duplications and copy number variations. This region includes several beta-defensin genes that are involved in antimicrobial response, signaling, and fertility (Forni2015Determining). The DEFB105B protein is part of a larger cluster of beta-defensin genes that exhibit significant copy number variation, which may contribute to individual differences in immunological response and disease susceptibility (Hollox2008Directional).

In terms of molecular function, DEFB105B, like other beta-defensins, is involved in modulating immune responses and inflammatory processes. These activities are crucial for the organism's defense against bacterial and viral infections, highlighting the importance of DEFB105B in the innate immune system (Taudien2004Polymorphic).

## Clinical Significance
DEFB105B, part of the beta-defensin gene cluster, is implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in immune function. Alterations in the expression or copy number of DEFB105B and related defensin genes can influence susceptibility to diseases. For instance, high copy numbers of beta-defensin genes, including DEFB105B, are associated with increased susceptibility to psoriasis, an inflammatory skin condition (de2008Human). Conversely, low copy numbers of related defensin genes have been linked to colonic Crohn's disease, highlighting the dual role of copy number variations in disease susceptibility (de2008Human).

In the context of cancer, the defensin gene cluster, including DEFB105B, is frequently deleted in various cancer types, which may contribute to immune evasion by tumor cells (Ye2017Prevailing). This deletion is part of a broader pattern of homozygous deletions in the 8p21-23 locus, which is associated with worse survival outcomes in certain cancers (Ye2017Prevailing).

The structural variation and copy number variability of the DEFB105B region also pose challenges in understanding its precise role in disease, as these variations can affect gene function and expression (Hollox2008Defensins). Further research is needed to elucidate the specific clinical implications of these genetic variations.
