# ZNF222

## Overview
ZNF222 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 222, a member of the Krüppel-type (C2H2) zinc finger transcription factor family. This protein functions primarily as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, and is active in the nucleus where it modulates the transcription of target genes. ZNF222 is located on chromosome 19q13.3 and is part of a larger family of zinc finger proteins that are enriched in regulatory elements, suggesting a significant role in gene expression regulation. Additionally, ZNF222 has been associated with epigenetic changes, indicating its potential involvement in epigenetic regulation and its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Ashouri2021Characterization; Wolf2007Unmasking; Sadikovic2007DNA).

## Function
ZNF222, a member of the zinc finger protein family, functions primarily as a transcription factor in healthy human cells. It is involved in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, influencing various cellular processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. ZNF222 is active in the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of target genes critical for maintaining normal cellular functions (Ashouri2021Characterization; Wolf2007Unmasking).

The protein is part of the clustered ZNF gene family on chromosome 19q13.3, which encodes Krüppel-type (C2H2) zinc finger transcription factor proteins. These proteins are functionally important and are enriched in regulatory elements like CTCF-binding sites, super-enhancers, and promoters, suggesting a significant role in gene expression regulation (Ashouri2021Characterization).

In addition to its role in transcriptional regulation, ZNF222 has been associated with epigenetic changes. It has been identified as an enriched and presumably hypermethylated region in studies analyzing DNA methylation changes, indicating its potential involvement in epigenetic regulation (Sadikovic2007DNA). These molecular activities underscore the importance of ZNF222 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease when dysregulated.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF222 has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In breast cancer, an insertion associated with decreased expression of ZNF222 has been linked to breast cancer risk, suggesting a potential clinical significance of ZNF222 gene mutations in relation to this disease (Ashouri2021Characterization). Additionally, ZNF222 was identified as one of the most selected genes in breast cancer datasets, indicating its biological association with the disease (LuqueBaena2014Application). 

In the context of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), ZNF222 is listed as one of the top five biological ALL risk genes, highlighting its potential role in the disease's genetic risk profile (Zazuli2022Identification). 

For intracranial berry aneurysms (IBA), variants in ZNF222 have been noted to have a slightly increased minor allele frequency among sporadic IBA cases compared to the general Japanese population, although further evidence is needed to confirm its clinical significance (Hitchcock2016A). 

These findings suggest that ZNF222 may play a role in the pathogenesis of various conditions, although further research is needed to establish definitive causal relationships.

## Interactions
ZNF222 is a zinc finger protein that is part of the clustered ZNF gene family on chromosome 19q13.3, which encodes Krüppel-type (C2H2) zinc finger transcription factor proteins. These proteins are functionally important and are involved in regulating gene expression (Ashouri2021Characterization). ZNF222 overlaps with CpG islands in gene promoters, indicating potential changes in methylation status, which can affect its interaction with DNA and influence gene expression (Sadikovic2007DNA).

The evolutionary analysis of zinc-finger transcription factor genes, including ZNF222, suggests that these proteins have undergone significant divergence and conservation, which may impact their interaction capabilities. The study highlights the challenges in resolving ancient relationships due to the divergence of finger repeats within the conserved C2H2 structure, which is crucial for DNA binding (Shannon2003Differential).

ZNF222 is also part of a larger family of KRAB-ZNF proteins, which are transcriptional regulators. These proteins often form complexes with other proteins and nucleic acids, modulating transcriptional activity. The differential expansion of these gene families has contributed to species-specific biological functions, suggesting that ZNF222 may participate in complex regulatory networks (Shannon2003Differential). However, specific protein interactions for ZNF222 are not detailed in the available context.
