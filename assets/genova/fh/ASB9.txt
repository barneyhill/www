# ASB9

## Overview
The ASB9 gene encodes the ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 9 protein, which is a crucial component of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domain and SOCS box, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and the assembly of the E3 ligase complex, respectively. ASB9 plays a significant role in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, particularly targeting creatine kinase B and mitochondrial creatine kinase, thereby influencing cellular energy metabolism and protein homeostasis. Predominantly expressed in the kidney and testes, ASB9 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell-cycle control and signal transduction, and has been implicated in conditions such as male infertility and colorectal cancer (Mori2010Clinical; Debrincat2007Ankyrin; Lumpkin2020Structure).

## Structure
The ASB9 protein is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domain and SOCS box, which are integral to its function as part of the Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The ankyrin repeat domain consists of seven tandem repeats, including six consensus repeats and a C-terminal capping repeat. Each consensus ankyrin repeat is a 33-residue motif that forms a helix-loop-helix-βhairpin structure, providing a stable platform for protein-protein interactions (Muniz2013Molecular; Fei2008Crystallization). The SOCS box, a conserved three-helix motif, facilitates interactions with Elongin B and C, and is crucial for the assembly of the E3 ligase complex (Muniz2013Molecular; Lumpkin2020Structure).

The ASB9 protein forms a complex with Elongin B and C, adopting an elongated structure with dimensions of 110 Å × 45 Å × 40 Å (Muniz2013Molecular). The quaternary structure of ASB9 involves its interaction with Elongin B/C and Cul5, forming a ternary complex that is essential for its function in ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (Thomas2013Multimeric). The ankyrin domain's binding groove on its concave inner face is supported as the substrate-binding site, interacting with substrates like creatine kinase B (Balasubramaniam2015How; Debrincat2007Ankyrin). The ASB9 protein does not have specific post-translational modifications or splice variant isoforms mentioned in the context (Balasubramaniam2015How).

## Function
ASB9 (ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 9) is a protein that functions as part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a crucial role in the regulation of protein degradation pathways in cells. It specifically targets creatine kinase B (CKB) and mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK) for degradation, which is essential for maintaining cellular energy metabolism. The interaction between ASB9 and CKB is mediated by the ankyrin repeat region, while the SOCS box is necessary for the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CKB (Debrincat2007Ankyrin; Lumpkin2020Structure).

ASB9 forms a complex with Cullin-5 and Elongins B and C, facilitating the polyubiquitylation of its target proteins, marking them for degradation by the proteasome. This process is vital for controlling cellular protein levels and is involved in various cellular processes such as cell-cycle control and signal transduction (Thomas2013Multimeric). ASB9 is predominantly expressed in the kidney and testes, and its activity is primarily cytoplasmic (Thomas2013Multimeric).

In addition to its role in energy metabolism, ASB9 has been implicated in regulating cell proliferation and mitochondrial function, as its expression correlates with reduced creatine kinase activity and delayed cell growth (Kwon2010ASB9).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ASB9 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), overexpression of ASB9 leads to increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, suggesting its role in regulating cell survival and growth. This is particularly significant in the context of male infertility, as ASB9 deficiency is associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a severe condition characterized by impaired spermatogenesis. Patients with spermatogenesis disorders, especially those with spermatogonia and spermatocyte maturation arrest, exhibit decreased ASB9 levels, indicating that changes in ASB9 expression or its interactions may contribute to male infertility (Li2023Ubiquitin).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ASB9 expression levels have prognostic implications. High ASB9 mRNA expression correlates with a good prognosis and is considered a significant prognostic factor for overall survival. Conversely, low ASB9 expression is associated with increased invasiveness and poorer prognosis, potentially due to its role in reducing endogenous creatine kinase B (CKB) levels, which are overexpressed in various tumors (Mori2010Clinical). These findings suggest that ASB9 could serve as a novel prognostic marker for CRC, aiding in predicting patient outcomes and guiding treatment strategies (Mori2010Clinical).

## Interactions
ASB9 interacts with several proteins, primarily through its ankyrin repeat domains and SOCS box domain. It has been shown to interact with creatine kinase B (CKB) and ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (uMtCK) in a SOCS box-independent manner. This interaction is facilitated by the ankyrin repeat domains, with the first ankyrin repeat being essential for binding to uMtCK (Kwon2010ASB9). ASB9 also mediates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of CKB through its SOCS box, which acts as an adaptor for an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involving elongin B, elongin C, and Cullin 5 (Kwon2010ASB9; Schiffer2016Model).

In addition to its interactions with creatine kinases, ASB9 has been identified to interact with tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6 (TNFAIP6) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIF1A) in granulosa cells. These interactions were confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and ProLabel enzyme complementation assays, indicating a significant physical interaction (Benoit2019Gonadotropin). The interaction with TNFAIP6 may play a role in extracellular matrix remodeling during ovulation, while the interaction with HIF1A suggests a regulatory role in the cellular response to hypoxia (Benoit2019Gonadotropin).
