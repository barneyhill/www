# GLT1D1

## Overview
GLT1D1 is a gene that encodes the protein glycosyltransferase 1 domain containing 1, which plays a pivotal role in the N-linked glycosylation pathway in mammalian cells. This protein is categorized as a glycosyltransferase, a type of enzyme responsible for transferring glycosyl groups to proteins, thereby forming glycosidic bonds. The glycosylation process facilitated by GLT1D1 is essential for the proper folding, stability, and function of glycoproteins, impacting cellular communication and immune responses. The protein is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the synthesis of glycoproteins, including the glycosylation of PD-L1, a protein involved in immune regulation. The gene's involvement in various cellular processes and its association with diseases such as asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain cancers underscore its clinical significance (Joo2018Genetic; Liu2020Overexpression; Dahlin2015Genomewide; Krzeminski2016Integrative).

## Structure


## Function
GLT1D1 encodes a protein that functions as a glycosyltransferase, specifically involved in the N-linked glycosylation pathway in mammalian cells. This pathway is crucial for the assembly of a 14-saccharide core unit, which is processed in the endoplasmic reticulum and transferred to nascent polypeptide chains. The GLT1D1 protein facilitates the transfer of glycosyl groups such as galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and sialic acid to proteins by forming glycosidic bonds. This glycosylation is essential for maintaining protein stability and function (Liu2020Overexpression).

In healthy human cells, GLT1D1 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the synthesis of glycoproteins. This process impacts cellular communication and immune response by ensuring proper protein folding and stability. Although the specific function of GLT1D1 in healthy cells is not extensively detailed, its role in glycosylation suggests it is integral to various cellular processes, including cell signaling and immune function (Liu2020Overexpression). The protein itself is not N-glycosylated but plays a critical role in facilitating the transfer of N-glycans to other proteins, such as PD-L1, which is important for immune regulation (Liu2020Overexpression).

## Clinical Significance
The GLT1D1 gene has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in glycosylation. In asthma, genetic variations in GLT1D1, specifically the SNP rs517020, have been associated with reduced responses to leukotriene modifiers such as zileuton and montelukast, suggesting that these variations may influence the effectiveness of asthma treatments (Dahlin2015Genomewide). 

In the context of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the SNP rs7300146 in GLT1D1 has shown a significant association with childhood-onset SLE in a Korean cohort, indicating a potential role in the susceptibility to this autoimmune condition (Joo2018Genetic).

GLT1D1 has also been linked to multiple myeloma, where changes in DNA methylation and expression levels of the gene were observed at relapse, suggesting its involvement in the progression of this cancer (Krzeminski2016Integrative). Additionally, the gene has been associated with xerostomia in oropharyngeal cancer survivors, with the SNP rs4760542 linked to higher odds of experiencing this condition (Aggarwal2022Genetic). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GLT1D1 in various diseases, emphasizing the need for further research to fully understand its role.

## Interactions
GLT1D1 is involved in the glycosylation of the programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a critical interaction that affects PD-L1's stability and function in immune evasion. This glycosylation process is essential for the stabilization of PD-L1, which in turn enhances its immunosuppressive capabilities by facilitating its interaction with the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on T cells. This interaction leads to reduced T-cell activity, contributing to immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (Liu2020Overexpression).

GLT1D1 transfers N-linked glycans to the asparagine residues of PD-L1, a modification that is crucial for PD-L1's stability and immunosuppressive function. Experimental evidence shows that inhibiting this glycosylation process results in decreased stability of PD-L1, highlighting the importance of GLT1D1 in maintaining PD-L1's functional state (Liu2020Overexpression).

The overexpression of GLT1D1 is associated with poor prognosis in certain subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), due to its role in promoting immune escape through PD-L1 glycosylation (Liu2020Overexpression).
