# PPIF

## Overview
The PPIF gene encodes the mitochondrial matrix protein peptidylprolyl isomerase F, commonly known as Cyclophilin D (CypD), which is a member of the cyclophilin family of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. This protein plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial function by regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a critical component in cell death pathways and mitochondrial homeostasis. CypD's enzymatic activity facilitates protein folding and chaperone functions within the mitochondria, impacting processes such as ATP production and cellular stress responses. The protein's function is modulated by various post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation, which influence its interaction with other mitochondrial proteins and its role in cellular health and disease (Kumutima2022Posttranslational; Elrod2013Physiologic; Porter2018Cyclophilin).

## Structure
Cyclophilin D (CypD), encoded by the PPIF gene, is a mitochondrial matrix protein with a primary structure consisting of 207 amino acids. Upon mitochondrial import, a 29-residue mitochondrial targeting sequence is cleaved, resulting in a mature protein of 178 residues (Coluccino2023Cyclophilin). The secondary structure of CypD includes 8 antiparallel β-strands and 2 α-helices, forming a globular protein (GutiérrezAguilar2015Structural; Coluccino2023Cyclophilin). 

The tertiary structure of CypD is characterized by a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes a conserved patch of amino acids forming the cyclosporin A-binding domain (CsABD), with two main pockets, S1 and S2, contributing to substrate selectivity (GutiérrezAguilar2015Structural). The S1 pocket accommodates the proline of the substrate, while the S2 pocket is less specific (Coluccino2023Cyclophilin).

Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation significantly influence CypD's function. Phosphorylation at serine 191 and acetylation at lysine 167 are notable modifications that affect its catalytic activity and conformational dynamics (Kumutima2022Posttranslational; GutiérrezAguilar2015Structural). These modifications play a role in regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (Kumutima2022Posttranslational).

## Function
The PPIF gene encodes Cyclophilin D (CypD), a mitochondrial matrix protein that plays a significant role in regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), which is crucial for mitochondrial function and cell death pathways. CypD acts as a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, facilitating protein folding and chaperone functions within the mitochondria (Elrod2013Physiologic; Porter2018Cyclophilin). It is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial coupling, which is essential for ATP production and cellular health (Porter2018Cyclophilin).

CypD modulates the MPTP by sensitizing it to calcium and other factors, influencing processes like mitophagy and cellular necrosis (Porter2018Cyclophilin). It interacts with various mitochondrial proteins, including ATP synthase, adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), and phosphate carrier (PiC), to regulate the MPTP, although these proteins do not form the pore themselves (Porter2018Cyclophilin). CypD's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and oxidation, which affect its role in mitochondrial dynamics and cellular stress responses (Porter2018Cyclophilin; Bernardi2015The).

In healthy cells, CypD helps maintain mitochondrial integrity and regulates cell death processes, contributing to overall cellular homeostasis (Elrod2013Physiologic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the PPIF gene, which encodes the mitochondrial matrix protein cyclophilin D (CypD), have been implicated in several diseases, particularly those involving mitochondrial dysfunction. In schizophrenia, elevated levels of CypD have been observed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of affected individuals. This increase is associated with reduced expression of parvalbumin in interneurons, despite no change in the total number of parvalbumin-positive cells, suggesting a link between CypD-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathology of schizophrenia (O’Brien2023The). The elevated CypD levels are thought to contribute to oxidative stress and redox dysregulation, which may impair inhibitory neurotransmission and neuronal synchrony, leading to cognitive deficits characteristic of the disorder (O’Brien2023The).

Research in mouse models has shown that deletion of CypD can prevent parvalbumin interneuron dysfunction and cognitive deficits induced by NMDA receptor hypofunction, a condition relevant to schizophrenia. This suggests that targeting CypD could be a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating cognitive deficits associated with the disorder (Phensy2020Deletion). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPIF gene alterations in the context of psychiatric disorders.

## Interactions
Cyclophilin D (PPIF) is a mitochondrial matrix protein that plays a crucial role in regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). It interacts with several proteins, influencing cell death pathways. One significant interaction is with the tumor suppressor protein p53. PPIF binds to p53, particularly at the CsA-binding site, which is crucial for the formation of the mPTP during oxidative stress, leading to cell death. This interaction is implicated in various diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cerebral ischemia (Fayaz2015Modelling).

PPIF also interacts with the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of p53, where it catalyzes the isomerization of proline residues, particularly Pro151. This isomerization affects the conformational dynamics of p53, potentially leading to its aggregation, a process associated with tumorigenesis (Kumutima2021p53).

Additionally, PPIF is known to interact with adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which are components of the mPTP complex. These interactions influence apoptosis and necrosis, highlighting PPIF's role in cell death regulation (Davis2010Structural).
