# YJU2

## Overview
YJU2 is a gene that encodes the YJU2 splicing factor homolog, a protein integral to the spliceosome's function during pre-mRNA splicing. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor and is involved in the first catalytic step of splicing, following the action of the Prp2 protein. The YJU2 splicing factor homolog interacts with various components of the spliceosome, including the NineTeen Complex (NTC) and U2 snRNA, facilitating structural rearrangements necessary for splicing. These interactions are crucial for the recruitment and positioning of other splicing factors, such as Cwc25, thereby playing a pivotal role in the modulation of the spliceosome's catalytic core (Chiang2013A).

## Interactions
YJU2 is a splicing factor involved in the first catalytic step of splicing, functioning after the action of Prp2. It interacts with several components of the spliceosome, including the NineTeen Complex (NTC) components Ntc90 and Ntc77. The N-terminal domain of YJU2 (Yju2-N) interacts weakly with Ntc90, while the C-terminal domain (Yju2-C) interacts strongly with Ntc77 (Chiang2013A). These interactions are crucial for the recruitment of YJU2 to the spliceosome, where it plays a role in the structural rearrangement necessary for splicing (Chang2009Ntc90).

YJU2 also interacts with U2 snRNA, particularly in the helix II region, which suggests a role in positioning the branch point during the first catalytic reaction (Chiang2013A). This interaction is observed in both precatalytic and postcatalytic spliceosomes, indicating YJU2's involvement in modulating the conformation of U2 snRNA (Chiang2013A). The presence of YJU2 is essential for the recruitment of Cwc25, another splicing factor, which binds to the spliceosome only after Prp2's action (Chiang2013A). These interactions highlight YJU2's critical role in orchestrating the catalytic core of the spliceosome.
