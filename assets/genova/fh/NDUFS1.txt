# NDUFS1

## Overview
The NDUFS1 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1, a critical component of mitochondrial complex I, which is the largest enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This protein plays a pivotal role in the electron transport chain by facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, a process essential for ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. The NDUFS1 protein is characterized by its iron-sulfur clusters, which are integral to its function in electron transfer and energy production. As a core subunit, it is involved in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function, and its interactions with other proteins within complex I are crucial for the stability and efficiency of the electron transport chain. Mutations in the NDUFS1 gene can lead to mitochondrial dysfunctions and are associated with various mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism and energy homeostasis (Hoefs2010Novel; Ni2019Mutations; Iuso2006Dysfunctions).

## Structure
The NDUFS1 gene encodes a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase. This subunit is crucial for the electron transfer process within complex I, as it accommodates three iron-sulfur clusters in the N-module, which are essential for binding and oxidizing NADH (Ni2019Mutations). The primary structure of NDUFS1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including the NADH-quinone oxidoreductase chain G domain and the molybdopterin oxidoreductase domain (Hoefs2010Novel).

The secondary structure of NDUFS1 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its three-dimensional folding, or tertiary structure. This folding is critical for the proper positioning of iron-sulfur clusters, which are involved in electron transfer (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian). The quaternary structure of NDUFS1 involves its assembly with other subunits in complex I, forming part of the peripheral arm of the enzyme (Fiedorczuk2018Mammalian).

Mutations in NDUFS1 can lead to structural instability, affecting the assembly and function of complex I. These mutations can disrupt electron transfer between iron-sulfur clusters, leading to increased reactive oxygen species production and metabolic reprogramming (Ni2019Mutations).

## Function
The NDUFS1 gene encodes a core subunit of Complex I, also known as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is the largest enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This subunit is crucial for the electron transfer process within Complex I, facilitating the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. This electron transfer is coupled with the translocation of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, contributing to the proton gradient essential for ATP synthesis (Qi2022Cardiacspecific; Ni2019Mutations).

NDUFS1 is located in the iron-sulfur fragment of Complex I and contains three iron-sulfur clusters (N1b, N4, and N5), which are vital for electron transfer (Hoefs2010Novel). In healthy human cells, NDUFS1 plays a critical role in maintaining the mitochondrial potential and preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause cellular damage (Iuso2006Dysfunctions). The protein is active in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it ensures efficient oxidative metabolism and energy production, supporting cellular functions and preventing mitochondrial diseases (Ni2019Mutations; Iuso2006Dysfunctions).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the NDUFS1 gene, which encodes a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, are associated with several mitochondrial disorders. These mutations can lead to complex I deficiencies, which are a major cause of inborn mitochondrial diseases such as Leigh syndrome and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (Hoefs2010Novel; Iuso2006Dysfunctions). Specific mutations, such as the C1564A mutation resulting in a Q522K replacement, are linked to reduced levels of the mature complex, partial inhibition of its activity, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, contributing to cellular oxidative stress and damage (Iuso2006Dysfunctions).

Alterations in NDUFS1 expression levels have been implicated in various diseases. In clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC), NDUFS1 is significantly downregulated, correlating with shorter progression-free and overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Ellinger2017Systematic). In the context of myocardial infarction, reduced NDUFS1 expression is associated with cardiac dysfunction and increased oxidative stress, while its overexpression can ameliorate these effects by improving mitochondrial function and reducing apoptosis (Qi2022Cardiacspecific). These findings highlight the clinical significance of NDUFS1 in both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial diseases.

## Interactions
NDUFS1, a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I, plays a crucial role in the electron transport chain by facilitating electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone. It interacts with other subunits within complex I, such as NDUFA7, NDUFV2, and NDUFV1, to ensure the stability and integration of the complex. Mutations in NDUFS1 can disrupt these interactions, leading to a decrease in complex I enzymatic activity and the formation of supercomplexes, which are assemblies of complex I, III, and IV (Ni2019Mutations).

NDUFS1 also interacts with MDM2, a protein known for its role in regulating apoptosis and cellular respiration. MDM2 binds to NDUFS1, promoting its accumulation in the cytosol and destabilizing the assembly of complex I supercomplexes. This interaction leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis, independent of p53-dependent transcription (Elkholi2019MDM2). The binding affinity between MDM2 and NDUFS1 has been confirmed through experimental approaches, indicating a significant role in mitochondrial function and apoptotic signaling (Elkholi2019MDM2). These interactions highlight NDUFS1's involvement in both structural and regulatory processes within the mitochondrial network.
