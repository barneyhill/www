# TUBA3C

## Overview
TUBA3C is a gene that encodes the tubulin alpha 3c protein, a member of the tubulin superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in the formation and function of microtubules. Microtubules are integral components of the cytoskeleton, essential for maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. The TUBA3C gene is specifically expressed in the testis, suggesting a specialized function in spermatogenesis and testicular cell dynamics (Prassanawar2019Tubulin). The tubulin alpha 3c protein is involved in the structural folding of actin and tubulin, contributing to cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for processes such as spermatid polarity and flagellar motility (Mikelsaar2011Balanced). Additionally, TUBA3C has been implicated in drug resistance mechanisms, particularly in relation to the cancer drug paclitaxel, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Cirillo2017The). The protein's interactions with other tubulin proteins and its involvement in various cellular and pathological processes underscore its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Veerappa2021Cascade).

## Structure
The TUBA3C gene encodes an alpha-tubulin isotype that is a component of microtubules, essential for cellular structure and function. The primary structure of TUBA3C consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein's backbone. The secondary structure includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, allowing it to interact with other proteins and cellular components. In terms of quaternary structure, TUBA3C forms dimers with beta-tubulin, which then polymerize to create microtubules (CuencaZamora2019Tubulin).

TUBA3C is specifically expressed in the testis, indicating a specialized role in this tissue (Prassanawar2019Tubulin). The protein's C-terminal tail shows significant variation, which is crucial for microtubule dynamics and interactions with microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (Prassanawar2019Tubulin). Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation are common in tubulins, affecting their function and interactions (CuencaZamora2019Tubulin). TUBA3C has been linked to reduced sensitivity to the cancer drug paclitaxel, suggesting its role in drug resistance mechanisms (Cirillo2017The).

## Function
TUBA3C encodes an α-tubulin isotype that is a critical component of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular functions, including maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division (Prassanawar2019Tubulin). In humans, TUBA3C is specifically expressed in the testis, suggesting a role in the specialized functions of microtubules in testicular cells (Prassanawar2019Tubulin). The protein is involved in the structural folding of actin and tubulin, which are key components of the cytoskeleton (Kuo2016GenomeWide).

TUBA3C is part of the tubulin superfamily, which includes both alpha and beta tubulins, and is involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement necessary for spermatid polarity and tail formation (Mikelsaar2011Balanced). The gene's expression is linked to the motility of flagella, and its disruption may lead to sperm immotility and abnormal morphology, contributing to infertility (Mikelsaar2011Balanced). Although the specific function of TUBA3C in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its role in microtubule dynamics and cellular processes like mitosis and intracellular trafficking is crucial for maintaining cellular integrity and function (Prassanawar2019Tubulin).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
TUBA3C, or tubulin alpha 3c, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It is known to interact with TUBA1A, another tubulin protein, as part of a broader network of protein-protein interactions. This interaction is significant in the context of keratoconus, a corneal disease, where TUBA3C binds with TUBA1A and VSX1 protein, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis through its involvement in protein cross-talk and regulatory activities (Veerappa2021Cascade).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), TUBA3C is identified as a potential downstream target of the gene VCX3A. The expression of TUBA3C is upregulated in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, and it is closely co-expressed with VCX3A, indicating a reliable interaction network. This suggests that TUBA3C may play a role in the progression and prognosis of HCC, potentially through its interaction with VCX3A (Ding2020Discovery).

These interactions highlight the importance of TUBA3C in various cellular and pathological processes, underscoring its potential as a target for further research in disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.
