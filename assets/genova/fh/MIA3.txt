# MIA3

## Overview
MIA3 is a gene that encodes the protein MIA SH3 domain ER export factor 3, commonly referred to as TANGO1. This transmembrane protein is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a pivotal role in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. TANGO1 is primarily involved in the export of large macromolecular cargo, such as collagens, from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, which is essential for maintaining the extracellular matrix and proper cellular function (McCaughey2021A; Wilson2011Global). The protein's structure includes an SH3-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a proline-rich domain, which facilitate its interactions with components of the COPII coat complex, such as Sec23 and Sec24, to regulate vesicle formation and cargo selection (Saito2009TANGO1; Wilson2011Global). MIA3's function is critical for collagen secretion, and its dysregulation is associated with various diseases, including vascular disorders, hepatocellular carcinoma, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (Lei2021MIA; JunkiertCzarnecka2023A; Zhou2023MIA3).

## Structure
The MIA3 gene encodes a protein known as TANGO1, which is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and plays a crucial role in the export of bulky cargo such as collagen. The protein structure includes several distinct domains: an N-terminal SH3-like domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) (Saito2009TANGO1; Wilson2011Global). The SH3-like domain is involved in binding to collagen VII, facilitating its secretion from the ER (Saito2009TANGO1). 

The TANGO1 protein has evolved a unique fold, termed the MOTH domain, which includes a small β-barrel fold and terminal elongations. This domain has lost the ability to interact with PPII helix motifs, a function typical of SH3 domains, and has adapted for new roles in non-cytosolic spaces (Arnolds2022A). The cytoplasmic domain of TANGO1 is necessary for its localization to ER exit sites and includes a coiled-coil region that can localize independently (Liu2017Tango1). 

TANGO1 is also known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and may have splice variant isoforms that contribute to its functional diversity (Wilson2011Global).

## Function
The MIA3 gene, also known as TANGO1, encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. It is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it facilitates the export of secretory cargo to the Golgi apparatus. MIA3 is essential for the proper secretion of large proteins, such as collagens, which are vital components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (McCaughey2021A; Wilson2011Global).

MIA3 interacts with components of the COPII coat complex, such as Sec23 and Sec24, to regulate the formation of transport vesicles. This interaction is crucial for the packaging and export of large macromolecular cargo from the ER (McCaughey2021A; Wilson2011Global). The protein also plays a role in maintaining the organization of the ER-Golgi interface, ensuring efficient membrane trafficking and proper protein localization (McCaughey2021A).

In the absence of MIA3, there are significant defects in collagen secretion, leading to intracellular accumulation and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can result in developmental abnormalities and diseases related to collagen production (Wilson2011Global).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the MIA3 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In vascular diseases, MIA3 is linked to coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis. Its expression is increased in proliferative vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), promoting proliferation, migration, and inflammation. Knockdown of MIA3 reduces these processes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing neointimal hyperplasia in vascular diseases (Lei2021MIA).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MIA3 overexpression promotes tumor progression by degrading glutathione through its interaction with CHAC1, enhancing cell proliferation and migration. Knockout of MIA3 in HCC cells results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis, indicating its role in cancer progression (Zhou2023MIA3).

MIA3 mutations are also associated with Ehlers-Danlos hypermobile syndrome (hEDS). A novel frameshift mutation in MIA3 was identified in patients with hEDS, suggesting that impaired collagen transport due to this mutation may contribute to the disease phenotype (JunkiertCzarnecka2023A).

Additionally, polymorphisms in MIA3 have been linked to early onset myocardial infarction, potentially affecting plaque stability in atherosclerosis (Wilson2011Global).

## Interactions
MIA3, also known as TANGO1, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in the secretory pathway. MIA3 interacts with the Sec23 and Sec24 proteins of the COPII coat complex, which is essential for the transport of bulky collagen trimers from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Wilson2011Global). This interaction is crucial for the proper export of collagens, including types I, II, III, IV, VII, and IX, from various cell types (Wilson2011Global). MIA3 also interacts with SEC24C, a component of the COPII coat protein complex, which is vital for vesicle formation and cargo selection in the ER (Wilson2011Global).

In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MIA3 binds to CHAC1, a member of the γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase family, promoting the degradation of glutathione (GSH) and thereby facilitating cancer progression (Wanbiao2023MIA3; Zhou2023MIA3). This interaction is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation experiments and is localized in the ER (Wanbiao2023MIA3). The MIA3/CHAC1 interaction is significant in promoting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in HCC cells (Zhou2023MIA3). These interactions highlight MIA3's multifaceted role in both normal cellular processes and disease states.
