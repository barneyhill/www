# SPATA31E1

## Overview
SPATA31E1 is a gene that encodes the SPATA31 subfamily E member 1 protein, which is part of the SPATA31 family of core duplicon genes. This protein is characterized by a high degree of intrinsic disorder, allowing it to participate in a wide range of molecular interactions due to its structural flexibility. The SPATA31E1 gene is primarily associated with spermatogenesis, playing a crucial role in testis development and sperm cell formation. Although the specific functions of the SPATA31E1 protein in humans are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and chromatin remodeling, suggesting a role in maintaining genomic stability and DNA repair (Van2020Intrinsic; Cheung2024Genetic). The gene's involvement in reproductive health and its potential link to various diseases, including cancer and infertility, highlight its clinical significance (Tan2021Whole; Cheung2024Genetic).

## Structure
The human SPATA31E1 protein, encoded by the SPATA31E1 gene, is a 1,445-residue-long protein that is part of the SPATA31 family of core duplicon genes. This protein is characterized by a high degree of intrinsic disorder, as evidenced by the presence of 42 Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) distributed throughout its sequence. These MoRFs range from 9 to 44 residues in length and collectively account for 759 residues, indicating that a significant portion of the protein is capable of engaging in disorder-based interactions with various partners (Van2020Intrinsic).

The structure of SPATA31E1 does not include specific domains or prominent folds, and there is no detailed information available on its secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures. The protein's high intrinsic disorder suggests a lack of stable structure, which is common among intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and allows for structural plasticity and binding promiscuity (Van2020Intrinsic). Despite its potential for interaction, the protein-protein interaction network for SPATA31E1 is currently limited, likely due to the protein being understudied (Van2020Intrinsic). There is also no detailed information on its regulation by post-translational modifications (PTMs) (Van2020Intrinsic).

## Function
The SPATA31E1 gene, part of the SPATA31 family, is implicated in spermatogenesis, a critical process for male fertility. In humans, the protein encoded by SPATA31E1 is characterized by a high level of intrinsic disorder, which allows it to engage in disorder-based interactions with various molecular partners. This intrinsic disorder is indicated by the presence of 42 Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) distributed throughout its sequence, suggesting a significant potential for interaction with other proteins (Van2020Intrinsic).

Although the specific functions of SPATA31E1 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its association with spermatogenesis suggests a role in testis development and the formation of sperm cells. In mice, the absence of Spata31 leads to disorganized testis morphology and aberrant spermatogenic cells, indicating its importance in normal spermatogenesis, which may imply a similar function in humans (Marques2018Weighted).

SPATA31E1 is also involved in cellular processes such as cell cycle regulation and chromatin remodeling, typically active in the nucleus where it may influence gene expression and DNA maintenance. This suggests a broader role in maintaining genomic stability and potentially influencing DNA repair mechanisms (Tan2021Whole; Cheung2024Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPATA31E1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, SPATA31E1 has been identified as one of the genes harboring protein-truncating variants in first-degree relatives of familial pancreatic cancer patients, suggesting a potential role in cancer pathogenesis (Tan2021Whole). Additionally, SPATA31E1 mutations have been associated with chemoresistance in small cell lung cancer, indicating its involvement in disease recurrence and progression-free survival (Tang2022WholeExome).

In reproductive health, SPATA31E1 mutations have been linked to infertility, particularly in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) cases. These mutations were found in infertile individuals but not in fertile subgroups, suggesting a connection between SPATA31E1 mutations and infertility (Cheung2024Genetic). The gene is also part of a larger family involved in spermatogenesis, and its disruption can lead to disorganized testis morphology and aberrant spermatogenic cells, as observed in animal models (Marques2018Weighted).

Furthermore, SPATA31E1 has been identified in studies on stallion fertility, where high-impact variants in this gene were found to potentially affect reproductive traits, although specific consequences in humans remain unclear (Schrimpf2016Screening).
