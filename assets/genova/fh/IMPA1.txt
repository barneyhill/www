# IMPA1

## Overview
The IMPA1 gene encodes the enzyme inositol monophosphatase 1, a critical component of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway. This enzyme is responsible for the dephosphorylation of inositol monophosphate, thereby generating free inositol, which is essential for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and its derivatives. Inositol monophosphatase 1 is categorized as a hydrolase enzyme and functions as a homodimer, with its activity predominantly occurring in the cytoplasm. The enzyme is highly expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in maintaining neuronal function and excitability. IMPA1's activity is notably inhibited by lithium, a mood stabilizer used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, which underscores its importance in neurological health and its potential impact on psychiatric conditions (Saha2023IMPA1; Figueiredo2020Inositol).

## Structure
The human inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) enzyme is a crucial component of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, catalyzing the dephosphorylation of inositol monophosphate to free inositol. Structurally, IMPA1 functions as a homodimer, indicating a quaternary structure where two identical subunits associate to form the active enzyme (Singh2012Cloning; Bone1992Structure). Each subunit of the enzyme is composed of a five-layered sandwich structure, featuring three pairs of alpha-helices and two beta-sheets, which is characteristic of its secondary structure (Bone1992Structure). The enzyme's active sites are located in a large hydrophilic cavern at the base of the two central helices, which are crucial for its catalytic function (Bone1992Structure).

The primary structure of IMPA1 includes a conserved domain with a TIM barrel fold, a common motif in enzymes that facilitates its catalytic activity (Singh2012Cloning). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate the enzyme's activity, although specific modifications for IMPA1 are not detailed in the provided context. The gene also exhibits splice variants, which can lead to different isoforms with potential variations in function or localization (Figueiredo2020Inositol).

## Function
The human gene IMPA1 encodes the enzyme inositol monophosphatase 1, which is crucial for the dephosphorylation of inositol monophosphate to generate free inositol. This enzyme plays a vital role in the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway by facilitating the recycling of inositol, which is necessary for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and its derivatives, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) (Saha2023IMPA1; Figueiredo2020Inositol). PIP2 is a critical component in phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated intracellular calcium signaling, which is essential for various cellular processes, including neurotransmission in the brain (Saha2023IMPA1).

IMPA1 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm and is highly expressed in the brain, where it supports normal neuronal function and excitability by maintaining adequate levels of inositol and PIP2 (Saha2023IMPA1; Figueiredo2020Inositol). The enzyme's activity is inhibited by lithium, a mood stabilizer used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, which affects PIP2 turnover and calcium signaling, thereby modulating neuronal excitability (Saha2023IMPA1). This inhibition highlights the enzyme's importance in maintaining normal cellular signaling pathways and its potential impact on neurological health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the IMPA1 gene are associated with autosomal recessive intellectual developmental disorder 59 (MRT59), characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability and behavioral changes such as paranoia and aggression. This condition is linked to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in IMPA1, which lead to significant cognitive and functional impairments, including difficulties in verbal expression, executive functions, and cognitive flexibility. Patients with MRT59 often require assistance in daily tasks due to impairments in communication and social cognition (Pessoa2023Neuropsychological).

The IMPA1 gene mutation results in a frameshift and premature stop codon, causing a loss of enzyme function. This deficiency affects neuronal progenitor cells, leading to cell cycle arrest, neuronal apoptosis, and impaired neurogenesis, while gliogenesis remains unaffected. The mutation also causes altered brain activity patterns, such as decreased frontal theta band power and altered alpha band variability, which are associated with intellectual disability (Figueiredo2020Inositol; Walker2019Lossoffunction; Pessoa2023Neuropsychological).

Inositol supplementation has shown potential in improving neurogenesis when provided early in development, although it does not completely rescue the phenotype. The IMPA1 gene's role in psychiatric conditions is further highlighted by its suppression by lithium, a treatment for bipolar disorder (Figueiredo2020Inositol; Pessoa2023Neuropsychological).

## Interactions
The IMPA1 protein is involved in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, particularly in the context of axonal maintenance and mRNA metabolism. In sympathetic neurons, IMPA1 is part of a complex that includes the endonuclease Ago2, the RNA-binding protein HuD, and Upf1, a protein involved in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNA. This complex is responsible for the cleavage of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the IMPA1 transcript, a process crucial for maintaining axon integrity and regulating mRNA stability and translation (Andreassi2021Cytoplasmic).

Ago2, a member of the Argonaute family, binds preferentially to long 3' UTRs and mediates the endonucleolytic cleavage of the IMPA1 3' UTR. This interaction is facilitated by a stable stem-loop structure within the UTR and requires additional RNA-binding proteins and cofactors for efficient cleavage (Andreassi2021Cytoplasmic). The presence of these proteins in axons suggests a regulatory mechanism that influences the localization and stability of the IMPA1 transcript, impacting local protein synthesis and axon integrity (Andreassi2021Cytoplasmic). These interactions highlight the role of IMPA1 in the broader context of RNA metabolism and neuronal function.
