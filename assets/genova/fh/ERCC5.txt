# ERCC5

## Overview
ERCC5 is a gene that encodes the XPG protein, a critical component of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is essential for maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA damage. The XPG protein is a structure-specific endonuclease that plays a pivotal role in the incision step of NER by cleaving the damaged DNA strand at the 3' end, thereby facilitating the removal of bulky DNA adducts caused by environmental carcinogens and UV radiation (Zhu2012Polymorphisms; MacInnes1993Human). This protein is characterized by its conserved nuclease domains and its ability to interact with other proteins involved in DNA repair, such as the TFIIH complex and replication protein A (RPA) (Tsutakawa2020Human; Matsunaga1996Replication). Mutations in ERCC5 can lead to disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome, underscoring its importance in cellular health and genomic integrity (Tsutakawa2020Human; Cleaver2009Disorders).

## Structure
The ERCC5 gene encodes a protein known as XPG, which is a structure-specific endonuclease involved in nucleotide excision repair. The protein consists of 1,186 amino acids and has a molecular mass of approximately 133 kDa (MacInnes1993Human). The primary structure of ERCC5 includes highly conserved N- and I-nuclease domains, which form the nuclease core essential for its function. These domains are separated by a large spacer region that facilitates protein-protein interactions (Zhu2012Association).

The secondary structure of ERCC5 is characterized by the presence of helix-loop-helix (HLH) segments within its bipartite domains A and B, which are conserved with yeast RAD proteins (MacInnes1993Human). Domain B, in particular, may involve a zinc finger motif, suggesting a role in protein-DNA interactions (MacInnes1993Human).

ERCC5 also contains a ubiquitin-binding motif (UBM) and a PIP domain, which mediate interactions with PCNA, potentially involved in triggering the 3' incision in nucleotide excision repair (Zhu2012Association). The protein's structure is further characterized by potential post-translational modifications, such as a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site (MacInnes1993Human). Additionally, several alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms of ERCC5 have been identified, which may affect its function and stability (Emmert2001The).

## Function
The ERCC5 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, a vital mechanism for maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA damage. The ERCC5 protein functions as a single-strand specific DNA endonuclease, which cleaves the damaged DNA strand at the 3' end, facilitating the removal of bulky DNA adducts caused by environmental carcinogens and UV radiation (Zhu2012Polymorphisms; MacInnes1993Human). This activity is essential for correcting helix-distorting DNA lesions, such as pyrimidine dimers, and preventing disorders like xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome, which are characterized by deficiencies in DNA repair (MacInnes1993Human).

The ERCC5 protein is likely localized in the nucleus, where it participates in the incision step of the excision repair process, ensuring the integrity of the genome in healthy cells (MacInnes1993Human). It shares significant sequence similarity with RAD repair proteins in yeast, indicating a conserved mechanism of DNA repair across species (MacInnes1993Human). The protein's structure includes conserved bipartite domains, which are crucial for its function in DNA repair (MacInnes1993Human). Defective ERCC5 can lead to genomic instability and increased cancer risk, highlighting its importance in cellular and organismal health (Zhu2012Polymorphisms).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ERCC5 gene, also known as XPG, are associated with several genetic disorders, primarily xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). XP, particularly the XP-G subtype, is characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) light, leading to a higher risk of skin cancers and, in some cases, neurological abnormalities (Tsutakawa2020Human; Nouspikel1994Mutations). Mutations in ERCC5 can disrupt the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is crucial for repairing UV-induced DNA damage, resulting in the clinical manifestations of XP (Cleaver2009Disorders).

Cockayne syndrome, associated with ERCC5 mutations, involves severe developmental defects, neurodegeneration, and premature aging, but without the cancer predisposition seen in XP (Tsutakawa2020Human). Some mutations in ERCC5 can lead to a combined XP/CS phenotype, which presents with symptoms of both conditions (Calmels2016Uncommon).

The clinical severity of these conditions can vary depending on the specific mutations in ERCC5. Missense mutations often lead to milder XP phenotypes, while truncating mutations can result in more severe manifestations, including the combined XP/CS phenotype (Chikhaoui2019Identification; Calmels2016Uncommon). The variability in clinical outcomes is influenced by the specific impact of mutations on the stability and function of the XPG protein (Tsutakawa2020Human).

## Interactions
The ERCC5 gene encodes the XPG protein, which is involved in several DNA repair processes through its interactions with various proteins and DNA structures. XPG interacts with the TFIIH repair/transcription complex and replication protein A (RPA) in nucleotide excision repair (NER), where it cleaves the damaged DNA strand 3′ to the lesion. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of the XPF-ERCC1 heterodimer, which incises the DNA 5′ to the lesion (Tsutakawa2020Human; Matsunaga1996Replication).

XPG also binds specifically to bubble DNA structures, causing significant bending of the DNA, which is essential for its role in DNA repair (Tsutakawa2020Human). In transcription-coupled repair (TCR), XPG interacts with RNA polymerase II and Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) proteins. In homologous recombination repair (HRR), XPG interacts with BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51, promoting RAD51 loading onto RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (Tsutakawa2020Human).

XPG's interaction with RPA is specific, as RPA enhances the junction-cutting activities of XPG on DNA substrates with bubble or loop structures, a function not replicated by other single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (Matsunaga1996Replication). These interactions highlight XPG's role as both an enzyme and a scaffold in coordinating DNA repair processes.
