# KCNJ16

## Overview
KCNJ16 is a gene that encodes the protein potassium inwardly rectifying channel subfamily J member 16, commonly referred to as Kir5.1. This protein is a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family, which plays a critical role in maintaining potassium ion flow across cell membranes. Kir5.1 is characterized by its ability to form heteromeric channels with other Kir subunits, such as Kir4.1 and Kir4.2, which are essential for various physiological processes, including maintaining membrane potential and electrolyte balance, particularly in the kidney. The protein is sensitive to intracellular pH changes, allowing it to function as a pH sensor and mediator in renal ion transport regulation. Kir5.1 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the brain, kidney, liver, and pancreas, where it influences cellular excitability and fluid balance. Mutations in KCNJ16 have been linked to clinical conditions such as hypokalemic metabolic acidosis and nonfamilial Brugada syndrome, underscoring its significance in human health (Palygin2017Essential; Paulais2011Renal; Zhang2021Inwardly).

## Structure
The KCNJ16 gene encodes the Kir5.1 protein, which is part of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel family. The primary structure of Kir5.1 includes two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) connected by an extracellular pore-forming region (H5), along with cytoplasmic amino (NH2) and carboxy (COOH) terminal domains. The H5 region functions as an ion-selectivity filter, sharing a characteristic sequence with other K+-selective ion channels (Zhang2021Inwardly).

The secondary structure of Kir5.1 is characterized by the presence of beta-sheets in the C-terminal cytosolic domain, which provides binding sites for intracellular signaling regulators (Zhang2021Inwardly). The tertiary structure involves the arrangement of these domains to facilitate ion transport and channel gating.

In terms of quaternary structure, Kir5.1 can form homotetramers, although these are generally non-functional. Instead, it forms functional heterotetramers with Kir4.1 or Kir4.2, which are stable and functional on the plasma membrane (Zhang2021Inwardly). These heterotetramers are crucial for maintaining membrane potential and recycling potassium ions, particularly in the kidney (Zhang2021Inwardly). Kir5.1 is also sensitive to intracellular pH changes, acting as a pH sensor and mediator in renal ion transport regulation (Zhang2021Inwardly).

## Function
The KCNJ16 gene encodes the Kir5.1 subunit, which is part of the inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels family. These channels are crucial for maintaining potassium ion flow across cell membranes, which is essential for various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, Kir5.1 primarily forms heteromeric channels with Kir4.1, encoded by KCNJ10, and Kir4.2, encoded by KCNJ15. These heteromeric channels are involved in maintaining the basolateral membrane potential and facilitating potassium recycling, particularly in the distal nephron segments of the kidney. This function is vital for sustaining Na+ reabsorption and maintaining electrolyte balance (Paulais2011Renal; Zhang2021Inwardly).

Kir5.1 channels are sensitive to intracellular pH changes, allowing them to act as extracellular potassium sensors, which is important for regulating salt transport and maintaining acid-base balance (Zhang2023Diverse; Paulais2011Renal). The Kir5.1 subunit is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, kidney, liver, and pancreas, and plays a role in modulating cellular excitability and fluid balance (Zhang2021Inwardly). In the brain, Kir5.1 may interact with postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) to form functional channels, potentially influencing synaptic transmission (Zhang2023Diverse).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the KCNJ16 gene, which encodes the Kir5.1 channel, are associated with several clinical conditions. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in KCNJ16 have been linked to hypokalemic metabolic acidosis, characterized by increased urinary excretion of potassium, calcium, and magnesium, as observed in both animal models and a human case (Webb2021Biallelic). In mice, the absence of Kir5.1 results in a severe renal phenotype, including hypokalemic, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with hypercalciuria, contrasting with the SeSAME/EAST syndrome associated with KCNJ10 mutations (Paulais2011Renal).

In salt-sensitive rats, deletion of KCNJ16 leads to a phenotype similar to SeSAME/EAST syndrome, with salt wasting, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia, highlighting its role in electrolyte balance and blood pressure regulation (Palygin2017Essential). The gene is also implicated in nonfamilial Brugada syndrome, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (Palygin2017Essential). The disruption of Kir5.1 channels affects sodium and potassium balance, leading to severe consequences, including rapid death when on a high-salt diet, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for managing salt-sensitive hypertension and hyperkalemic states (Palygin2017Essential).

## Interactions
KCNJ16, also known as Kir5.1, is a protein that primarily interacts with other Kir subunits to form functional potassium channels. Kir5.1 cannot form functional channels on its own but is known to heteromerize with Kir4.1 (encoded by the KCNJ10 gene) to create channels with distinct properties. This interaction results in larger and more strongly rectified currents compared to Kir4.1 alone (Lo2022EASTSeSAME). Kir5.1 also interacts with Kir4.2 in the kidney and stomach, forming heteromeric channels that are sensitive to intracellular pH changes (Lo2022EASTSeSAME).

In the kidney, Kir5.1 and Kir4.1 function as heteromers, particularly in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), where they play a crucial role in maintaining potassium conductance and electrolyte balance (Lo2022EASTSeSAME). The interaction between Kir5.1 and Kir4.1 is essential for the proper function of these channels, as Kir5.1 can modulate the effects of Kir4.1 mutations, either exacerbating or mitigating functional deficits (Lo2022EASTSeSAME).

Kir5.1 also contains a PDZ binding motif, which suggests potential interactions with anchoring proteins like PSD-95. When coexpressed with PSD-95, Kir5.1 is clustered at the plasma membrane, indicating a role in the postsynaptic terminal (Lo2022EASTSeSAME).
