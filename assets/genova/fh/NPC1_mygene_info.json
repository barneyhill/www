endosomes and lysosomes and mediates intracellular cholesterol trafficking via binding of cholesterol to its N-terminal domain. It is predicted to have a cytoplasmic C-terminus, 13 transmembrane domains, and 3 large loops in the lumen of the endosome - the last loop being at the N-terminus. This protein transports low-density lipoproteins to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments where they are hydrolized and released as free cholesterol. Defects in this gene cause Niemann-Pick type C disease, a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by over accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in late endosomal/lysosomal compartments.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009].", "symbol": "NPC1", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1417776"}, "unigene": ["Hs.715623", "Hs.464779"], "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "O15118", "TrEMBL": ["K7ERW2", "K7ENZ0", "K7ERM4", "K7EQ23", "K7EIH7"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "NPC1"}}
