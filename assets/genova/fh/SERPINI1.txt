# SERPINI1

## Overview
SERPINI1 is a gene that encodes the protein serpin family I member 1, commonly known as neuroserpin. Neuroserpin is a serine protease inhibitor predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, where it plays a critical role in regulating proteolytic processes. As a member of the serpin superfamily, neuroserpin is characterized by its ability to inhibit tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), thereby maintaining neuronal survival and function. This regulation is essential for processes such as synaptic plasticity, neuronal migration, and axogenesis. Neuroserpin's structural features, including its reactive center loop and serpin fold, enable it to undergo conformational changes necessary for its inhibitory function. Mutations in the SERPINI1 gene are linked to Familial Encephalopathy with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies (FENIB), a rare neurodegenerative disorder marked by the accumulation of neuroserpin polymers within neurons (Adorjan2019Neuroserpin; Godinez2022Neuroserpin; Caccia2010Molecular).

## Structure
The SERPINI1 gene encodes neuroserpin, a serine protease inhibitor primarily expressed in the nervous system. Neuroserpin is a 55-kDa secretory protein that belongs to the serpin superfamily, characterized by a conserved core domain of approximately 350 residues. This domain includes three main β-sheets (A, B, and C) and 8-9 α-helices, forming the typical serpin fold (Caccia2010Molecular).

The reactive center loop (RCL) is a critical structural feature, acting as a bait for target proteases. Upon cleavage, the RCL inserts into the A-sheet, transitioning the protein from a 'stressed' to a 'relaxed' conformation, which is energetically favorable (Caccia2010Molecular). The RCL shows significant conformational variability, crucial for its function (Caccia2010Molecular).

Neuroserpin can exist in different conformations, including native, cleaved, latent, and polymeric forms. The latent form results from the insertion of the uncleaved RCL into the A-sheet, rendering the protein inactive (Noto2015Functional). The protein's structure is stabilized by intramolecular salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, contributing to its conformational stability and flexibility (Noto2015Functional).

Post-translational modifications of neuroserpin may include glycosylation, although the specific glycosylation pattern has not been thoroughly analyzed (Caccia2010Molecular). The protein can also form polymers through RCL swapping, a process implicated in certain neurodegenerative diseases (Caccia2010Molecular).

## Function
The SERPINI1 gene encodes neuroserpin, a serine protease inhibitor primarily expressed in the central nervous system. Neuroserpin plays a crucial role in regulating proteolytic processes by inhibiting tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which is essential for maintaining neuronal survival and function (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative; Adorjan2019Neuroserpin). This regulation helps prevent neurotoxicity and supports synaptic plasticity, neuronal migration, and axogenesis (Chen2007Two; Godinez2022Neuroserpin).

In healthy human cells, neuroserpin is involved in maintaining proteolytic homeostasis, which is vital for the brain's response to conditions like hypoxia-ischaemia (Adorjan2019Neuroserpin). It is expressed in various brain regions, including the cortical layers, and is particularly abundant in pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons (Adorjan2019Neuroserpin). Neuroserpin also plays a role in neuroprotection by interacting with the PI3K/Akt pathway, enhancing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, and reducing pro-apoptotic proteins (Godinez2022Neuroserpin).

In the retina, neuroserpin regulates serine protease activity and provides neuroprotection, particularly under stress conditions such as ischemia (Godinez2022Neuroserpin). Its expression and activity are crucial for normal synaptic function and neuronal health, highlighting its importance in the nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SERPINI1 gene are associated with a rare neurodegenerative disorder known as Familial Encephalopathy with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies (FENIB). This condition is characterized by the accumulation of neuroserpin polymers within neurons, leading to the formation of inclusion bodies called Collins bodies. These inclusions result in progressive neurological symptoms, including myoclonic epilepsy, cognitive deficits, and dementia (Roussel2016Progressive; Godinez2022Neuroserpin). The severity of FENIB varies depending on the specific mutation, with mutations such as G392E and G392R being linked to more severe forms of the disease, characterized by early onset and profound intellectual decline (Roussel2016Progressive).

The pathophysiology of FENIB involves both cell-autonomous toxicity due to neuroserpin accumulation and non-cell autonomous toxicity from the loss of protease inhibition (Roussel2016Progressive). Mutations like S49P, S52R, H338R, and G392E affect the conformational stability of neuroserpin, leading to its aggregation and the subsequent neurodegenerative effects (Davis2002Association). The condition is rare, with only a few familial cases reported worldwide (Roussel2016Progressive). Additionally, neuroserpin dysfunction has been implicated in other neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and stroke, due to its role in synaptic plasticity and neurovascular permeability (Godinez2022Neuroserpin).

## Interactions
SERPINI1, also known as neuroserpin, is a serine protease inhibitor that primarily interacts with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), inhibiting its activity. This interaction is crucial in regulating proteolytic processes in the nervous system, particularly in axonal development, synaptic plasticity, and neurite outgrowth (Mirshahvaladi2024Quantitative; SanchezNavarro2020Integrative). 

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, SERPINI1's interaction with tPA is significant, as it can modulate neurotoxic effects associated with tPA activity in the brain (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative). The inhibition of tPA by SERPINI1 is also linked to the accumulation of amyloid-β protein in Alzheimer's disease, potentially due to reduced degradation of amyloid-β by plasmin (SanchezNavarro2020Integrative).

Proteomic studies in neuroserpin-deficient mice have revealed that SERPINI1 is involved in various biological pathways, including nucleosome positioning, visual perception, and glutamate receptor activation. These studies suggest that SERPINI1 interacts with a range of proteins across different brain regions, affecting processes such as focal adhesion, apoptosis, and oxidative phosphorylation (Mirshahvaladi2024Quantitative). The protein-protein interaction network analysis has identified high-confidence interactions involving SERPINI1, highlighting its role in complex biological processes (Mirshahvaladi2024Quantitative).
