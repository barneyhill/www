# SLC7A14

## Overview
The SLC7A14 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 7 member 14, which is a member of the cationic amino acid transporter family. This protein is characterized by its predicted 14 transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in the transport of amino acids across lysosomal membranes, with a particular affinity for arginine (Giffen2021Mutation; Closs2006Structure). SLC7A14 is predominantly expressed in sensory tissues such as the retina and inner ear, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and sensory function (Jin2014SLC7A14; Giffen2021Mutation). Mutations in the SLC7A14 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa and auditory neuropathy, conditions that underscore its importance in sensory cell survival and function (Jin2014SLC7A14; Giffen2021Mutation). The protein's involvement in the mTORC1 signaling pathway further highlights its regulatory role in cellular growth and metabolism (Jiang2024Hypothalamic).

## Structure
The SLC7A14 protein is a member of the cationic amino acid transporter family, predicted to have 14 transmembrane domains with intracellular N- and C-termini (Closs2006Structure). This structural model is supported by experimental data, although alternative models with 12 or 13 transmembrane domains have been suggested (Closs2006Structure). The protein is part of the y+ system of cationic amino acid transporters and consists of 771 amino acids (Jin2014SLC7A14).

The SLC7A14 protein is expressed in the brain and eye, particularly in the inner nuclear layer and photoreceptor layer of the retina, indicating its role in photoreceptor development and function (Jin2014SLC7A14). While specific domains or 3D conformations are not explicitly described, the protein's structure is hypothesized to resemble the LeuT fold, a common structural motif in the SLC7 family characterized by a pseudo-symmetrical relation between the first five transmembrane helices and the consecutive five TMs (Jungnickel2018Structurala).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are predicted in SLC7A14, although these have not been experimentally confirmed (Closs2006Structure). The protein's function and stability may be influenced by these modifications.

## Function
The SLC7A14 gene encodes a protein that functions as a lysosomal membrane transporter, primarily facilitating the uptake of the amino acid arginine. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and nutrient sensing, particularly in lysosomal function and autophagy (Giffen2021Mutation). The protein is predominantly localized to the lysosomal membrane, with additional presence in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, indicating its involvement in intracellular membrane trafficking (Giffen2021Mutation).

In healthy human cells, SLC7A14 is highly expressed in sensory inner hair cells and retinal photoreceptors, suggesting a significant role in sensory functions (Giffen2021Mutation). The protein's proper localization to the lysosomal membrane is essential for its function, as mutations that disrupt this localization can lead to lysosomal dysfunction and impaired autophagy, contributing to cell degeneration (Jin2014SLC7A14; Giffen2021Mutation).

SLC7A14 is also implicated in the regulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway, where it interacts with proteins such as IKKβ and DERL1 to modulate cellular processes related to growth and metabolism (Jiang2024Hypothalamic). This regulatory role highlights its broader impact on cellular and organismal physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC7A14 gene are associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) and auditory neuropathy, conditions linked to lysosomal dysfunction. The gene encodes a transporter protein involved in the lysosomal uptake of cationic amino acids, particularly arginine. Mutations, such as the missense mutation p.Gly330Arg, lead to aberrant subcellular localization, reducing the protein's presence on the lysosomal membrane and disrupting its function. This mislocalization affects the regulation of autophagy, a critical process for cell survival, particularly in post-mitotic cells like photoreceptors and inner hair cells (Giffen2021Mutation).

In humans, SLC7A14 mutations have been linked to progressive hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by the degeneration of inner hair cells and photoreceptors. This results in auditory neuropathy and visual dysfunction, with symptoms including night blindness and progressive vision loss (Jin2014SLC7A14; Giffen2021Mutation). Studies have shown that SLC7A14 mutations account for approximately 2% of arRP cases in Chinese patients, highlighting its significance in retinal diseases (Jin2014SLC7A14). The gene's role in maintaining lysosomal-autophagy regulation suggests its potential as a target for gene therapy to prevent sensory deficits (Giffen2021Mutation).

## Interactions
The SLC7A14 protein is involved in several interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with TSC1 and IKKβ, playing a role in the regulation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. SLC7A14 inhibits the phosphorylation of TSC1 at Ser511, a critical step for mTORC1 activation. This inhibition is mediated by SLC7A14's ability to suppress the interaction between IKKβ and TSC1, thereby preventing TSC1 phosphorylation (Jiang2024Hypothalamic). The protein DERL1 is identified as a common interacting partner for SLC7A14, IKKβ, and TSC1, suggesting that SLC7A14 may inhibit mTORC1 signaling by disrupting the interaction between DERL1 and IKKβ (Jiang2024Hypothalamic).

SLC7A14 is also involved in lysosomal function, where it is trafficked to the lysosomal membrane and co-localizes with lysosomal markers LAMP1 and LAMP2. A missense mutation, SLC7A14 p.Gly330Arg, disrupts its localization, reducing its presence in lysosomes and affecting its interactions, which are crucial for maintaining lysosomal function and autophagy regulation (Giffen2021Mutation). These interactions are essential for the protein's role in cellular homeostasis and sensory cell survival (Giffen2021Mutation).
