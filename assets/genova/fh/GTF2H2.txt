# GTF2H2

## Overview
The GTF2H2 gene encodes the general transcription factor IIH subunit 2, a critical component of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex. This protein is integral to the processes of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and nucleotide excision repair (NER), both of which are essential for maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function. As a part of the TFIIH complex, the protein encoded by GTF2H2, also known as the p44 subunit, plays a pivotal role in unwinding DNA and facilitating the repair of DNA damage, thereby preventing mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer (Walker2017Evaluation; Chhabra2014Fetal). The gene is located in the SMA chromosomal region and has been studied in relation to Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), although its direct involvement in this condition is not yet fully understood (Coliban2023Analysis). Additionally, the GTF2H2 gene and its associated pathways have been implicated in cancer, highlighting its clinical significance and the necessity for further research to elucidate its roles in various diseases (Li2021TEP).

## Function
The GTF2H2 gene encodes a subunit of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which plays a crucial role in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. This complex is essential for unwinding DNA, facilitating the transcription of genes, and repairing DNA damage, thereby maintaining genomic stability and proper cellular function (Walker2017Evaluation; Chhabra2014Fetal).

In healthy human cells, GTF2H2 is involved in the transcription process, where it assists in the formation of the transcription pre-initiation complex, enabling RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription. This process is vital for the expression of genes necessary for various cellular functions (Coliban2023Analysis). Additionally, GTF2H2 is active in the NER pathway, a critical DNA repair mechanism that corrects DNA lesions caused by ultraviolet light and chemical mutagens. This repair process is essential for preventing mutations that could lead to diseases such as cancer (Walker2017Evaluation).

The GTF2H2 gene is located in the SMA chromosomal region and has been studied in the context of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), although its direct role in this condition remains to be fully elucidated (Coliban2023Analysis).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GTF2H2 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. While the GTF2H2 gene itself was not found to have deletions in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in a Moldovan population, mutations in this gene have been associated with severe forms of SMA, such as type I, in other studies (Coliban2023Analysis). This suggests a potential role in the severity of SMA, although this was not observed in the specific study of the Moldovan population.

In the context of cancer, the long non-coding RNA linc-GTF2H2-1, associated with the GTF2H2 gene, has been identified as a potential biomarker for lung cancer diagnosis and progression. It was found to be significantly downregulated in advanced-stage lung cancer patients, indicating its potential role in cancer progression (Li2021TEP). The expression of linc-GTF2H2-1 was also related to clinical parameters such as smoking history and tumor length, suggesting its involvement in the disease's clinical manifestations (Li2021TEP). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GTF2H2-related pathways in both genetic disorders and cancer, underscoring the need for further research to fully understand its role in these conditions.

## Interactions
The GTF2H2 gene encodes a subunit of the transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex, which is essential for transcription initiation and nucleotide excision repair. The TFIIH complex is composed of several subunits, including XPB, XPD, p62, p52, p44, p34, and p8, with GTF2H2 corresponding to the p44 subunit. This complex plays a critical role in DNA repair and transcription processes by interacting with various proteins and nucleic acids (Greber2017The).

The p62 subunit of TFIIH, which is closely associated with GTF2H2, contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is crucial for recruiting TFIIH to sites of DNA damage. This recruitment is facilitated by interactions with proteins such as XPC in global genome repair (GGR) and UVSSA in transcription-coupled repair (TCR). Both XPC and UVSSA bind to the p62 PH domain through specific residues that insert into hydrophobic pockets, a mechanism essential for TFIIH recruitment (Okuda2017Common).

The TFIIH complex also interacts with RNA polymerase II and other transcription factors, facilitating DNA unwinding and repair processes. These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC) and the nucleotide excision repair pathway (Schilbach2017Structures; Tsutakawa2020Envisioning).
