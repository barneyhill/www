# UBE3D

## Overview
UBE3D is a gene that encodes the ubiquitin protein ligase E3D, a crucial enzyme in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is responsible for protein degradation and maintaining cellular homeostasis. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, the protein ubiquitin protein ligase E3D plays a pivotal role in conferring substrate specificity by facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 conjugating enzymes to target proteins, thereby marking them for degradation (Xu2023Association). This process is essential for regulating protein turnover and ensuring proper cellular function. UBE3D is involved in several critical cellular processes, including DNA damage repair and mitosis, interacting with key proteins such as PCNA and KAP1 to maintain genomic stability and proper cell division (Xu2022UBE3D). Mutations in UBE3D have been linked to diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and may affect its role in DNA repair and mitotic progression, highlighting its clinical significance (Hundley2021A; Huang2015Wholeexome).

## Function
UBE3D encodes a ubiquitin protein ligase that plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a pathway essential for protein degradation and cellular homeostasis. This system involves tagging proteins with ubiquitin to mark them for degradation by the proteasome, thus regulating protein turnover and maintaining cellular function (Xu2023Association; Huang2015Wholeexome). UBE3D functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which confers substrate specificity by transferring ubiquitin from E2 conjugating enzymes to target proteins (Xu2023Association).

In healthy human cells, UBE3D is involved in several critical cellular processes, including DNA damage repair and mitosis. It interacts with proteins such as PCNA and KAP1 to facilitate DNA repair, particularly in response to double-strand breaks, and is implicated in chromatin relaxation during this process (Xu2022UBE3D). UBE3D also plays a role in mitotic progression, as its knockdown affects normal mitotic processes, indicating its importance in cell cycle regulation (Hundley2021A). These functions highlight UBE3D's role in maintaining genomic stability and proper cell division, contributing to overall cellular health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UBE3D gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and conditions related to DNA damage repair. In East Asian populations, a nonsynonymous amino acid substitution, rs7739323, which results in a V4M substitution at position 379 in the UBE3D gene, has been significantly associated with an increased risk of neovascular AMD. This variant is thought to affect the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to protein degradation issues, inflammation, and angiogenesis, which are key features of AMD (Huang2015Wholeexome).

The UBE3D gene is also involved in DNA damage repair processes. The V379M mutation in UBE3D affects its interaction with KAP1, a protein crucial for chromatin relaxation during double-strand break repair. This disruption can lead to increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and retinal damage, particularly under conditions like blue light exposure, which is relevant to AMD pathogenesis (Xu2022UBE3D).

Additionally, UBE3D has been identified as necessary for normal mitotic progression. Mutations in UBE3D can lead to mitotic defects, suggesting its importance in cell division processes, which may have implications for cancer and other proliferative disorders (Hundley2021A).

## Interactions
UBE3D, a ubiquitin protein ligase, is involved in several critical protein interactions that facilitate its role in DNA damage repair and other cellular processes. UBE3D interacts with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), a DNA clamp protein essential for DNA repair. This interaction is mediated through a conserved PIP (PCNA-interacting protein) box in UBE3D, specifically involving the aromatic residues F167 and F168. Mutations in these residues disrupt the interaction, highlighting its importance for UBE3D's recruitment to DNA damage sites (Xu2022UBE3D).

UBE3D also interacts with KAP1, a protein involved in heterochromatin formation and double-strand break repair. This interaction is facilitated by the 377RR378 motif in the HECT domain of UBE3D and is crucial for relaxing heterochromatin during DNA repair. The interaction is regulated by the phosphorylation of KAP1 at S824 by ATM, which enhances the binding affinity between UBE3D and KAP1 (Xu2022UBE3D).

Additionally, UBE3D has been identified as sensitive to mitotic inhibitors, suggesting potential interactions with proteins involved in mitosis, although specific partners in this context are not detailed (Hundley2021A).
