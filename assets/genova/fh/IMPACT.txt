# IMPACT

## Overview
The IMPACT gene encodes the impact RWD domain protein, which plays a crucial role in cellular stress response mechanisms. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein and is involved in the modulation of translation initiation, particularly under conditions of amino acid starvation. The impact RWD domain protein functions by interacting with the GCN2 kinase, inhibiting its activity, and thereby preventing the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2Î±). This inhibition is essential for maintaining protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis during nutrient deprivation (Qiu2020aarFDC). The IMPACT gene is highly conserved across species, underscoring its fundamental role in cellular physiology and its potential implications in various clinical contexts.
