# PRAMEF11

## Overview
PRAMEF11 is a gene that encodes the protein PRAME family member 11, which is part of the PRAME (Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma) gene family. This family is known for its role in various biological processes, although the specific functions of PRAMEF11 remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by PRAMEF11 is not currently categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, and its precise biological role is still under investigation. Genetic alterations involving PRAMEF11 have been associated with certain clinical conditions, including Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome and idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss, although the direct implications of these alterations are not yet fully understood (Lindstrand2008Molecular; Chen2015Concurrent; YILDIZ2022Copy).

## Clinical Significance
PRAMEF11, a member of the PRAME gene family, has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its genetic alterations. A study identified a deletion at cytoband 1p36.21 on chromosome 1, which includes the PRAMEF11 gene, in patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. This deletion was observed in three out of five patients analyzed, suggesting a potential role of PRAMEF11 in the condition, although the specific clinical significance of PRAMEF11 mutations or expression alterations in MRKH syndrome remains unclear (Chen2015Concurrent).

In the context of idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), PRAMEF11 was identified in regions with copy number variations (CNVs). However, these CNVs were not specifically highlighted as pathogenic or associated with any particular disease in the study, indicating that the clinical significance of PRAMEF11 in RPL is not well established (YILDIZ2022Copy).

Additionally, a complex intrachromosomal rearrangement involving PRAMEF11 was noted in a patient with a mild phenotype, suggesting that PRAMEF11 may not be sensitive to haploinsufficiency. The rearrangement's complexity makes it challenging to directly associate clinical symptoms with PRAMEF11 (Lindstrand2008Molecular).
