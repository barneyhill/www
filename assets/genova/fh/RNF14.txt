# RNF14

## Overview
RNF14, or ring finger protein 14, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, characterized by its RING finger domain, plays a pivotal role in protein degradation, transcriptional regulation, and chromatin remodeling. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF14 facilitates the transfer of ubiquitin to substrate proteins, marking them for degradation and thus regulating protein turnover and cellular homeostasis. It is notably involved in the androgen receptor signaling pathway, acting as a coactivator to enhance target gene expression, and is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and Wnt signaling pathways. Additionally, RNF14 is essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of elongation factor-1α during ribosome stalling, highlighting its role in maintaining protein synthesis and cellular stress responses (Wang2020RBR; Oltion2022An).

## Structure
RNF14 (ring finger protein 14) is characterized by a RING finger domain, a specialized type of zinc finger domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions and exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity. The primary structure of RNF14 includes a sequence of amino acids that form this RING domain, which is crucial for its functional role in ubiquitination processes. The secondary structure of RNF14 may include alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the stability and function of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with other molecules and its biological activity. While the quaternary structure typically refers to the assembly of multiple protein subunits, it is not specified whether RNF14 forms such complexes. Post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, can significantly influence the function of RNF14, potentially altering its activity and interactions. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of RNF14 may exist, which can lead to variations in its structure and function, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
RNF14, also known as ring finger protein 14, is a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in various cellular processes, including protein degradation, transcriptional regulation, and chromatin remodeling. In healthy human cells, RNF14 plays a critical role in the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway by acting as a coactivator that enhances AR target gene expression. It interacts with p300/CBP-associated factors, which possess histone acetyl-transferase activity, thereby influencing chromatin structure and gene transcription (Wang2020RBR).

RNF14 is also implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation. It promotes the transcription of cyclin D1, a key regulator of cell cycle progression, and its depletion can lead to cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, inhibiting cell growth (Wang2020RBR). Additionally, RNF14 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it binds to target promoters with TCF/LEF and maintains β-catenin recruitment, supporting cell survival (Wang2020RBR).

In the context of ribosome stalling, RNF14, along with RNF25, is essential for the ubiquitination and degradation of elongation factor-1α (eEF1A), a process crucial for maintaining protein synthesis and cellular homeostasis (Oltion2022An). RNF14's activity in these pathways underscores its importance in cellular regulation and stress response mechanisms.

## Interactions
RNF14, also known as ARA54, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its RING finger domain. It acts as a transcriptional co-activator and interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), modulating its activity (Lin2009The). RNF14 is also part of a network that includes interactions with other hormone nuclear receptors such as the estrogen receptor (ESR1) and the growth hormone receptor (NR3C1) (Lin2009The).

In the context of ribosome-associated processes, RNF14 interacts with GCN1, a ribosome-associated scaffolding protein. This interaction is crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of elongation factor-1α (eEF1A) on stalled ribosomes, a process mediated by RNF14's E3 ligase activity (Oltion2022An). The interaction between RNF14 and GCN1 is facilitated by their RWD domains, which are protein interaction domains (Oltion2022An).

RNF14 also forms complexes with ribosomes and is involved in the ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins, playing a role in ribosome quality control and stress response pathways (Oltion2022An). These interactions highlight RNF14's involvement in both transcriptional regulation and protein degradation pathways.
