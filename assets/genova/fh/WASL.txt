# WASL

## Overview
The WASL gene encodes the WASP-like actin nucleation promoting factor, commonly referred to as N-WASP, which is a pivotal component in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This protein is categorized as an actin nucleation-promoting factor and plays a crucial role in actin polymerization by activating the Arp2/3 complex, thereby facilitating the formation of branched actin filaments. N-WASP is involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, endocytosis, and morphogenesis, through its interactions with signaling molecules such as the small GTPase Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5P2) (Rohatgi1999The; May2001The). The protein's activity is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and functional dynamics (Alekhina2017Cellular). Mutations and dysregulation of WASL have been linked to various pathological conditions, including neurological disorders and cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Kumar2021Compound; p&gt; miR1423p; Peng2019&lt).

## Structure
The WASL protein, also known as N-WASP, is a member of the WASP family involved in actin polymerization. It contains several key domains that contribute to its function. The WH1 domain facilitates interactions with other proteins, such as the WASP-interacting protein (WIP), which stabilizes the protein structure (Alekhina2017Cellular). The GTPase-binding domain (GBD) interacts with the GTP-bound form of Cdc42, relieving autoinhibition and activating the protein (Alekhina2017Cellular). A proline-rich region is present, which is crucial for binding to SH3 domain-containing proteins and is involved in the regulation of actin dynamics (Kumar2021Compound). The VCA domain is essential for the activation of the Arp2/3 complex, promoting actin nucleation and the formation of branched actin filaments (Alekhina2017Cellular).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in modulating the activity of WASL, affecting its interactions and function in actin polymerization (Alekhina2017Cellular). Splice variants of WASL may exist, potentially altering its functional properties, although specific details on these isoforms are not provided in the context (Alekhina2017Cellular).

## Function
WASL, also known as N-WASP, is a protein that plays a critical role in actin cytoskeleton dynamics by promoting actin polymerization through the activation of the Arp2/3 complex. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including cell motility, endocytosis, and morphogenesis (Rohatgi1999The; May2001The). WASL is regulated by interactions with molecules such as the small GTPase Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns 4,5P2), which transition it from an inactive to an active state, facilitating actin polymerization (Rohatgi1999The; May2001The).

In healthy human cells, WASL is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, where it is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate actin assembly. The protein's C-terminal region is crucial for its interaction with the Arp2/3 complex, enhancing actin nucleation (Rohatgi1999The). WASL's activity is modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, which may affect its sensitivity to upstream signals, impacting cellular processes such as movement and structural integrity (May2001The). The protein's role in actin dynamics is vital for maintaining cellular structure and function, contributing to organismal outcomes like immune responses and cell differentiation (Tolar2017Cytoskeletal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the WASL gene, also known as N-WASP, have been implicated in various diseases, particularly neurological disorders and cancers. In the context of early onset Parkinson's disease (PD), compound heterozygous variants in the WASL gene have been identified in a family with a history of PD. These include a missense variant (p.P380L) and a splice variant, both of which are predicted to be damaging. Functional studies suggest these variants lead to altered neuronal structure, decreased tolerance to reactive oxygen species, and increased levels of alpha-synuclein, a protein associated with PD pathogenesis (Kumar2021Compound; Kumar2020Evidence).

In cancer, particularly uveal melanoma, WASL is targeted by miR-142-3p, a microRNA that suppresses tumor growth. Downregulation of miR-142-3p leads to increased WASL expression, contributing to tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation and migration. Overexpression of miR-142-3p results in reduced WASL levels, causing cell cycle arrest and decreased tumor growth, highlighting WASL's role in cancer progression (p&gt; miR1423p; Peng2019&lt).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of WASL in disease pathogenesis, suggesting that its mutations and expression alterations can contribute to the development of neurological disorders and cancers.

## Interactions
WASL, also known as N-WASP, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in actin cytoskeleton dynamics. WASL interacts with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase TNK2, which phosphorylates WASL, enhancing its actin nucleation activity. This interaction is important for the infection process of multiple picornaviruses, as TNK2 acts upstream of WASL in a common pathway that supports viral entry (Jiang2019Entry). WASL also interacts with the adaptor protein NCK1, which is hypothesized to recruit WASL to TNK2, facilitating its activation through phosphorylation. This interaction is supported by co-localization studies and quantitative FRET analysis, which demonstrate a higher interaction efficiency between WASL and NCK1 compared to TNK2 and NCK1 (Jiang2019Entry).

WASL's role in actin polymerization is further supported by its interaction with the Arp2/3 complex, which is essential for actin branching. The interaction between WASL and the Arp2/3 complex is crucial for the endocytic trafficking of viral particles, a key step in the lifecycle of picornaviruses (Jiang2019Entry).
