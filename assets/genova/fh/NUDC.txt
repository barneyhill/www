# NUDC

## Overview
The NUDC gene encodes the nuclear distribution C, dynein complex regulator protein, which is a crucial component in various cellular processes, particularly in mitosis and cytokinesis. This protein functions as a co-chaperone and is characterized by a conserved CS domain, which is typical of proteins involved in heat shock response and protein folding (Zheng2011Structural). NUDC plays a pivotal role in regulating the dynein motor complex, essential for intracellular transport and cell division, and is involved in the organization of microtubule structures during mitosis (Aumais2003Role; Fu2016Emerging). Beyond its role in cell division, NUDC is implicated in neuronal migration, inflammatory responses, and thrombopoiesis, indicating its broader significance in cellular homeostasis (Fu2016Emerging; Riera2009The). The protein's interactions with various cellular components, including the mitotic kinase Plk1 and the thrombopoietin receptor, underscore its multifaceted role in maintaining cellular function and its potential involvement in pathological conditions such as cancer (Aumais2003Role; Pan2005A).

## Structure
The human NUDC protein is characterized by a conserved molecular architecture that includes a CS domain, which is typical of proteins acting as co-chaperones of Hsp90 or as independent small heat shock proteins (Zheng2011Structural). The core of the NUDC protein is an all-antiparallel β-sandwich, with significant portions of the structure occurring in loops (Zheng2011Structural). The CS domain shares structural similarities with other proteins like the Hsp90 cochaperone p23 and the Hsp20 chaperone, although there are differences in loop structures and β-strand configurations (Zheng2011Structural).

NUDC proteins are homodimeric, with a modular structure that includes a coiled-coil motif for dimerization, a flexible linker, and two conserved α-helices (Zheng2011Structural). The dimeric nature is crucial for their function, and the N-terminal coiled-coil motif is implicated in dimerization (Zheng2011Structural). The C-terminal fragment of NUDC, downstream of residue 274, shows sequence conservation and is likely α-helical, but does not significantly interact with the CS domain (Zheng2011Structural).

NUDC proteins do not form binary complexes with Lis1, a WD40 family member, as shown by isothermal calorimetric titration and pull-down experiments (Zheng2011Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which is involved in its role in cytokinesis (Zheng2011Structural).

## Function
The NUDC gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in several cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily involved in mitosis and cytokinesis, where it regulates the dynein motor complex, essential for intracellular transport and cell division. NUDC is associated with microtubule-based structures during different phases of mitosis, including the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and mitotic spindles, and is crucial for proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Aumais2003Role; Fu2016Emerging). 

NUDC interacts with the mitotic kinase Plk1, which phosphorylates NUDC, influencing its function in mitosis and cytokinesis. This interaction is vital for the stability and organization of the midzone and midbody microtubule matrices, ensuring successful cell division (Aumais2003Role; Fu2016Emerging). 

In addition to its role in cell division, NUDC is involved in neuronal migration and is expressed in regions of the embryonic neocortex undergoing this process. It also plays a role in the inflammatory response and thrombopoiesis, indicating its broader involvement in cellular homeostasis (Fu2016Emerging; Riera2009The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NUDC gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the context of cancer. NUDC is highly expressed in early myeloid and erythroid precursors and is upregulated in leukemia, suggesting its involvement in malignant hematopoietic cell growth (Miller1999A). In gliomas, NUDC and its interaction partners are upregulated or redistributed in migrating tumor cells, indicating a role in tumor cell migration and proliferation (Suzuki2007Expression). Overexpression of NUDC in mammalian cells leads to cytokinesis failure, resulting in multinucleation and abnormal cell division, which are associated with tumorigenesis (Aumais2003Role).

NUDC is also implicated in hematopoiesis, with its expression regulated by hematopoietic growth factors. This regulation is crucial for normal cell proliferation and differentiation, and its dysregulation may contribute to hematological malignancies (Miller1999A). In addition, NUDC is involved in the LIS1/dynein pathway, and its altered expression can lead to defects in mitotic processes, further contributing to cancer progression (Fu2016Emerging). These findings highlight the potential of NUDC as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment, particularly in leukemia and gliomas.

## Interactions
NUDC interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as mitosis and cytokinesis. It forms a complex with LIS1, a regulatory subunit of platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase type I, which is involved in neuronal migration and nuclear movement. This interaction is significant for the regulation of the dynein motor complex, essential for nuclear migration and spindle pole body function (Helmstaedt2008The; Morris1998The). NUDC also interacts with the dynein/dynactin motor complex, a microtubule minus-end-directed complex, and is involved in the regulation of dynein function during cell division (Aumais2003Role).

NUDC binds to the extracellular domain of the thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl), influencing megakaryocyte differentiation and activating signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in Mpl-expressing cells (Pan2005A). It also forms a physiological complex with cofilin 1, a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton, stabilizing it via an Hsp90-independent pathway (Fu2016Emerging). These interactions highlight NUDC's involvement in various cellular processes, including cell division, neuronal migration, and thrombopoiesis.
