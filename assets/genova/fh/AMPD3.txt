# AMPD3

## Overview
The AMPD3 gene encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase 3, a critical component of purine metabolism in humans. This enzyme is primarily expressed in erythrocytes, where it catalyzes the deamination of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), playing a vital role in maintaining the balance of adenine nucleotides and energy homeostasis within cells. As a member of the AMP deaminase family, AMPD3 is distinguished by its unique structure, which includes a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain essential for its catalytic activity and an amino-terminal domain that may influence its intracellular localization and regulatory functions. The enzyme's activity is modulated by interactions with calmodulin in the presence of calcium ions, which enhances its catalytic efficiency. While AMPD3 deficiency in humans is generally asymptomatic, it has been linked to altered erythrocyte function and immune cell dynamics in animal models, as well as potential implications in tumor biology (Zhan2020Adenosine; Cheng2012AMPD3‐deficient; Mahnke2005Calcium).

## Structure
The AMPD3 protein, encoded by the AMPD3 gene, is a human AMP deaminase isoform involved in purine metabolism. The primary structure of AMPD3 includes a 2301-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 767 amino acids (MahnkeZizelman1992Cloning). The secondary structure analysis reveals several consecutive beta-turns in the divergent amino-terminal domain, which are absent in skeletal muscle isoforms, and a highly alpha-helical region over 30 amino acids long, containing residues homologous to alpha-spectrin and fodrins (MahnkeZizelman1992Cloning).

The AMPD3 protein has a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain believed to contain the active site, including residues like SLSTDDP involved in zinc binding and substrate interaction (MahnkeZizelman1992Cloning). The amino-terminal domain shows significant divergence, potentially relating to noncatalytic roles such as intracellular localization (MahnkeZizelman1992Cloning). The protein also has three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites, with only one conserved between the two human isoforms (MahnkeZizelman1992Cloning).

Alternative splicing of the AMPD3 gene results in at least three different 5'-terminal exons, leading to isoforms with variations at the amino terminus, which may create isoform-specific regulatory sites and unique epitopes (MahnkeZizelman1992Cloning).

## Function
AMPD3, or adenosine monophosphate deaminase 3, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the catabolism of AMP (adenosine monophosphate) within erythrocytes. It catalyzes the conversion of AMP to IMP (inosine monophosphate), which is crucial for maintaining the balance of adenine nucleotides, including ATP and ADP, in cells. This balance is essential for energy homeostasis and cellular functions such as energy metabolism and oxygen transport (O’Brien2015CD73).

In erythrocytes, AMPD3 is the only isoform present and is responsible for the irreversible loss of AMP from the adenine nucleotide pool, as erythrocytes lack a salvage pathway to convert IMP back to AMP. This process is vital for regulating the size of the adenine nucleotide pool, which is critical for maintaining ATP levels, the primary energy currency for cellular processes (O’Brien2015CD73).

AMPD3 activity is particularly important under conditions of energy imbalance and oxidative stress, where it helps stabilize the energy charge of cells. In AMPD3-deficient conditions, elevated ATP levels can affect hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, potentially enhancing oxygen delivery to tissues (Cheng2012AMPD3‐deficient; O’Brien2015CD73).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the AMPD3 gene have been associated with various physiological and pathological conditions. In humans, AMPD3 deficiency is typically clinically asymptomatic, characterized by increased ATP levels in erythrocytes without noticeable symptoms (Zhan2020Adenosine). However, in mice, AMPD3 deficiency has been linked to increased osmotic fragility of erythrocytes under fasting conditions, suggesting potential erythrocyte dysfunction (Cheng2012AMPD3‐deficient). This deficiency does not improve anemia associated with pyruvate kinase deficiency, indicating that AMPD3 plays a distinct role in red blood cell metabolism (Cheng2012AMPD3‐deficient).

In the context of immune function, AMPD3 deficiency in mice leads to a reduction in naive T-cell populations in peripheral blood, potentially due to elevated ATP levels affecting T-cell surface markers (Zhan2020Adenosine). This reduction is not observed in secondary lymphoid organs, suggesting a specific impact on peripheral blood lymphocytes (Zhan2020Adenosine).

In gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), AMPD3 is highly expressed and correlates with the expression of the KIT gene. Its depletion in GIST cells reduces cell proliferation and increases sensitivity to the therapeutic agent imatinib, indicating a role in tumor progression and treatment response (Wong2016AMPD3).

## Interactions
AMPD3 interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in the presence of calcium ions (Ca2+), forming a protein-protein interaction that is crucial for its activation. This interaction occurs at the N-terminal domain of the AMPD3 polypeptide, specifically within residues 65-89. The binding of Ca2+-CaM to AMPD3 enhances its catalytic activity by lowering the apparent Km, which is not achieved by Ca2+ or CaM alone (Mahnke2005Calcium). This interaction is significant in erythrocytes, where it antagonizes inhibitory protein-lipid interactions that would otherwise reduce AMPD3 activity (Mahnke2005Calcium).

The interaction between AMPD3 and CaM is largely dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and is not significantly affected by changes in pH or ionic strength. The N-terminal domain is crucial for this interaction, as truncation beyond a certain point reduces the adsorption of AMPD3 to CaM-agarose beads (Mahnke2005Calcium). This protein-protein interaction is reversible and likely controlled by intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, allowing AMPD3 to interact with membranes in response to physiological changes (Mahnke2005Calcium).
