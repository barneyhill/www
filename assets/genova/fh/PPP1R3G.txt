# PPP1R3G

## Overview
The PPP1R3G gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3G, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a pivotal role in glycogen metabolism and glucose homeostasis. This protein is primarily expressed in the liver, where it targets PP1 to glycogen particles, facilitating the dephosphorylation of key enzymes involved in glycogen synthesis and breakdown. As a regulatory subunit, PPP1R3G is crucial for adapting glycogen metabolism to nutritional states, being upregulated during fasting and downregulated after feeding. Beyond its role in glycogen metabolism, PPP1R3G is also implicated in lipid metabolism, influencing triglyceride synthesis and fat storage, thereby linking glycogen metabolism to lipid accumulation. Additionally, PPP1R3G interacts with various proteins, including RIPK1 and TRAF2, playing a significant role in cell death pathways such as apoptosis and necroptosis, with potential implications in inflammatory and degenerative diseases (Luo2011FastingInduced; Zhang2017Ablation; Du2021RIPK1).

## Function
PPP1R3G encodes a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that plays a significant role in glycogen metabolism and glucose homeostasis. In healthy human cells, PPP1R3G is primarily active in the liver, where it targets PP1 to glycogen particles, facilitating the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase. This action is crucial for glycogen synthesis, particularly during the fasting-feeding cycle, as it helps regulate glycogen accumulation in response to changes in blood glucose levels (Luo2011FastingInduced).

PPP1R3G is upregulated during fasting and downregulated after feeding, indicating its role in adapting glycogen metabolism to nutritional states. This regulation is essential for maintaining postprandial blood glucose homeostasis, as PPP1R3G modulates glycogen synthase activity, thereby influencing glycogen storage and glucose clearance in the liver (Luo2011FastingInduced).

In addition to its role in glycogen metabolism, PPP1R3G is involved in lipid metabolism. It influences triglyceride synthesis and fat storage, linking glycogen metabolism to lipid accumulation, which can impact conditions such as obesity (Zhang2017Ablation). These functions highlight PPP1R3G's critical role in energy storage and metabolic regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PPP1R3G gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in the regulation of cell death pathways such as apoptosis and necroptosis. The PPP1R3G gene, in conjunction with PP1γ, forms a holoenzyme that dephosphorylates RIPK1, a crucial step for its activation and the promotion of cell death pathways. Disruptions in this process can lead to resistance to necroptosis and apoptosis, as seen in PPP1R3G knockout models (Du2021RIPK1). 

In vivo studies have shown that mice lacking PPP1R3G are protected from TNF-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), indicating that alterations in PPP1R3G expression can impact inflammatory responses and cell death regulation (Du2021RIPK1). This suggests that PPP1R3G could be a potential therapeutic target for conditions involving systemic inflammation and cell death, such as TNF-induced SIRS (Du2021RIPK1).

Furthermore, human genetic studies have linked disruptions in RIPK1 signaling, which is regulated by PPP1R3G, to severe inflammatory and degenerative diseases, including autoinflammatory disorders and ALS. This highlights the potential impact of PPP1R3G alterations on disease mechanisms where apoptosis and necroptosis are involved (Du2021RIPK1).

## Interactions
PPP1R3G is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. It forms a holoenzyme with the catalytic subunit PP1γ, which is essential for the dephosphorylation and activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). This interaction is critical for promoting apoptosis and necroptosis by dephosphorylating inhibitory phosphorylation sites on RIPK1, such as S25, S320, and S335 (Du2021RIPK1). The interaction between PPP1R3G and PP1γ is mediated by a specific RVQF motif in PPP1R3G, and mutation of this motif disrupts the interaction, leading to a failure in RIPK1 activation (Du2021RIPK1).

PPP1R3G also interacts with TRAF2, suggesting that it could be directed to different substrates by various TRAF proteins, thereby increasing its substrate repertoire (Du2021RIPK1). In addition, PPP1R3G has been shown to interact with Sorcin, a protein involved in calcium signaling. This interaction is supported by experimental binding potency data and is observed in cellular contexts, indicating a potential complex formation (Genovese2020Profiling).

These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PPP1R3G in regulating cell death pathways and its potential implications in inflammatory and degenerative diseases.
