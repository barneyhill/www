# MFAP3L

## Overview
MFAP3L (microfibril associated protein 3 like) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular processes related to cancer progression, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The protein encoded by MFAP3L is implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, acting as a critical component in the modulation of these processes. It is targeted by microRNA-671-5p (miR-671-5p), which functions as a tumor suppressor by binding to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of MFAP3L, leading to its downregulation. This interaction is significant in the context of NSCLC, where the suppression of MFAP3L by miR-671-5p results in decreased expression of proteins associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased levels of E-cadherin, thereby inhibiting cancer progression (Ye2021MicroRNA‑671‑5p). The role of MFAP3L in cancer metastasis, including colorectal liver and bone metastasis in breast cancer, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (Ye2021MicroRNA‑671‑5p).

## Clinical Significance
MFAP3L (microfibril associated protein 3 like) has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), MFAP3L expression is upregulated, which is associated with increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This upregulation is linked to the downregulation of microRNA-671-5p (miR-671-5p), which normally targets MFAP3L to suppress these cancerous activities. The study by Junhui Ye et al. demonstrated that miR-671-5p inhibits NSCLC progression by targeting MFAP3L, and that overexpression of MFAP3L can reverse the inhibitory effects of miR-671-5p on cancer cell behaviors (Ye2021MicroRNA‑671‑5p).

MFAP3L is also associated with metastasis in other cancers. It has been linked to colorectal liver metastasis and bone metastasis in breast cancer, suggesting its role in cancer metastasis through nuclear signaling pathways (Ye2021MicroRNA‑671‑5p). These findings highlight the potential of MFAP3L as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment, particularly in NSCLC, where targeting the miR-671-5p/MFAP3L signaling pathway could suppress tumor progression (Ye2021MicroRNA‑671‑5p).

## Interactions
MFAP3L (microfibril-associated protein 3-like) is involved in interactions with microRNA-671-5p (miR-671-5p), a microRNA that acts as a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). miR-671-5p directly targets MFAP3L by binding to a response element within its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), leading to the downregulation of MFAP3L expression. This interaction has been confirmed through luciferase reporter assays, which demonstrated that miR-671-5p mimics reduce luciferase activity, indicating direct binding to MFAP3L (Ye2021MicroRNA‑671‑5p).

The interaction between miR-671-5p and MFAP3L plays a significant role in modulating cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, and invasion in NSCLC cells. The suppression of MFAP3L by miR-671-5p results in decreased expression of proteins associated with cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including PCNA, N-cadherin, and vimentin, while increasing E-cadherin levels. These effects are reversed by the overexpression of MFAP3L, highlighting its role as a direct target of miR-671-5p (Ye2021MicroRNA‑671‑5p). This interaction suggests that MFAP3L is a critical component in the miR-671-5p-mediated regulation of NSCLC progression, making it a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
