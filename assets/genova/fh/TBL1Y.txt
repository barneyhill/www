# TBL1Y

## Overview
TBL1Y is a gene located on the Y chromosome that encodes the protein transducin beta-like 1 Y-linked, which is involved in transcriptional regulation. This protein is a member of the WD40 repeat protein family, characterized by its role in forming multicomponent complexes essential for transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. TBL1Y is particularly significant in the context of cardiac differentiation and development, where it influences the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes. The protein's interactions with corepressors such as SMRT and its involvement in pathways like Notch signaling underscore its importance in cellular processes and development. Clinically, TBL1Y has been associated with conditions such as prostate cancer and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its potential role in disease mechanisms (Meyfour2017Y; Di2018TBL1Y:; Tiirikka2015Human).

## Structure
The TBL1Y protein is characterized by the presence of eight WD40 repeats in its C-terminal region, which are predicted to form an eight-bladed β-propeller structure. This structural feature is crucial for protein-protein interactions, facilitating the assembly and function of multicomponent complexes involved in transcriptional repression (Ginalski2004Protein). The N-terminal region of TBL1Y is involved in histone binding, playing a significant role in chromatin and gene regulation (Ginalski2004Protein).

TBL1Y is a Y-linked homologue of TBL1X and is part of the TBL1 family, which includes TBL1X and TBLR1. These proteins share structural similarities, such as the presence of WD40 repeats, but TBL1Y exhibits distinct functional characteristics. Unlike TBL1X and TBLR1, TBL1Y does not repress transcriptional activity for the adenovirus major late promoter, which may be attributed to structural differences in the N-terminal alanine-rich region (Yan2005Molecular).

The protein is also involved in cardiac differentiation, with its expression increasing during the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into cardiac cells. This suggests a role in sex-specific differences in cardiovascular development (Meyfour2017Y).

## Function
TBL1Y is a Y chromosome gene that encodes a protein involved in transcriptional regulation, particularly as part of the nuclear receptor corepressor complex. This protein plays a significant role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression, influencing various cellular processes such as cell differentiation and metabolism (Di2018TBL1Y:). TBL1Y is expressed in specific tissues, including the cochlea and prostate, suggesting its involvement in auditory function and prostate cell development (Di2018TBL1Y:).

In cardiac differentiation, TBL1Y is crucial for the proper development of cardiomyocytes. It shows dynamic expression patterns during cardiac differentiation, initially localizing in the cytoplasm and later in the nucleus, with peak expression at day 3 of differentiation (Meyfour2017Y). Knockdown of TBL1Y in cardiac mesoderm cells leads to increased apoptosis and affects cardiomyocyte morphology and function, indicating its importance in cardiogenesis (Meyfour2017Y).

TBL1Y also interacts with the SMRT corepressor, which is essential for its function as a transcriptional regulator, particularly in the context of thyroid hormone receptor activity. This interaction is important for the transcriptional activation of genes downstream of the thyroid hormone receptor, which is crucial for auditory function (Di2018TBL1Y:).

## Clinical Significance
The TBL1Y gene, located on the Y chromosome, has been implicated in several clinical conditions. It is associated with prostate cancer development, particularly in cases involving Y chromosome deletions, which are common genetic anomalies among prostate cancer patients (Tiirikka2015Human). TBL1Y has also been linked to autism spectrum disorders, with a higher prevalence of unusual SNPs in autistic males. Y-chromosome aneuploidy, which includes variations in TBL1Y, is associated with a higher rate of autistic disorders, particularly among XXYY males (Tiirikka2015Human).

In the context of cardiac differentiation, TBL1Y plays a crucial role. Its knockdown in human embryonic stem cells leads to increased apoptosis and affects cardiomyocyte morphology and function, suggesting its importance in cardiogenesis. This is potentially due to its interaction with the Notch signaling pathway, which is crucial for cardiac development (Meyfour2017Y). Additionally, TBL1Y is considered a component of the nuclear receptor corepressor complex, indicating its regulatory contributions to cancer-related processes, such as juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas (Kumari2024Comprehensive). Despite these associations, the specific mechanisms by which TBL1Y mutations contribute to these conditions remain to be fully elucidated.

## Interactions
TBL1Y, a protein encoded by the TBL1Y gene on the Y chromosome, is involved in several protein-protein interactions crucial for its function in transcriptional regulation. It interacts with the SMRT corepressor, which is part of the thyroid nuclear receptor complex. This interaction is significant for transcriptional repression, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Di2018TBL1Y:). TBL1Y contains WD40 repeats that facilitate its role in assembling multicomponent complexes involved in transcriptional repression (Ginalski2004Protein). These WD40 repeats potentially form an eight-bladed β-propeller structure, which is essential for its interaction capabilities (Ginalski2004Protein).

In the context of cardiac differentiation, TBL1Y is suggested to influence Notch signaling pathways by interacting with CtBP, a Notch corepressor. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of cardiac-specific markers and the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes (Meyfour2017Y). TBL1Y's interactions extend beyond the Y chromosome, as it also interacts with proteins encoded on other human chromosomes, which is expected due to its derivation from pseudoautosomal regions or identity with X chromosome sequences (Rengaraj2015Bioinformatics).
