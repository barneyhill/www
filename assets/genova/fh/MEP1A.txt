# MEP1A

## Overview
The MEP1A gene encodes the meprin A subunit alpha, a metalloprotease that belongs to the astacin family of metalloproteinases. This gene is responsible for producing a protein that plays a significant role in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, thereby contributing to tissue remodeling, inflammation, and cell migration. The meprin A subunit alpha is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes M12A protease, MAM, and MATH domains, and forms part of a larger oligomeric assembly that enhances its stability and function (BaylyJones2022Helical; BaylyJones2022Helicala). The protein is predominantly expressed in the kidney and intestinal tissues, where it is involved in maintaining intestinal barrier function and modulating immune responses (STERCHI2008Meprins; Jiang2000Structure). Alterations in MEP1A expression have been linked to various pathological conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Coskun2012TNFαinduced; Peters2019Role).

## Structure
The MEP1A gene encodes the metalloprotease meprin α, which is characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of meprin α consists of a sequence of amino acids that form a compact triad of domains: the M12A protease, MAM, and MATH domains (BaylyJones2022Helical). The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, contributing to the protein's stability and function. 

In terms of tertiary structure, meprin α forms a flexible, left-handed helical assembly approximately 22 nm in diameter, with a spacious helical groove and a hollow core (BaylyJones2022Helical). This helical filament is stabilized by interactions between the MAM and MATH domains, which are supported by a conserved disulfide bond (BaylyJones2022Helicala).

The quaternary structure of meprin α involves the formation of covalently linked homo- and heterodimers, which can further assemble into large, non-covalently associated soluble oligomers (BaylyJones2022Helicala). These oligomers exhibit various structures, including rings, circles, spirals, and tubes, and are crucial for the protein's function and regulation (BaylyJones2022Helical).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are common, contributing to the protein's molecular mass and stability (BaylyJones2022Helical). The protein's oligomeric state enhances its proteolytic and thermal stability, although it does not affect substrate specificity or enzymatic activity (BaylyJones2022Helicala).

## Function
The MEP1A gene encodes the α subunit of metalloendopeptidase meprin A, a member of the astacin family of metalloproteinases. Meprin A is involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, playing a crucial role in tissue remodeling, inflammation, and cell migration (STERCHI2008Meprins; Jiang2000Structure). The enzyme is active in the extracellular space, where it processes a variety of peptides and proteins, including hormones, growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins, leading to their activation or inactivation (Jiang2000Structure; Jiang1999Identification).

In healthy human cells, meprin A is expressed in tissues such as the kidney, small intestine, colon, and appendix, with the highest expression levels observed in the kidney (Jiang2000Structure). The enzyme is particularly important in the intestine, where it is localized to the brush border membrane of villus epithelial cells, contributing to the maintenance of intestinal barrier function and modulation of immune responses (STERCHI2008Meprins). Meprin A's activity is regulated by transcription factors, such as GATA factors, which influence its tissue-specific expression (STERCHI2008Meprins).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MEP1A gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of meprin A, have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly ulcerative colitis (UC), MEP1A expression is significantly reduced. This downregulation is linked to the suppression of the transcription factor CDX2 by TNF-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine elevated in IBD. The suppression of MEP1A by TNF-α, mediated through CDX2 and HNF4α, contributes to the inflammatory processes in the gut, suggesting a role in the pathogenesis of IBD (Coskun2012TNFαinduced).

In cancer, MEP1A expression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in MEP1A have been identified in various cancers, including melanoma, lung, uterine, and stomach cancers. These SNVs can disrupt the protease's catalytic activity, affecting tumor microenvironment interactions and potentially facilitating cancer progression (Peters2019Role).

MEP1A has also been identified as a susceptibility gene for atherosclerosis in mice. Alterations in MEP1A expression influence oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, contributing to the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions (Grainger2021Identification).

## Interactions
MEP1A, encoding the meprin α subunit, participates in several significant protein interactions. Meprin α can form heterodimers with meprin β through disulfide bonds between their MAM domains. This interaction is crucial for the cell surface localization of meprin α, which occurs only when it is coexpressed with meprin β. The heterodimerization is disrupted by mutating specific cysteine residues, highlighting the importance of these disulfide bonds (Peters2019Tethering).

Meprin α also interacts with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA C) in the context of kidney injury. Meprin A cleaves the PKA Cβ1 isoform, while meprin B can cleave all three PKA C isoforms (Cα, Cβ1, and Cβ2). These interactions are significant in the pathology of acute and chronic kidney injury, as they influence PKA signaling pathways (Niyitegeka2015Isoformspecific).

Additionally, MEP1A mRNA interacts with the long non-coding RNA CCL14-AS, which reduces its stability and downregulates its expression. This interaction suggests a regulatory role in colorectal cancer progression, where CCL14-AS acts as a tumor suppressor by modulating MEP1A expression (Li2023Long).
