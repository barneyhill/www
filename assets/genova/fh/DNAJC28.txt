# DNAJC28

## Overview
DNAJC28 is a gene that encodes the protein DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C28, which is part of the Hsp40 class of molecular chaperones. These proteins are integral to cellular processes that maintain protein homeostasis, such as protein folding, prevention of aggregation, and refolding of misfolded proteins. The DNAJC28 protein interacts with Hsp70 proteins, enhancing their ATPase activity, which is crucial for their chaperone function. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in Golgi organization and intracellular vesicle trafficking. DNAJC28 is involved in the cellular response to oxidative stress and is implicated in processes like actin polymerization and endosomal processing. Clinically, DNAJC28 has been linked to various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where its expression levels are often altered, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Heldens2010Cochaperones; Martin2021Transcriptomewide; Dilliott2022DnaJC7; Deo2023Identification; Zoppino2018Comprehensive; Iacobas2021TWEAKing; Zhang2020Characterization).

## Function
DNAJC28 is a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family, specifically the Hsp40 class, which functions as a molecular chaperone. These proteins are crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis by assisting in protein folding, preventing aggregation, and facilitating the refolding of misfolded proteins. DNAJC28 interacts with Hsp70 proteins, enhancing their ATPase activity, which is essential for the chaperone function of Hsp70 (Deo2023Identification; Heldens2010Cochaperones).

In healthy human cells, DNAJC28 is involved in the canonical heat shock response and is associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in Golgi organization and intracellular vesicle formation and trafficking. This function is linked to oxidative stress, suggesting that DNAJC28 may help manage cellular stress conditions (Martin2021Transcriptomewide). The protein is also implicated in processes such as actin polymerization and endosomal processing, which are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Martin2021Transcriptomewide).

DNAJC28 is active in the cytoplasm and may contribute to the regulation of protein quality control under both normal and stress conditions, ensuring proper protein function and cellular signaling (Deo2023Identification).

## Clinical Significance
DNAJC28, a member of the DnaJ heat shock protein family, has been implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression levels. In cancer, DNAJC28 is downregulated in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), with its decreased expression associated with worse overall survival in these cancers. It is also noted for its ability to inhibit cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in multiple cancer types, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2020Characterization). In breast cancer, DNAJC28 is downregulated across all subtypes analyzed, indicating a complex regulation of this gene in cancer biology (Zoppino2018Comprehensive).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, DNAJC28 is associated with neurological phenotypes such as delayed speech and language, generalized hypotonia, intellectual disability, seizures, and optic atrophy (Dilliott2022DnaJC7). In a neuropsychiatric lupus mouse model, DNAJC28 shows high expression levels, which may act as a compensatory mechanism in response to inflammation and local damage, suggesting a protective role in neurodegenerative conditions (Iacobas2021TWEAKing).
