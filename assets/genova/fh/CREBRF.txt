# CREBRF

## Overview
The CREBRF gene encodes the CREB3 regulatory factor, a protein that plays a pivotal role in cellular energy metabolism and stress response regulation. As a regulatory protein, CREBRF is involved in modulating the activity of the transcription factor CREB3, particularly during the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response, by sequestering CREB3 and promoting its degradation (Wong2018Exploring). This protein is expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, where it influences adipogenic differentiation and energy storage (Minster2016A). CREBRF also affects muscle cell metabolism by shifting energy production from glycolysis to oxidative pathways, thereby enhancing mitochondrial respiration (Saavedra2023REPTOR). Clinically, the gene is notable for its p.Arg457Gln variant, which is associated with increased obesity risk but offers protection against type 2 diabetes in certain populations, such as Pacific Islanders (Loos2016CREBRF; Krishnan2018Discordant). This dual role underscores the gene's significance in metabolic regulation and its potential evolutionary adaptation to environmental pressures.

## Function
The CREBRF gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in regulating cellular energy metabolism and stress responses. It is widely expressed in various tissues, including adipose tissue, where it is involved in adipogenic differentiation. During this process, CREBRF expression is induced alongside adipogenic markers, promoting lipid and triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes, which suggests a role in energy storage (Minster2016A). CREBRF also functions as a negative regulator of the transcription factor CREB3, which is activated during the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response. By binding and sequestering CREB3 into nuclear sub-regions, CREBRF suppresses its activity and promotes degradation, thus modulating the cellular response to prolonged ER stress (Wong2018Exploring).

In muscle cells, CREBRF shifts energy metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative pathways, enhancing mitochondrial respiration and reducing glycolytic ATP production. This shift is associated with increased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and decreased lactate production, indicating a role in adapting muscle metabolism to nutrient availability (Saavedra2023REPTOR). CREBRF's involvement in these processes suggests it plays a crucial role in maintaining energy homeostasis and metabolic flexibility in response to changing nutritional conditions.

## Clinical Significance
The CREBRF gene, particularly the p.Arg457Gln variant, has been linked to significant clinical implications in certain populations, notably among Pacific Islanders. This variant is associated with an increased risk of obesity, as it promotes fat storage and increases body mass index (BMI) (Loos2016CREBRF; Minster2016A). Despite this, it paradoxically offers a protective effect against type 2 diabetes, reducing the risk by enhancing insulin sensitivity and promoting a metabolically healthier form of obesity characterized by increased subcutaneous fat deposition (Li2021CREBRF; Krishnan2018Discordant).

The variant is prevalent in Samoan and other Polynesian populations but is rare globally, suggesting a unique genetic adaptation to historical environmental conditions, such as feast and famine cycles (Loos2016CREBRF; Hanson2019Association). The CREBRF variant's influence on metabolic traits is distinct from other obesity-associated genes, as it does not primarily affect appetite or hunger through the central nervous system (Loos2016CREBRF). Studies using animal models have shown that the variant promotes adipogenesis and reduces oxidative stress, which may contribute to its protective effects against diabetes (Li2021CREBRF).

## Interactions
CREBRF (CREB3 regulatory factor) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, influencing cellular processes. It interacts with Luman, a cellular transcription factor, through a consensus HCF-binding motif, which is also present in the viral transcription factor VP16. This interaction is crucial for regulating herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) replication (Audas2016Characterization). CREBRF forms nuclear foci that colocalize with GRIP1, a nuclear receptor co-activator, suggesting potential physical interactions with other nuclear proteins (Audas2016Characterization).

CREBRF also interacts with CREB3, a member of the CREB family involved in transcription regulation. It acts as a negative regulator by sequestering CREB3 into discrete nuclear sub-regions, suppressing its activity and promoting its degradation (Wong2018Exploring). In the context of glioblastoma, CREBRF inhibits hypoxia-induced autophagy through the CREB3/ATG5 pathway, highlighting its regulatory role over CREB3 (Xue2016CREBRF).

In cervical cancer, CREBRF is a downstream target of the circ_0102171/miR-4465 axis, where miR-4465 binds to CREBRF, reducing its expression and activity (Tang2020Hsacirc0102171). These interactions underscore CREBRF's role in modulating transcriptional activity and cellular stress responses.
