# PTPN23

## Overview
PTPN23 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 23 (HD-PTP), a member of the Bro1 domain-containing protein family. Although classified as a classical non-transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase, HD-PTP is catalytically inactive due to a conserved divergence in its phosphatase domain (Gingras2009HDPTP). Despite this, HD-PTP plays a crucial role in cellular processes such as endosomal sorting, signal transduction, and the regulation of cell invasion. It is involved in the morphogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and interacts with components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery (Doyotte2008The; Tabernero2018Dissecting). Additionally, HD-PTP acts as a tumor suppressor, influencing pathways such as SRC and β-catenin signaling, and is implicated in various diseases, including neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer (Singh2023PTPN23; Lin2011Identification).

## Structure
PTPN23 encodes the HD-PTP protein, which is a member of the Bro1 domain-containing protein family. The molecular structure of HD-PTP includes several distinct domains: a Bro1 domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a proline-rich region (PRR) (Tabernero2018Dissecting). The Bro1 domain is crucial for its role in endosomal sorting and multivesicular body (MVB) morphogenesis, interacting with components of the ESCRT machinery, such as CHMP4B and TSG101 (Doyotte2008The). The coiled-coil domain adopts an open and extended conformation, facilitating interactions with other proteins (Tabernero2018Dissecting).

HD-PTP is categorized as a classical non-transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), but it is catalytically inactive due to a conserved divergence in its phosphatase domain. Specifically, a key residue in the PTP motif has diverged, rendering the enzyme inactive (Gingras2009HDPTP). Despite this, HD-PTP retains functional importance, as its expression reduces colony growth in cancer cell lines, indicating a tumor suppressor role independent of its phosphatase activity (Gingras2009HDPTP).

PTPN23 is also involved in post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may influence its interactions and functions within the cell (Husedzinovic2015The). The protein can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, suggesting a dynamic role in cellular processes (Husedzinovic2015The).

## Function
PTPN23, also known as HD-PTP, is a protein involved in several critical cellular processes, primarily related to endosomal sorting and signal transduction. It plays a significant role in the endosomal cargo sorting pathway, which is essential for the degradation of membrane proteins in lysosomes. PTPN23 is involved in the morphogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and is crucial for the proper trafficking of endosomal cargo, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Doyotte2008The; Tabernero2018Dissecting).

PTPN23 is also implicated in the regulation of the survival motor neuron (SMN) complex, which is vital for the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) necessary for pre-mRNA splicing. It influences the localization and phosphorylation state of the SMN complex, maintaining its function in RNA processing and cellular homeostasis (Husedzinovic2015The).

In addition to its role in endosomal sorting and SMN complex regulation, PTPN23 is involved in the regulation of cell invasion and signaling pathways. It acts as an inhibitor of SRC and β-catenin signaling, maintaining epithelial characteristics and inhibiting invasive signaling pathways in mammary epithelial cells (Lin2011Identification). PTPN23's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and endosomes, where it influences cellular homeostasis and development (Budzinska2020PTPN23).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the PTPN23 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Biallelic variants in PTPN23 have been linked to a severe autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, structural brain abnormalities, intellectual disability, spasticity, language disorder, microcephaly, optic atrophy, and seizures (Bend2019Phenotype). In an extended Palestinian family, a frameshift variant in PTPN23 was associated with a complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia, presenting with lower limb weakness, muscle wasting, hyperreflexia, and microcephaly (KhalafNazzal2021Final).

PTPN23 mutations are also implicated in mesiodens formation, a dental anomaly involving extra teeth. Specific mutations such as p.Glu603Lys and p.Arg1100Cys are linked to this condition, affecting protein stability and EGFR signaling (Adisornkanj2023Genetic). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PTPN23 is downregulated, and its low expression correlates with poor prognosis. The WDR4/PTPN23 axis is involved in sustaining EGFR and c-MET signaling pathways, contributing to cancer progression and resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Singh2023PTPN23). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PTPN23 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
PTPN23, also known as HD-PTP, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, particularly binding to CHMP4B via its Bro1 domain and to TSG101 through a central domain containing PS/TAP motifs. These interactions are essential for endosomal cargo sorting and multivesicular body (MVB) morphogenesis (Doyotte2008The).

In the context of lung cancer, PTPN23 interacts with WDR4, forming a WDR4/PTPN23 axis that is hyperactivated in human lung cancer. This interaction is associated with poor prognosis and involves the ubiquitination of PTPN23 by WDR4, which suppresses the degradation of EGFR and c-MET, key players in cancer signaling pathways (Singh2023PTPN23).

PTPN23 also interacts with the SMN complex, including SMN and its partners Gemin2, Gemin3, and unrip. This interaction is important for regulating the phosphorylation state of SMN, affecting its localization and function in snRNP assembly and trafficking (Husedzinovic2015The).

In mammary epithelial cells, PTPN23 interacts with SRC, E-cadherin, and β-catenin. These interactions are significant for regulating cell invasion, motility, and adhesion, with PTPN23 acting as a negative regulator of SRC activity (Lin2011Identification).
