# DRD4

## Overview
The DRD4 gene encodes the dopamine receptor D4, a member of the D2-like family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are characterized by their seven transmembrane domains. This receptor plays a crucial role in modulating synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, particularly in regions such as the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and striatum. The dopamine receptor D4 is involved in various signaling pathways, influencing neurotransmission, receptor trafficking, and synaptic plasticity. Notably, the DRD4 gene exhibits significant polymorphisms, especially in the third intracellular loop, which can lead to different receptor variants with distinct functional properties. These polymorphisms have been associated with individual differences in susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia. The receptor's interactions with other proteins and its involvement in diverse cellular processes underscore its importance in both normal brain function and disease states (Nemoda2011Psychopathological; Ferré2022Functional; Rondou2010The).

## Structure
The dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by its seven transmembrane (TM) domains, a common feature of GPCRs. The primary structure of DRD4 includes a sequence of 387 amino acids in humans, with significant polymorphisms, particularly in the third intracellular loop (IC3), which contains variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) (Rondou2010The; Tarazi1999Brain). These polymorphisms can result in different receptor variants, affecting receptor function and drug interactions (Tarazi1999Brain).

The secondary structure of DRD4 is dominated by alpha helices that span the cell membrane, typical of GPCRs (MISSALE1998Dopamine). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a three-dimensional conformation, forming a ligand-binding pocket that is crucial for its interaction with dopamine and other ligands (Zhou2019Crystal). The receptor's quaternary structure is not prominently discussed, but it can form dimeric or oligomeric complexes, which may influence its activity (Zhou2019Crystal).

Post-translational modifications of DRD4 include N-linked glycosylation at specific asparagine residues, which may play a role in receptor stability and function (Rondou2010The). The receptor also undergoes phosphorylation, which can modulate its signaling properties (Tarazi1999Brain). The DRD4 gene produces several splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Rondou2010The).

## Function
The DRD4 gene encodes the dopamine D4 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor involved in modulating synaptic transmission in the brain. This receptor is part of the D2-like receptor family and is primarily located postsynaptically in dendritic shafts and spines, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and striatum (Rondou2010The). The D4 receptor influences various signaling pathways, including adenylyl cyclase activity, which affects cAMP production, and modulates intracellular calcium levels, impacting synaptic transmission and receptor trafficking (Rondou2010The).

The D4 receptor is involved in the regulation of glutamate receptors, such as NMDA and AMPA, and voltage-gated ion channels, which are crucial for dopamine's long-lasting effects on synaptic transmission (Rondou2010The). It also plays a role in the modulation of frontal cortico-striatal pyramidal neurons, influencing impulsivity and attention regulation (Ferré2022Functional). The receptor's polymorphic variants, such as D4.2, D4.4, and D4.7, exhibit different potencies in coupling to signaling pathways, which may contribute to individual differences in neuropsychiatric disorders (Ferré2022Functional).

In addition to its role in neurotransmission, the D4 receptor is involved in the circadian modulation of melatonin synthesis in the pineal gland, highlighting its diverse functions in cellular and organismal processes (Ferré2022Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The DRD4 gene, encoding the dopamine receptor D4, is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Variations in this gene, particularly the 7-repeat allele of the exon 3 VNTR, have been associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This allele is linked to persistent ADHD into adulthood and is associated with endophenotypes such as locomotor hyperactivity and executive function deficits (Nemoda2011Psychopathological). Imaging studies have shown that ADHD children with the DRD4 7-repeat allele exhibit cortical thinning, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, which resolves by late adolescence (Nemoda2011Psychopathological).

The DRD4 gene is also associated with schizophrenia, with elevated expression levels observed in patients. The gene's high affinity for the antipsychotic drug clozapine makes it a significant therapeutic target (Michealraj2014Functional). Additionally, DRD4 polymorphisms have been linked to substance use disorders, including alcoholism and nicotine dependence. The 7-repeat allele is associated with higher smoking cue reactivity and poorer quit rates (Nemoda2011Psychopathological).

Alterations in DRD4 expression and function are also implicated in emotional eating behaviors, potentially leading to obesity. The gene's role in dopamine signaling affects reward sensitivity and impulsivity, contributing to these conditions (Barth2020Genetically).

## Interactions
The dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) is involved in various protein interactions that significantly influence its signaling and functional properties. DRD4 interacts with SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Grb2 and Nck, which are adapter proteins that recruit multiprotein complexes to the receptor. These interactions are crucial for processes like cell proliferation, movement, axon guidance, and actin cytoskeleton organization. The proline-rich sequences in the polymorphic region of DRD4's third intracellular loop (IC3) are key to these interactions (Rondou2010The).

DRD4 also interacts with G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK), affecting neuronal excitability by modulating ion passage in response to D4 stimulation (Rondou2010The). Another significant interaction is with the BTB-Kelch protein KLHL12, which binds specifically to the polymorphic region of DRD4 and acts as a substrate-specific adaptor in a Cul3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to the receptor's ubiquitination (Rondou2010The).

There is also evidence suggesting that DRD4 may form oligomers, which could play a role in receptor biogenesis, although this has not yet been published (Rondou2010The). These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving DRD4 and its role in various cellular processes.
