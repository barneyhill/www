# CD55

## Overview
CD55 is a gene that encodes the protein known as decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which is a critical component of the immune system. The CD55 protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in regulating the complement system, a part of the innate immune response. It achieves this by promoting the dissociation of C3 and C5 convertases, thereby preventing the over-activation of the complement pathways and protecting host cells from damage (Thielen2018CRISPRCas9). Structurally, CD55 is characterized by four short consensus repeat (SCR) domains and is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Lukacik2004Complement). The protein is expressed on the surface of most human cells, including erythrocytes and endothelial cells, and also functions as a ligand for the CD97 receptor, facilitating cell adhesion processes (Hamann1996The; Mikesch2006Decayaccelerating). Mutations in the CD55 gene can lead to clinical conditions such as CHAPLE syndrome, characterized by complement system hyperactivation and associated complications (Ozen2017CD55).

## Structure
The CD55 protein, also known as decay-accelerating factor, is characterized by its four short consensus repeat (SCR) domains, which are crucial for its function in regulating the complement system. These domains are arranged in a rod-like formation, as revealed by X-ray diffraction and analytical ultracentrifugation data, and are linked to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor by a stalk extended by highly charged O-glycans (Lukacik2004Complement). The SCR domains form an extended linear molecule with dimensions of approximately 160 x 50 x 30 Å, and the structure is relatively rigid with little variation at the domain interfaces (Lukacik2004Complement).

CD55 is heavily glycosylated, featuring both N-linked and O-linked glycans. The N-linked oligosaccharides are primarily located at Asn-63 in the SCR 1/2 domain interface, while the O-linked glycans are predominantly found in the serine/threonine/proline-rich stalk region (Lukacik2004Complement). This glycosylation contributes to the protein's stability and protection from proteases. The interaction with convertases involves a hydrophobic patch centered on the linker between SCR domains 2 and 3, with the AP convertase contacting SCR domains 2, 3, and 4 (Lukacik2004Complement). The structure of CD55 in complex with CD97 has been determined, revealing an antiparallel binding mode involving the SCR 1-3 domains of CD55 (Niu2021Structural). The study of CD55's structure provides insights into its biological functions and interactions with other proteins.

## Function
CD55, also known as decay-accelerating factor (DAF), is a crucial protein in the regulation of the complement system, a component of the innate immune response. It functions by promoting the rapid dissociation of C3 and C5 convertases, which are key enzymes in the complement activation pathways, including the classical, lectin, and alternative pathways. This activity, known as decay accelerating activity, prevents the over-activation of the complement system, thereby protecting host cells from potential damage (Thielen2018CRISPRCas9).

CD55 is anchored to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and is expressed on the surface of most human cells, including erythrocytes and endothelial cells (Mikesch2006Decayaccelerating; Thielen2018CRISPRCas9). Its role is vital in maintaining immune homeostasis by preventing excessive inflammation and cell lysis, which could result from uncontrolled complement activation (Thielen2018CRISPRCas9).

In addition to its regulatory role in the complement system, CD55 also acts as a ligand for the CD97 receptor, facilitating cell adhesion processes (Hamann1996The). This interaction underscores its involvement in cellular communication and immune response regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CD55 gene, also known as decay-accelerating factor (DAF), are associated with several clinical conditions, most notably CHAPLE syndrome (CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy). This ultra-rare genetic disorder is caused by loss-of-function variants in the CD55 gene, leading to overactivation of the complement system. Patients with CHAPLE syndrome experience severe gastrointestinal symptoms, protein-losing enteropathy, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and increased risk of thromboembolic events. Symptoms often manifest in infancy or early childhood and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality (Ozen2024Evaluating; Ozen2017CD55).

The deficiency in CD55 results in excessive complement activation, causing damage to intestinal lymphatics and contributing to conditions like primary intestinal lymphangiectasia and thrombosis. The disease can progress to severe complications such as gastrointestinal obstruction and perforation (Kurolap2022CD55deficiency; Ozen2024Evaluating). Treatment with complement inhibitors like eculizumab and pozelimab has shown promise in managing symptoms by reducing complement activation and improving clinical outcomes (Kurolap2019Eculizumab; Ozen2024Evaluating).

CD55 deficiency is also linked to autoimmune hemocytopenias, where reduced expression of CD55 and CD59 leads to increased susceptibility to complement-mediated cell destruction (RuizArgüelles2007The). In some populations, specific CD55 variants, such as the c.596C>T variant in Bukharan Jews, are prevalent and contribute to the clinical manifestations of CD55 deficiency (Kurolap2022CD55deficiency).

## Interactions
CD55, also known as decay-accelerating factor (DAF), is involved in several protein interactions that regulate the complement system and influence cell adhesion. CD55 interacts with components of the alternative pathway of the complement system, such as C3b and factor B, to inhibit the formation and stability of C3/C5 convertases. This interaction is crucial for preventing excessive complement activation and protecting self-cells from damage. CD55 binds to C3b, factor B, and the Bb subunit with varying affinities, which are enhanced in the presence of Mg2+ (Harris2005Molecular).

CD55 also interacts with CD97, a seven-span transmembrane receptor found on leukocytes. This interaction involves the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains of CD97 and the short consensus repeat (SCR) domains of CD55. The binding is calcium-dependent and requires at least three tandemly linked EGF domains in CD97 for effective interaction with CD55 (Hamann1996The; Hamann1998Characterization). The structural basis of this interaction has been elucidated, showing an antiparallel binding mode involving the SCR 1-3 domains of CD55 and the EGF domains of CD97 (Niu2021Structural). These interactions are significant in various physiological processes and disease pathogenesis, including inflammatory responses and immune regulation.
