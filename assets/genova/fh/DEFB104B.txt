# DEFB104B

## Overview
DEFB104B is a gene that encodes the protein defensin beta 104B, which is part of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides play a crucial role in the innate immune system by providing a first line of defense against a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Defensin beta 104B is categorized as an antimicrobial peptide and is known for its ability to disrupt microbial membranes, thereby exerting its antimicrobial effects. The expression of DEFB104B is regulated by various factors, including inflammatory cytokines and microbial components, which can influence its role in host defense mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
