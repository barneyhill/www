# DLX4

## Overview
DLX4, or distal-less homeobox 4, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox family, which is crucial for various developmental and cellular processes. The protein encoded by DLX4 is involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly in craniofacial morphogenesis and limb formation, as well as in hematopoiesis (Levi2022DLX; Tan2021DLX). As a transcription factor, DLX4 plays a pivotal role in cellular differentiation and proliferation, influencing pathways such as the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) during the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Tamaoki2014The). Beyond its developmental roles, DLX4 is implicated in various cancers, where it can modulate tumor progression and response to therapy through interactions with other proteins and DNA repair mechanisms (Tan2021DLX; Trinh2015The).

## Function
DLX4 (distal-less homeobox 4) is a transcription factor involved in various developmental processes in healthy human cells. It is part of the DLX gene family, which plays significant roles in craniofacial development, limb formation, and hematopoiesis. DLX4 is expressed in the mesenchyme of murine palatal shelves during embryonic development, indicating its involvement in craniofacial morphogenesis (Levi2022DLX; Tan2021DLX). 

In the context of hematopoiesis, DLX4 expression increases during megakaryopoiesis and decreases during erythropoiesis, suggesting a role in regulating the balance between these lineages. It induces IL1β production, activating NF-κB signaling, which promotes a megakaryocytic transcriptional program (Tan2021DLX). 

DLX4 is also implicated in the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). It enhances reprogramming efficiency by promoting mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), a crucial step in iPSC generation, and can functionally replace c-MYC in this process (Tamaoki2014The). 

Although DLX4 is expressed at low levels in most adult tissues, its role in developmental processes suggests it may have regulatory functions beyond transcription, potentially participating in molecular complexes in the cytoplasm (Levi2022DLX).

## Clinical Significance
DLX4 plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and interactions influencing disease progression and treatment outcomes. In breast cancer, high DLX4 expression is associated with poor response to topoisomerase II-targeting chemotherapy. This is due to DLX4's interaction with Ku proteins, which promotes DNA repair and reduces drug sensitivity. DLX4 also facilitates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through TWIST, enhancing cancer cell migration (Tan2021DLX).

In ovarian cancer, elevated DLX4 expression correlates with poor survival. It promotes angiogenesis and tumor-mesothelial cell interactions via CD44 induction, linked to increased NF-κB activity (Tan2021DLX). DLX4 also induces inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression through a STAT1-dependent pathway, contributing to increased tumor microvessel density (Trinh2015The).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), DLX4 isoforms BP1 and DLX7 have opposing roles. BP1 acts as an oncogene, enhancing cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, while DLX7 functions as a tumor suppressor, reducing proliferation and tumor load (Zhou2022DNA).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), high DLX4 expression is linked to advanced tumor stage and poor survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker (Wang2023Identification).

## Interactions
DLX4 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It interacts with the transcription factor STAT1, enhancing its expression and activity. This interaction is evidenced by increased levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and its nuclear localization in cells expressing DLX4. Immunoprecipitation assays have confirmed the physical interaction between DLX4 and STAT1, which is crucial for the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, promoting angiogenesis in ovarian cancer (Trinh2015The).

DLX4 also interacts with Ku70 and Ku80, proteins involved in DNA repair, to stimulate DNA-PK activity and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated DNA repair. This interaction helps protect tumor cells from DNA damage caused by chemotherapeutic agents (Trinh2015The). In breast cancer, DLX4 binds to the TWIST gene promoter, promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through TWIST (Tan2021DLX).

DLX4's role in transcriptional regulation is further supported by its ability to bind DNA and upregulate transcription from conserved intergenic sequences, as demonstrated in studies involving other Dlx proteins (Zerucha2000A).
