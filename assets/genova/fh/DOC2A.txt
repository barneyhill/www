# DOC2A

## Overview
DOC2A, or double C2 domain alpha, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release in neurons. The protein belongs to the Doc2 family, characterized by the presence of two C2 domains, which are typically associated with calcium-dependent phospholipid binding. However, DOC2A uniquely modulates synaptic transmission through a calcium-independent mechanism, distinguishing it from other calcium sensors (Pang2011Doc2). Functionally, DOC2A plays a critical presynaptic role in maintaining synaptic activity by supporting the supply of vesicles necessary for spontaneous exocytosis (Pang2011Doc2). The gene is also implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, due to its location within the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, which is known for copy number variations associated with these conditions (AlQattan2015The; Pang2011Doc2). Additionally, DOC2A interacts with Rab27a, a small GTPase involved in vesicular transport, highlighting its role in cellular processes related to vesicle trafficking and exocytosis (Sahid2021Inhibition).

## Function
DOC2A is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release in neurons. It is part of the Doc2 protein family, which includes Doc2A, Doc2B, and Doc2C, and is characterized by the presence of two C2 domains. These domains are typically known for their calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding properties, but in the case of DOC2A, the protein modulates spontaneous synaptic transmission through a calcium-independent mechanism (Pang2011Doc2). 

DOC2A plays a presynaptic role in modulating spontaneous neurotransmitter release, particularly in excitatory synapses. Knockdown experiments have shown that reducing DOC2A expression significantly decreases spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory minirelease, indicating its crucial role in maintaining synaptic activity (Pang2011Doc2). Despite its structural similarity to calcium sensors, DOC2A does not function as a primary calcium sensor for neurotransmitter release. Instead, it appears to act as a structural support element, maintaining the supply of vesicles necessary for spontaneous exocytosis (Pang2011Doc2).

The DOC2A gene is also noted for its involvement in 16p11.2 copy number variations associated with autism, suggesting its potential relevance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Pang2011Doc2).

## Clinical Significance
The DOC2A gene has been implicated in several neurological disorders due to its role in synaptic function. Alterations in the DOC2A gene, particularly copy number variations at the 16p11.2 chromosomal region, have been associated with autism spectrum disorders. This region includes DOC2A among other genes, and its duplication or deletion can lead to neurodevelopmental issues (AlQattan2015The; Pang2011Doc2). 

In a study involving a child with a de novo 16p11.2 duplication, which includes DOC2A, the child exhibited severe developmental delays and seizure disorders, although no direct pathogenic mutations in DOC2A were identified (Bedoyan2010Duplication). This suggests that while DOC2A is located in a region associated with these conditions, the exact contribution of DOC2A mutations or expression changes to these phenotypes remains unclear.

Additionally, research has shown that DOC2A is associated with brain volume variations, particularly in white matter, which may have implications for brain-related disorders, although specific diseases were not directly linked in the study (Wightman2024Rare). These findings highlight the potential clinical significance of DOC2A in neurological and developmental disorders.

## Interactions
DOC2A (double C2 domain alpha) is known to interact with Rab27a, a member of the Rab family of small GTPases, which are involved in vesicular transport processes. This interaction is significant in the context of mast cell activation and exocytosis. In a study examining the effects of zoledronate on histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells, it was found that the interaction between Rab27a and DOC2a was not affected by zoledronate treatment. This suggests that the physical interaction between these proteins is stable under the conditions tested, even when histamine release is inhibited (Sahid2021Inhibition).

The interaction between Rab27a and DOC2a is enhanced upon stimulation with DNP, as indicated by an increase in the number of red spots per cell, which are markers of this interaction. However, the presence of zoledronate did not significantly alter this interaction in DNP-activated cells, reinforcing the idea that DOC2A's interaction with Rab27a is not influenced by zoledronate (Sahid2021Inhibition). This interaction is crucial for understanding the role of DOC2A in cellular processes related to vesicle trafficking and exocytosis.
