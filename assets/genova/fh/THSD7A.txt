# THSD7A

## Overview
THSD7A, or thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7A, is a gene that encodes a large extracellular protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in endothelial cells. The THSD7A protein is characterized by multiple thrombospondin type 1 repeats and is categorized as a membrane-associated N-glycoprotein. It plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis, which are vital for vascular development and maintenance. Additionally, THSD7A is significant in kidney function, where it contributes to the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier and is a target for autoantibodies in membranous nephropathy, an autoimmune kidney disease. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as the actin cytoskeleton and integrins, underscore its involvement in cytoskeletal reorganization and cellular dynamics (Reinhard2021Characterization; Flockerzi2023THSD7A).

## Structure
The THSD7A protein is a large extracellular protein encoded by the THSD7A gene, consisting of 1,657 amino acids. It features several distinct domains and motifs, including an amino-terminal signal peptide, at least ten thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs), an RGD site, six tryptophan-rich (WSXW) sequences, a CD36-binding motif, a putative transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain (Wang2009Thrombospondin). The protein's extracellular segment contains 21 predicted thrombospondin repeat domains, with the highest autoimmune response associated with the two N-terminal domains, d1 and d2 (Bochel2023Structure).

The N-terminal didomain d1_d2 of THSD7A exhibits a V-shaped arrangement with a well-defined C-terminal tip and N-terminal tip, connected by conserved disulfide bridges. This structure is characterized by a conserved W(K/R)(L/T)GPW motif and a seven-layered structure defined by conserved disulfide bridges (Bochel2023Structure). The d1 and d2 domains have a distorted type 1-1 TSR fold, leading to their classification as type 1A TSRs (Bochel2023Structure).

THSD7A is subject to alternative splicing, producing nine different mRNAs, including seven alternatively spliced variants and two unspliced forms. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, three major protein variants of 100, 88, and 78 kDa have been detected, suggesting alternative splicing or post-translational processing (Wang2009Thrombospondin). The protein is also glycosylated, which is a common post-translational modification (Bochel2023Structure).

## Function
THSD7A (thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7A) is a protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and migration processes, particularly in endothelial cells. It is involved in angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels, a critical process for vascular development and maintenance. The protein is hypothesized to be a membrane-associated N-glycoprotein, with a soluble form that can promote endothelial cell migration, tube formation, and sprouting, all essential for angiogenesis (Flockerzi2023THSD7A).

In the context of kidney function, THSD7A is implicated in maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier, contributing to proper kidney function. It is one of the target antigens for autoantibodies in membranous nephropathy, an autoimmune disease affecting the kidneys (Reinhard2021Characterization). The protein localizes to the slit diaphragm of podocytes, where it stabilizes membrane dynamics, which is crucial for the filtration function of the kidneys (Herwig2019Thrombospondin).

THSD7A's role in healthy human cells is primarily associated with its involvement in vascular and kidney functions, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal physiological processes related to blood vessel formation and kidney filtration.

## Clinical Significance
THSD7A is clinically significant due to its association with membranous nephropathy (MN), an autoimmune kidney disease. Autoantibodies against THSD7A can lead to podocyte injury, resulting in proteinuria and the development of MN. These antibodies bind to THSD7A expressed on podocytes, causing cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell detachment, which are characteristic of MN pathology (Tomas2016Autoantibodies). The presence of THSD7A autoantibodies is particularly noted in patients who are seronegative for anti-PLA2R1 antibodies, and the prevalence of THSD7A-related MN varies by ethnicity, being more common in Asian populations (Pozdzik2018Membranous).

THSD7A is also implicated in certain cancers, such as lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In LSCC, THSD7A positivity is associated with poor survival outcomes in female patients and is linked to high expression of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK), suggesting a role in tumor progression and metastasis. THSD7A might activate FAK-dependent signaling pathways, making it a potential therapeutic target in LSCC (Flockerzi2023THSD7A). The expression of THSD7A by tumor cells may also prime the production of anti-THSD7A antibodies, leading to immune complex formation in the kidneys, which further links THSD7A to malignancies (Pozdzik2018Membranous).

## Interactions
THSD7A (thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7A) is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with paxillin-associated protein with ARFGAP activity 3 (PAG3) through its carboxyl-terminal region, which may sequester paxillin activity and hinder its recruitment to focal adhesions, affecting cytoskeletal reorganization (Wang2009Thrombospondin). THSD7A is also associated with the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge of migrating endothelial cells and co-localizes with αVβ3 integrin and paxillin in focal adhesions. This interaction suggests that THSD7A may inhibit endothelial cell migration by interacting with the αVβ3-paxillin focal complex, potentially masking αVβ3 integrins and preventing their interaction with extracellular signals (Wang2009Thrombospondin).

In the context of membranous nephropathy, THSD7A is a target for autoantibodies, which bind to the protein on the cell surface, leading to cytoskeletal changes and cell detachment. This interaction is significant in the pathogenesis of the disease, as it disrupts podocyte integrity and contributes to proteinuria (Tomas2016Autoantibodies). These interactions highlight THSD7A's role in cell adhesion, migration, and disease mechanisms.
