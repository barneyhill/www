# TIPRL

## Overview
The TIPRL gene encodes the TOR signaling pathway regulator-like protein, a critical component in cellular signaling networks. This protein functions primarily as a regulator of protein phosphatase activity, particularly targeting PP2A, PP4, and PP6, and plays a pivotal role in modulating the mTOR signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth, proliferation, and survival (Sun2022Research; Scorsato2016Crystal). Structurally, TIPRL is characterized by a unique fold with a central core of antiparallel beta-sheets, facilitating its interaction with other molecules (Scorsato2016Crystal). Functionally, TIPRL acts as a negative regulator of phosphatase activity, influencing various cellular processes, including autophagy and stress responses (Jeon2019TIPRL; Sun2022Research). Its involvement in cancer biology is significant, as alterations in TIPRL expression are associated with different cancer types, impacting tumor progression and resistance to therapies (Luan2020TIPRL; Jun2019The).

## Structure
The human TIPRL protein exhibits a unique molecular structure characterized by a novel fold. Its tertiary structure is organized around a central core of antiparallel beta-sheets, which are covered by a smaller five-strand beta-sheet and two alpha-helices. This configuration forms a cleft that is crucial for its function (Scorsato2016Crystal). The N-terminal region of TIPRL includes an α/β region, while the C-terminal region shows structural disorder (Scorsato2016Crystal).

The protein's surface is predominantly negatively charged, with positively charged residues concentrated in the cleft, facilitating interactions with other molecules (Scorsato2016Crystal). TIPRL contains a specific binding site for the PP2Ac C-terminus, which is highly conserved and located in the C-terminal half of the protein (Scorsato2016Crystal). This site is characterized by alternating hydrophobic and positively charged residues, stabilizing the interaction primarily through hydrophobic interactions (Scorsato2016Crystal).

TIPRL can form dimers under specific conditions, although it is likely a monomer in physiological settings (Scorsato2016Crystal). The protein's interaction with PP2Ac is influenced by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation and methylation, which regulate binding affinity (Scorsato2016Crystal).

## Function
The TIPRL gene encodes the TOR signaling pathway regulator-like protein, which plays a significant role in regulating protein phosphatase activity, particularly PP2A, PP4, and PP6, in healthy human cells. TIPRL acts as a negative regulator of phosphatase activity, inhibiting the catalytic subunits of these phosphatases. This inhibition is crucial for modulating the mTOR signaling pathway, which is involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival (Sun2022Research; Scorsato2016Crystal).

TIPRL interacts with the C-terminus of the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), affecting the assembly and recycling of PP2A holoenzyme complexes. This interaction is essential for maintaining the stability and function of PP2A, which is a major regulator of several cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and apoptosis (Scorsato2016Crystal).

In addition to its role in phosphatase regulation, TIPRL is involved in the cellular response to stress conditions, such as DNA damage. It modulates the phosphorylation of eIF2α, which is crucial for the activation of autophagy-related genes, thereby promoting autophagy under metabolic stress (Jeon2019TIPRL). TIPRL's activity is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular responses to nutrient availability and stress, impacting processes like autophagy and metabolism (Sun2022Research).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TIPRL gene have been implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In HCC, TIPRL is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, contributing to tumor aggressiveness and resistance to treatments like TRAIL and sorafenib. It is linked to markers of autophagy and cancer stem cells, which are involved in chemo- and radio-resistance (Jun2019The).

In gastric cancer, TIPRL acts as a tumor suppressor, with decreased expression correlating with advanced disease stages and poor clinical outcomes. Its downregulation is associated with increased cell migration and invasion, mediated through the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (Luan2020TIPRL).

In NSCLC, TIPRL is upregulated and enhances cancer cell survival by promoting autophagy through the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway. This upregulation is linked to higher malignancy stages and provides metabolic advantages to cancer cells, suggesting TIPRL as a potential therapeutic target (Jeon2019TIPRL).

Overall, TIPRL's role in cancer involves its regulation of key signaling pathways that affect cell survival, proliferation, and resistance to therapies.

## Interactions
TIPRL interacts with several proteins, primarily acting as an inhibitor of protein phosphatases such as PP2A, PP4, and PP6. This interaction is significant in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the mTOR signaling pathway and apoptosis inhibition (Scorsato2016Crystal). TIPRL binds to the catalytic subunit of PP2A, occupying its active site and potentially blocking its phosphatase activity, which affects the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (Scorsato2016Crystal; Luan2020TIPRL). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma cells, TIPRL forms a complex with MKK7 and PP2Ac, inhibiting the phosphorylation of JNK and blocking the apoptosis cascade initiated by TRAIL (LEE2014Tussilago). TIPRL's interaction with PP2A is also crucial in gastric cancer, where it suppresses cell migration and invasion by modulating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (Luan2020TIPRL).

In lung cancer, TIPRL interacts with the eIF2α-ATF4 pathway, regulating autophagy and providing a survival advantage to cancer cells under stress. TIPRL induces eIF2α phosphorylation, which is independent of its interaction with PP2A (Jeon2019TIPRL). These interactions highlight TIPRL's role in various cancer types, influencing cell survival, migration, and resistance to therapies.
