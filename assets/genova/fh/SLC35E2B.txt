# SLC35E2B

## Overview
SLC35E2B is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member E2B, which is part of the solute carrier (SLC) family. This family is known for its role in the transport of various molecules across cellular membranes. The SLC35E2B protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter, suggesting its involvement in the movement of specific substrates across the lipid bilayer, although the precise substrates and physiological roles remain to be fully elucidated. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research to better understand their functions and potential implications in human health and disease.
