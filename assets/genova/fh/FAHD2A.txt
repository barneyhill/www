# FAHD2A

## Overview
FAHD2A is a gene that encodes the protein fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase domain containing 2A, which is a member of the 'FAA hydrolase' protein family. This protein is primarily localized in the mitochondria and plays a significant role in cellular metabolic processes, particularly in the enol-keto tautomerization of oxaloacetate (OAA). This enzymatic activity is crucial for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as it helps convert the inhibitory enol form of OAA to its keto form, thereby supporting efficient aerobic respiration. The FAHD2A protein is also implicated in the function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain by participating in metabolite repair, specifically by eliminating enol-OAA, which can inhibit succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a key enzyme in the TCA cycle (Zmuda2024A). Despite its involvement in these essential processes, the precise role of FAHD2A in healthy human cells is not yet fully understood (Zmuda2024A).

## Function
FAHD2A is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular metabolic processes, particularly within the mitochondria. The FAHD2A protein is part of the 'FAA hydrolase' protein family, which is structurally conserved across various species. It is localized in the mitochondria and is involved in the enol-keto tautomerization of oxaloacetate (OAA), a critical process for maintaining the balance of OAA forms in cells. This activity is crucial for supporting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as it converts inhibitory enol-OAA to its keto form, thereby facilitating efficient aerobic respiration (Zmuda2024A).

FAHD2A, along with other FAHD proteins, has been linked to the function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. It plays a role in metabolite repair by eliminating enol-OAA, which inhibits succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a key enzyme in the TCA cycle. This function is essential for maintaining the efficiency of the TCA cycle and overall cellular respiration (Zmuda2024A). Despite its involvement in these critical processes, the specific function of FAHD2A in healthy human cells remains not fully characterized (Zmuda2024A).
