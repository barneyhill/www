# LGALS1

## Overview
The LGALS1 gene encodes the protein galectin-1, a member of the galectin family known for its carbohydrate-binding properties. Galectin-1 is characterized by its ability to bind β-galactosides through a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which is integral to its function in various biological processes (Camby2006Galectin1:). As a multifunctional protein, galectin-1 plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, migration, and immune modulation, influencing processes such as tissue regeneration, immune response, and tumor progression (Liesenhoff2023Endogenous; van2004Dimeric). The protein's structure allows it to form non-covalent homodimers, enhancing its binding capabilities and functional interactions with other cellular components (López-Lucendo2004Growth-regulatory). Galectin-1's involvement in pathological conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases, underscores its clinical significance and potential as a therapeutic target (Pál2010A; Spano2009Galectin1).

## Structure
Galectin-1, encoded by the LGALS1 gene, is a protein characterized by its ability to bind β-galactosides. The primary structure of galectin-1 consists of 135 amino acids, forming a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) crucial for its extracellular activity (Camby2006Galectin1:; Barrientos2013Involvement). The secondary structure of galectin-1 features a β-sandwich fold composed of two antiparallel β-sheets, a common motif among galectins (Camby2006Galectin1:; López-Lucendo2004Growth-regulatory). 

In its tertiary structure, galectin-1 forms a globular shape, with a hydrophobic core that contributes to its stability (Camby2006Galectin1:). The quaternary structure of galectin-1 can exist as a non-covalent homodimer, with the dimeric form being stabilized by interactions between monomers at the interface (Camby2006Galectin1:; López-Lucendo2004Growth-regulatory). 

Galectin-1 can undergo post-translational modifications, such as oxidation, which affects its lectin activity (López-Lucendo2004Growth-regulatory). The protein's structure includes key residues that interact with carbohydrates through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, contributing to its binding specificity (Camby2006Galectin1:).

## Function
Galectin-1, encoded by the LGALS1 gene, is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. It plays a significant role in cell migration and adhesion, particularly in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Galectin-1 promotes cell migration and reduces cell adhesion, which is crucial for tissue regeneration and pathological processes (Liesenhoff2023Endogenous). It also maintains cellular homeostasis and the epithelial phenotype of RPE cells, influencing cell proliferation and viability. The absence of galectin-1 results in reduced cell proliferation and viability, increased cell adhesion, and a shift towards a more mesenchymal phenotype (Liesenhoff2023Endogenous).

Galectin-1 is involved in modulating immune responses by promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine production, such as IL-10, and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-γ. This immunomodulatory effect is crucial for maintaining immune tolerance and preventing excessive immune responses (van2004Dimeric). In the context of reproduction, galectin-1 is essential for maternal adaptation to pregnancy, supporting trophoblast differentiation and placental development. It modulates the immune environment to prevent fetal rejection and supports the formation of regulatory T cells (Barrientos2013Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LGALS1 gene, which encodes galectin-1, have been implicated in various diseases. In reproductive health, galectin-1 is dysregulated in pre-eclampsia, with decreased expression in early onset and increased expression in late onset cases. This suggests different etiologies for these subtypes, and low circulating levels of galectin-1 in the second trimester are associated with the later development of pre-eclampsia, indicating its potential as a biomarker (Barrientos2013Involvement).

In cancer, galectin-1 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it is associated with increased metastasis and tumor aggressiveness. Its expression is higher in the stroma of cirrhotic and HCC tissues compared to normal liver tissues, contributing to enhanced cell migration and invasion (Spano2009Galectin1). In gliomas, high galectin-1 expression correlates with tumor grade and may influence tumor astrocyte migration, impacting the invasive behavior of these tumors (Rorive2001Galectin1).

In autoimmune conditions, specific polymorphisms in LGALS1 are associated with autoimmune myasthenia gravis, suggesting that alterations in its expression or interactions may contribute to this condition (Pál2010A). In rheumatoid arthritis, reduced galectin-1 levels in synovial fluid due to anti-Gal-1 autoantibodies are linked to disease severity (MendezHuergo2019Clinical).

## Interactions
Galectin-1, encoded by the LGALS1 gene, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing cell adhesion, migration, and immune responses. It binds to extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as laminin (LN) and fibronectin (FN), affecting cell adhesion in a context-dependent manner. Galectin-1 can inhibit the adhesion of activated T-cells to ECM components by interacting with the actin cytoskeleton and integrins on smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (Elola2007Galectins:). It also interacts with the glycoprotein 90K/Mac-2 binding protein (90K/Mac-2BP), inducing homotypic aggregation in cells like A375 human melanoma cells (Elola2007Galectins:).

In immune regulation, galectin-1 modulates T-cell homeostasis by binding to specific glycoreceptors, triggering pro-apoptotic signaling pathways, and influencing cytokine production and proliferation (Di2011When). It also affects T-cell signaling in the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs (Rabinovich2009Conveying). Galectin-1's interactions with cell surface glycoproteins are crucial for its function, and its dimeric form is necessary for effective binding and signaling (Di2011When). Additionally, galectin-1 interacts with nucleic acids, affecting RNA splicing and stability (Rabinovich2009Conveying).
