# ATP1B1

## Overview
ATP1B1 is a gene that encodes the beta-1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a transmembrane protein complex essential for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium and potassium ions across the plasma membrane. This protein plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and regulation of cell volume (Prasad2013A). The beta-1 subunit, specifically, is crucial for the structural stability and functional regulation of the Na+/K+ ATPase, facilitating its assembly with the catalytic alpha subunit (Selvakumar2014Epigenetic). Beyond its fundamental role in ion transport, ATP1B1 is involved in cellular adhesion and signaling, impacting processes such as blood pressure regulation and renal function (Xiao2009Association). The gene's clinical significance is highlighted by its association with conditions like hypertension and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where its expression and regulation are critical determinants of disease progression (Faruque2011Association; Selvakumar2014Epigenetic).

## Structure
The ATP1B1 gene encodes the beta-1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a membrane protein essential for ion transport and cellular homeostasis. The beta-1 subunit is characterized by a primary structure consisting of a sequence of amino acids that form a single transmembrane helix and a large extracellular domain. The secondary structure includes an Ig-like β-sandwich configuration in the extracellular region, which is crucial for its function in cell adhesion (Clausen2017The; RamírezSalinas2024In).

The tertiary structure of the beta-1 subunit involves the folding of its extracellular domain, which includes three conserved disulfide bonds that contribute to the protein's stability (Clausen2017The; Kirley1989Determination). The quaternary structure is defined by its assembly with the alpha subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, forming a functional enzyme complex (Geering2001ThefunctionalroleofβsubunitsinoligomericPtypeATPases).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation are present, with three glycosylation sites identified in the beta-1 subunit, which are important for its stability and function (Clausen2017The). The beta-1 subunit can also undergo glutathionylation in response to oxidative stress, specifically at a cysteine residue in its transmembrane helix (Clausen2017The).

## Function
The ATP1B1 gene encodes the β1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, a crucial enzyme for maintaining the electrochemical gradients of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions across the plasma membrane. This enzyme is essential for various cellular processes, including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, and regulation of cell volume (Prasad2013A). The Na+/K+ ATPase is composed of two essential subunits: the catalytic α-subunit and the regulatory β1-subunit, with the latter being encoded by ATP1B1. The β1-subunit is vital for the proper assembly and function of the Na+/K+ ATPase, ensuring its structural stability and activity (Xiao2009Association; Selvakumar2014Epigenetic).

In epithelial cells, particularly in the kidney, the Na+/K+ ATPase plays a significant role in maintaining Na+ and K+ gradients, which are critical for the directional transport of solutes across the epithelial cell layer, known as vectorial transport (Selvakumar2014Epigenetic). The β1-subunit is also involved in blood pressure regulation through its role in sodium reabsorption in renal epithelia and its function as a signal transducer in cardiac myocytes (Xiao2009Association). The proper function of the Na+/K+ ATPase is essential for kidney function and overall cellular homeostasis (Selvakumar2014Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ATP1B1 gene, which encodes the β1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, have been linked to several clinical conditions, particularly those affecting blood pressure regulation. Variants in the ATP1B1 gene are associated with hypertension, as demonstrated in various populations. For instance, a polymorphic element in the 3'UTR of ATP1B1 affects alternative polyadenylation, influencing blood pressure by altering mRNA processing. The T12 GT3 GT6 allele is associated with increased polyadenylation at the A2 site, leading to higher expression of ATP1B1 mRNA and elevated blood pressure in European-American populations (Prasad2013A). In African-Americans, the ATP1B1 variant rs2901029 has been significantly associated with systolic blood pressure, highlighting the gene's role in hypertension (Faruque2011Association).

In addition to hypertension, ATP1B1 is implicated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The gene is epigenetically silenced in ccRCC through promoter hypermethylation, leading to reduced expression of the Na,K-β subunit, which acts as a tumor suppressor. This silencing is associated with oncogenic transformation and increased tumor aggressiveness (Selvakumar2014Epigenetic). These findings underscore the clinical significance of ATP1B1 in both cardiovascular and oncological contexts.

## Interactions
ATP1B1, the beta-1 subunit of the Na+/K+ ATPase, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function and regulation. It interacts with Neuronal Growth Regulator 1 (NEGR1), a GPI-anchored membrane protein, through their C-terminal regions. This interaction is significant for intercellular interactions and is confirmed by various assays, including size-exclusion chromatography and proximity ligation assays. NEGR1 and ATP1B1 co-localize in membrane lipid rafts, suggesting a role in neural cell adhesion and communication (Cheon2021NaKATPase).

ATP1B1 also interacts with DCF1, a protein that influences astrocyte morphology via the P38 signaling pathway. This interaction is crucial for maintaining normal astrocyte structure, and DCF1 deficiency leads to increased ATP1B1 expression, affecting astrocyte morphology and glutamate release (Wang2018Interaction).

Additionally, ATP1B1 interacts with the human cytomegalovirus UL136 protein. This interaction, demonstrated through GST-pull-down assays and immunofluorescent co-localization, suggests a role in viral infection processes, such as cell-to-cell spread and maintaining ion homeostasis during infection (Cui2011Interaction). These interactions highlight ATP1B1's involvement in various cellular functions and its potential impact on neurological and viral-related conditions.
