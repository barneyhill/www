# DAZAP2

## Overview
DAZAP2, or Deleted in Azoospermia Associated Protein 2, is a gene that encodes a small adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and protein stability regulation. The DAZAP2 protein, characterized by its proline-rich region and SH2 and SH3 domain-binding motifs, plays a crucial role in modulating transcriptional activities, particularly within the Wnt signaling pathway, by interacting with transcription factors such as TCF-4 (SHI2007Molecular; Shi2004The; Lukas2009Dazap2). It is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but can translocate to the nucleus in response to specific cellular signals, such as DNA damage, where it interacts with key proteins like p53 and HIPK2 to influence cell death responses and cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs (Liebl2021DAZAP2). DAZAP2's involvement in protein interactions, such as with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1, underscores its role in ubiquitination pathways and protein degradation (Liebl2021DAZAP2). Additionally, alterations in DAZAP2 expression have been linked to multiple myeloma, highlighting its clinical significance in cancer pathogenesis and therapy (SHI2007Molecular; Luo2012The).

## Structure
The DAZAP2 protein is a small adaptor protein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 17 kDa, consisting of 168 amino acids (SHI2007Molecular; Shi2004The). It contains a proline-rich region and several potential SH2 (Yxxψ) and SH3 (PxψP) domain-binding motifs, which suggest its involvement in signal transduction pathways (SHI2007Molecular; Shi2004The). The protein is highly conserved among vertebrates, particularly at the C-terminus, indicating the presence of important functional domains (Shi2004The).

DAZAP2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, exhibiting a punctuated distribution pattern, as shown by confocal microscopy studies (SHI2007Molecular; Shi2004The). It is also known to shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus, particularly in response to DNA damage, where it interacts with proteins such as p53 and HIPK2 (Liebl2021DAZAP2).

Post-translational modifications of DAZAP2 include phosphorylation by HIPK2 at multiple sites, such as Ser77, which is crucial for its role in regulating protein interactions and subcellular localization (Liebl2021DAZAP2). The protein's interaction with HIPK2 and SIAH1 suggests a role in regulating protein stability through ubiquitination pathways (Liebl2021DAZAP2). However, specific details on the secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, as well as splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
DAZAP2 (DAZ associated protein 2) is a small, evolutionarily conserved protein involved in various cellular processes. It interacts with the TCF-4 transcription factor, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, modulating transcription driven by TCF-4. This interaction influences the expression of Wnt-signaling target genes, which are crucial for cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (Lukas2009Dazap2).

DAZAP2 is also involved in regulating protein stability through its interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1, facilitating the degradation of HIPK2, a kinase involved in DNA damage response. This process is proteasome-dependent and highlights DAZAP2's role in protein stability and degradation pathways (Liebl2021DAZAP2).

In the context of DNA damage, DAZAP2 modulates the p53 response by interacting with HIPK2 and p53, influencing the expression of p53 target genes. This interaction affects cell death responses and contributes to the regulation of cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs (Liebl2021DAZAP2).

DAZAP2 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but can relocate to the nucleus, particularly upon interaction with TCF-4 or in response to DNA damage, indicating its dynamic role in cellular signaling and transcription regulation (Lukas2009Dazap2; Liebl2021DAZAP2).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DAZAP2 gene have been implicated in multiple myeloma (MM), a cancer characterized by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. DAZAP2 is significantly downregulated in MM patients, both at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting its involvement in the disease's pathogenesis (SHI2007Molecular; Shi2004The). The downregulation of DAZAP2 in MM is associated with promoter hypermethylation, which suppresses its expression. This epigenetic modification is a key mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of MM, and demethylation therapies have been proposed as a potential treatment to restore DAZAP2 expression (Luo2012The).

DAZAP2 also plays a role in cancer cell sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs. It interacts with the tumor suppressor p53 and the kinase HIPK2, modulating the expression of p53 target genes. Alterations in DAZAP2 expression can enhance cancer cell chemosensitivity, suggesting its potential role in cancer therapy. In particular, DAZAP2 depletion increases sensitivity to drugs like 5-Fluorouracil, indicating its function as a chemoresistance factor (Liebl2021DAZAP2).

## Interactions
DAZAP2 (DAZ associated protein 2) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with IL17RB, binding to its cytoplasmic tail between amino acids 329 and 347, a process dependent on DAZAP2's SH2-binding domains. This interaction is regulated by Smurf2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates the proteasomal degradation of DAZAP2, suggesting a mechanism where Smurf2 controls IL17RB signaling by degrading DAZAP2 (Popova2012Smurf2).

DAZAP2 also interacts with the IL-25 receptor (IL-25R), where it acts as an inhibitory molecule. It binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the SEFIR domain of IL-25R, particularly Y355. This interaction inhibits the recruitment of ACT1 to IL-25R, and its degradation is necessary for proper IL-25 signaling, mediated by TRAF4 and SMURF2 (Zepp2015TRAF4SMURF2–Mediated).

In the context of Wnt signaling, DAZAP2 interacts with TCF-4, a member of the Tcf/Lef family, modulating transcription driven by TCF-4. This interaction results in the nuclear translocation of DAZAP2 and affects the expression of Wnt target genes (Lukas2009Dazap2).

DAZAP2 also plays a role in the DNA damage response by interacting with the tumor suppressor p53 and the kinase HIPK2. It regulates HIPK2 stability through interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase SIAH1, influencing p53 target gene expression and cancer cell sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs (Liebl2021DAZAP2).
