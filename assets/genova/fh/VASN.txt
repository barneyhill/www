# VASN

## Overview
Vasorin (VASN) is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane glycoprotein known as vasorin. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes leucine-rich repeat motifs, an epidermal growth factor-like domain, and a fibronectin type III-like domain, facilitating its role in protein-protein interactions (Ikeda2004Vasorin). Vasorin is primarily involved in modulating transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling, acting as a TGF-β-binding protein that inhibits TGF-β signaling pathways by reducing Smad2 phosphorylation (Bonnet2018From; Ikeda2004Vasorin). It is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and plays a crucial role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and response to injury (Ikeda2004Vasorin). Additionally, vasorin interacts with the Notch1 signaling pathway, influencing cellular differentiation and development (Bonnet2018From). The gene's expression and function have significant implications in various physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer progression and vascular development.

## Structure
Vasorin (VASN) is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of vasorin consists of 673 amino acids, featuring a hydrophobic signal sequence at the N-terminus (Ikeda2004Vasorin). The extracellular domain of vasorin includes ten tandem leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and a fibronectin type III-like domain, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions (Ikeda2004Vasorin). These motifs contribute to the secondary structure, likely forming alpha helices and beta sheets, although specific details on these structures are not provided.

The tertiary structure of vasorin involves the three-dimensional folding of these domains, allowing it to interact with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and modulate its signaling (Ikeda2004Vasorin). The quaternary structure is not explicitly detailed, but vasorin can exist as monomers or form homodimers in the plasma membrane, as shown by fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (Liang2024The).

Post-translational modifications include N-linked glycosylation, which increases the molecular mass of vasorin beyond its predicted size (Ikeda2004Vasorin). The presence of splice variant isoforms is not mentioned in the provided context.

## Function
Vasorin (VASN) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a significant role in modulating transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling, a pathway crucial for various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. VASN functions as a TGF-β-binding protein, directly interacting with TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, thereby inhibiting TGF-β signaling by reducing Smad2 phosphorylation and TGF-β-responsive reporter activation (Bonnet2018From; Ikeda2004Vasorin). This inhibition is achieved through the secretion of a soluble form of VASN, which acts as a ligand trap, preventing TGF-β from binding to its receptors (Malapeira2010ADAM17).

VASN is predominantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and is involved in maintaining the contractile phenotype of these cells, which is essential for vascular homeostasis and response to injury (Ikeda2004Vasorin). In healthy human cells, VASN is located at the cell-surface membrane and is involved in stabilizing Notch1 at the membrane, facilitating its cleavage and subsequent nuclear translocation to form a transcription complex (Bonnet2018From). This interaction with the Notch1 pathway suggests a role in cellular differentiation and development. VASN's activity in the extracellular matrix and its ability to modulate key signaling pathways highlight its importance in vascular development and tissue repair.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the VASN gene have been implicated in several cancers, including rectal cancer, glioma, and breast cancer. In rectal cancer, high VASN expression is associated with increased pulmonary metastasis and resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy, leading to a poorer prognosis and lower five-year survival rates. VASN interacts with the NOTCH1 protein, influencing the MAPK pathway, which is crucial in tumor progression (Kang2024Vasorin). In glioma, VASN is highly expressed in high-grade tumors and is linked to poor progression-free survival. It enhances the invasive ability of glioma cells and is associated with the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma multiforme, indicating its role in aggressive tumor characteristics (Liang2019Vasorin).

In breast cancer, VASN expression is lower in tumors compared to normal tissue, and its sialylation by the ST3Gal1 enzyme facilitates TGF-β1-mediated tumor angiogenesis and progression. Low VASN expression is linked to shorter relapse-free survival, particularly in patients with high-grade tumors (Yeo2019Sialylation). Additionally, VASN acts as a TGFβ trap, and its cleavage by ADAM17 is crucial for inhibiting TGFβ signaling, which is significant in tumor progression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Malapeira2010ADAM17).

## Interactions
Vasorin (VASN) is known to interact with several proteins, primarily through its role in modulating transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. VASN binds directly to TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3, acting as a TGF-β trap and inhibiting TGF-β-induced signaling pathways (Bonnet2018From; Ikeda2004Vasorin). This interaction is crucial in various physiological and pathological contexts, including vascular injury and tumor progression.

VASN is also a substrate for the metalloprotease ADAM17, which cleaves VASN to release its soluble form (sVASN). This cleavage is essential for the regulation of TGF-β signaling, as sVASN can inhibit TGF-β by preventing its interaction with its receptor (Malapeira2010ADAM17). The interaction between VASN and ADAM17 highlights the importance of proteolytic processing in modulating VASN's function.

In addition to its interactions with TGF-β and ADAM17, VASN is involved in the Notch1 signaling pathway. It competes with Numb for binding to Notch1, influencing the renewal and tumorigenic properties of glioblastoma stem cells (Bonnet2018From). VASN also interacts with the MAPK pathway, as its overexpression correlates with increased expression of ERK and p-ERK, suggesting a role in tumor proliferation and migration (Kang2024Vasorin).
