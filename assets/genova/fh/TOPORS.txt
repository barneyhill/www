# TOPORS

## Overview
TOPORS is a gene located on chromosome 9p21 that encodes the TOP1 binding arginine/serine rich protein, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This multifunctional protein is involved in various cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis, primarily through its interactions with key proteins such as p53 and topoisomerase I (Marshall2010Deficiency; Haluska1999Interaction). The protein is characterized by several conserved domains, including a RING domain essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity, and is subject to complex regulation through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (park2008identification). Clinically, mutations in the TOPORS gene are linked to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease, and the gene is also implicated in tumor suppression due to its role in maintaining genomic stability (Marshall2010Deficiency; Eid2024Autosomal).

## Structure
The TOPORS protein is encoded by the human TOPORS gene located on chromosome 9p21 and consists of 1045 amino acids with a molecular weight of 119 kDa (park2008identification). The protein features several conserved domains, including a RING domain located at amino acids 103-144, which is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (park2008identification). This domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin (park2008identification).

TOPORS also contains two bipartite nuclear localization sequences (residues 616-644), 33 RS/SR dipeptide repeats, and a C-terminal lysine-rich region (residues 880-895) (park2008identification). The protein includes 5 PEST domains, which are typically found in proteins that are rapidly degraded, and 6 consensus SUMO conjugation sites (park2008identification). The SR/RS dipeptide region is involved in interaction with SUMO1 and includes a SUMO1 acceptor site (Czub2016TOPORS).

Post-translational modifications of TOPORS include phosphorylation, which regulates its ubiquitin and SUMO E3 ligase activities. Phosphorylation at Ser98 enhances interaction with E2 enzymes, while phosphorylation at Ser499 near a conserved SUMO interacting motif may stabilize interaction with SUMO-1 (park2008identification). The protein's structure and modifications suggest a complex regulation of its ligase activities, impacting cellular processes such as cell cycle arrest and genomic stability (park2008identification).

## Function
The TOPORS gene encodes a multifunctional protein that acts as both an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a SUMO1 E3 ligase, playing a crucial role in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, TOPORS is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it is associated with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. It interacts with key proteins such as p53 and topoisomerase I, contributing to DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis (Marshall2010Deficiency; Haluska1999Interaction).

TOPORS is involved in the ubiquitination and sumoylation of several proteins, including p53, Sin3A, and NKX3.1, which links it to the regulation of transcription and chromatin organization (Sharif2011TOPORS). It plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and chromatin architecture, as evidenced by studies showing that its deficiency leads to increased genetic instability and malignancy (Ji2020TOPORS; Marshall2010Deficiency).

In the retina, TOPORS is identified as a cilia-centrosomal protein, localizing at the connecting cilium of photoreceptor cells. It is implicated in proteasomal degradation pathways and may influence signaling cascades such as Wnt and Hedgehog, which are partly regulated by ciliary function (Chakarova2010TOPORS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TOPORS gene are associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), a degenerative eye disease characterized by progressive vision loss. The prevalence of TOPORS mutations in adRP cases is approximately 1.68%, as identified in a cohort study of patients with inherited retinal disease (Eid2024Autosomal). Pathogenic truncating variants in TOPORS are specifically clustered between amino acid residues 807 to 867, suggesting a dominant-negative effect as the underlying mechanism of pathogenicity (Wang2022Autosomal). These mutations lead to defective retinal development and degeneration, as evidenced by studies in zebrafish and other models (Chakarova2010TOPORS).

In addition to its role in retinal degeneration, TOPORS is implicated in tumor suppression. Deficiency in TOPORS, which functions as a dual ubiquitin and SUMO E3 ligase, results in genetic instability and an increased rate of malignancy in mice. This is due to defects in chromosomal segregation and aneuploidy, rather than DNA repair (Marshall2010Deficiency). The gene's role in maintaining genomic stability and its involvement in chromatin regulation highlight its significance in preventing tumorigenesis (Marshall2010Deficiency).

## Interactions
TOPORS, a multifunctional protein, engages in various interactions with other proteins, playing significant roles in cellular processes. It interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-1 (Sdc-1), where Sdc-1 binds to TOPORS and inhibits its growth-promoting activities. This interaction is crucial for regulating smooth muscle cell proliferation and involves the sequence E493LVESSDSEELGPKYVE510 of TOPORS (Braun2012Inhibition).

TOPORS also interacts with human topoisomerase I (htop1), as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation studies in HeLa cells. This interaction suggests a role for TOPORS in recruiting htop1 to RNA polymerase II transcriptional complexes (Haluska1999Interaction).

In the retina, TOPORS interacts with the 26S protease regulatory subunit 4 (P26s4), encoded by the PSMC1 gene. This interaction is significant for proteostasis and may involve SUMOylation activities, affecting protein degradation processes (Czub2016TOPORS).

TOPORS is also associated with PML nuclear bodies and influences chromatin interactions, suggesting a role in maintaining chromatin architecture (Ji2020TOPORS). These interactions highlight the diverse functional roles of TOPORS in cellular regulation and maintenance.
