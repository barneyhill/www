a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor for members of the platelet-derived growth factor family. These growth factors are mitogens for cells of mesenchymal origin. The identity of the growth factor bound to a receptor monomer determines whether the functional receptor is a homodimer (PDGFB or PDGFD) or a heterodimer (PDGFA and PDGFB). This gene is essential for normal development of the cardiovascular system and aids in rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. This gene is flanked on chromosome 5 by the genes for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor; all three genes may be implicated in the 5-q syndrome. A translocation between chromosomes 5 and 12, that fuses this gene to that of the ETV6 gene, results in chronic myeloproliferative disorder with eosinophilia.
