# RANBP1

## Overview
RANBP1, or RAN binding protein 1, is a gene located on chromosome 22 at the 22q11.21 locus, encoding a protein that plays a pivotal role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic processes. The protein, categorized as a regulatory protein, is involved in the RAN GTPase cycle, facilitating the dissociation of RAN from importin/exportin complexes, which is essential for the transport of proteins and RNA across the nuclear envelope (Plafker2000Facilitated). RANBP1 is characterized by a Ran binding domain (RanBD) and a nuclear export signal (NES), which are crucial for its function and cytoplasmic localization (Richards1996A). The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as CRM1 and RanGTP, are vital for its role in mitotic spindle assembly and nuclear envelope reformation (Yau2020RanBP1). Alterations in RANBP1 expression have been linked to various cancers and genetic disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Audia2023RANBP1).

## Structure
RANBP1, also known as RAN binding protein 1, is a protein encoded by the RANBP1 gene located on chromosome 22 at the 22q11.21 locus. The protein is 203 amino acids long and contains a Ran binding domain (RanBD) that spans amino acids 27-160. This domain is crucial for its interaction with Ran-GTP, a small GTPase involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport (Audia2023RANBP1; Richards1996A). The RanBD of RANBP1 is structurally similar to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions and cell signaling (Audia2023RANBP1).

The COOH-terminal region of RANBP1, comprising the last 43 amino acids, contains a nuclear export signal (NES) essential for its cytoplasmic localization. This NES is identified as the sequence 178KVAEKLEALSVR189 and is necessary for the protein's export from the nucleus (Richards1996A). The NES facilitates the formation of a ternary complex with CRM1 and Ran:GTP, promoting nuclear export (Plafker2000Facilitated).

RANBP1 is involved in the regulation of the RAN GTPase cycle and plays a role in the disassembly of nuclear export complexes, particularly by interacting with CRM1 and RanGTP (Koyama2010An). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for its function in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic spindle assembly (Audia2023RANBP1).

## Function
RANBP1 (RAN binding protein 1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of the RAN GTPase cycle, which is essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitotic processes in human cells. It functions by facilitating the dissociation of RAN from importin/exportin complexes, thereby enabling the transport of proteins and RNA across the nuclear envelope (Plafker2000Facilitated). RANBP1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm due to a nuclear export signal (NES) in its COOH-terminal domain, which is essential for its cytosolic distribution (Richards1996A).

In the context of mitosis, RANBP1 is involved in spindle assembly by influencing the RAN-GTP gradient, which is critical for accurate chromosome segregation (Yau2020RanBP1). It controls the mobility of RCC1 on chromatin, maintaining the RAN-GTP gradients necessary for mitotic progression (Yau2020RanBP1). RANBP1 also plays a role in the reformation of the nucleus after mitosis, where its downregulation is necessary for proper nuclear envelope reassembly and nuclear pore complex formation (Ciciarello2010Nuclear).

RANBP1's activity is not limited to mitosis; it also regulates the interactions of transport receptors with their cargoes by disassembling stable receptor-RAN-GTP complexes, ensuring the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport (Bischoff1997RanBP1).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the RANBP1 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the SGK1-RANBP1 axis is associated with chemo- and radio-resistance, contributing to poor treatment outcomes (Audia2023RANBP1). In colorectal cancer (CRC), high RANBP1 expression correlates with poor prognosis and enhances cell proliferation and invasion by interacting with YAP and modulating the Hippo pathway (Audia2023RANBP1). In breast cancer, RANBP1 overexpression is linked to chromosomal instability and poor prognosis, affecting the efficacy of taxol by influencing microtubule stability and apoptosis (Audia2023RANBP1).

RANBP1 dysregulation is also associated with mitotic abnormalities, such as supernumerary centrosomes and multipolar spindles, which are common in cancer cells and contribute to tumor initiation and progression (Audia2023RANBP1). Beyond cancer, RANBP1 is located in a region commonly deleted in velo-cardio-facial syndrome (Di George syndrome), which can lead to heart defects and facial abnormalities (Audia2023RANBP1). Additionally, RANBP1 polymorphisms have been observed in individuals with schizophrenia-related eye tracking anomalies, although no direct association with schizophrenia risk has been established (Motahari2019In).

## Interactions
RANBP1 interacts with several proteins involved in the regulation of the RAN GTPase cycle, which is crucial for nucleocytoplasmic transport. It forms a complex with RanGTP, which is essential for the disassembly of RanGTP complexes with nuclear transport factors such as importin β, transportin, and CAS. This interaction facilitates the release of RanGTP, ensuring the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport (Bischoff1997RanBP1).

In fungi, RANBP1 forms a 1:1:1 complex with CRM1 and RanGTP, aiding in cargo dissociation through a CRM1-RanGTP sequestration mechanism. In animals, RANBP1 forms a 1:1:2 complex, sequestering RanGTP from nuclear export complexes without forming a stable complex with CRM1 (Li2019Distinct).

RANBP1 also interacts with RCC1, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran. It forms a complex with RanGTP that prevents RCC1 from binding, thereby inhibiting RCC1-stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange on Ran (Bischoff1995Coactivation). During mitosis, RANBP1 forms a complex with Ran and RCC1, known as the RRR complex, which is crucial for controlling RCC1 dynamics and ensuring proper mitotic progression (Yau2020RanBP1).
