# HAS3

## Overview
The HAS3 gene encodes the enzyme hyaluronan synthase 3, which is a critical component in the biosynthesis of hyaluronan, a major glycosaminoglycan of the extracellular matrix. As an integral membrane protein, HAS3 is characterized by multiple transmembrane domains and is involved in the polymerization and extrusion of hyaluronan at the plasma membrane (Goentzel2006Recombinant). This enzyme is distinct from other hyaluronan synthases due to its ability to produce shorter hyaluronan chains, which can influence cellular processes such as adhesion and migration (Itano1999Three). The activity of HAS3 is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which allows for rapid modulation in response to cellular signals (Goentzel2006Recombinant). HAS3 plays a significant role in various physiological and pathological processes, including tissue integrity, cell proliferation, and migration, and is implicated in conditions such as cancer and neurological disorders (Arranz2014Hyaluronan; Wang2022Targeting).

## Structure
The human hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) protein is an integral plasma membrane protein involved in the synthesis of hyaluronan, a key component of the extracellular matrix. HAS3 is predicted to have six membrane-spanning segments and two additional hydrophobic stretches that interact with the plasma membrane (Goentzel2006Recombinant). A significant feature of HAS3 is a large cytoplasmic loop between the second and third transmembrane segments, which contains the majority of conserved residues among HAS family members and likely houses the catalytic regions of the protein (Goentzel2006Recombinant).

HAS3 is subject to post-translational modifications, specifically phosphorylation. It is serine-phosphorylated, and this modification can be enhanced by effectors such as a cAMP analogue, suggesting a role in the rapid regulation of HAS3 activity (Goentzel2006Recombinant). The phosphorylation of HAS3 was quantified, showing an increase in stoichiometry from approximately 0.11 under non-stimulating conditions to 0.32 upon maximal stimulation (Goentzel2006Recombinant).

The distinct enzymatic properties of HAS3, compared to other isoforms like HAS1 and HAS2, include the synthesis of shorter hyaluronan chains, which may be due to its slower elongation rate and rapid release and re-initiation of HA synthesis (Itano1999Three).

## Function
Hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the synthesis of hyaluronan, a glycosaminoglycan essential for various cellular functions. HAS3 is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it facilitates the polymerization of hyaluronan and its extrusion into the extracellular matrix (Spicer1997Molecular). This process is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of tissues and supporting cell proliferation and migration, particularly in the epidermis (Sayo2002Hyaluronan).

In human keratinocytes, HAS3 is a key regulator of hyaluronan synthesis, influencing cell proliferation and differentiation. The expression of HAS3 is modulated by cytokines such as interferon-gamma (IFN-g), which upregulates HAS3 mRNA and enhances hyaluronan production, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b), which downregulates HAS3, reducing hyaluronan synthesis (Sayo2002Hyaluronan). This regulation is independent of cell proliferation and differentiation, indicating a direct role of HAS3 in hyaluronan synthesis (Sayo2002Hyaluronan).

HAS3 is also involved in the production of smaller hyaluronan molecules compared to other hyaluronan synthases, such as HAS1 and HAS2, which may influence the formation of pericellular coats and impact cellular processes like adhesion and migration (Itano1999Three). The enzyme's activity is subject to regulation by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can rapidly alter its function in response to cellular signals (Goentzel2006Recombinant).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the HAS3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in the context of cancer and neurological disorders. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), elevated HAS3 expression is associated with increased tumor growth, metastasis, and poorer survival outcomes. Targeting HAS3 in RCC has been suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy, as its inhibition can reduce tumor cell proliferation and invasion (Wang2022Targeting). In melanoma, HAS3 overexpression leads to the release of extracellular vesicles that promote cancer progression through the activation of the hedgehog signaling pathway, enhancing cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Arasu2019HAS3induced).

In the brain, HAS3 deficiency is linked to epilepsy. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of HAS3 results in a significant reduction in brain extracellular space, leading to altered neuronal activity and seizures (Arranz2014Hyaluronan). This suggests that HAS3 plays a crucial role in maintaining normal brain function, and its deficiency can increase seizure susceptibility (Arranz2014Hyaluronan). These findings highlight the clinical significance of HAS3 in both cancer and neurological conditions.

## Interactions
Hyaluronan synthase 3 (HAS3) is involved in specific protein interactions that regulate its function and localization. HAS3 has been shown to interact with Rab10, a small GTPase, which plays a crucial role in the endocytosis and trafficking of HAS3. This interaction is significant for the regulation of hyaluronan synthesis and cell adhesion. Rab10 colocalizes with HAS3 in intracellular vesicular structures and is involved in the endocytic pathway, although fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis suggests that HAS3 and Rab10 do not have a direct physical interaction within a 10-nm distance (Deen2014Rab10mediated).

HAS3 does not co-immunoprecipitate with other endosomal proteins such as Rab5 and Rab7, indicating a specific interaction with Rab10 (Deen2014Rab10mediated). The interaction with Rab10 is crucial for the regulation of HAS3's presence on the plasma membrane, affecting hyaluronan secretion and cell surface hyaluronan coat formation, which in turn influences cell adhesion to collagen (Deen2014Rab10mediated). The regulation of HAS3 by Rab10 involves clathrin-dependent endocytosis, as HAS3 co-immunoprecipitates with clathrin heavy chain, suggesting a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Deen2014Rab10mediated).
