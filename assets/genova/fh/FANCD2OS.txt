# FANCD2OS

## Overview
FANCD2OS is a gene that encodes the protein known as FANCD2 opposite strand. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and epigenetic modifications. While the specific functional categorization of the FANCD2 opposite strand protein remains under investigation, it is known to play a significant role in the cellular response to DNA damage and stress. The gene's expression and its protein product have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and substance use disorders. Research has shown that FANCD2OS is differentially expressed in response to therapeutic drugs in cancer, suggesting its involvement in drug resistance mechanisms (Zhao2022Transcription). Additionally, epigenetic studies have linked FANCD2OS to dementia biomarkers and alcohol use disorder, highlighting its potential impact on disease progression and patient outcomes (Miller2024An; Zillich2021Epigenomewide).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FANCD2OS has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to its role in gene expression and interaction pathways. In esophageal cancer, FANCD2OS is one of the genes significantly differentially expressed in response to multiple drugs, suggesting its involvement in drug resistance mechanisms. Mutations in FANCD2OS are associated with the development of multiple cancers and can affect patient prognosis (Zhao2022Transcription).

In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, an epigenome-wide association study identified a significant DNA methylation locus within FANCD2OS associated with dementia biomarkers. This locus, cg13053408, is involved in mediating the effects of the amyloid precursor protein fragment on FOXO3, which is linked to aging and Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of FANCD2OS has been shown to modulate the expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which is elevated in Alzheimer's disease and correlated with amyloid-beta deposition in the hippocampus (Miller2024An).

FANCD2OS is also associated with alcohol use disorder, as identified by differentially methylated regions in the ventral striatum, indicating its potential role in the molecular mechanisms underlying this condition (Zillich2021Epigenomewide). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FANCD2OS in various diseases, particularly those involving altered gene expression and epigenetic modifications.
