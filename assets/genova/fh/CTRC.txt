# CTRC

## Overview
The CTRC gene encodes the enzyme chymotrypsin C, a serine protease that plays a pivotal role in the digestive system, particularly within the pancreas. As a member of the chymotrypsin-like serine endopeptidases, chymotrypsin C is involved in the regulation of digestive enzyme activity, including the activation and degradation of trypsinogen, a precursor to trypsin, and the activation of procarboxypeptidases A1 and A2 (Beer2012Comprehensive; Szabó2011High). The enzyme's structure is characterized by a catalytic triad and a substrate binding site that confers specificity through electrostatic interactions (Batra2013Longrange). Mutations in the CTRC gene have been linked to an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining pancreatic health (Takáts2022Risk). Understanding the genetic and functional aspects of CTRC is crucial for elucidating its role in pancreatic disorders and for potential therapeutic interventions.

## Structure
Chymotrypsin C (CTRC) is a serine protease enzyme characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of CTRC consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure includes two β-barrels, each composed of six-stranded, twisted β-pleated sheets, which are typical of chymotrypsin-like serine endopeptidases (GomisRüth1995The; Batra2013Longrange). The tertiary structure of CTRC is stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its three-dimensional conformation (GomisRüth1995The).

CTRC contains a catalytic triad composed of Ser 195, His 57, and Asp 102, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Batra2013Longrange). The enzyme's substrate binding site is primarily hydrophobic, surrounded by an intense positive electrostatic surface potential that attracts negatively charged substrates (Batra2013Longrange). This electrostatic complementarity is a key determinant of CTRC's substrate specificity (Batra2013Longrange).

The quaternary structure of CTRC may involve dimerization, although specific details on this aspect are not provided in the context. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, contributing to the enzyme's stability and function (GomisRüth1995The).

## Function
Chymotrypsin C (CTRC) is a serine protease enzyme primarily active in the pancreas, where it plays a crucial role in regulating digestive enzyme activity. In healthy human cells, CTRC is involved in the activation and degradation of trypsinogen, a precursor to the digestive enzyme trypsin. It facilitates the trypsin-mediated activation of cationic trypsinogen by processing its activation peptide and promotes the degradation of trypsinogen and trypsin under low calcium conditions, which is an important defensive mechanism to prevent premature enzyme activation that could lead to pancreatic damage (Beer2012Comprehensive; Szabó2011High).

CTRC also acts as a co-activator for procarboxypeptidases A1 and A2, requiring its activity for their full activation (Szabó2011High). The enzyme's specificity is partly due to its affinity for leucyl peptide bonds and its preference for acidic residues at the P4' position, which enhances its binding affinity and regulatory functions (Szabó2011High). These molecular processes are crucial for maintaining normal pancreatic function and preventing conditions such as pancreatitis, which can arise from the loss of CTRC function (Beer2012Comprehensive).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CTRC gene are associated with an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis (CP), a progressive fibro-inflammatory disorder of the pancreas. Loss-of-function variants in CTRC can lead to impaired degradation of trypsinogen, resulting in its harmful activation and contributing to pancreatic inflammation (Beer2012Comprehensive; Takáts2022Risk). Specific CTRC variants, such as p.A73T, p.V235I, p.K247_R254del, and p.R254W, have been identified as significant risk factors for CP, with odds ratios ranging from 2.6 to 6.5 (Takáts2022Risk). The p.A73T variant, in particular, has been shown to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in pancreatic acinar cells, leading to increased apoptosis and contributing to pancreatic damage (Szmola2009Pancreatitisassociated).

The p.G60G variant, although common, is associated with an increased risk of CP, potentially due to reduced CTRC mRNA expression (WertheimTysarowska2021Genetic; LaRusch2015The). The presence of CTRC variants in both patients and healthy controls suggests that not all variants are pathogenic, and their clinical significance can be inferred from their biochemical or cell biological phenotype (Beer2012Comprehensive). Understanding the functional impact of these variants is crucial for assessing CP risk and guiding genetic counseling (Takáts2022Risk).

## Interactions
Chymotrypsin C (CTRC) is a serine protease that plays a crucial role in the regulation of digestive enzymes through its interactions with other proteins. CTRC is involved in the activation and degradation of trypsinogens, including cationic trypsinogen, by cleaving specific peptide bonds. This process is essential for the proper activation of digestive enzymes in the duodenum and can prevent premature activation that may lead to pancreatitis (Batra2013Longrange; Nemoda2006Chymotrypsin).

CTRC specifically cleaves the Phe18-Asp19 peptide bond in trypsinogen, facilitating its autoactivation. This interaction is regulated by the presence of Asp218, which is crucial for the activation process (Nemoda2006Chymotrypsin). CTRC also interacts with mesotrypsinogen, cleaving it at specific sites to reduce its catalytic activity and decrease the degradation of the trypsin inhibitor SPINK1, thereby playing a protective role against pancreatitis (Toldi2020Inactivation).

The substrate specificity of CTRC is influenced by its preference for acidic residues at the P4 position, which is attributed to electrostatic interactions with basic residues on CTRC. This specificity allows CTRC to selectively target regulatory cleavage sites, distinguishing it from other chymotrypsin and elastase isoforms (Batra2013Longrange; Szabó2011High).
