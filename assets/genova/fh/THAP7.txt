# THAP7

## Overview
THAP7 is a gene that encodes the THAP domain-containing protein 7, a transcriptional regulator involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional repression and cell proliferation. The protein is characterized by the presence of a THAP domain, a zinc-coordinating DNA-binding domain, which is crucial for its function in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic; Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). THAP7 primarily functions in the nucleus, where it forms homodimers and interacts with other proteins such as Template Activating Factor-Iβ (TAF-Iβ) and histone H4 tails, facilitating transcriptional repression through histone deacetylation (Macfarlan2006ThanatosAssociated). The protein's role in cell cycle progression and its upregulation in certain cancers, such as lung adenocarcinoma, underscore its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Miele2007The; THAP7; Chen2019&lt; p&gt).

## Structure
THAP7 is a human protein characterized by the presence of a THAP domain, a zinc-coordinating DNA-binding domain located at the amino terminus. This domain is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional repression and cell proliferation (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic; Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). The THAP domain typically exhibits a β-α-β fold, which is conserved across the THAP protein family (Sanghavi2021Synapomorphic).

The secondary structure of THAP7 includes a predicted alpha helical region spanning residues 237-281, which overlaps with a predicted coiled coil region. This region is crucial for protein oligomerization and is characterized by amphipathic alpha helices (Sanghavi2019Classification). The coiled coil domain facilitates the formation of homodimers, which are essential for THAP7's function in transcriptional repression and interaction with other proteins (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L).

THAP7 is known to bind hypo-acetylated histone H4 tails, suggesting a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Sanghavi2019Classification). The protein's interaction with transcriptional co-regulators, such as HCF-1, further underscores its involvement in transcriptional regulation (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L).

## Function
THAP7 is a transcriptional regulator involved in several molecular processes within healthy human cells. It plays a significant role in cell proliferation by promoting cell-cycle progression. Experiments using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to create THAP7 null mutant cell lines have shown that while these cells remain viable, they exhibit slower proliferation rates compared to parental cells, indicating the importance of THAP7 in maintaining normal cell proliferation rates (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L).

THAP7 functions as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with the histone gene regulatory factor HiNF-P. It inhibits the HiNF-P-mediated activation of histone H4 gene transcription, thereby regulating histone gene expression during the cell cycle (Miele2007The). THAP7 achieves this repression by binding to hypo-acetylated histone H4 tails through its carboxy terminal residues, which is crucial for its role in transcriptional repression (Sanghavi2019Classification).

The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it forms homodimers but does not form heterodimers with THAP11, indicating distinct transcriptional networks (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). The coiled-coil domain of THAP7 is critical for its function, likely due to its role in dimerization, which is essential for promoting cell proliferation (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L).

## Clinical Significance
THAP7 is implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma, a subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma. Studies have shown that THAP7 is significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with a poorer prognosis, as higher THAP7 mRNA levels correlate with shorter overall survival in patients. Functionally, THAP7 promotes cell proliferation by facilitating the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle, which is crucial for tumor growth. It achieves this by epigenetically silencing the p21 gene, a known cell cycle regulator, through reduced acetylation of histone H3 on the p21 promoter (THAP7; Chen2019&lt; p&gt).

In addition to its role in lung adenocarcinoma, THAP7 interacts with the histone gene regulatory factor HiNF-P, suggesting a role in transcriptional repression. THAP7 inhibits the coactivation of histone H4 transcription by HiNF-P and its coactivator p220 NPAT, indicating its involvement in transcriptional control related to cell proliferation (Miele2007The). These interactions and regulatory functions highlight THAP7's potential as a target for molecular therapy in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
THAP7 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in transcriptional repression. It associates with Template Activating Factor-Iβ (TAF-Iβ), a key interaction that facilitates the recruitment of nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) to promoters, leading to histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression (Macfarlan2006ThanatosAssociated). The interaction between THAP7 and TAF-Iβ is mediated by the C-terminal 77 amino acids of THAP7, which are necessary for histone binding and transcriptional repression (Macfarlan2006ThanatosAssociated).

THAP7 also interacts with histone H3 and H4 tails, inhibiting their acetylation by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) such as p300 and PCAF through a mechanism termed histone masking (Macfarlan2006ThanatosAssociated). This interaction is enhanced when THAP7 is combined with TAF-Iβ, suggesting a cooperative role in inhibiting histone acetylation (Macfarlan2006ThanatosAssociated).

In addition to its interactions with TAF-Iβ and histones, THAP7 forms homodimers via coiled-coil domains and associates with HCF-1 through HBM sequences, which are crucial for its role in cell proliferation (Dehaene2020THAP11F80L). These interactions highlight THAP7's multifaceted role in transcriptional regulation and cellular processes.
