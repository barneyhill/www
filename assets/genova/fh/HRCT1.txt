# HRCT1

## Overview
HRCT1 is a gene that encodes the protein histidine rich carboxyl terminus 1, which is characterized by its abundance of histidine residues. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer biology. As a regulatory protein, histidine rich carboxyl terminus 1 is involved in the modulation of signaling pathways that are crucial for cell proliferation and migration. Notably, HRCT1 has been identified as an oncogene in gastric cancer, where it plays a significant role in tumor progression and metastasis through the activation of the ERBB2-MAPK signaling pathway (Hou2023HRCT1). The expression of HRCT1 is intricately regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-124-3p, which acts as a tumor suppressor. The dysregulation of this microRNA can lead to increased levels of HRCT1, thereby contributing to cancer development (Hou2023HRCT1). Due to its significant role in cancer progression, HRCT1 is being explored as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer (Hou2023HRCT1).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
HRCT1 is significantly upregulated in gastric cancer, particularly in cases with lymph node metastasis, deeper tumor invasion, distant metastases, advanced cancer stage, and poor differentiation. This upregulation is associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), making HRCT1 an independent predictor for these outcomes in gastric cancer patients (Hou2023HRCT1). HRCT1 acts as an oncogene by promoting tumor cell migration, invasion, and proliferation, contributing to tumor metastasis and growth. It activates the ERBB2-MAPK signaling pathway, which is crucial for gastric cancer progression (Hou2023HRCT1).

The expression of HRCT1 is negatively regulated by miR-124-3p, a microRNA that functions as a tumor suppressor and is downregulated in gastric cancer. The downregulation of miR-124-3p may lead to the accumulation of HRCT1, further promoting cancer progression (Hou2023HRCT1). Given its role in promoting tumor progression and its regulation by miR-124-3p, HRCT1 is considered a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer treatment (Hou2023HRCT1).
