# ENTPD1

## Overview
ENTPD1, also known as CD39, is a gene that encodes the protein ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1, a transmembrane ectonucleotidase. This enzyme is pivotal in the regulation of purinergic signaling by hydrolyzing extracellular ATP and ADP into AMP, thereby modulating immune responses and maintaining vascular homeostasis. The protein is predominantly expressed on the surface of endothelial and immune cells, including regulatory T cells, where it plays a significant role in creating an anti-inflammatory environment by facilitating the production of adenosine. This function is crucial for processes such as thromboregulation, immune suppression, and tissue remodeling. Alterations in ENTPD1 expression and function have been linked to various pathological conditions, including metabolic disorders, cancer, and immune-related diseases, highlighting its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Antonioli2013CD39; Enjyoji2008Deletion; Luo2021Favorable).

## Structure
ENTPD1, also known as CD39, is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 70 to 80 kDa and consists of approximately 510 amino acids. The protein is characterized by two transmembrane domains located near the N- and C-termini, which anchor it to the cell membrane. Between these domains lies a large extracellular loop that contains the catalytic domain, essential for its enzymatic activity (Zimmermann2012Cellular; Ferrero2019A).

The extracellular loop of ENTPD1 includes five highly conserved sequence motifs known as apyrase-conserved regions (ACRs), which are crucial for its function. A sixth region, ACR6, is also identified within subfamilies (Zimmermann2012Cellular). The protein shares structural features with other NTPDases, including ten conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, contributing to its stability and function (Zimmermann2012Cellular).

ENTPD1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which is important for its stability and proper localization. The protein can form oligomeric structures, such as dimers, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Zimmermann2012Cellular; Ferrero2019A). The enzyme's activity is influenced by its membrane topology and the dynamics of its transmembrane helices (Zimmermann2020Ectonucleoside).

## Function
ENTPD1, also known as CD39, is an ectonucleotidase that plays a crucial role in modulating purinergic signaling by hydrolyzing ATP and ADP to AMP. This enzymatic activity is essential for regulating extracellular nucleotide levels and maintaining immune homeostasis. CD39 is primarily expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and various immune cells, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (Antonioli2013CD39).

In endothelial cells, CD39, in conjunction with CD73, converts ATP/ADP to adenosine, creating an antithrombotic environment and influencing vascular tone, inflammation, and thrombosis (Antonioli2013CD39; Helenius2015Suppression). This process is vital for reducing endothelial activation and monocyte recruitment, thus playing a role in immune regulation and vascular function (Antonioli2013CD39).

In immune cells, CD39 is crucial for the immunosuppressive activity of Tregs and the modulation of macrophage inflammatory responses. Its activity helps prevent excessive inflammation by promoting an adenosine-rich environment, which supports tissue remodeling and anti-inflammatory functions (Antonioli2013CD39). The enzyme's role in converting ATP to adenosine is also significant in shifting immune responses from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory states (Antonioli2013CD39).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ENTPD1 gene, also known as CD39, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of diabetes and metabolic disorders, the deletion of Cd39/Entpd1 in mice leads to hepatic insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and decreased insulin sensitivity. This is associated with increased activation of hepatic c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (c-JNK) and a proinflammatory phenotype, characterized by elevated cytokine levels (Enjyoji2008Deletion).

ENTPD1 polymorphisms are linked to type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy, particularly in African Americans. Specific haplotypes are associated with either increased risk or protection against diabetes-related end-stage renal disease (DM-ESRD) (Friedman2008FunctionalENTPD1Polymorphisms).

In cancer, ENTPD1 expression varies across different types. In thyroid carcinoma (THCA), high ENTPD1 expression is associated with better survival and prognosis, particularly in advanced stages of the disease (Luo2021Favorable). However, in other cancers like esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer, high ENTPD1 expression correlates with poor prognosis (Luo2021Favorable).

ENTPD1 also plays a role in immune-related diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and sepsis, where it modulates inflammation and immune responses (Zeng2020Implications).
