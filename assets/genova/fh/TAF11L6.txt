# TAF11L6

## Overview
TAF11L6 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 11 like 6, which is involved in the regulation of transcription. This protein is categorized as a transcription factor, playing a crucial role in the assembly of the transcription preinitiation complex, which is essential for the initiation of gene expression. TAF11L6 is part of a larger family of TATA-box binding protein associated factors (TAFs) that interact with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to form the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, a key component in the transcription machinery of eukaryotic cells. The precise function and interactions of TAF11L6 within the transcriptional framework are subjects of ongoing research, with implications for understanding gene regulation and expression (Qiu2020aarFDC).
