# CHST9

## Overview
CHST9, or carbohydrate sulfotransferase 9, is a gene that encodes a type II membrane protein belonging to the sulfotransferase 2 family. This protein is primarily localized to the Golgi membrane, where it plays a crucial role in the sulfation of carbohydrates, specifically glycosaminoglycans, by transferring sulfate groups to N-glycans and O-glycans. The enzymatic activity of carbohydrate sulfotransferase 9 is essential for the structural integrity and function of proteoglycans, which are vital components of the extracellular matrix. This sulfation process influences various physiological processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and the organization of the extracellular matrix, thereby impacting development and immune response. The CHST9 protein is highly expressed in the trachea and brain, particularly in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, and is involved in cell-cell interaction, signal transduction, and embryonic development (Chen2019A).

## Structure
The CHST9 gene encodes a type II membrane protein consisting of 443 amino acids, which is part of the sulfotransferase 2 family. The protein is localized to the Golgi membrane and is involved in the transfer of sulfate to specific positions on N-glycans and O-glycans (Chen2019A). The CHST9 protein structure includes a 12-amino acid cytoplasmic domain, a 21-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 410-amino acid luminal domain. The luminal domain contains four potential N-linked glycosylation sites and two motifs: a putative 5′-phosphosulfate-binding site (5′-PSB) and a 3′-phosphate-binding site (3′-PB) of 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (Chen2019A).

A frameshift variant in the CHST9 gene, specifically a two-base-pair deletion (c.50_51delTG) located in the first exon, results in a truncated protein. This mutation affects the transmembrane domain, leading to a loss of function mutation. The truncated protein is predicted to lose its major functions, including substrate recognition, membrane anchoring, and sulfate group transfer (Chen2019A). The protein is highly expressed in the trachea and brain, particularly in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, and plays a role in cell-cell interaction, signal transduction, and embryonic development (Chen2019A).

## Function
CHST9, or carbohydrate sulfotransferase 9, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the sulfation of carbohydrates, specifically glycosaminoglycans. This enzymatic activity is essential for the structural integrity and function of proteoglycans, which are key components of the extracellular matrix. The sulfation process mediated by CHST9 influences cell signaling, adhesion, and the organization of the extracellular matrix, thereby impacting various physiological processes such as development and immune response.

CHST9 is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it modifies glycoproteins and glycolipids. This modification is crucial for the proper functioning of these molecules, as it affects their interactions and stability. By transferring sulfate groups to specific carbohydrate moieties, CHST9 ensures that proteoglycans can perform their roles in cellular communication and structural support effectively. The activity of CHST9 in the Golgi apparatus highlights its importance in the post-translational modification of proteins, which is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and facilitating organismal development. The enzyme's function in these molecular processes underscores its significance in maintaining healthy cellular and physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CHST9 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions. A notable frameshift variant, specifically a two-base-pair deletion (c.50_51delTG), results in a truncated protein that likely loses its major functions, such as substrate recognition and sulfate transfer. This loss of function mutation is associated with schizophrenia, potentially interfering with normal brain development and contributing to the disorder by affecting chondroitin 4-sulphotransferase activity, crucial for forming perineuronal nets involved in neural patterning and synaptic signaling (Chen2019A). The study by Chen et al. identified this frameshift variant in the CHST9 gene in a Chinese population, showing a significant association with schizophrenia through both case-control and family-based analyses (Chen2019A).

In addition to psychiatric disorders, CHST9 has been implicated in various cancers. The CHST9 rs1436904 genetic variant is associated with the prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Patients with the GG genotype of this variant have a shorter disease-free survival compared to those with the TT genotype, suggesting that this polymorphism may serve as a prognostic marker for TNBC, particularly in patients with large tumors or those who are premenopausal (Yuan2017CHST9).
