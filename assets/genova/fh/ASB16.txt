# ASB16

## Overview
ASB16 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 16, which is involved in various cellular processes through its structural domains. The protein is characterized by ankyrin repeat domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a SOCS box domain that plays a crucial role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby maintaining protein homeostasis (Anasa2018Multifaceted). ASB16 is expressed in tissues such as skeletal muscle and the cerebellum, where it may have regulatory functions, although its precise roles in normal physiology are not fully understood (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics; Anasa2018Multifaceted). The protein is also implicated in signaling pathways that influence apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, suggesting its involvement in cellular adhesion and signaling processes (Anasa2018Multifaceted; Xie2023A). Further research is needed to elucidate the comprehensive biological functions of ASB16 and its potential implications in health and disease.

## Structure


## Function
ASB16 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in protein-protein interactions, primarily through its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate binding to other proteins. The SOCS box domain of ASB16 is implicated in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cellular functions (Anasa2018Multifaceted). 

In skeletal muscle, ASB16 is characterized by a large enhancer chromatin region with overlapping DNA hypomethylation, suggesting a regulatory role in muscle tissue (Ehrlich2020Epigenetics). Despite its expression in skeletal muscle and the cerebellum, the specific function of ASB16 in healthy human cells remains largely unexplored (Anasa2018Multifaceted). 

ASB16 is also involved in signaling pathways related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with significant inhibitory effects on apoptosis and promotion of EMT activation (Xie2023A). The protein is localized to focal adhesion sites, indicating a potential role in cellular adhesion and signaling processes (Anasa2018Multifaceted). However, detailed functional studies are needed to fully elucidate its role in cellular and organismal biology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ASB16 gene have been linked to various diseases, particularly in the context of bovine digital dermatitis (BDD). A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs109521151, results in a missense mutation (His447Arg) in the SOCS box domain of the ASB16 protein. This mutation is associated with increased susceptibility to BDD, a condition affecting cattle, by potentially altering the protein's ubiquitin ligase activity and impacting inflammatory process regulation in skin tissue (Oelschlaegel2022Functional). The presence of this mutation suggests a significant role for ASB16 in the immunological response to infections, as evidenced by its expression in immune cells and skin tissue (Oelschlaegel2022Functional).

In humans, the ASB16-AS1 gene, a long non-coding RNA associated with ASB16, has been implicated in several cancers. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ASB16-AS1 is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene by modulating the miR-1827/FZD4/Wnt/β-catenin axis, promoting cancer progression (p&gt; Yao2019&lt; LncRNA). In gastric cancer, ASB16-AS1 enhances tumor growth and drug resistance by interacting with TRIM37 and activating the NF-κB pathway (Fu2020ASB16AS1). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ASB16 and its associated non-coding RNA in disease pathogenesis.
