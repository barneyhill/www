# ADD3

## Overview
The ADD3 gene encodes the protein adducin 3, also known as γ-adducin, which is a member of the adducin family of cytoskeletal proteins. Adducin 3 is primarily involved in the regulation and stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular structure and integrity. It functions as part of a heterotetrameric complex, typically with α and β adducin subunits, to cap the barbed ends of actin filaments and facilitate the interaction between actin and spectrin. This interaction is essential for the structural organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly in erythrocytes, where it contributes to membrane stability under mechanical stress (Franco2010Erythrocyte; Gonçalves2018A). Adducin 3 is regulated by calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner and is a substrate for protein kinases, which modulate its activity and localization (Kiang2018A; Li1998Adducin). Mutations in the ADD3 gene have been associated with various clinical conditions, including neurological disorders and biliary atresia, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Cheng2013Common; Gonçalves2018A).

## Structure
The ADD3 gene encodes the γ-adducin protein, which is a component of the adducin family involved in the cytoskeletal structure of cells. The γ-adducin protein is composed of a conserved domain structure that includes a globular N-terminal head domain, a neck domain, and a C-terminal tail domain. The head domain may assist in dimerization, while the neck domain is crucial for forming heterodimers, the active form of adducin (Franco2010Erythrocyte). The C-terminal tail domain contains a MARCKS domain, important for protein-protein interactions and regulatory activities, and binds to the erythrocyte anion transporter, band 3 (Franco2010Erythrocyte).

Adducin proteins, including γ-adducin, are known to form heterotetramers, typically with α and β subunits, although γ-adducin can also form α/γ heterotetramers (Sahr2009Targeted). The γ-adducin gene undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms such as γ-1 and γ-2, which differ by the inclusion of an additional exon in γ-2, adding 32 amino acids (Suriyapperuma2000The). The γ-adducin protein is regulated by calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner, affecting its interaction with actin and spectrin (Franco2010Erythrocyte).

## Function
The ADD3 gene encodes the protein adducin-γ, which is a crucial component of the adducin family involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Adducin proteins form heterotetramers, typically composed of adducin-α and either adducin-γ or adducin-β. These complexes play a significant role in capping the barbed ends of F-actin and facilitating the interaction between actin and spectrin, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and organization of the cytoskeleton in healthy human cells (Gonçalves2018A). 

In erythrocytes, adducin-γ, encoded by ADD3, is part of a protein complex that stabilizes the red blood cell membrane by connecting the spectrin-actin junctional complex to band 3, a major membrane protein. This interaction is vital for maintaining membrane stability and integrity during mechanical stress (Franco2010Erythrocyte). Adducin-γ also interacts with calmodulin, suggesting a role in calcium-mediated regulation of the erythrocyte membrane (Franco2010Erythrocyte).

Mutations in ADD3 have been linked to various clinical phenotypes, including neurological disorders, indicating its importance in normal neurological development and function (Gonçalves2018A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADD3 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of biliary atresia (BA), a severe neonatal liver disease, common genetic variants in the ADD3 gene have been linked to increased susceptibility. Studies have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs17095355 and rs10509906, which are associated with either increased risk or protective effects against BA. These SNPs are thought to influence ADD3 expression levels in the liver, potentially affecting the pathogenesis of BA (Cheng2013Common; Zeng2014Association; Bai2020Association).

In addition to BA, mutations in the ADD3 gene have been implicated in a range of other conditions, including intellectual disability, microcephaly, cataracts, and skeletal defects. These mutations can interact with variants in other genes, such as KAT2B, to produce a broader spectrum of clinical phenotypes, as observed in certain familial cases (Gonçalves2018A).

The ADD3 gene has also been studied in the context of glioblastoma, where its deletion is associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival. This suggests that ADD3 may function as a tumor suppressor gene in gliomas (Kiang2021ADD3).

## Interactions
Adducin 3 (ADD3) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in the cytoskeleton. It interacts with spectrin and actin to form a stable cytoskeletal network. This interaction is facilitated by the MARCKS-related domain and a newly defined oligomerization domain, which are essential for recruiting spectrin to the fast-growing ends of actin filaments (Li1998Adducin). The oligomerization domain, located in the neck region of adducin, allows the formation of dimers, trimers, and tetramers, which are important for its function in spectrin recruitment and actin capping (Li1998Adducin).

Adducin also interacts with calmodulin and is a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylate adducin at specific sites, influencing its activity and localization (Li1998Adducin). The phosphorylation by PKC can lead to the redistribution of adducin from the cytoskeletal to soluble fractions, affecting its association with the cytoskeleton (Dong199535H). These interactions highlight the role of ADD3 in cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular signaling pathways.
