# CREG2

## Overview
CREG2, or cellular repressor of E1A stimulated genes 2, is a gene that encodes a secreted glycoprotein predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly within the limbic system, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. This protein is part of the CREG family and is characterized by its N-glycosylation, which is essential for its secretion and function as a neuronal extracellular molecule (Kunita2002Identification). Unlike its homolog CREG1, CREG2 exhibits a more restricted expression pattern, suggesting a specialized role in neuronal function and possibly in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation within the nervous system (Di2003The). Additionally, CREG2 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, where its expression levels correlate with patient prognosis (Alotaibi2023Global). The protein's interactions, including its potential association with ubiquitin-specific protease USP17, indicate its involvement in complex regulatory networks within the brain (Kunita2002Identification).

## Function
CREG2 is a secreted glycoprotein that is specifically expressed in the brain, particularly within the limbic system, including regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus (Kunita2002Identification). It is N-glycosylated, a modification that is dependent on N-terminal signal sequences necessary for its entry into the endoplasmic reticulum, where glycosylation occurs (Kunita2002Identification). This glycosylation suggests that CREG2 functions as a secreted protein, potentially playing a role as a novel neuronal extracellular molecule (Kunita2002Identification).

The localization of CREG2 to the perinuclear region indicates its presence in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role in protein processing and trafficking within cells (Kunita2002Identification). Although CREG2 shares about 35% identity with the original CREG protein, it is distinct in its expression pattern and potential functions, as it is not ubiquitously expressed but rather restricted to the brain (Di2003The; Kunita2002Identification). The specific expression of CREG2 in the brain implies a specialized role in neuronal function and possibly in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation within the nervous system.

## Clinical Significance
CREG2 has been identified as having potential clinical significance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). A study found that increased expression levels of CREG2 are associated with lower overall survival in ESCC patients, with a Hazard Ratio of 2.29, indicating that higher expression correlates with a more than twofold increase in the risk of death (Alotaibi2023Global). This suggests that CREG2 could serve as a prognostic marker for ESCC. The gene's expression is positively correlated with tumor clinical stage, metastasis, and infiltration stages in malignant gastric cancer tissues, further supporting its potential role in cancer progression (Alotaibi2023Global).

Despite its significance in cancer, CREG2 is not highly expressed in normal esophageal tissues, indicating a tissue-specific expression pattern that may contribute to its role in tumorigenesis (Alotaibi2023Global). The study also notes that CREG2 was upregulated in African American and European populations, suggesting possible population-specific expression differences (Alotaibi2023Global). These findings highlight the importance of further research into the mechanisms by which CREG2 contributes to cancer development and progression, as well as its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CREG2, a member of the CREG family, is a secreted glycoprotein that has been identified as a candidate interacting protein with USP17, a ubiquitin-specific protease. This potential interaction was discovered through yeast two-hybrid screening using a human brain cDNA library, suggesting a physical interaction between CREG2 and USP17 (Kunita2002Identification). CREG2 is specifically expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus, but not in other tissues like the heart or liver (Kunita2002Identification).

The protein is N-glycosylated, and its N termini may function as signal sequences for secretion, indicating that CREG2 is processed through the secretory pathway (Kunita2002Identification). While the specific interactions of CREG2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its glycosylation and secretion suggest it may participate in extracellular signaling or interactions within the brain's cellular environment. The study of CREG2's interactions is ongoing, and its role in cellular processes such as growth and differentiation highlights its potential involvement in complex regulatory networks within the brain (Kunita2002Identification).
