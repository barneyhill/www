# SCD

## Overview
The SCD gene encodes the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase, a critical component in lipid metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a membrane-bound desaturase and is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids by introducing a cis-double bond at the Δ9 position of saturated fatty acids, such as stearoyl-CoA, converting them into monounsaturated forms like oleoyl-CoA. This process is essential for the formation of membrane phospholipids and triglycerides, which are vital for maintaining cell membrane fluidity and function. The SCD gene is located on chromosome 10, and its expression results in two mRNA transcripts due to alternative polyadenylation, although both encode the same protein. The enzyme's activity is integral to cellular processes, including protection against lipotoxicity in human beta cells, particularly under metabolic stress conditions such as type 2 diabetes (ZHANG1999Human; Oshima2019Stearoyl; Ntambi1995The).

## Structure
The human stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) protein is a 359 amino acid enzyme with a molecular mass of 41.5 kDa (ZHANG1999Human). The SCD protein is characterized by its transmembrane domains, which are typical of membrane-bound proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum (Castro2011The). The enzyme's structure includes conserved histidine-containing motifs, which are crucial for its desaturase activity, facilitating the introduction of a cis-double bond at the Δ9 position of saturated fatty acids (ZHANG1999Human; Ntambi1995The).

The SCD gene produces two mRNA transcripts, 3.9 and 5.2 kb in size, due to alternative polyadenylation sites, but these encode the same polypeptide (ZHANG1999Human). The gene is located on chromosome 10, with a pseudogene on chromosome 17 that is transcriptionally inactive (ZHANG1999Human). The SCD protein shares high sequence homology with its mouse counterparts, indicating a conserved structure across species (ZHANG1999Human). The protein's secondary and tertiary structures are inferred from its amino acid sequence, which includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, although specific details on these structures are not provided in the context.

## Function
The stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) gene encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in lipid metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of saturated fatty acids, such as stearoyl-CoA, into monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily oleoyl-CoA. This enzymatic activity involves the introduction of a cis-double bond at the Δ9 position of the fatty acid chain, a process essential for the synthesis of monounsaturated fats, which are key components of membrane phospholipids and triglycerides (ZHANG1999Human; Ntambi1995The).

SCD is a membrane-bound enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it functions as part of a multienzyme complex involving NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase and cytochrome b5. This complex facilitates the electron transport necessary for the desaturation process (Wang2005Characterization). The activity of SCD is crucial for maintaining cell membrane fluidity, which is important for proper cellular function and signal transduction (Ntambi1999Regulation).

In human beta cells, SCD helps protect against lipotoxicity by converting toxic saturated fatty acids into less harmful unsaturated forms, thereby maintaining cell identity and function. This protective role is particularly significant in the context of metabolic stress, such as that seen in type 2 diabetes (Oshima2019Stearoyl).

## Interactions
Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in lipid metabolism. SCD1 interacts with the CoA moiety, which plays a significant role in opening the substrate binding tunnel and stabilizing substrate conformation, facilitating the desaturation process and product release into the membrane (Petroff2020Sequential). The CoA moiety also increases the distance between specific residues, such as Gln147 and Thr261, which is essential for substrate entry into the binding tunnel (Petroff2020Sequential).

SCD1's activity is linked to its interaction with cytochrome b5 (cyt b5), which is involved in electron transfer. SCD1 accelerates the oxidation of cyt b5, indicating a functional electron transport pair that is essential for its desaturase activity (Shen2020Structure).

Additionally, SCD1-derived lipokines, such as PI(18:1/18:1), interact with cellular stress signaling pathways. These interactions involve the regulation of proteins like the serine/threonine-protein phosphatase Ppp2ca, which is involved in stress signaling pathways, including p38 MAPK activation and autophagy initiation (Thürmer2022PI(18:118:1) page 9 of 15).
