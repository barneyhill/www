# KIR3DL3

## Overview
KIR3DL3 is a gene that encodes the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor, three Ig domains and long cytoplasmic tail 3, a transmembrane protein primarily involved in immune regulation. This receptor is part of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, characterized by its three extracellular immunoglobulin domains, which facilitate interactions with specific ligands such as HHLA2. KIR3DL3 functions as an inhibitory receptor, predominantly expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cell subsets, where it modulates immune responses by transmitting inhibitory signals. These signals are crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. The receptor's interaction with HHLA2, a ligand expressed on antigen-presenting cells and tumors, is significant in the context of cancer, as it suppresses NK cell and T cell activity, thereby influencing tumor immunity (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2; Trundley2006Molecular). KIR3DL3's expression is tightly regulated by promoter methylation, and its polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a protective role against such conditions (Aghaei2019Association; Trundley2006Molecular).

## Structure
The KIR3DL3 protein is a member of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family, characterized by its three extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains: D0, D1, and D2. These domains are involved in the protein's interaction with ligands, with the D0 domain playing a crucial role in binding to HHLA2, a known ligand (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2). The primary structure of KIR3DL3 includes amino acid sequences that form these Ig domains, which are highly conserved across catarrhine primates, indicating their evolutionary importance (Leaton2019Conservation).

The secondary structure of KIR3DL3 is typical of immunoglobulin folds, consisting of beta sheets and loops. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional arrangement of the Ig domains, which are essential for the protein's function as an inhibitory receptor (Bhatt2021KIR3DL3). KIR3DL3 lacks the exon encoding the stem between the Ig domains and the transmembrane region, which is unique compared to other KIRs (Bhatt2021KIR3DL3).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may affect the receptor's function and stability, although specific modifications for KIR3DL3 are not detailed in the available context. The cytoplasmic tail of KIR3DL3 contains a single immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which is crucial for its inhibitory signaling function (Trundley2006Molecular).

## Function
KIR3DL3 is a receptor involved in immune regulation, primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cell subsets. In healthy human cells, KIR3DL3 is expressed on the CD56 bright subset of NK cells, which are known for their immunoregulatory functions (Trundley2006Molecular). The receptor is also found on terminally differentiated and effector memory CD8+ T cells, where it contributes to the acquisition of NK-like characteristics, enabling these T cells to lyse target cells without TCR engagement (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2).

KIR3DL3 functions as an inhibitory receptor, transmitting signals that modulate immune responses. It interacts with HHLA2, a ligand expressed on antigen-presenting cells and tumors, to mediate inhibitory signals that suppress NK cell and T cell activity (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2). This interaction involves the recruitment of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, which inhibit signaling pathways such as Vav1, ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-κB, crucial for immune cell activation (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2).

The expression of KIR3DL3 is regulated by promoter methylation, which keeps it transcriptionally inactive under normal conditions. However, demethylation can induce its expression, suggesting a tightly controlled regulatory mechanism (Trundley2006Molecular). The precise biological significance of KIR3DL3 in healthy individuals remains unclear, but it is thought to play a role in maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity.

## Clinical Significance
KIR3DL3 has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility. A meta-analysis by Aghaei et al. found that KIR3DL3 polymorphisms are significantly negatively associated with RA, suggesting a protective role against the disease (Aghaei2019Association). This gene functions as an inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells, potentially influencing RA progression by modulating NK cell activity (Aghaei2019Association). The study highlighted that KIR3DL3 is a 'framework' gene present in all KIR haplotypes, which may contribute to its consistent protective effect across different populations (Aghaei2019Association).

Despite its potential clinical significance, the specific ligand for KIR3DL3 remains uncertain, and its exact role in RA and other diseases is still being explored (Aghaei2019Association). The study by Amorim et al. noted the high allelic diversity of KIR3DL3, which could have implications for its function and interaction with other immune components, although the clinical significance of these variations was not specifically addressed (Amorim2021HighResolution). Overall, KIR3DL3 polymorphisms may influence disease susceptibility, particularly in autoimmune conditions like RA, by affecting immune regulation.

## Interactions
KIR3DL3 is an inhibitory receptor that interacts with the B7 family ligand HHLA2. This interaction plays a significant role in immune regulation, particularly in the context of cancer. KIR3DL3 binds to HHLA2 at distinct sites compared to TMIGD2, another receptor for HHLA2, indicating a unique binding mechanism (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2). The binding of KIR3DL3 to HHLA2 inhibits NK cell-mediated tumor cell lysis by forming inhibitory synapses, which prevent the cytoskeletal reorganization necessary for tumor killing (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2). This interaction recruits SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, leading to the suppression of signaling pathways such as Vav1, ERK1/2, AKT, and NF-κB (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2).

The KIR3DL3-HHLA2 interaction is also significant in T cells, where it inhibits TCR-dependent and independent functions, suppressing cytolytic activity and cytokine secretion (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2). Blocking this interaction with specific monoclonal antibodies can enhance NK cell cytotoxicity and T cell activity, suggesting potential therapeutic applications in cancer immunotherapy (Bhatt2021KIR3DL3). The interaction between KIR3DL3 and HHLA2 is a potential target for enhancing anti-tumor immunity by disrupting this immunosuppressive pathway (Wei2021KIR3DL3HHLA2).
