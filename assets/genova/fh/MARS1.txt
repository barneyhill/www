# MARS1

## Overview
MARS1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme methionyl-tRNA synthetase 1, a member of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the attachment of methionine to its corresponding tRNA, a process essential for the initiation of protein translation (Rubio2020Aminoacyl-tRNA; Jang2023Prediction). Methionyl-tRNA synthetase 1 is involved in various cellular processes beyond translation, including cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Jang2023Prediction; Sung2022Functional). Mutations in the MARS1 gene have been associated with several clinical conditions, such as congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and familial trigeminal neuralgia, underscoring its significance in human health (Wang2023MARS1; van2013Rare).

## Function
MARS1, or methionyl-tRNA synthetase 1, is a critical enzyme in protein synthesis, responsible for catalyzing the attachment of methionine to its corresponding tRNA (tRNA^Met) in the cytoplasm. This process, known as aminoacylation, is essential for the initiation of protein translation, as methionine is typically the first amino acid incorporated into nascent proteins (Rubio2020Aminoacyl-tRNA; Jang2023Prediction). MARS1 operates through a two-step enzymatic reaction involving the activation of methionine and its subsequent transfer to tRNA, ensuring the accurate translation of genetic information into proteins (Rubio2020Aminoacyl-tRNA).

Beyond its role in translation, MARS1 is involved in various cellular processes. It stabilizes cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) by forming a complex with heat shock protein 90, which is crucial for cell cycle regulation (Jang2023Prediction; Sung2022Functional). MARS1 also links the DNA damage response to global translation control, particularly after UV-mediated DNA damage, where it undergoes phosphorylation and dissociates from AIMP3 (Jang2023Prediction). These functions highlight MARS1's importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to cellular stress.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MARS1 gene, which encodes methionyl-tRNA synthetase, have been linked to several clinical conditions. These mutations can lead to a multi-organ phenotype characterized by symptoms such as failure to thrive, liver failure, lactic acidosis, aminoaciduria, hypothyroidism, interstitial lung disease, and transfusion-dependent anemia. The mutations significantly reduce the enzyme's activity, impacting its ability to couple methionine to its cognate tRNA, which is crucial for protein biosynthesis (van2013Rare).

MARS1 mutations are also associated with congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), a condition marked by the accumulation of lipoprotein substances within the alveoli, leading to respiratory distress and other systemic symptoms (Alzaid2019MethionyltRNA). Additionally, MARS1 mutations have been implicated in familial trigeminal neuralgia (FTN), where they may contribute to chronic activation of the integrated stress response, leading to peripheral nerve degeneration (Wang2023MARS1).

Furthermore, MARS1 mutations have been linked to non-photosensitive trichothiodystrophy (NPS-TTD), a disorder characterized by brittle hair and nails, ichthyosis, and other clinical symptoms. These mutations result in reduced protein stability and aminoacylation activity, affecting translation in various organs (Botta2021Protein).

## Interactions
Methionyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (MARS1) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in translation and its role in cancer. MARS1 is part of the multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC), which includes eight cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and three auxiliary proteins. Within this complex, MARS1 interacts with EEF1E1, facilitating the transfer of Met-tRNA to the active eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) complex, which is essential for translation initiation (Kong2020Cell‐based).

MARS1 also interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), stabilizing it and promoting cell cycle progression. This interaction is facilitated by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and cell division cycle 37 (CDC37), which assist in the proper folding of CDK4 and its interaction with cyclin D1. The interaction between MARS1 and CDK4 is influenced by methionine binding, as methionine binding-deficient mutants of MARS1 show reduced interaction with CDK4 (Sung2022Functional; Yu2021Aminoacyl-tRNA).

In cancer, MARS1 competes with the tumor suppressor p16 INK4a for binding to CDK4, particularly in p16 INK4a-negative cancers, where MARS1's role in stabilizing CDK4 is more pronounced (Jang2023Prediction; Sung2022Functional).
