# NKPD1

## Overview
The NKPD1 gene encodes the protein NTPase KAP family P-loop domain containing 1, which is a member of the P-loop NTPase superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, playing a significant role in cellular energy transfer and molecular signaling. The NKPD1 protein is characterized by its P-loop NTPase domain, which is crucial for its function in various metabolic pathways within the cytoplasm. These pathways are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting organismal development. The gene's involvement in nucleotide metabolism suggests its broad impact on cellular energy dynamics and signaling pathways, contributing to the regulation of energy-dependent processes and overall metabolic balance (Amin2017Nonsynonymous).

## Structure


## Function
The NKPD1 gene encodes a protein that is involved in essential cellular processes, particularly nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. This protein is characterized by a P-loop NTPase domain, which plays a crucial role in energy transfer and molecular signaling within the cell. The activity of the NKPD1 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, where it participates in various metabolic pathways. These pathways are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting organismal development. The protein's function in healthy human cells is integral to the regulation of energy-dependent processes, contributing to the overall metabolic balance and proper functioning of cellular activities. While the specific molecular mechanisms and pathways involving NKPD1 in healthy cells are not detailed in the provided context, its role in nucleotide metabolism suggests a broad impact on cellular energy dynamics and signaling pathways (Amin2017Nonsynonymous).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NKPD1 gene have been associated with depressive symptoms in European populations. A study by Najaf Amin et al. found a significant association between non-synonymous variations in NKPD1 and increased depressive symptoms. These variations explained 0.9% of the sex-age-adjusted variance of depressive symptoms, which corresponds to 3.8% of the total estimated heritability of depression. The study utilized exome sequencing and genotyping in a genetically isolated population from the Netherlands, known as the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study, and replicated the findings in the Rotterdam Study (Amin2017Nonsynonymous).

The NKPD1 gene is predicted to be involved in the de-novo synthesis of sphingolipids, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. This suggests that alterations in NKPD1 may affect sphingolipid metabolism, contributing to depressive disorders. The research highlights the potential clinical significance of NKPD1 gene mutations in understanding the genetic basis of depression, although the exact mechanisms remain to be further explored (Amin2017Nonsynonymous).
