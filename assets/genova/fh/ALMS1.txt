# ALMS1

## Overview
The ALMS1 gene encodes the ALMS1 centrosome and basal body associated protein, which is integral to the function and structure of primary cilia and centrosomes. This protein is categorized as a centrosomal protein due to its localization and role in microtubule organization and ciliogenesis. ALMS1 is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of ciliary length and morphology, and is essential for proper intracellular signaling and sensory functions. Mutations in the ALMS1 gene are linked to Alström syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by a spectrum of clinical manifestations such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and sensory impairments. The protein's interactions with cytoskeletal components and its regulatory role in signaling pathways like TGF-β/BMP underscore its importance in cellular homeostasis and organismal development (Hearn2005Subcellular; ÁlvarezSatta2021ALMS1).

## Structure
The ALMS1 protein is a large protein consisting of 4,169 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 461 kDa (Braune2017Characterization; Jagger2010Alström). The primary structure includes a large tandem repeat domain with 34 imperfect repetitions of 45 to 50 amino acids, a leucine zipper motif, and a polymorphic strand of glutamic acid and alanine residues near the N-terminus (Braune2017Characterization; Hearn2002Mutation). The C-terminus contains the ALMS motif, which shares sequence similarity with centriolar proteins such as C10orf90 and CEP295, suggesting a role in centrosome targeting (Hearn2018ALMS1; Knorz2010Centriolar).

The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination around the third coiled-coil domain and a DNA damage-regulated phosphorylation site (Hearn2018ALMS1). ALMS1 is expressed in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, with some variants affecting exons 2, 13, and 23, potentially influencing its function (Braune2017Characterization). The protein localizes to centrosomes and basal bodies, implicating it in microtubule organization and ciliary function (Braune2017Characterization; Knorz2010Centriolar).

## Function
The ALMS1 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in various cellular processes, particularly in the formation and function of primary cilia. ALMS1 localizes to centrosomes and basal bodies, structures essential for microtubule organization and ciliogenesis, which are crucial for sensory functions and intracellular signaling (Hearn2005Subcellular; Li2007A). In healthy human cells, ALMS1 is involved in the assembly of primary cilia, affecting their length and morphology. Loss of ALMS1 expression results in longer cilia with aberrant morphologies, impacting cargo transport and signaling cascades regulated by primary cilia (ÁlvarezSatta2021ALMS1).

ALMS1 interacts with cytoskeletal components like α-actinin, suggesting a role in actin remodeling and endocytic recycling, which are crucial for ciliary assembly (ÁlvarezSatta2021ALMS1; Collin2012The). The protein is also a key regulator of the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathways, influencing processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (ÁlvarezSatta2021ALMS1). ALMS1's involvement in these pathways is significant, as aberrant signaling is associated with various pathologies, including Alström syndrome (ÁlvarezSatta2021ALMS1). Overall, ALMS1 is essential for maintaining cellular structure and function, contributing to organismal development and homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALMS1 gene are primarily associated with Alström syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This syndrome is characterized by a range of symptoms, including early-onset obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sensorineural hearing loss, and cone-rod retinal dystrophy leading to blindness (Marshall2007Alström; Collin2002Mutations). The condition also involves cardiomyopathy, multi-organ fibrosis, and progressive hepatic and renal failure (Marshall2007Alström; Hearn2018ALMS1). 

The ALMS1 gene encodes a protein that is crucial for ciliary function, and its mutations often result in nonsense or frameshift variations, leading to premature protein truncation (Hearn2005Subcellular; Marshall2007Alström). These mutations disrupt normal cellular processes, contributing to the multisystemic manifestations of Alström syndrome (Hearn2018ALMS1). 

There is little evidence of a direct genotype-phenotype correlation, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors may influence the clinical presentation of the syndrome (Hearn2018ALMS1). The study of ALMS1 mutations provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying related conditions, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, due to its role in ciliary and centrosome function (Hearn2005Subcellular; Collin2002Mutations).

## Interactions
ALMS1 is associated with the centrosome and basal bodies, where it plays a role in centrosome cohesion and ciliary function. It colocalizes with the centrosome cohesion protein C-Nap1 at the proximal ends of centrioles, suggesting a potential interaction that is crucial for maintaining the intercentriolar link (Knorz2010Centriolar). Although direct physical interaction between ALMS1 and C-Nap1 has not been demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitation, ALMS1 is required for the localization of C-Nap1 to centrioles, indicating an indirect interaction possibly mediated by other proteins or mechanisms (Knorz2010Centriolar).

ALMS1 also appears to interact functionally with PCM1, a component of centriolar satellites involved in intracellular transport to the centrosome. Depletion of ALMS1 disrupts PCM1 granule distribution and reduces centrosomal levels of PCM1-dependent proteins, such as pericentrin, suggesting a role in PCM1-based intracellular transport (Knorz2010Centriolar). However, PCM1 depletion does not significantly affect C-Nap1 levels, indicating that ALMS1's role in centrosome cohesion may involve additional pathways or factors (Knorz2010Centriolar).

In Drosophila, the ALMS1 homolog Alms1 interacts with the cartwheel protein Sas-6, functioning downstream to maintain centriole engagement during meiosis. This interaction is crucial for preventing premature centriole disengagement and ensuring proper cell division (Hou2023Alström).
