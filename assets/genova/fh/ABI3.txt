# ABI3

## Overview
ABI3 is a gene that encodes the ABI family member 3 protein, which is a crucial component of the WAVE complex involved in actin polymerization. This protein is primarily expressed in microglia, the immune cells of the brain, and plays a significant role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, impacting cellular processes such as movement, stability, and signaling. Unlike other members of the ABI family, ABI3 uniquely inhibits the WAVE complex, thereby modulating its ability to promote actin polymerization (Turner2022Identification). The ABI3 protein is characterized by several domains, including an SH3 domain, and is subject to regulation through phosphorylation at specific sites. Variations in the ABI3 gene, including splice variants and mutations, have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, where it may influence amyloid-beta clearance and tau pathology (Conway2018ABI3; Satoh2017Microglia). Additionally, ABI3 has been implicated in cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Fu2023Unveiling).

## Structure
The ABI3 gene encodes a protein that is a component of the WAVE complex, which regulates actin polymerization. The prototypic ABI3 protein consists of 366 amino acids and includes several domains and phosphorylation sites. Notably, exons 2 to 4 encode the ABI-homologous region, while exons 7 and 8 encode an SH3 domain, which is involved in protein-protein interactions (Turner2022Identification). The protein may be regulated by phosphorylation at specific sites, including S213, S216, Y341, and S342 (Turner2022Identification).

Several splice variant isoforms of ABI3 have been identified, particularly those involving exon 6. These isoforms include: (i) an isoform retaining the first three base pairs of exon 6, resulting in the loss of Ser216; (ii) an isoform lacking the first 69 base pairs of exon 6; and (iii) an isoform lacking exon 6 entirely, leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon (Turner2022Identification). The full-length ABI3 and certain isoforms are expressed in a dispersed punctate pattern within the cytosol, while the D-Exon6 isoform forms larger aggregates, suggesting potential functional differences (Turner2022Identification). These structural variations may influence the protein's function and its role in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.

## Function
The ABI3 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which is crucial for cellular processes such as movement, stability, and signaling. The ABI3 protein is primarily expressed in microglia, the immune cells of the brain, and is a component of the WAVE complex, which regulates actin polymerization by recruiting cytosolic G-actin and integrating it into the cytoskeletal structure (Turner2022Identification). Unlike other ABI family members, ABI3 uniquely inhibits the WAVE complex, affecting its ability to promote actin polymerization (Turner2022Identification).

In healthy human cells, ABI3's involvement in actin polymerization suggests its participation in cellular processes requiring cytoskeletal rearrangement, such as cell movement and stability (Turner2022Identification). The protein is active in the cytoplasm, appearing in a dispersed cytosolic localization rather than colocalizing with actin (Turner2022Identification). Although the specific function of ABI3 in healthy cells beyond actin polymerization is not fully detailed, its expression is restricted to microglia, indicating a potential role in immune responses and possibly in the early stages of clearing amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease (Turner2022Identification).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ABI3 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ABI3_rs616338-T variant is associated with an increased risk of AD, particularly in Caucasian populations, where it shows a significant association with the disease (Conway2018ABI3). The S209F variant of ABI3 is also linked to an increased risk of AD, affecting the phosphorylation of the ABI3 protein, which may render it functionally inactive (Ibanez2022Deletion; Turner2022Identification). 

ABI3 is primarily expressed in microglia, the brain's immune cells, and plays a role in regulating immune responses. In AD, microglia expressing ABI3 are involved in amyloid-beta clearance and may influence tau pathology, key features of the disease (Ibanez2022Deletion; Satoh2017Microglia). Deletion of the ABI3 gene in mouse models has been shown to exacerbate AD-related neuropathology, suggesting its protective role against disease progression (Karahan2023The; Smith2022Deletion).

Beyond neurodegenerative diseases, ABI3 has been linked to cardiovascular conditions, including atherosclerosis, where it regulates macrophage senescence and the NF-κB signaling pathway (Fu2023Unveiling).
