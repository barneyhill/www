# SDCBP2

## Overview
SDCBP2, or syndecan binding protein 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly through its interactions with other proteins. The protein encoded by SDCBP2 is categorized as a scaffolding protein, which plays a crucial role in organizing and stabilizing protein complexes within the cell. It is known for its involvement in cellular signaling pathways, including those related to xenobiotic metabolism and viral infections. The protein's ability to interact with multiple partners, such as bisphosphate nucleotidase (BPNT1) and the human T-cell leukemia virus Tax oncoprotein, highlights its significance in both normal cellular functions and disease mechanisms (Hui2013Predicting; Maseko2021Structural).

## Structure


## Function


## Interactions
SDCBP2, also known as syndecan binding protein 2, is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. One notable interaction involves the SDCBP2-1 domain, which has been predicted to interact with bisphosphate nucleotidase (BPNT1) in the context of xenobiotic metabolism. This interaction suggests a potential role for SDCBP2 in catalyzing foreign compounds within the xenobiotic metabolism pathway, a novel theme not previously reported in known interaction networks (Hui2013Predicting).

SDCBP2 is also implicated in the interaction with the human T-cell leukemia virus Tax oncoprotein through its PDZ domains. This interaction is significant for the transformation ability of HTLV-1 and its cell-to-cell transmission. The study highlights the potential of targeting virus-host interactions, such as the one between Tax-1 and syntenin-1, to develop antiviral therapies that minimize drug resistance (Maseko2021Structural).

These interactions underscore the diverse roles of SDCBP2 in cellular signaling and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms, including its participation in xenobiotic metabolism and viral infection pathways.
