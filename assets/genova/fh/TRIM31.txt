# TRIM31

## Overview
TRIM31 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 31, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family. This family is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which are essential for its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Ding2024An; Ra2016TRIM31). The TRIM31 protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and is associated with mitochondria, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as autophagy and immune response (Sugiura2008Characterization). It is involved in the regulation of autophagic pathways, particularly in the intestinal epithelium, and interacts with key proteins like p53 and the NLRP3 inflammasome, influencing tumor suppression and immune responses (Guo2021Loss; Ra2016TRIM31). TRIM31's expression and function have been implicated in various cancers, where it can act as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the context, making it a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment (Guo2021Loss; Ding2024An).

## Structure
TRIM31 is a protein that belongs to the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, characterized by a RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These domains are integral to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, with the RING finger domain playing a crucial role in dimerization and activation of the ligase activity (Ding2024An; Ra2016TRIM31). The coiled-coil domain is responsible for oligomerization, which may facilitate its association with cellular structures such as the mitochondrial outer membrane (Sugiura2008Characterization).

TRIM31 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, with some association with mitochondria, although it lacks a specific mitochondrial targeting sequence (Sugiura2008Characterization). The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination and palmitoylation. Palmitoylation, particularly on cysteine residues, is suggested to be critical for its membrane association and function in autophagy (Ra2016TRIM31).

TRIM31 exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, including TRIM31a, TRIM31b, and a novel variant TRIM31g. These isoforms retain the RING finger domain but may lack other domains such as the coiled-coil domain, affecting their functional properties (Sugiura2008Characterization).

## Function
TRIM31 is a protein that plays a significant role in promoting autophagy in intestinal cells through an Atg5/Atg7-independent pathway. This alternative autophagy pathway is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against pathogenic bacterial infections in the intestinal epithelium. TRIM31 interacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in a palmitoylation-dependent manner, facilitating the formation of autolysosomes, which are essential for the removal of invasive bacteria from intestinal epithelial cells (Ra2016TRIM31).

TRIM31 is localized in mitochondria and is involved in the formation of autophagic structures, particularly those originating from mitochondria. It induces the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, a marker of autophagy, even without starvation, and is found in autophagic membranes (Ra2016TRIM31). The protein's function is influenced by its palmitoylation, which is critical for its membrane association and autophagic activity (Ra2016TRIM31).

TRIM31 also plays a role in immune responses by facilitating the clearance of invasive bacteria and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its expression is upregulated in response to bacterial invasion, indicating its involvement in immune defense mechanisms (Ra2016TRIM31).

## Clinical Significance
TRIM31 is implicated in various cancers, acting as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending on the cancer type. In gastric cancer, TRIM31 is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis, influencing pathways related to cell cycle regulation and oxidative stress (Ding2024An). Its expression correlates with chemotherapy sensitivity, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for treatment response (Ding2024An).

In pancreatic cancer, TRIM31 overexpression contributes to chemoresistance against gemcitabine by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is linked to poor survival outcomes (Yu2018Oncogenic). This overexpression sustains NF-κB activation through the ubiquitination of TRAF2, enhancing cancer cell survival (Yu2018Oncogenic).

Conversely, in breast cancer, TRIM31 acts as a tumor suppressor. It is downregulated in cancer tissues, and its low expression is associated with worse clinical outcomes. TRIM31 stabilizes and activates the tumor suppressor protein p53, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Guo2021Loss).

In glioma, TRIM31 is overexpressed, promoting tumor proliferation and invasiveness through the NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways, and is linked to poor prognosis (Giannopoulou2022Emerging). These findings highlight TRIM31's dual role in cancer, with its expression levels serving as potential biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targets.

## Interactions
TRIM31, a member of the tripartite motif-containing protein family, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. One significant interaction is with the tumor suppressor protein p53. TRIM31 directly binds to p53, stabilizing and activating it by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination and inhibiting K48-linked ubiquitination. This interaction disrupts the MDM2-p53 complex, preventing p53 degradation and enhancing its tumor suppressor functions in breast cancer cells (Guo2021Loss).

TRIM31 also interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome, a component of the innate immune response. It promotes the proteasomal degradation of NLRP3 through K48-linked ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting inflammasome activation. This interaction is mediated by the second C-terminal coiled-coil domain of TRIM31 and the PYD domain of NLRP3 (Song2016The).

Additionally, TRIM31 interacts with p52 Shc, a signal transducer, although this interaction does not involve ubiquitination or affect p52 Shc stability. Instead, TRIM31 suppresses Src-induced anchorage-independent growth, suggesting a role in modulating c-Src signaling (Watanabe2009TRIM31).
