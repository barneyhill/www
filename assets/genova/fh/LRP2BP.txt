# LRP2BP

## Overview
LRP2BP, or LRP2 binding protein, is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in relation to the megalin receptor, which is essential for endocytosis and signal transduction. The protein encoded by LRP2BP is characterized by its ankyrin repeat domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions, and phosphorylation sites that suggest regulatory roles through phosphorylation. LRP2BP is expressed in several cell types, including ciliated and endothelial cells, where it is implicated in maintaining cell integrity and function. It plays a role in synaptic signaling, especially in the retina, and is involved in cellular responses to mechanical stress. Clinically, LRP2BP has been associated with conditions such as systemic sclerosis and autism spectrum disorder, highlighting its potential significance in disease pathogenesis (Lin2018Allelespecific; Coan2018Exploring; Pu2021ExomeWide; Woods2018A).

## Function
LRP2BP (LRP2 binding protein) is involved in several cellular processes, primarily related to its role as a scaffold protein that interacts with the megalin receptor, which is crucial for endocytosis and signal transduction. This interaction suggests that LRP2BP may play a role in synaptic signaling, particularly in the retina, where it is localized to the dendrites and axon terminals of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) (Woods2018A). LRP2BP is also expressed in ciliated cells across various anatomical sites, indicating a potential role in cellular structures associated with cilia, although its specific function in ciliary processes remains unclear (Coan2018Exploring).

In the context of endothelial cells, LRP2BP is implicated in maintaining cell integrity and function. It is suggested to influence tight junction integrity, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, which are critical for endothelial cell health and function (Pu2021ExomeWide). Additionally, LRP2BP is involved in cellular responses to mechanical stress, as evidenced by its downregulation in kidney proximal tubule cells under shear stress conditions, which may affect cell differentiation and function (Park2020Transcriptional).

## Clinical Significance
The LRP2BP gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In systemic sclerosis (SSc), a multisystem autoimmune disease, LRP2BP is identified as a susceptibility gene associated with endothelial injury. The expression of LRP2BP is significantly lower in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of SSc patients, which may contribute to endothelial dysfunction by affecting tight junctions, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis in microvascular endothelial cells (Pu2021ExomeWide).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), LRP2BP exhibits a mono-to-biallelic switch in expression in the prefrontal cortex of affected individuals. This change in expression pattern is significant and may provide insights into the pathogenesis of ASD, suggesting that dysregulated allele-specific expression of LRP2BP could contribute to the disorder (Lin2018Allelespecific).

While LRP2BP was investigated in the context of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), no significant differences in its expression levels were observed between patients and controls, indicating it may not play a significant role in FSHD pathology (Klooster2009Comprehensive).

## Interactions
LRP2BP (LRP2 binding protein) is involved in several interactions with other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It acts as a scaffold protein that binds and recruits proteins to the megalin receptor, which is crucial for endocytosis and signal transduction. LRP2BP interacts with the PKCα-binding protein (PICK1), suggesting its involvement in rod bipolar cell (RBC) signal transduction through interactions with megalin and PICK1 (Woods2018A).

In the context of vascular biology, LRP2BP is known to interact with the long noncoding RNA PR11-714G18.1. This interaction suppresses vascular cell migration in human vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, indicating a regulatory role in cellular processes (Zhang2020Predicting).

LRP2BP contains four ankyrin repeat domains, which are indicative of its role in protein-protein interactions. It also has two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites and three protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, suggesting potential regulatory interactions through phosphorylation (Coan2018Exploring). Despite these predicted interactions, direct evidence of LRP2BP's function in these contexts remains limited.
