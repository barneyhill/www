# BCO1

## Overview
The BCO1 gene encodes the enzyme beta-carotene oxygenase 1, a member of the carotenoid cleavage oxygenase (CCO) family, which is crucial for the conversion of dietary provitamin A carotenoids into vitamin A. This enzyme is characterized by a conserved seven-bladed beta-propeller fold and functions as a monomer with a molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa (Sui2013Structural; Harrison2020Enzymology). Beta-carotene oxygenase 1 catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of beta-carotene at the central 15,15' double bond, producing retinal, a precursor of vitamin A (Lindqvist2005Cell). The enzyme is primarily active in the small intestine but is also expressed in other tissues, contributing to local vitamin A synthesis (Gong2017Inhibition). BCO1's activity is essential for maintaining adequate vitamin A levels, which are vital for vision, immune response, and cellular differentiation (Harrison2020Enzymology). Additionally, BCO1 is implicated in lipid metabolism and may influence metabolic and eye diseases, as well as cancer biology, where it has potential therapeutic implications (Kim2019βCarotene; Harrison2020Enzymology).

## Structure
The BCO1 protein, also known as beta-carotene oxygenase 1, is a member of the carotenoid cleavage oxygenase (CCO) family. It is characterized by a conserved seven-bladed beta-propeller fold, which is a common structural motif among CCOs (Daruwalla2020Structural; Sui2013Structural). This structure includes a central iron (Fe2+) cofactor coordinated by four conserved histidine residues, essential for its catalytic activity (Poliakov2020Evolutionary; Sui2013Structural). The beta-propeller structure is rigid and facilitates the enzyme's interaction with its lipophilic substrates, such as beta-carotene, by allowing membrane penetration and substrate extraction (Sui2013Structural).

BCO1 functions primarily as a monomer with a molecular weight of approximately 60 kDa (Harrison2020Enzymology). While specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided, the enzyme's activity as a monomer suggests it does not form large complexes with other proteins. The enzyme's substrate specificity is influenced by its active site configuration, which is adapted to cleave beta-carotene at the central 15,15' double bond, producing retinal (Sui2013Structural; Harrison2020Enzymology). The presence of splice variant isoforms and potential post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may further modulate its function and structural properties.

## Function
The BCO1 gene encodes the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase, which plays a crucial role in the conversion of dietary provitamin A carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, into vitamin A. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the central 15,15' carbon-carbon double bond of beta-carotene, resulting in the production of two molecules of retinaldehyde (retinal) (Lindqvist2005Cell; Harrison2020Enzymology). Retinal can be further converted to retinol (vitamin A) by a reductive retinal reductase enzyme present in the same cell (Lindqvist2005Cell). BCO1 is primarily active in the epithelial cells of the small intestine mucosa, but it is also expressed in other tissues such as the liver, kidney, and lung, where it contributes to local vitamin A synthesis (Lindqvist2005Cell; Gong2017Inhibition).

BCO1's activity is essential for maintaining adequate levels of vitamin A, which is vital for various physiological functions, including vision, immune response, and cellular differentiation (Harrison2020Enzymology). The enzyme's substrate specificity allows it to cleave carotenoids with an unsubstituted beta-ring, such as alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin, but not xanthophylls like zeaxanthin or lutein (Harrison2020Enzymology). BCO1's role extends beyond vitamin A synthesis, as it is also implicated in lipid metabolism and may influence metabolic and eye diseases (Harrison2020Enzymology).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the BCO1 gene have been linked to several health conditions. Genetic polymorphisms in BCO1 are associated with variations in plasma levels of carotenoids, such as β-carotene and lycopene, which can influence the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a blinding disease (WidjajaAdhi2015A). Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BCO1, such as rs12934922 and rs6564851, have been shown to affect plasma carotenoid levels, potentially impacting carotenoid absorption and metabolism (Moran2019Single). The rs6564851 variant is also associated with lipid metabolism, influencing cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which may contribute to conditions like hypertriglyceridemia (RiveraParedez2022Association).

BCO1 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in neuroblastoma, where its overexpression can inhibit cancer cell stemness and metastasis by down-regulating cancer stem cell markers and reducing cell migration and invasion (Kim2019βCarotene). These findings suggest that BCO1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in cancer treatment due to its role in regulating differentiation-related microRNAs and its anti-metastatic properties (Kim2019βCarotene).
