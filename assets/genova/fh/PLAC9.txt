# PLAC9

## Overview
PLAC9 is a gene located on chromosome 10q22.3 that encodes the placenta associated 9 protein, which is predominantly extracellular and involved in various cellular processes. The protein consists of 97 amino acids and features a signal peptide, indicating its role in secretory pathways. PLAC9 is highly conserved across species, suggesting its functional importance. It plays a significant role in regulating cell proliferation and motility, particularly in human bronchial epithelial cells, by influencing the expression of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These functions imply that PLAC9 may contribute to cellular homeostasis and could be implicated in lung-associated diseases, including lung cancer, where its expression is notably altered (Ouyang2018Placentaspecific; Wang2021Proteomic).

## Structure
The PLAC9 protein is encoded by the human gene located on chromosome 10q22.3. It consists of 97 amino acids, with a primary structure that includes a signal peptide at the N-terminus, spanning amino acids 1 to 23, as predicted by SignalP 4.0 software (Ouyang2018Placentaspecific). The secondary structure of PLAC9 features two helices and two coils, indicating a combination of alpha-helical and coiled regions (Ouyang2018Placentaspecific). The protein is predicted to be predominantly extracellular, with a 66.7% probability of extracellular localization, as suggested by PSORT II analysis (Ouyang2018Placentaspecific).

The tertiary structure of PLAC9 is not detailed in the available sources, but its potential extracellular role is supported by the presence of a signal peptide, which is typical for secretory proteins. The protein's sequence is highly conserved between mouse and human, with 73% identity over 98 residues, suggesting functional importance (GalavizHernandez2003Plac8). There is no information available on the quaternary structure, specific domains, or post-translational modifications of PLAC9. The protein's role in cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and motility, has been studied, but these aspects do not directly inform its molecular structure (Wang2021Proteomic).

## Function
PLAC9, a gene encoding placenta-specific protein 9, is involved in several cellular processes, particularly in human bronchial epithelial cells. It plays a role in regulating cell proliferation and motility. Overexpression of PLAC9 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing S phase arrest, which is associated with altered expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), such as decreased levels of cyclin D3, cyclin E2, CDK2, and CDK4, and increased levels of cell cycle inhibitors like p21 Waf/cip1 and myt1 (Wang2021Proteomic). 

PLAC9 also enhances cell motility, as evidenced by increased cell migration and invasion in assays. This is linked to changes in the expression of proteins related to cell motility, including increased E-cadherin and decreased vimentin levels, which are key markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Wang2021Proteomic). The protein is thought to be secreted, with localization studies indicating its presence in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, suggesting a role in secretory pathways (Ouyang2018Placentaspecific). These functions suggest that PLAC9 may have a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and could be involved in lung-associated diseases (Wang2021Proteomic).

## Clinical Significance
The PLAC9 gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung diseases, particularly lung cancer. Studies have shown that PLAC9 expression is significantly decreased in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared to normal lung tissues, suggesting a potential role in lung epithelial pathogenesis (Wang2021Proteomic). Overexpression of PLAC9 in human bronchial epithelial cells has been found to inhibit cell proliferation and induce S-phase arrest, while simultaneously enhancing cell motility, including migration and invasion. These effects are associated with changes in the expression of cell cycle proteins and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, such as cyclins, CDKs, E-cadherin, and vimentin (Wang2020Proteomic; Wang2021Proteomic). The dual role of PLAC9 in inhibiting proliferation and promoting motility suggests it may act as a tumor suppressor and could be involved in the progression of lung cancer (Wang2020Proteomic; Wang2021Proteomic). However, the clinical significance of PLAC9 gene mutations or specific expression alterations in other diseases has not been extensively studied, and further research is needed to clarify its role in other pathological conditions (Wang2021Proteomic).

## Interactions
PLAC9, or placenta associated 9, is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in human bronchial epithelial cells. Proteomic analyses have identified numerous interactions between PLAC9 and other proteins, highlighting its role in cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and motility. Overexpression of PLAC9 in these cells leads to the downregulation of key cell cycle proteins such as c-Myc, cyclin D3, cyclin E2, CDK2, and CDK4, while increasing the levels of cell cycle inhibitors like p21 Waf/cip1 and myt1 (Wang2021Proteomic). This suggests that PLAC9 may interact with these proteins to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing S-phase arrest (Wang2020Proteomic).

PLAC9 also influences cell motility, as evidenced by increased cell migration and invasion. This is associated with changes in the expression of proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as increased E-cadherin and decreased vimentin levels (Wang2021Proteomic). These interactions suggest a complex role for PLAC9 in modulating cell motility and potentially participating in EMT processes. The protein-protein interaction network analysis using STRING identified 714 differentially expressed proteins, with 587 interactive proteins related to cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell motility, further supporting PLAC9's involvement in these cellular processes (Wang2021Proteomic).
