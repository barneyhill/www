# OR2T11

## Overview
The OR2T11 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 11, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in the detection of specific odorants, particularly low-molecular-weight thiols. This receptor is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, a hallmark of GPCRs, and is notably responsive to copper ions, which are crucial for its activation (Li2016Smelling). The protein's ability to bind copper ions at specific sites enhances its sensitivity to certain sulfur-containing compounds, making it unique among human olfactory receptors for its strong response to odorizers like tert-butyl mercaptan (TBM) (Block2017The). OR2T11's function is significant in olfactory sensory neurons, contributing to the detection and transduction of environmental odorants to the olfactory bulb (Block2017The). The gene's expression has been linked to various physiological and pathological conditions, including reproductive health and psychological disorders, highlighting its potential importance in both sensory perception and broader biological processes (Chen2016Expression; Karuthadurai2022Sperm).

## Structure
The human olfactory receptor OR2T11 is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs (Li2016Smelling). The receptor is involved in detecting low-molecular-weight thiols and is notably responsive to copper ions, which play a crucial role in its activation (Li2016Smelling). OR2T11 has two identified copper-binding sites. Site 1 involves residues Met115, Cys238, and His241, forming a trigonal planar configuration with Cu(I) near the cytoplasmic region, which rearranges to a distorted tetrahedral configuration upon ligand binding. Site 2 involves residues Met56, Met133, Arg135, and Cys138, with Cu(I) binding in a tetrahedral coordination (Li2016Smelling; Haag2019Coppermediated).

The receptor's structural stability is supported by a conserved disulfide bond, which is likely critical for its function (Block2017The). The presence of specific amino acids, such as cysteine, histidine, and methionine, is essential for metal binding and receptor function (Block2017The). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, may also influence the receptor's activity, although specific details are not provided in the context.

## Function
The human gene OR2T11 encodes an olfactory receptor protein that plays a crucial role in the detection of low molecular weight alkanethiols, such as ethanethiol and 2-methyl-2-propanethiol (TBM), which are used as odorizers in liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas. OR2T11 is the only human receptor identified to have a strong response to TBM, and this response is notably enhanced by the presence of copper ions (Block2017The). The receptor also responds to a variety of other low molecular weight monothiols and some dithiols, but not to hydrogen sulfide or longer straight-chain thiols. The receptor's response is specific to certain metals, as it responds to silver compounds like AgNO3 but not to others like AuCl3 or ZnSO4 (Block2017The).

OR2T11 is involved in the detection of sulfur compounds, including cyclic and acyclic sulfides, with its response enhanced by copper and silver ions. This suggests a role for metals in the olfactory detection of these compounds (Block2017The). The receptor's function is significant in the context of olfactory sensory neurons, which detect environmental odorants and convey this information to the olfactory bulb (Block2017The).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2T11 gene has been implicated in various conditions due to alterations in its expression levels. In breeding bulls, OR2T11 is significantly upregulated in cases of poor semen quality. This upregulation is associated with the dysregulation of genes related to olfactory processes, suggesting a potential link between altered expression of OR2T11 and reduced semen quality (Karuthadurai2022Sperm). The gene is involved in olfactory transduction pathways and is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, which may influence sperm function and quality (Karuthadurai2022Sperm).

In humans, OR2T11 is upregulated in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with a significant fold-change in expression. This suggests a role for OR2T11 in the olfactory-related pathways that are differentially expressed in PTSD cases (Chen2016Expression). However, the specific clinical implications of OR2T11 mutations or expression alterations in humans are not well-documented, and further research is needed to understand their broader impact on health and disease. The current studies highlight the potential significance of OR2T11 in both reproductive and psychological conditions, although direct links to specific diseases remain to be fully elucidated.
