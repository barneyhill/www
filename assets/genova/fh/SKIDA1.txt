# SKIDA1

## Overview
SKIDA1 is a gene that encodes the protein SKI/DACH domain containing 1, which is involved in various cellular processes. This protein is characterized by the presence of a SKI/DACH domain, which suggests a role in transcriptional regulation and developmental pathways. Although the precise functions of SKIDA1 are still being elucidated, it is implicated in the modulation of gene expression and may interact with other proteins to influence cellular growth and differentiation. Research into SKIDA1 has highlighted its potential involvement in certain signaling pathways, which could have implications for understanding its role in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
