# SPAG7

## Overview
The SPAG7 gene encodes the sperm associated antigen 7 protein, which is integral to various biological processes, particularly in the context of male reproductive health. As a member of the sperm-associated antigens (SPAGs), the SPAG7 protein is crucial for sperm motility, structural integrity, and cell signaling, playing a significant role in spermatogenesis and sperm function (AbuHalima2023Expression). The protein is characterized by the presence of two nuclear localization signals and an R3H domain, which suggests its involvement in nucleic acid interactions, potentially in response to viral infections or cellular DNA/RNA dynamics (Bens2014SPAG7). Beyond its reproductive functions, SPAG7 is expressed in various human tissues, indicating its broader physiological roles, possibly including immune responses (Bens2014SPAG7). The protein's interactions with other proteins, such as ABHD16A, and its involvement in ciliopathy-associated pathways further underscore its importance in cellular processes and disease mechanisms (Leonhard2023Ciliopathyassociated).

## Structure


## Function
The SPAG7 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in several biological processes, particularly in sperm production and maturation. It is part of the sperm-associated antigens (SPAGs), a group of proteins important for sperm motility, structural integrity, and cell signaling. SPAG7 is expressed in male germ cells, especially during the development of the acrosome in round and elongating spermatids, contributing to the structural integrity of the sperm tail and overall sperm function (AbuHalima2023Expression).

SPAG7 contains two nuclear localization signals and an R3H domain, which is predicted to bind single-stranded DNA or RNA in a sequence-specific manner. This suggests a potential role in responding to viral infections or free cellular DNAs or RNAs (Bens2014SPAG7). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and flagella of sperm cells, contributing to their movement and reproductive success (AbuHalima2023Expression).

In addition to its role in spermatogenesis, SPAG7 is expressed in various human tissues, including lymph nodes and tonsils, indicating its involvement in broader physiological functions, possibly related to immune responses (Bens2014SPAG7).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SPAG7 gene have been linked to several health conditions. In mice, SPAG7 deficiency leads to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to placental insufficiency, resulting in underweight births and a lower birth rate. Surviving SPAG7-deficient mice often develop obesity and insulin resistance in adulthood, attributed to decreased energy expenditure and impaired skeletal muscle function (Flaherty2024SPAG7). This suggests that SPAG7 plays a crucial role in fetal development and metabolic health.

In humans, SPAG7 has been identified as a candidate gene for the periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and adenopathy (PFAPA) syndrome, an autoinflammatory disorder. This association was made through the identification of a chromosomal translocation affecting SPAG7 in a patient with PFAPA syndrome (Bens2014SPAG7). Additionally, SPAG7 expression levels have been linked to male infertility. Lower expression of SPAG7 and certain regulatory microRNAs in seminal plasma have been observed in subfertile men, suggesting a potential role in sperm function and fertility outcomes (AbuHalima2023Expression). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SPAG7 in both reproductive and systemic health conditions.

## Interactions
SPAG7, or sperm associated antigen 7, is known to participate in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. The SPAG7 protein contains two nuclear localization signals and an R3H domain, which is predicted to bind single-stranded DNA or RNA in a sequence-specific manner. This suggests a potential role in cellular responses to viral infections or DNA/RNA interactions (Bens2014SPAG7).

SPAG7 has been shown to physically interact with the ABHD16A protein, encoded by the BAT5 gene, which is located in the HLA gene cluster. This interaction suggests that SPAG7 may be part of a group of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of auto-inflammatory disorders (Bens2014SPAG7).

In the context of ciliopathy-associated mutations, SPAG7 was identified as a potential interactor in the IFT140 interactome analysis. However, the specific function of SPAG7 in this interaction remains unknown. The interaction between SPAG7 and IFT140 was noted to be reduced in the presence of the E790K mutation in IFT140, indicating a possible role in the stability of protein interaction networks (Leonhard2023Ciliopathyassociated).
