# CSNK2B

## Overview
The CSNK2B gene encodes the beta subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. The CK2β protein, produced by CSNK2B, functions as a regulatory subunit within the CK2 holoenzyme, which is composed of two catalytic alpha subunits and two regulatory beta subunits. This configuration is essential for the enzyme's full activity and specificity. CK2β is characterized by a zinc finger motif that facilitates dimerization, a critical step for the formation of the tetrameric holoenzyme complex (Chantalat1999Crystal; Unni2022Predictive). Beyond its role in the CK2 holoenzyme, CK2β also engages in CK2-independent interactions, influencing various signaling pathways and cellular functions (LITCHFIELD2003Protein). Mutations in CSNK2B have been linked to Poirier-Bienvenu Neurodevelopmental Syndrome, underscoring the gene's clinical significance (Zhang2022Splicing).

## Structure
The CSNK2B gene encodes the CK2β protein, a regulatory subunit of the protein kinase CK2 holoenzyme. The CK2β protein is involved in modulating the substrate specificity and stability of the CK2α catalytic subunit. It contains a conserved zinc finger motif that facilitates dimerization, forming permanent dimers due to its effective dimerization surface (Unni2022Predictive). The CK2 holoenzyme is formed by the interaction of CK2β dimers with two CK2α subunits, mediated by specific contact points (Unni2022Predictive).

The CK2β protein includes an acidic loop domain, which functions as a pseudosubstrate and is involved in oligomerization, polyamine binding, and polybasic peptide binding. The Zn2+ binding motif is highlighted by key cysteine residues (109, 114, 137, 140) essential for zinc binding (Unni2022Predictive). Post-translational modifications of CK2β include acetylation, glycosylation, monomethylation, nitrosylation, and sumoylation (Unni2022Predictive).

Splice site mutations in CSNK2B can lead to exon skipping, resulting in unstable mutant transcripts targeted for nonsense-mediated RNA decay. This process significantly reduces CSNK2B expression and affects the protein's function, particularly in the brain (Poirier2017CSNK2B).

## Function
The CSNK2B gene encodes the regulatory β subunit of protein kinase CK2, a serine/threonine kinase involved in various cellular processes. In healthy human cells, CK2β plays a crucial role in the assembly and stabilization of the CK2 holoenzyme, which is composed of two catalytic α subunits and two regulatory β subunits. This assembly is essential for the enzyme's full activity and function both in vitro and in vivo (Chantalat1999Crystal; Buchou2003Disruption).

CK2β is involved in regulating substrate specificity and possibly the subcellular localization of the CK2 holoenzyme. It contains a zinc finger motif that mediates dimerization, which is necessary for forming the tetrameric structure of CK2 (Chantalat1999Crystal). The β subunit also interacts with various proteins, such as p53 and p21 WAF1, through its acidic domain, influencing cellular signaling and regulation (Chantalat1999Crystal).

CK2β is implicated in cell cycle regulation, cell survival, and apoptosis. It modulates the activity of the catalytic subunit, affecting processes like gene expression, protein synthesis, and cell proliferation (Buchou2003Disruption; LITCHFIELD2003Protein). The β subunit's regulatory functions are essential for maintaining cellular processes and ensuring proper signaling pathways in healthy human cells (Guerra1999Protein).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CSNK2B gene are associated with Poirier-Bienvenu Neurodevelopmental Syndrome (POBINDS), a condition characterized by early-onset epilepsy, developmental delay, hypotonia, and various malformations (Zhang2022Splicing). Over sixty mutations have been identified, including missense, nonsense, splice, and frameshift variants, which can lead to altered protein expression and interactions, potentially causing haploinsufficiency and reduced CK2 holoenzyme activity (Unni2022Predictive; Di2023Haploinsufficiency).

CSNK2B mutations can result in a range of phenotypes, from mild to profound intellectual disability and epilepsy. Variants affecting the zinc finger domain are linked to milder intellectual disabilities and more manageable seizures (Di2023Haploinsufficiency; Zhang2022Splicing). Some mutations lead to exon skipping and premature stop codons, resulting in nonsense-mediated decay of mRNA and loss of protein function (Poirier2017CSNK2B).

The clinical manifestations of CSNK2B mutations include various types of seizures, such as myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, often with early onset (Li2019Germline). Dysmorphic features and growth abnormalities are also common in individuals with POBINDS (Wilke2022Two).

## Interactions
CSNK2B, encoding the beta subunit of casein kinase 2 (CK2), is involved in various protein-protein interactions that regulate its activity and function. CK2β interacts with the catalytic subunit CK2α, forming a tetrameric holoenzyme complex essential for its kinase activity (Unni2022Predictive). This interaction is mediated by a zinc finger motif and a C-terminal domain in CK2β, which are crucial for dimerization and complex formation (LITCHFIELD2003Protein).

CK2β also interacts with several other proteins, influencing cellular processes. It binds to proteins such as nucleolin, Nopp140, FGF-1, FGF-2, Hsp90, Cdc37, tubulin, FAF-1, and CKIP-1, which can alter or stabilize CK2's catalytic activity or target it to specific cellular sites (LITCHFIELD2003Protein). CK2β's interaction with Pin1 and the FACT complex modulates CK2 activity in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (LITCHFIELD2003Protein).

In addition to its role in the CK2 holoenzyme, CK2β has CK2-independent functions. It interacts with c-Mos and A-Raf protein kinases, negatively regulating cell proliferation and maturation processes (LITCHFIELD2003Protein). These interactions highlight the diverse regulatory roles of CK2β in cellular signaling pathways.
