# ULK2

## Overview
ULK2 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2) is a gene that encodes a serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of autophagy, a cellular process critical for maintaining protein homeostasis and cellular health. The ULK2 protein is characterized by its kinase activity, which is essential for the degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, particularly in skeletal muscle tissue. Unlike its paralog ULK1, ULK2 does not directly initiate autophagy but instead plays a pivotal role in preventing the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, thereby safeguarding muscle function and integrity (Fuqua2019ULK2). ULK2 is also implicated in broader metabolic and immune processes, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Demeter2020ULK1). The gene's involvement in various diseases, including glioblastoma and neurodegenerative disorders, underscores its potential as a therapeutic target (VasconcelosFerreira2022ULK; Shukla2014Methylation).

## Structure
ULK2 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase involved in autophagy, characterized by a distinct molecular structure. The primary structure of ULK2 includes an amino-terminal kinase domain, a central proline/serine-rich (PS) domain, and a carboxy-terminal (C) domain (Yan1999Mouse). The kinase domain shares approximately 76% identity with ULK1, indicating a high degree of conservation (Yan1999Mouse). The PS domain is rich in serine and proline residues, although its precise functional role remains unclear (Yan1999Mouse). 

The secondary structure of ULK2 features typical elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its functional conformation. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these elements into a functional kinase, with the kinase domain being crucial for its enzymatic activity (Yan1999Mouse). 

ULK2 can form a dimeric assembly, suggesting a quaternary structure that may facilitate trans autophosphorylation, a regulatory mechanism observed in other kinases (Chaikuad2019Conservation). Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating ULK2's activity (Yan1999Mouse). Splice variants of ULK2 may exist, potentially altering its functional domains and influencing its role in cellular processes.

## Function
ULK2 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2) is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis in skeletal muscle by regulating the degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. It is particularly enriched in skeletal muscle, where it is essential for basal selective protein degradation. This process involves the recognition and sequestration of insoluble ubiquitinated protein aggregates, which are associated with the adaptors sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1, also known as p62) and NBR1 (Fuqua2019ULK2).

ULK2 is distinct from its paralog ULK1, as it does not directly regulate autophagy initiation or the fusion of autophagosomes to lysosomes. Instead, ULK2's role is more focused on preventing the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, which can lead to impaired muscle force and myofiber atrophy if not properly managed (Fuqua2019ULK2). In addition to its role in skeletal muscle, ULK2 is involved in nitrogen compound metabolic processes and is regulated by transcription factors associated with homeostasis and immune responses, indicating its broader role in maintaining metabolic balance and immune function in healthy human cells (Demeter2020ULK1).

## Clinical Significance
ULK2 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 2) plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in autophagy and cellular homeostasis. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ULK2 is often silenced through promoter methylation, leading to its down-regulation. This silencing is crucial for astrocyte transformation and tumor growth, suggesting that ULK2 acts as a tumor suppressor in this context. The restoration of ULK2 expression through methylation inhibitors has been shown to reverse its silencing, indicating a potential therapeutic target for GBM (Shukla2014Methylation).

In colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), ULK2 has been found to harbor somatic frameshift mutations, although these mutations do not show a significant association with tumor grade or stage (Choi2017Intratumoral). In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, ULK2 expression is reduced in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), where its restoration improves motor performance and reduces neuropathology, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (VasconcelosFerreira2022ULK).

ULK2 is also essential for maintaining skeletal muscle health by preventing the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates. Deficiency in ULK2 leads to muscle weakness and atrophy, underscoring its critical role in muscle homeostasis (Fuqua2019ULK2).

## Interactions
ULK2 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing a significant role in autophagy and other cellular processes. It is known to interact with the AAA+ ATPase VCP/p97, which is crucial for the disassembly of stress granules. This interaction is mediated through the phosphorylation of VCP by ULK2, enhancing VCP's ATPase activity and facilitating stress granule resolution (Wang2019ULK1).

ULK2 also interacts with Yes-associated protein (YAP) through a specific PPxY motif, which is essential for binding to the YAP WW domain. This interaction affects ULK2's subcellular localization and autophagic activity, linking it to the Hippo signaling pathway. Mutations in this motif can disrupt the interaction, leading to increased autophagic activity and altered localization (Shin2016Inhibition).

Additionally, ULK2 has distinct protein-protein interaction partners compared to its homolog ULK1. These interactions are involved in various biological processes, including nitrogen compound metabolic processes and immune system-related functions (Demeter2020ULK1). The unique interactions of ULK2 highlight its specific roles in cellular regulation and stress response.
