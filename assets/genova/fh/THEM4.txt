# THEM4

## Overview
THEM4, or thioesterase superfamily member 4, is a gene that encodes a mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase protein involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. The protein, also referred to as CTMP, is primarily localized to the mitochondria, where it plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis. As a member of the thioesterase superfamily, THEM4 is characterized by its enzymatic activity, which involves the hydrolysis of thioester bonds, particularly those of long-chain fatty acids. This protein is also a significant player in the Protein Kinase B (PKB/Akt) signaling pathway, acting as a negative regulator by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation, which has implications for cell survival and proliferation (zhuravleva2013structural; Zhang2021Exosomal). THEM4's involvement in various cellular processes, including its role in cancer progression and response to cellular stress, underscores its potential clinical significance (zhuravleva2013structural; Zhang2021Exosomal).

## Function
THEM4, also known as CTMP, is a mitochondrial acyl-CoA thioesterase involved in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis. It is primarily active in the mitochondria, where it associates with the inner mitochondrial membrane and is released following apoptosis induction, promoting cell death (zhuravleva2013structural). THEM4 has a preference for long-chain fatty acids and is part of the PKB (Protein Kinase B) signaling regulation network, playing a role in mitochondrial fusion processes. This is evidenced by changes in mitochondrial morphology in cells deficient in THEM4 (zhuravleva2013structural).

The protein functions as a homodimer and may form higher-order oligomers in specific mitochondrial environments. Its catalytic machinery, including the HGG motif and Asp/Thr residues, is conserved, suggesting a role in deprotonating water molecules for nucleophilic attack on thioester bonds (zhuravleva2013structural). THEM4 is also implicated in glioblastoma development and ischemia-induced neuronal cell death, highlighting its involvement in cellular stress responses and apoptosis (zhuravleva2013structural). Despite its known roles in these processes, the specific function of THEM4 in healthy human cells remains less clearly defined in the available literature.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
THEM4, also known as thioesterase superfamily member 4, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular signaling pathways. One of the primary interactions of THEM4 is with Protein Kinase B (PKB/Akt), where it acts as a negative regulator. This interaction is significant in the context of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. THEM4's inhibitory effect on Akt is achieved by reducing Akt phosphorylation, thereby blocking downstream signaling pathways that promote cancer progression (zhuravleva2013structural; Zhang2021Exosomal).

In the context of colon cancer, THEM4 is targeted by miR-183-5p, a microRNA enriched in exosomes derived from M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages. This interaction leads to the downregulation of THEM4, which in turn activates the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways, promoting cancer cell proliferation and invasion while inhibiting apoptosis (Zhang2021Exosomal). The binding of miR-183-5p to THEM4 was confirmed through a dual-luciferase reporter assay, demonstrating a direct interaction that results in the modulation of these critical signaling pathways (Zhang2021Exosomal).
