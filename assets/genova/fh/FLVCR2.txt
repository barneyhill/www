# FLVCR2

## Overview
FLVCR2 is a gene that encodes the FLVCR choline and putative heme transporter 2, a protein belonging to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters. This protein is characterized by its role in facilitating the transport of choline and potentially heme across cellular membranes, operating as a uniporter without reliance on sodium or pH gradients (Ri2024Molecular). Structurally, it features a classical MFS transporter fold with twelve transmembrane helices, enabling it to undergo conformational changes necessary for its transport function (Cater2023Structural). FLVCR2 is notably expressed in endothelial cells at the blood-brain barrier, where it plays a crucial role in choline uptake, contributing to brain development and function (Cater2023Structural). Mutations in the FLVCR2 gene are linked to Fowler syndrome, a severe autosomal recessive disorder, and its expression levels have implications in acute myeloid leukemia, highlighting its clinical significance (Su2022The; Santander2020Lack).

## Structure
FLVCR2 is a protein that belongs to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) of transporters, characterized by a classical MFS transporter fold. This fold includes twelve transmembrane helices (TMs) arranged into two pseudo-symmetric six-helix bundles, known as the N-domain and C-domain, connected by a flexible cytoplasmic loop (Cater2023Structural). The structure of FLVCR2 has been determined in both inward-facing and outward-facing conformations using cryo-electron microscopy, with resolutions of 2.49 Å and 2.77 Å, respectively (Cater2023Structural).

In the outward-facing state, FLVCR2 exhibits a large extracellular cavity lined by aromatic, hydrophobic, and polar amino acids, with no charged residues. Choline is coordinated in this cavity by specific residues, including W125 and Y153, through cation-π interactions, and N121 through hydrogen bonding (Cater2023Structural). In the inward-facing state, the choline binding site is surrounded by an 'aromatic cage' formed by W125, Y153, and Y348, with additional hydrogen-bonding interactions provided by M154, Q214, and Q470 (Cater2023Structural).

The protein operates through a rocker-switch mechanism, involving conformational changes between the outward-facing and inward-facing states to facilitate choline transport (Ri2024Molecular). The structural dynamics and substrate specificity of FLVCR2 are crucial for its function as a transporter (Ri2024Molecular).

## Function
FLVCR2 is a gene encoding a protein that functions as a transporter for choline and potentially heme across cellular membranes. In healthy human cells, FLVCR2 is part of the major facilitator superfamily and operates as a uniporter, facilitating the transport of choline and ethanolamine without relying on sodium or pH gradients (Ri2024Molecular). This protein is crucial for maintaining cellular choline homeostasis, which is essential for various physiological processes, including phospholipid synthesis, neurotransmission, and energy metabolism (Cater2023Structural).

FLVCR2 is highly expressed in endothelial cells at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), where it plays a significant role in choline uptake into the brain, contributing to brain development and function (Cater2023Structural). The protein's activity is characterized by a rocker-switch, alternating-access mechanism, transitioning between outward-facing and inward-facing states to facilitate ligand transport (Cater2023Structural; Ri2024Molecular). FLVCR2's function is linked to choline metabolism, and its role in cellular transport is crucial for maintaining brain choline homeostasis and supporting normal brain development (Cater2023Structural; Ri2024Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FLVCR2 gene are associated with Fowler syndrome, also known as proliferative vasculopathy with hydranencephaly-hydrocephaly syndrome (PVHH). This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by severe hydrocephalus, thin cerebral cortex, and glomeruloid vascular structures in the brain, often leading to prenatal lethality (Santander2020Lack; Lalonde2010Unexpected). The mutations in FLVCR2 are typically loss-of-function, with affected individuals usually being compound heterozygotes for two different recessive alleles (Santander2020Lack). 

In addition to its role in PVHH, FLVCR2 expression levels have been linked to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High expression of FLVCR2 is associated with poor overall survival in AML patients and is related to immune cell infiltration and immune response pathways, suggesting its involvement in tumor progression (Su2022The). 

Mouse models have shown that inactivation of Flvcr2 results in impaired brain angiogenesis, leading to vascular malformations similar to those seen in humans with Fowler syndrome, although the blood-brain barrier remains intact (Santander2020Lack). These findings highlight the critical role of FLVCR2 in vascular development and its potential impact on neurological and hematological conditions.

## Interactions
FLVCR2, a protein encoded by the FLVCR2 gene, is involved in various interactions that influence cellular processes. In the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), FLVCR2 has been shown to interact with immune-related proteins such as HMGCR and CORO1A. These interactions are significant as they are involved in regulating T-cell homeostasis, which is crucial for the tumor microenvironment and may influence immunomodulation and the progression of AML (Su2022The).

FLVCR2 is also a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of secondary carriers, which are known for transporting small solutes like calcium. It shares structural similarities with FLVCR1, including 12 membrane-spanning segments and six extracellular loops. Although FLVCR2 does not naturally bind the feline leukemia virus, a single mutation can confer receptor activity for a variant of the virus, indicating its potential for specific protein interactions (Thomas2010Highthroughput).

While the structural studies of FLVCR2 have focused on its role as a choline transporter, these studies do not specifically mention interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids, suggesting that further research is needed to fully elucidate its interaction network (Cater2023Structural).
