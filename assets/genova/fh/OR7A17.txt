# OR7A17

## Overview
OR7A17 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily A member 17, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This protein functions primarily as an olfactory receptor, playing a crucial role in the detection and transduction of odorant signals in the olfactory epithelium. As a transmembrane receptor, it binds specific odor molecules and initiates a neuronal response that contributes to the perception of smell. Beyond its olfactory functions, OR7A17 is expressed in non-chemosensory tissues, such as human keratinocyte cells, where it is involved in regulating cell proliferation and calcium signaling. This suggests that OR7A17 may have broader physiological roles beyond olfaction, potentially impacting cellular processes in various tissues (Kim2021Olfactory).

## Function
OR7A17 is an olfactory receptor gene that encodes a protein involved in the detection of odor molecules. This receptor is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which transduces extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins. In healthy human cells, OR7A17 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it plays a role in the sense of smell by binding specific odorants and initiating a neuronal response that leads to odor perception.

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR7A17 is also expressed in non-chemosensory tissues, such as human keratinocyte cells. In these cells, OR7A17 is involved in regulating cell proliferation. The expression of OR7A17 is downregulated by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which is known to suppress cell proliferation. However, overexpression of OR7A17 in keratinocytes can counteract the antiproliferative effects of ATRA, suggesting that OR7A17 promotes cell proliferation by modulating calcium channel activity, potentially through TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels (Kim2021Olfactory). This indicates that OR7A17 may have broader physiological functions beyond olfaction, contributing to cellular processes such as proliferation and calcium signaling in keratinocytes (Kim2021Olfactory).

## Clinical Significance
The gene OR7A17, encoding an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations are not detailed. Alterations in OR7A17 expression have been associated with the regulation of cell proliferation in human keratinocyte cells, particularly in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. Overexpression of OR7A17 can counteract the antiproliferative effects of ATRA, suggesting its potential role in mitigating adverse effects such as skin irritation and disrupted epidermal barrier function during ATRA therapy (Kim2021Olfactory).

In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), OR7A17 expression has been studied in the choroid plexus, although it is expressed at low levels and no significant regulation related to AD progression has been observed (Alves2024Olfactory). The gene's expression was not detectable in the orbitofrontal cortex of AD patients, indicating it may not play a significant role in this brain region (Alves2023Epigenetic).

OR7A17 has also been identified as a gene with altered connectivity in multiple sclerosis, suggesting a potential association with central nervous system diseases, although specific clinical implications remain unclear (Creanza2016MetaAnalysis).
