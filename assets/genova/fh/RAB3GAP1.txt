# RAB3GAP1

## Overview
RAB3GAP1 is a gene that encodes the catalytic subunit of the RAB3 GTPase activating protein complex, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of RAB3 proteins, a group of small GTPases involved in vesicle trafficking. The protein encoded by RAB3GAP1, known as RAB3 GTPase activating protein catalytic subunit 1, functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) and is crucial for converting RAB3 proteins from their active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state. This conversion is essential for the regulation of neurotransmitter and hormone exocytosis, particularly within the nervous system, where it influences synaptic vesicle release and synaptic plasticity. Additionally, RAB3GAP1 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab18, contributing to endomembrane trafficking and autophagic processes, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and stress response (Takáts2020The; Homma2020Rab; Imagawa2015Two). Mutations in RAB3GAP1 are linked to Warburg Micro syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in neurodevelopmental disorders (Khalesi2021Novel; Koparir2019Revealing).

## Function
The RAB3GAP1 gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the RAB3GAP complex, which is crucial for the regulation of RAB3 proteins, small GTPases involved in vesicle trafficking. This complex, consisting of RAB3GAP1 and the non-catalytic subunit RAB3GAP2, functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that converts RAB3 from its active GTP-bound form to an inactive GDP-bound form. This conversion is essential for the regulation of neurotransmitter and hormone exocytosis, particularly in the nervous system, where it plays a significant role in synaptic vesicle release and synaptic plasticity (MorrisRosendahl2010New; Akkuş2023First; Imagawa2015Two).

RAB3GAP1 is also involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle transport, contributing to the proper functioning of synaptic vesicles and granule secretion. The catalytic activity of RAB3GAP1 is localized in its C-terminal region, and mutations in this gene can lead to a loss of function, affecting these critical cellular processes (MorrisRosendahl2010New). Additionally, RAB3GAP1 acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab18, which is important for endomembrane trafficking and autophagic processes, maintaining cellular homeostasis and response to stress (Takáts2020The; Homma2020Rab).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RAB3GAP1 gene are associated with Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities, ocular manifestations, and other systemic features. These mutations typically result in a loss of function, leading to a range of phenotypic variations observed in WARBM. Common clinical features include microcephaly, intellectual disability, brain malformations, ocular abnormalities such as microphthalmia and congenital cataracts, and spasticity (Khalesi2021Novel; Akkuş2023First; Koparir2019Revealing).

Specific mutations in RAB3GAP1, such as the c.151-5 T > G splicing variant, lead to cryptic splice site activation and exon skipping, resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon. This causes a significant decrease in RAB3GAP1 expression, contributing to the pathogenic effects observed in WARBM (Khalesi2021Novel). Other mutations, like the c.2607-1G>C splice site mutation, are associated with milder phenotypes, while deletion-insertion mutations can lead to more severe manifestations (Koparir2019Revealing).

The RAB3GAP1 gene encodes a protein that is part of a heterodimeric enzyme complex involved in membrane trafficking and neurotransmitter exocytosis. Disruptions in its normal function due to mutations can lead to the clinical features observed in WARBM (Khalesi2021Novel; Wang2022WholeExome).

## Interactions
RAB3GAP1 is a component of the RAB3GAP complex, which includes RAB3GAP2 as a non-catalytic subunit. This complex plays a crucial role in the inactivation of the RAB3 subfamily of proteins, including RAB3A, RAB3B, RAB3C, and RAB3D, by acting as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). RAB3GAP1 specifically catalyzes the conversion of RAB3 proteins from their active GTP-bound state to an inactive GDP-bound state, which is essential for regulating neurotransmitter release and other neurodevelopmental processes (Khalesi2021Novel; Rasnitsyn2017FOXC1).

The RAB3GAP-Rab18 module, which includes RAB3GAP1, is involved in autolysosome maturation through its interaction with the Vps34 Complex I. This interaction is critical for autophagic degradation and maintaining proper lysosome morphology and function. The module affects autolysosome morphology by destabilizing Rab7-positive autophagosomal and late endosomal compartments (Takáts2020The).

FOXC1, a transcription factor, regulates the expression of RAB3GAP1 by interacting with its upstream regions, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation. FOXC1 knockdown leads to decreased RNA and protein levels of RAB3GAP1, indicating its involvement in cellular trafficking processes (Rasnitsyn2017FOXC1).
