# GALC

## Overview
The GALC gene encodes the enzyme galactosylceramidase, a lysosomal hydrolase critical for the degradation of galactolipids, particularly galactosylceramide and psychosine, within the lysosome. This enzyme plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of the myelin sheath, which is essential for proper nerve function in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Galactosylceramidase is synthesized as an inactive precursor and undergoes proteolytic processing to become active, forming a heterotetrameric complex with saposin A (SapA) that is crucial for its enzymatic function. Mutations in the GALC gene can lead to Krabbe disease, a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by demyelination and neurological dysfunction due to the accumulation of psychosine (Wenger1997Molecular; Shin2016Altered; Hill2018The).

## Structure
The GALC (galactosylceramidase) protein is composed of 669 amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain that undergoes post-translational modifications to become active. The precursor form of GALC is approximately 80 kDa and is processed into two fragments: a 50 kDa N-terminal fragment and a 30 kDa C-terminal fragment, which constitutes the active enzyme (Hossain2015Chaperone).

The secondary structure of GALC includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its overall folding. The tertiary structure of GALC features a TIM barrel, β-sandwich, and lectin domains, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity and interaction with other proteins (Hill2018The). The active site of GALC is buried within these domains, facilitating the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds (Hill2013Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, GALC forms a heterotetrameric complex with saposin A (SapA) in a pH-dependent manner. This complex consists of a central SapA dimer with two GALC molecules bound to its surface, creating an open channel that connects the GALC active site to the SapA hydrophobic cavity (Hill2018The). This arrangement is essential for the degradation of glycosphingolipids, as it allows the binding and processing of lipidated substrates (Hill2018The).

## Function
The GALC gene encodes the enzyme galactosylceramidase, which is crucial for the catabolism of galactolipids in the lysosome, a cellular organelle responsible for waste processing. This enzyme specifically breaks down galactosylceramide and psychosine, which are components of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers. In healthy human cells, GALC activity is essential for maintaining the integrity and function of myelin, ensuring proper nerve signal transmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Wenger1997Molecular; Shin2016Altered).

GALC is synthesized as an 80 kDa precursor and is processed into two active fragments within the lysosome: a 50 kDa N-terminal fragment and a 30 kDa C-terminal fragment. This maturation process is vital for the enzyme's activity (Hossain2015Chaperone). The enzyme's function in the lysosome is critical for preventing the accumulation of toxic substances, such as psychosine, which can lead to neurological damage if not properly degraded (Wenger1997Molecular).

The proper trafficking and processing of GALC to the lysosome are essential for its function. Mutations affecting these processes can lead to disorders like Krabbe disease, characterized by demyelination and neurological dysfunction (Shin2016Altered).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GALC gene, which encodes the enzyme galactosylceramidase, are primarily associated with Krabbe disease, also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy. This autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder results from a deficiency in GALC activity, leading to the accumulation of psychosine, a toxic metabolite that causes demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Spratley2016New; Tatsumi1995Molecular). The disease is characterized by symptoms such as hypertonicity, irritability, and developmental delays, typically manifesting within the first year of life, although later onset forms exist (Tanner2012Array; Tatsumi1995Molecular).

Krabbe disease can be classified based on the age of onset: early infantile, late infantile, late childhood, adolescent, and adult onset, with early infantile being the most common (Wu2022A). The most common mutation associated with the disease is a 30-kb deletion, which accounts for a significant proportion of cases, particularly in individuals of European and Mexican ancestry (Tanner2012Array). Other mutations include missense, nonsense, deletions, and insertions, with regional and racial variations (Wu2022A). The accumulation of psychosine is believed to disrupt lipid raft architecture and impede oligodendrocyte differentiation, contributing to the disease's pathology (Spratley2016New).

## Interactions
GALC (galactosylceramidase) interacts with saposin A (SapA) to form a pH-dependent heterotetrameric complex crucial for glycosphingolipid degradation. This interaction is optimal at low pH, similar to the conditions in endolysosomal compartments. The GALC-SapA complex is characterized by a 2:2 heterotetramer structure, with a central SapA dimer and two GALC molecules. The interaction involves extensive electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions, with specific residues in SapA, such as E25, E32, E49, D52, and D60, forming critical electrostatic interactions with GALC. Hydrophobic interactions are also significant, with residues like L28 interacting with GALC's hydrophobic surface. The backbone of residue N21 in SapA forms a hydrogen bond with GALC's G144, and residue Q24 in SapA forms hydrogen bonds with GALC residues T523 and R520 (Hill2018The).

The GALC-SapA complex features a hydrophobic channel that facilitates the binding and processing of glycosphingolipids. This channel provides a protected environment for substrate presentation, allowing the GALC enzyme to cleave the polar glycosyl headgroups of lipids from their hydrophobic ceramide tails (Hill2018The).
