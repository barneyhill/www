# CAPRIN1

## Overview
CAPRIN1, or cell cycle associated protein 1, is a gene located on chromosome 11 (11p13) that encodes a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, synaptic plasticity, and stress response. The CAPRIN1 protein is characterized by its phosphoprotein nature and contains RNA-binding motifs, such as arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) motifs, which facilitate its interaction with mRNA and other proteins (Yang2019Role; Solomon2007Distinct). As a scaffolding protein, CAPRIN1 forms homodimers and participates in ribonucleoprotein complexes, playing a critical role in mRNA transport and translation (Wu2016Crystal; Yang2019Role). It is notably involved in the formation of stress granules, which are essential for cellular stress responses, and interacts with proteins such as G3BP1 and FMRP to regulate RNA metabolism (Wu2016Crystal; Solomon2007Distinct). The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which influence its activity in various cellular contexts (Yang2019Role).

## Structure
The CAPRIN1 protein is a 709-amino acid phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 116 kDa, encoded by a gene located on chromosome 11 (11p13) (Yang2019Role). Its primary structure includes conserved regions, such as homologous region-1 (HR1) and homologous region-2, which are crucial for its function (Yang2019Role). The protein contains RNA-binding motifs, including arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) motifs, which are essential for its interaction with mRNA and the induction of eIF-2α phosphorylation (Solomon2007Distinct).

The secondary structure of CAPRIN1 features a novel all-alpha-helical fold within its dimerization domain, comprising six alpha-helices (Wu2016Crystal). This domain mediates homodimerization, forming a head-to-head dimer with a V-shaped structure (Wu2016Crystal). The dimerization interface involves about 60 residues, primarily from helices 1 and 4, and is characterized by high shape complementarity (Wu2016Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, CAPRIN1 forms homodimers, which are crucial for its function as a scaffolding protein in ribonucleoprotein complexes (Wu2016Crystal; Yang2019Role). The protein's dimeric structure creates a large concave surface that acts as a protein-binding groove, facilitating interactions with proteins like G3BP1 and FMRP (Wu2016Crystal; Yang2019Role). CAPRIN1 is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its function (Yang2019Role).

## Function
Caprin-1 is a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, synaptic plasticity, and stress response. In healthy human cells, Caprin-1 is involved in the transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle by selectively binding to mRNAs such as c-Myc and cyclin D2, which are essential for cell proliferation (Wu2015Bacterial; Solomon2007Distinct). It forms a complex with RasGAP SH3 domain binding protein-1 (G3BP-1) in cytoplasmic RNA granules, which are associated with microtubules and play a role in mRNA transport and translation (Wu2015Bacterial; Solomon2007Distinct).

In the brain, Caprin-1 is highly expressed in neuronal RNA granules, where it regulates the translation of mRNAs related to synaptic plasticity, such as CaMKII, BDNF, TrkB, and CREB (Wu2016Crystal). It is also involved in the formation of stress granules (SGs) in response to oxidative stress, which helps protect cells by regulating mRNA stability and translation (Vu2021Defining; Solomon2007Distinct). Caprin-1's functions are largely dependent on its interactions with other proteins, including G3BP-1, and its ability to induce phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF-2α), which can lead to a global inhibition of protein synthesis under stress conditions (Solomon2007Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CAPRIN1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), CAPRIN1 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis, particularly in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients. Its expression correlates with clinicopathological features such as lymph node metastasis and PET metabolic parameters, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for ESCA progression (Gao2023Caprin1).

In prostate cancer, mutations in the SPOP gene, which normally promotes the degradation of CAPRIN1, lead to increased levels of CAPRIN1. This upregulation enhances stress granule assembly, contributing to cancer cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy, such as docetaxel. The interaction between SPOP mutations and CAPRIN1 is significant in the context of prostate cancer progression and treatment resistance (Shi2019Prostate).

In the auditory system, CAPRIN1 is crucial for maintaining hearing function. Its deletion in mice results in progressive hearing loss and impaired recovery from noise exposure, indicating its role in cochlear protection and stress response. This suggests that CAPRIN1 is important for auditory protection and may have implications for age-related hearing loss (Nolan2022Targeted).

## Interactions
CAPRIN1, also known as cell cycle associated protein 1, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions that are crucial for its biological functions. It forms a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Ras GAP-activating protein-binding protein 1 (G3BP1). This complex is essential for RNA metabolism and stress granule dynamics, with CAPRIN1 acting as a scaffold that allows simultaneous binding of two FMRP and two G3BP1 molecules (Wu2016Crystal; Zhu2020Crystal).

The interaction between CAPRIN1 and G3BP1 is mediated through specific motifs, with CAPRIN1 binding to the NTF2 domain of G3BP1. This interaction is pH-sensitive and involves specific residues that are critical for binding (Schulte2021Caprin1). CAPRIN1 also interacts with the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) core protein, suggesting a role in antiviral responses (Wu2016Crystal).

In neuronal cells, CAPRIN1 interacts with FMRP independently of RNA, and this interaction is important for local translation control in neurons. The absence of both FMRP and CAPRIN1 can lead to dendrite dysmorphogenesis, indicating their potential complementary functions (El2012Fragile). CAPRIN1's interactions are facilitated by its RGG and RG-rich sequences, characteristic of RNA-binding proteins (Wu2016Crystal).
