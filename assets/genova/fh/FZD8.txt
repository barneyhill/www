# FZD8

## Overview
FZD8 is a gene that encodes the frizzled class receptor 8, a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is integral to the Wnt signaling pathway, which is pivotal in regulating cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The FZD8 protein is characterized by a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) essential for binding Wnt ligands, and it features seven transmembrane domains typical of GPCRs. It plays a significant role in both β-catenin-dependent and independent signaling pathways, influencing cell fate decisions and maintaining stem cell quiescence. FZD8's interactions with various signaling molecules, including TGF-β receptors, underscore its involvement in complex cellular processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell invasion (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled; MurilloGarzón2018Frizzled8). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Al‑Zahrani2023Expression; MurilloGarzón2018Frizzled8).

## Structure
The FZD8 protein is a member of the frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, characterized by a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that is crucial for Wnt ligand binding. This CRD is highly conserved and features a specific three-dimensional structure stabilized by disulfide bridges formed by conserved cysteine residues (Hendaoui2012Inhibition; Ain2013Prediction). The CRD of FZD8 has been crystallized, revealing a structure that includes two known Wnt binding sites: a hydrophobic groove for the palmitoleic acid moiety and the Wnt index finger binding site (Zhao2020Antiepileptic). 

The FZD8 protein also contains seven transmembrane domains typical of GPCRs and an intracellular C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, which is essential for interacting with scaffold proteins like Dishevelled (Dvl) (Pascual-Vargas2021A). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation occur at the N-terminus, which is important for the protein's maturation and trafficking to the plasma membrane (Pascual-Vargas2021A). 

The structure of FZD8 has been studied in complex with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine, which binds to a novel pocket on the CRD, distinct from the known Wnt binding sites, suggesting potential for designing FZD-specific inhibitors (Zhao2020Antiepileptic).

## Function
FZD8 (frizzled class receptor 8) is a protein that functions as a receptor in the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, FZD8 is primarily involved in β-catenin-independent signaling pathways. It has been shown to activate JNK signaling, which can lead to rapid apoptotic cell death, as observed in certain embryonic contexts (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled). FZD8 also plays a role in maintaining hematopoietic stem cells in a quiescent state by suppressing the Ca2+-NFAT-IFNγ pathway, indicating its involvement in stem cell regulation (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled).

FZD8 is active at the cell membrane, where it interacts with Wnt ligands to initiate intracellular signaling cascades. It can antagonize β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling, which is important for regulating cell fate decisions during development (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled). The protein's cysteine-rich domain (CRD) is crucial for its interaction with Wnt ligands and other signaling molecules, such as TGF-β receptors, which are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion processes (MurilloGarzón2018Frizzled8). These interactions highlight FZD8's role in integrating multiple signaling pathways to influence cellular and organismal outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and interactions of the FZD8 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In prostate cancer, FZD8 is upregulated, particularly in metastatic cases, and is a major receptor for Wnt-11, facilitating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion. Silencing FZD8 reduces cancer cell migration, invasion, and EMT-related gene expression, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (MurilloGarzón2018Frizzled8).

In breast cancer, high FZD8 expression is associated with poor clinicopathological characteristics, including low survival rates and larger tumor size and grade. It is also linked to chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Al‑Zahrani2023Expression).

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high FZD8 expression is associated with a hazard ratio indicating a potential protective effect in certain clinical contexts (Li2021Expression). In glioma, high FZD8 expression correlates with poor overall survival and is associated with higher tumor grades (Huang2023Identification). In gastric cancer, increased FZD8 expression is observed, suggesting its potential as a biomarker (Demirci2023Overexpressions).

## Interactions
Frizzled class receptor 8 (FZD8) is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in signal transduction pathways. FZD8 interacts with Wnt-11, forming a stable complex that is essential for activating Wnt signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells. This interaction is significant for processes such as cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (MurilloGarzón2018Frizzled8). FZD8 also interacts with components of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway. It forms complexes with TGF-β receptors, specifically TGFβRI and TGFβRII, through its cysteine-rich domain (CRD). This interaction is mediated by the extracellular domains of FZD8 and TGFβRI, and is regulated by TGF-β, influencing EMT and cancer cell invasion (MurilloGarzón2018Frizzled8).

FZD8 is known to antagonize β-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling and is involved in β-catenin-independent pathways. It can bind to the CRDs of other Frizzled receptors, such as FZD1, FZD4, and FZD5, and has been shown to interact with various Wnt ligands, including Wnt-1, Wnt-5A, and Wnt-9B, indicating its role in diverse signaling pathways (Dijksterhuis2014WNTFrizzled; Dijksterhuis2015Systematic).
