# IZUMO1

## Overview
The IZUMO1 gene encodes the izumo sperm-oocyte fusion 1 protein, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the fertilization process by facilitating the fusion of sperm and egg cells. This protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by its unique structural domains, including an extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain and an IZUMO domain, which are essential for its function in gamete adhesion and fusion (Inoue2005The; HernándezFalcó2022The). The IZUMO1 protein is expressed on the surface of sperm cells and becomes active following the acrosome reaction, enabling it to interact with the JUNO receptor on the oocyte surface, a critical step for successful fertilization (Jean2018JUNO; Inoue2005The). The absence or dysfunction of IZUMO1 can result in male infertility due to the inability of sperm to fuse with the egg, despite normal binding and penetration capabilities (Inoue2005The). This gene and its encoded protein are thus integral to reproductive success and have significant implications for understanding and addressing infertility issues.

## Structure
The IZUMO1 protein is a crucial component in the fertilization process, specifically in the recognition and fusion of sperm and egg cells. Its molecular structure has been elucidated, revealing a distinct boomerang shape. The protein is composed of two main domains: a rod-shaped N-terminal four-helix bundle (4HB) and a C-terminal immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) domain. The 4HB domain consists of four helices that vary in length and exhibit amphipathic characteristics, with polar surfaces exposed to the solvent and hydrophobic residues forming a core. These helices are connected by loops, with a longer loop linking two of the helices. The 4HB and hinge regions are stabilized by disulfide linkages and charge-charge interactions (Aydin2016Molecular).

The Ig-like domain, located at the membrane-proximal end, adopts a seven-stranded β-sandwich structure with a novel 2+5 organization, differing from the classical 3+4 arrangement. This domain is characterized by a conserved disulfide bond between specific strands (Aydin2016Molecular). IZUMO1 is initially monomeric in spermatozoa but undergoes dimerization upon interaction with the oocyte, specifically with the JUNO receptor. This dimerization is essential for the robust adhesion required for sperm-egg fusion (Inoue2015Oocytetriggered).

## Function
The IZUMO1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in the process of sperm-egg fusion during fertilization. This protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is characterized by an extracellular immunoglobulin domain and an IZUMO domain, which are essential for its function in gamete adhesion and fusion (Inoue2005The; HernándezFalcó2022The). IZUMO1 is specifically expressed on the surface of sperm cells and becomes active following the acrosome reaction, a crucial step in fertilization that allows the sperm to penetrate the egg's outer layers (Inoue2005The).

The primary function of IZUMO1 is to facilitate the fusion of sperm with the oocyte membrane by interacting with its receptor, JUNO, on the oocyte surface. This interaction is vital for the membrane fusion event that allows the transfer of genetic material from the sperm to the egg, leading to successful fertilization and subsequent embryonic development (Jean2018JUNO; HernándezFalcó2022The). The absence or dysfunction of IZUMO1 results in male infertility due to the inability of sperm to fuse with the egg, despite being able to bind to and penetrate the zona pellucida (Inoue2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the IZUMO1 gene can lead to infertility due to impaired sperm-egg fusion. The absence of IZUMO1 results in male infertility, as demonstrated in studies with Izumo1-deficient mice, where sperm could not fuse with eggs despite normal mating behavior and penetration of the zona pellucida (Inoue2010The; MOU2017Male). Disruptions in the localization and expression of IZUMO1, such as those caused by the absence of testis-specific serine kinase (TSSK6), also lead to infertility by affecting actin polymerization necessary for IZUMO1 relocalization (HernándezFalcó2022The; Inoue2010The).

The interaction between IZUMO1 and the oocyte receptor JUNO is crucial for fertilization. Juno-deficient oocytes are incapable of being fertilized, highlighting the importance of this interaction (MOU2017Male). Mutations in the IZUMO1 receptor gene, IZUMO1R, which encodes JUNO, have been associated with fertilization failure and polyspermy, suggesting that disruptions in the IZUMO1-JUNO interaction can lead to reproductive issues (Yu2017Mutational). These findings underscore the clinical significance of IZUMO1 in reproductive health, with potential implications for diagnosing and treating infertility.

## Interactions
IZUMO1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a critical role in sperm-egg fusion during fertilization. It is part of a trimeric complex with SPACA6 and TMEM81, which is essential for sperm-egg interaction in vertebrates. This complex is involved in binding to the egg protein JUNO in mammals, facilitating the fusion of sperm and egg membranes (Deneke2023A). The interaction between IZUMO1 and JUNO has been biochemically and structurally characterized, highlighting its primary role in sperm-egg binding (Deneke2023A).

In zebrafish, IZUMO1 forms a trimeric complex with Spaca6 and Tmem81, which is crucial for fertilization. This complex is predicted to interact with the egg protein Bouncer, forming a tetrameric complex that bridges sperm and egg membranes (Deneke2023A). In mammals, IZUMO1 is also part of high molecular weight protein complexes in spermatozoa, which include GLIPR1L1. These complexes are associated with lipid rafts and undergo dynamic remodeling during the acrosome reaction, essential for sperm adhesion to the oolemma (Gaikwad2019GLIPR1L1).

IZUMO1's interactions with other proteins, such as ACE3, CAPZA3, and TMEM190, suggest its involvement in a multiprotein membrane complex essential for membrane fusion during fertilization (HernándezFalcó2022The). These interactions are crucial for its function in fertilization, although specific interactions with nucleic acids are not mentioned (HernándezFalcó2022The).
