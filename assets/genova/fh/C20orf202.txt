# C20orf202

## Overview
C20orf202 is a gene located on chromosome 20 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 20 open reading frame 202. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its specific functions and mechanisms of action are not yet fully elucidated. The protein is categorized as a non-kinase, non-receptor protein, indicating that it does not function as an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups or as a molecule that binds to signaling molecules to initiate a cellular response. Research into C20orf202 and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies aiming to uncover its role in cellular pathways and potential implications in human health and disease.
