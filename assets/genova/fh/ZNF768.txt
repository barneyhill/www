# ZNF768

## Overview
ZNF768 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 768, a transcription factor characterized by its zinc finger domains, which facilitate specific DNA binding. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and plays a significant role in regulating gene expression, particularly in transcriptionally active euchromatic regions. The zinc finger protein 768 is involved in various cellular processes, including cell viability, proliferation, and the modulation of the p53 pathway, which is crucial for cellular senescence and proliferation. Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which affects its stability and function, especially in response to oncogenic signals. The gene is implicated in several human cancers, where it is often overexpressed or amplified, contributing to tumorigenesis by promoting cell cycle progression and bypassing senescence (Rohrmoser2018MIR; Villot2021ZNF768).

## Structure
ZNF768 is a protein characterized by the presence of ten zinc finger domains at its C-terminus, which are highly conserved in placental mammals and marsupials, but less so in monotremes (Rohrmoser2018MIR). These zinc fingers facilitate specific DNA binding, with the proximal and distal fingers likely responsible for this function (Rohrmoser2018MIR). At the N-terminus, ZNF768 contains amino acid stretches resembling the heptapeptide repeats found in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Villot2021ZNF768). These repeats are dynamically phosphorylated, which is significant for the protein's stability and function (Villot2021ZNF768).

The heptad repeats in ZNF768 show variation in amino acid composition, with serine-5 and proline-6 residues being highly conserved, while the position corresponding to serine-2 is often replaced by an acidic amino acid, such as glutamic acid (Rohrmoser2018MIR). This replacement may mimic the phosphorylation of serine-2, a key feature in RNA elongation control (Rohrmoser2018MIR). ZNF768 is a phosphoprotein, with phosphorylation occurring at multiple serine residues, which affects its stability and interaction with other proteins (Villot2021ZNF768; Rohrmoser2018MIR). The protein is localized to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor, binding to specific DNA motifs associated with gene expression regulation (Rohrmoser2018MIR; Villot2021ZNF768).

## Function
ZNF768 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation in human cells. It is primarily active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA motifs, particularly in euchromatic regions, which are transcriptionally active areas of the genome (Rohrmoser2018MIR). ZNF768 is recruited to expressed genes by mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs), which are retrotransposed elements associated with gene regulatory functions (Rohrmoser2018MIR). The protein contains an array of ten zinc fingers that allow it to bind specifically to DNA sequences, particularly at or near promoters, indicating its involvement in transcription regulation (Rohrmoser2018MIR).

ZNF768 is essential for cell viability and proliferation, as its knockdown leads to inhibited cell growth and the induction of senescence-like features (Villot2021ZNF768). It interacts with components of the Elongator complex and other nuclear factors, suggesting a role in transcriptional regulation and RNA processing (Rohrmoser2018MIR). The protein's activity is modulated by phosphorylation, which affects its stability and function, particularly in response to oncogenic RAS signaling (Villot2021ZNF768). Overall, ZNF768 is a key player in maintaining cellular homeostasis by regulating gene expression and cell cycle progression.

## Clinical Significance
ZNF768 is implicated in various human cancers due to its overexpression and gene amplification. It is frequently amplified or overexpressed in several cancer types, including endometrial carcinomas, melanoma, breast cancer, B-cell neoplasm, and bladder carcinoma. The gene is altered in approximately 1.9% of tumors, with gene amplification being the most common alteration. Elevated ZNF768 expression is notably observed in adrenocortical carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Villot2021ZNF768).

In lung tumors, particularly those with oncogenic RAS mutations, high ZNF768 protein levels are found, suggesting a disconnection between RAS activation and ZNF768 degradation in advanced tumors. This overexpression is linked to the enrichment of the cell cycle pathway, indicating its role in sustaining proliferation and bypassing senescence (Villot2021ZNF768). ZNF768 acts as a transcription factor, controlling the expression of genes linked to the cell cycle and mitosis, and affects p53 target expression. Its interaction with p53 suggests it regulates cell proliferation through both p53-dependent and independent mechanisms (Villot2021ZNF768).

ZNF768's role in cancer is further supported by its ability to bypass RAS-induced senescence by repressing the p53 pathway, thus promoting malignant transformation (Villot2021ZNF768). The gene's overexpression in tumors suggests its involvement in bypassing cellular senescence and sustaining proliferation, contributing to cancer development (Villot2021ZNF768).

## Interactions
ZNF768 is a zinc finger protein that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in gene regulation. It binds specifically to the sequence motif GCTGTGTG(N20)CCTCTCTG in mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs), which are retrotransposed elements in mammalian genomes. This binding is associated with euchromatin and promoter regions of genes, indicating a role in gene expression regulation (Rohrmoser2018MIR).

ZNF768 interacts with components of the Elongator complex, including Elp1, Elp2, and Elp3, as well as other nuclear factors. This interaction suggests that ZNF768 can recruit Elongator and other factors to expressed genes, influencing transcriptional regulation (Rohrmoser2018MIR).

The protein also interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, repressing its phosphorylation and activity. This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal part of p53 and the C2H2 domains in ZNF768. The interaction with p53 allows ZNF768 to modulate the p53 pathway, which is crucial for cellular senescence and proliferation (Villot2021ZNF768).

ZNF768's interaction with nucleic acids and proteins highlights its role as a transcription factor, impacting cellular processes such as proliferation and senescence (Villot2021ZNF768).
