# FEZ2

## Overview
FEZ2, or fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neuronal development and axonal growth. The FEZ2 protein is a member of the FEZ protein family, which is derived from the ancestral unc-76 gene. It is characterized by a conserved C-terminal coiled-coil domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions, allowing it to function as a hub protein within the cell (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). Unlike its paralog FEZ1, which is primarily expressed in the nervous system, FEZ2 is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues, suggesting its involvement in fundamental cellular processes beyond neuronal functions (Fujita2004Identification; Alborghetti2011FEZ2). The protein interacts with a variety of partners, including those involved in transcription, translation, apoptosis, and signal transduction, indicating its role in maintaining cellular functions and facilitating intracellular transport (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). Additionally, FEZ2 has been implicated in several clinical conditions, including neurological disorders and certain types of cancer, highlighting its significance in both health and disease (Truvé2020Identification; Vellichirammal2023The).

## Structure
The FEZ2 protein is characterized by specific structural features that facilitate its role in neuronal development and axonal growth. It contains conserved regions at both the N-terminus and C-terminus, with the latter housing a coiled-coil domain crucial for protein-protein interactions (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). This coiled-coil region is involved in oligomerization and interactions with other proteins, highlighting its importance in the protein's function (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). The C-terminal region, specifically amino acids 207-353, was used in studies to identify interacting partners, underscoring its role in mediating interactions with a variety of proteins involved in diverse biological processes (Alborghetti2011FEZ2).

FEZ2 has a conserved polybasic region, which differs from the nuclear localization signal found in FEZ1, suggesting variations in subcellular localization and function between these proteins (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). The protein's structure is highly similar to its orthologs, with only 12.8% of amino acids differing between FEZ1 and FEZ2, indicating a high degree of sequence conservation (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). While specific details on post-translational modifications like phosphorylation are not provided, such modifications could potentially regulate FEZ2's function. The broader interaction profile of FEZ2 compared to FEZ1 suggests evolutionary adaptations that may influence its structural and functional roles (Alborghetti2011FEZ2).

## Function
FEZ2 (fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 2) is a protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in neuronal development and axonal growth. It is part of the FEZ protein family, which originated from the ancestral unc-76 gene. FEZ2 has a conserved C-terminal region that mediates protein-protein interactions, allowing it to function as a hub protein interacting with a large number of other proteins (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). 

FEZ2 is ubiquitously expressed across different tissues, unlike its paralog FEZ1, which is primarily expressed in the nervous system. This broad expression pattern suggests that FEZ2 may have roles beyond neuronal functions, potentially in fundamental cellular processes (Fujita2004Identification; Alborghetti2011FEZ2). 

In terms of molecular activity, FEZ2 interacts with proteins involved in transcription, translation, apoptosis, signal transduction, and cytoskeleton/centrosome functions, indicating its involvement in maintaining cellular functions (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). It also interacts with protein kinase C f (PKCf) to induce neurite extension, suggesting a role in morphological changes in various cells (Fujita2004Identification). The protein is active in the cytoplasm and may function as a transport adaptor protein, facilitating the transport of vesicles and organelles along microtubules (Alborghetti2011FEZ2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the FEZ2 gene have been implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. In bipolar disorder, FEZ2 expression is downregulated in neural stem cells and mature neural cells derived from patients, suggesting a potential role in the disorder's pathophysiology (Truvé2020Identification). The gene's expression is also induced in animal models of psychotic mania, indicating its involvement in mood regulation and psychiatric conditions (Truvé2020Identification).

In the context of cancer, FEZ2 has been identified as a driver gene in certain subtypes of breast cancer, specifically ERPR-negative and HER2-positive tumors, highlighting its potential role in cancer progression and as a prognostic marker (Vellichirammal2023The).

Additionally, a study involving a three-generation family with a novel contiguous gene deletion on chromosome 2p22, which includes FEZ2, has been associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm syndrome. This condition presents with features similar to Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, although the individuals do not meet the full clinical criteria for these conditions (Quiñones‐Pérez2018Three‐generation). These findings suggest that FEZ2 may play a role in both neurological and cardiovascular conditions.

## Interactions
FEZ2, a member of the fasciculation and elongation protein zeta family, is involved in various protein interactions that suggest its role in cellular processes such as neuronal development and intracellular transport. FEZ2 interacts with pleiotrophin (PTN), protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type S (PTPRS), and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), indicating its involvement in signal transduction pathways (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). It also binds with protein kinase C zeta (PKCζ), which is known to promote neurite extension, suggesting a role in morphological changes in cells (Fujita2004Identification).

FEZ2 has acquired additional protein interaction partners compared to its homolog FEZ1, with 19 unique interactors identified, highlighting its evolutionary divergence and potential new cytoplasmic functions (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). These interactions include proteins involved in centrosome organization, cell polarity, apoptosis, and signal transduction (Alborghetti2011FEZ2). The study of FEZ2's interactions suggests that it may serve as a transport adaptor protein, potentially evolving to transport additional cargo due to its broader expression pattern compared to the neuron-specific FEZ1 (Alborghetti2011FEZ2).
