# COL19A1

## Overview
The COL19A1 gene encodes the collagen type XIX alpha 1 chain, a nonfibrillar collagen that is part of the FACIT (Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple Helices) family. This protein plays a significant role in the extracellular matrix (ECM), contributing to the structural integrity and function of various tissues. Collagen type XIX is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses in the central nervous system, particularly within the hippocampus, and is crucial for the organization of inhibitory synapses. It also plays a role in muscle stem cell niches, influencing muscle homeostasis and repair. Additionally, collagen type XIX exhibits anti-tumor properties by interacting with integrins and affecting signaling pathways that regulate cell migration and invasion. Mutations in the COL19A1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, including gastric cancer and neuromuscular disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiological processes and disease states (Su2009Collagen; Brodsky2022Somatic; Oudart2017Type).

## Structure
The COL19A1 gene encodes the collagen type XIX alpha 1 chain, a member of the FACIT (Fibril Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple Helices) family. This protein is composed of three α1(XIX) chains forming a homotrimer with a molecular mass of 400 kDa. Each α chain consists of 1142 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 112 kDa (Oudart2017Type). The structure of collagen XIX includes five collagenous domains (COL1 to COL5) interrupted by six non-collagenous domains (NC1 to NC6). The NC2 domain is crucial for trimerization and disulfide inter-chain bond formation, while the NC6 domain contains a heparin binding site (Oudart2017Type).

Collagen XIX is characterized by a rod-like structure with a globular domain at the N-terminal end, forming oligomers stabilized by N-terminus inter-molecular disulfide bonds (Oudart2017Type). It contains 14 cysteine residues that facilitate inter-chain and intra-chain disulfide bonds, stabilizing the triple helix (Oudart2017Type). Unlike many other collagens, collagen XIX lacks glycosylation sites (Oudart2017Type). The NC1 domain of collagen XIX has been shown to inhibit melanoma cell migration and invasion, and it interacts with αvβ3 integrin, affecting signaling pathways related to its anti-tumor properties (Oudart2017Type).

## Function
COL19A1 encodes collagen type XIX alpha 1 chain, a nonfibrillar collagen involved in various molecular processes within the extracellular matrix (ECM). This protein plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of synapses in the central nervous system, particularly in the hippocampus. It is expressed by subsets of hippocampal interneurons and is essential for the normal organization of synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2)-containing nerve terminals, which are primarily inhibitory. The absence of collagen XIX leads to altered distribution of Gad67, a marker for inhibitory synapses, and increased levels of gephyrin, a postsynaptic scaffolding molecule, indicating its importance in inhibitory synapse organization (Su2009Collagen).

In muscle stem cells (MuSCs), COL19A1 is part of the basement membrane zone (BMZ) and contributes to the structural integrity and function of the MuSC niche. It is highly expressed in quiescent MuSCs, suggesting a role in maintaining the ECM and BMZ architecture, which is crucial for muscle homeostasis and repair (Guillon2024Defining). Additionally, collagen XIX is associated with perineuronal nets (PNNs) and influences transcriptional regulation and protein levels, contributing to the formation of inhibitory nerve terminals through α5β1 integrin signaling (Heikkinen2021Collagens).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the COL19A1 gene, which encodes collagen type XIX alpha 1 chain, have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In mice, the double invalidation of the collagen XIX gene leads to high mortality due to malnutrition, with notable findings such as a mega-esophagus and motor dysfunction of smooth muscles. These issues are linked to disruptions in the extracellular matrix and a lack of activation of myogenic regulatory factors, affecting muscle cell transformation and function (Oudart2017Type). In the nervous system, collagen XIX is crucial for synapse formation in the hippocampus. Deficiency in collagen XIX results in reduced expression and distribution of synaptotagmin 2, affecting synaptic terminal formation and potentially leading to conditions related to synaptic function (Su2009Collagen).

In the context of cancer, overexpression of collagen XIX has been observed in the muscles of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Oudart2017Type). Additionally, somatic mutations in COL19A1 have been associated with gastric cancer, where they are linked to distinct tumor environments and overall survival rates. These mutations, particularly truncation mutations, are associated with longer overall survival in gastric cancer patients (Brodsky2022Somatic).

## Interactions
Collagen type XIX, encoded by the COL19A1 gene, is a member of the FACIT (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) family and plays a role in the extracellular matrix. It is involved in various interactions that influence cellular and tissue functions. Collagen XIX interacts with the extracellular matrix components, such as fibronectin and tenascin X, which are crucial for cell organization and tissue-specific functions (Oudart2017Type). It also has a binding site for heparin in the NC6 domain, which may facilitate interactions with other matrix molecules (Oudart2017Type).

In the context of cancer, collagen XIX is associated with the basement membrane zone and exhibits anti-tumor properties. It inhibits melanoma cell migration and invasion by interacting with αvβ3 integrin, affecting the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and increasing GSK3β activity (Oudart2017Type). This interaction may contribute to its role in inhibiting MMP-14 and VEGF expression, thereby exerting anti-angiogenic effects (Oudart2017Type).

Collagen XIX is also involved in synapse formation in hippocampal interneurons, where it may interact with transmembrane receptors or other synaptic organizers, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear (Su2009Collagen). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of collagen XIX in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions.
