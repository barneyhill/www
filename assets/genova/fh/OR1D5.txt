# OR1D5

## Overview
OR1D5 is a gene that encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily D member 5, which is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein plays a crucial role in the olfactory system by detecting odorant molecules and initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell. As a GPCR, it is involved in the conversion of extracellular signals into intracellular responses, a process that is fundamental to the sensory perception of odors (Glusman2000Sequence). The gene is part of a larger olfactory receptor gene cluster, which has undergone significant evolutionary changes, including gene duplications and conversions, contributing to the diversity and specificity of olfactory receptors (Glusman2000Sequence). Recent studies have highlighted the potential involvement of OR1D5 in olfactory disturbances, particularly in the context of viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2, where it may interact with other olfactory receptors to influence the structure and function of the olfactory epithelium (de2023Neuroinvasion).

## Interactions
OR1D5, a member of the olfactory receptor family, is involved in the detection of odors through its role as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This receptor is part of a complex signaling pathway that involves interactions with various proteins. Notably, OR1D5 has been reported to interact with the human olfactory receptor OR1D5, suggesting a potential mechanism for olfactory disturbances in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections (de2023Neuroinvasion). This interaction may influence the structure of the olfactory epithelium, contributing to olfactory disturbances such as anosmia.

The olfactory receptor gene cluster, which includes OR1D5, is characterized by a complex arrangement of genes and pseudogenes, indicating a rich evolutionary history involving gene duplications and conversions (Glusman2000Sequence). Although specific interactions of OR1D5 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed extensively, the receptor's role as a GPCR suggests it may participate in signal transduction pathways involving secondary messengers like cyclic AMP. This is typical of olfactory receptors, which transduce signals through interactions with G proteins and downstream effectors such as adenylate cyclase (Glusman2000Sequence).
