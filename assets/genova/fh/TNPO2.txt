# TNPO2

## Overview
TNPO2 is a gene that encodes the protein transportin 2, which is a member of the importin-β family of nuclear transport receptors. Transportin 2 plays a critical role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins, acting as a key mediator in the import and export of various proteins across the nuclear envelope. It is particularly involved in the transport of proteins containing a proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS), which are essential for numerous cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and cellular homeostasis (Goodman2021TNPO2; Yang2023Nuclear). The protein is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain and muscles, where it is vital for neuronal function and muscle differentiation (Goodman2021TNPO2). Mutations in the TNPO2 gene have been linked to developmental and neurological disorders, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Goodman2021TNPO2).

## Function
Transportin 2 (TNPO2) is a key protein involved in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating gene expression. TNPO2 functions as an importin, facilitating the translocation of proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus. It binds to the PY (proline-tyrosine) NLS of cargo proteins, which are typically disordered and contain specific motifs (Yang2023Nuclear). TNPO2 is also involved in the import of RNA-binding proteins, transcription factors, histones, splicing factors, and ribosomal proteins, highlighting its essential role in various cellular processes (Goodman2021TNPO2).

In addition to its import functions, TNPO2 is implicated in the export of mRNAs by forming a complex with RanGTP and the mRNA export factor NXF1, suggesting its classification as a "biportin" due to its dual role in nuclear import and export (Yang2023Nuclear). TNPO2 is highly expressed in the brain and muscles, where it is crucial for neuronal function and survival, as well as muscle cell differentiation (Goodman2021TNPO2). Its activity is essential for processes such as ciliogenesis, mitotic spindle assembly, and nuclear envelope and pore assembly, underscoring its importance in cellular and organismal development (Goodman2021TNPO2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the TNPO2 gene are associated with a range of developmental and neurological disorders. Variants in TNPO2, including both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations, have been linked to developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, neurological deficits, and dysmorphic features. These mutations can lead to conditions such as global developmental delay (GDD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and sleep disturbances (Goodman2021TNPO2).

Copy number variants (CNVs) involving TNPO2, such as deletions and duplications, have been reported as pathogenic, suggesting that dosage sensitivity of TNPO2 may contribute to developmental phenotypes (Goodman2021TNPO2). In Drosophila models, disruptions to TNPO2 activity result in developmental defects, indicating its pleiotropic role (Goodman2021TNPO2).

TNPO2 is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases due to its role in nuclear transport. Impaired TNPO2 function can lead to the mislocalization of RNA-binding proteins, contributing to neurodevelopmental abnormalities and potentially mediating neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis (Yang2023Nuclear). The gene's involvement in several developmental pathways, including NF-kB, hedgehog, insulin, and Ras/ERK signaling, may explain the varied phenotypes observed in affected individuals (Goodman2021TNPO2).

## Interactions
Transportin 2 (TNPO2) is involved in various protein interactions essential for its function in nucleocytoplasmic transport. TNPO2 interacts with over 60 cargo proteins, including developmental and neuronal proteins, facilitating their transport into the nucleus (Goodman2021TNPO2). It binds to proteins such as FUS, HuR/ElavL1, hnRNPA1, and NF-kB Essential Modulator, which are also cargoes for Transportin-1 (TNPO1) (Goodman2021TNPO2). TNPO2 is known to interact with the Argonaute protein family, nuclear receptor coactivators, CREB-regulated transcription coactivators, and far upstream element-binding proteins, including CRTC1, CRTC2, CRTC3, FUBP1, FUBP2, and FUBP3 (Mackmull2017Landscape).

TNPO2 also plays a critical role in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of estrogen receptor-α (ERα). It binds to ERα via two proline/tyrosine (PY) motifs in the AF-1 domain, facilitating ERα's cytoplasmic localization in an estrogen-dependent manner (Moriyama2020Transportin2). This interaction is competitive with importin-α, suggesting a mechanism where TNPO2 displaces importin-α from the ERα complex in the presence of estrogen (Moriyama2020Transportin2). These interactions highlight TNPO2's role in regulating ERα's subcellular distribution and its involvement in cytoplasmic signaling pathways (Moriyama2020Transportin2).
