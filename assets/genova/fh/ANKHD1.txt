# ANKHD1

## Overview
ANKHD1 is a gene that encodes the protein ankyrin repeat and KH domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of multiple ankyrin repeats and a KH domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional and translational regulation, due to its ability to mediate protein-protein interactions and bind single-stranded nucleic acids such as RNA and ssDNA (Almeida2020Emerging; Fragiadaki2018Ankyrin). ANKHD1 is implicated in several signaling pathways, notably the JAK/STAT and Hippo pathways, where it influences cell growth, survival, and differentiation (Mullenger2023Evaluating; Sidor2019Mask). The protein's interactions with various microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs further highlight its role in cancer progression and resistance to therapies (Mullenger2023Evaluating; Fragiadaki2018Ankyrin). ANKHD1's overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Almeida2020Emerging; Liu2020ANKHD1).

## Structure
ANKHD1 is a protein characterized by multiple ankyrin repeats and a single KH domain. The ankyrin repeats are known for mediating protein-protein interactions, while the KH domain is involved in binding single-stranded nucleic acids, such as RNA and ssDNA, which is crucial for transcriptional and translational regulation (Almeida2020Emerging; Fragiadaki2018Ankyrin). The KH domain of ANKHD1 spans amino acids 1694 to 1764 and includes a GxxG loop, essential for miRNA interactions (Fragiadaki2018Ankyrin).

ANKHD1 has several isoforms, with the longest being isoform 1, a 2542 amino acid protein. Other isoforms, such as isoform 2 (616 aa), isoform 3 (627 aa), and isoform 4 (581 aa), lack several exons and have distinct C-termini compared to isoform 1. Isoform 5 is a readthrough transcript involving ANKHD1 and EIF4EBP3 genes, encoding a 2617 aa protein. Smaller isoforms lack the KH domain, while larger isoforms contain nuclear localization sequences important for nuclear translocation and function as a co-activator of YAP1 (Almeida2020Emerging).

The ankyrin repeat domains form a linear solenoid structure, serving as a platform for protein-protein interactions. These repeats typically consist of 30-34 amino acids forming a helix-turn-helix conformation, contributing to the protein's structural stability (Chakrabarty2022Sequence).

## Function
ANKHD1 (ankyrin repeat and KH domain containing 1) is a multifunctional protein involved in several key cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the regulation of neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, particularly in the transition of radial glial cells and basal progenitors into neurons. Knockdown of ANKHD1 results in decreased neuron production, while its overexpression promotes differentiation into neurons, highlighting its importance in maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation in neural progenitor cells (hermann2014regulation).

In addition to its role in neural development, ANKHD1 is implicated in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, where it modulates cytokine receptor levels, leading to increased JAK autophosphorylation and subsequent STAT phosphorylation. This enhances STAT dimerization and translocation to the nucleus, promoting gene transcription (Mullenger2023Evaluating). ANKHD1 also interacts with the Hippo signaling pathway, particularly with the YAP protein, influencing its nuclear import, stability, and phase separation, which are crucial for YAP's transcriptional activity (Sidor2019Mask).

ANKHD1 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it can repress the p21 promoter and interact with the HSPB1 gene promoter, suggesting a role in gene regulation (Mullenger2023Evaluating). Its involvement in these pathways underscores its critical function in cell growth, survival, and differentiation.

## Clinical Significance
ANKHD1 is implicated in various cancers, with its overexpression linked to poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ANKHD1 is upregulated, correlating with advanced tumor stages and lymph node metastasis. It promotes cell proliferation and invasion by inactivating the Hippo signaling pathway, leading to increased levels of the yes-associated protein (YAP) and reduced YAP phosphorylation (Liu2020ANKHD1). In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), ANKHD1 is significantly overexpressed, interacting with microRNAs to regulate cell proliferation and tumor progression (Fragiadaki2018Ankyrin).

In acute leukemia, ANKHD1 is highly expressed and interacts with proteins like SIVA and SHP2, influencing cell proliferation and migration (MachadoNeto2015ANKHD1; Traina2006ANKHD1). Its expression is also elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it enhances tumor metastasis through interactions with SMYD3 (Zhou2019ANKHD1). In prostate and breast cancers, ANKHD1 is associated with increased cell proliferation and poor survival outcomes (Almeida2020Emerging). These findings suggest that ANKHD1 plays a critical role in cancer progression and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ANKHD1, a protein characterized by ankyrin repeat and KH domains, engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It interacts with SHP2, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, in K562 and LNCaP cell lines, suggesting a role in leukemia (Traina2006ANKHD1). ANKHD1 also binds to SIVA isoforms, confirmed through immunoprecipitation experiments, and this interaction affects cell proliferation and migration in leukemia cells by modulating the SIVA/Stathmin 1 pathway (MachadoNeto2015ANKHD1).

ANKHD1 is involved in the JAK/STAT and Hippo signaling pathways, interacting with YAP and TEAD transcription factors. It acts as a positive regulator of YAP1, enhancing the stability of the YAP/TEAD complex and influencing gene transcription (Mullenger2023Evaluating). The protein also binds to microRNAs such as miR-29a-3p, miR-196a, and miR-205 through its KH domain, impacting cancer cell proliferation (Fragiadaki2018Ankyrin). ANKHD1's interaction with long non-coding RNAs like LINC00346 and MALAT1 further underscores its role in cancer progression and resistance to therapies (Mullenger2023Evaluating).
