# NAAA

## Overview
The NAAA gene encodes the enzyme N-acylethanolamine acid amidase, a member of the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase superfamily. This enzyme is primarily involved in the hydrolysis of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), such as palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), into fatty acids and ethanolamine, playing a significant role in modulating inflammation and pain through its action in lysosomes (Gorelik2018Molecular; Ueda2010Nacylethanolamine). NAAA is characterized by its αββα-sandwich fold and undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation, which are crucial for its stability and function (Gorelik2018Molecular; Piomelli2020NAcylethanolamine). The enzyme's activity is distinct from that of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), with NAAA being more active in acidic environments typical of lysosomes (Tsuboi2005Molecular; Wang2008Amino). Clinically, alterations in NAAA expression have been linked to inflammatory diseases and cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Pontis2020NAcylethanolamine; Huang2022Insights).

## Structure
The N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) protein is a member of the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase superfamily, characterized by an αββα-sandwich fold (Gorelik2018Molecular). The primary structure of human NAAA consists of 359 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 40.1 kDa (Ueda2010Nacylethanolamine). NAAA shares significant sequence homology with acid ceramidase, with 33-34% identity and 70% similarity at the amino acid level (Ueda2010Nacylethanolamine).

The secondary structure includes α-helices and β-sheets, with the β-subunit consisting of antiparallel β-sheets flanked by α-helices, while the α-subunit forms a bundle of helices (Gorelik2018Molecular). The tertiary structure involves a hydrophobic and positively charged surface, which may facilitate binding to anionic lipids in lysosomal vesicles (Piomelli2020NAcylethanolamine).

NAAA undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation at four conserved sites, which may aid in subcellular targeting and stabilization (Piomelli2020NAcylethanolamine). The enzyme is translated as an inactive precursor and activated through self-catalyzed cleavage in an acidic environment, resulting in a heterodimer composed of a small α-subunit and a larger β-subunit (Gorelik2018Molecular; Piomelli2020NAcylethanolamine). The catalytic nucleophile is cysteine, specifically Cys126 in humans, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Gorelik2018Molecular).

## Function
N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), such as palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), into fatty acids and ethanolamine. This process is essential for regulating the levels of NAEs, which are bioactive lipids involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation and pain modulation (Gorelik2018Molecular; Ueda2010Nacylethanolamine). NAAA is primarily active in lysosomes, where it functions optimally at an acidic pH, around 4.5, aligning with its lysosomal localization (Tsuboi2005Molecular; Wang2008Amino).

The enzyme is involved in the hydrolytic cleavage of PEA, an endogenous agonist of the anti-inflammatory nuclear receptor PPAR-α. By degrading PEA, NAAA modulates the inflammatory response, as PEA is known for its analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties (Gorelik2018Molecular; Piomelli2020NAcylethanolamine). NAAA's activity is distinct from that of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which prefers long-chain polyunsaturated NAEs and is more abundant in the brain and liver (Gorelik2018Molecular; Tsuboi2005Molecular). The enzyme's function in healthy human cells involves maintaining homeostasis by regulating NAE levels, thereby influencing immune responses and cellular signaling pathways (Gorelik2018Molecular; Wang2008Amino).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NAAA gene have been implicated in various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), studies using a mouse model have shown that overexpression of NAAA in monocyte-derived cells, such as microglia and macrophages, leads to increased inflammatory responses and a more aggressive progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. This suggests that NAAA overexpression may exacerbate disease pathology (Pontis2020NAcylethanolamine). Conversely, genetic deletion of NAAA in mice has been associated with attenuated symptoms and delayed onset of EAE, indicating a protective effect against disease progression (Pontis2020NAcylethanolamine).

In cancer, NAAA expression is linked to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Genetic alterations such as mutations and copy number variations in the NAAA gene are associated with various cancers, including cervical cancer, where it shows the highest alteration frequency. These genetic changes are correlated with tumor mutational burden and immune cell infiltration, suggesting a role for NAAA in the tumor microenvironment and immune regulation (Huang2022Insights). High NAAA expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, highlighting its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and immunotherapy response (Huang2022Insights).

## Interactions
N-acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA) is a cysteine hydrolase enzyme that primarily interacts with lipid membranes and substrates. It associates with lipid vesicles through electrostatic interactions, which are facilitated by its hydrophobic helices, particularly α3 and α6. These helices form a positively charged surface that allows NAAA to embed into lipid membranes, a process necessary for accessing its substrates within hydrophobic environments (Gorelik2018Molecular).

NAAA undergoes self-proteolysis in the lysosome, which exposes its catalytic cysteine, enabling it to interact with intraluminal vesicles or lipid droplets. This interaction is crucial for the enzyme's function, as it creates a cavity for substrate accommodation, similar to the 'interfacial activation' seen in other lipases (Gorelik2018Molecular).

The enzyme's activity can be modulated by endogenous molecules such as phospholipids and thiol compounds, which enhance its activity. Phosphatidylcholine and dihydrolipoic acid are known to significantly stimulate NAAA activity, suggesting that these molecules may help maintain its function within lysosomes (Tai2012Endogenous). These interactions highlight NAAA's role in cellular processes related to inflammation and pain regulation.
