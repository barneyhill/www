# PIEZO1

## Overview
PIEZO1 is a gene that encodes the piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1, a large transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in mechanotransduction. This protein is characterized by its unique trimeric structure, which includes a central ion-conducting pore and peripheral propeller blades, allowing it to convert mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals (Saotome2017Structure; Zhao2018The). As a mechanosensitive ion channel, PIEZO1 is involved in various physiological processes, including the regulation of vascular function, red blood cell volume, and cellular responses to mechanical stress (Cinar2015Piezo1; Bagriantsev2014Piezo). Mutations in the PIEZO1 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, such as hereditary xerocytosis and generalized lymphatic dysplasia, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Alper2017Genetic; Bae2013Xerocytosis).

## Structure
The PIEZO1 protein is a large mechanosensitive ion channel composed of over 2,500 amino acids, forming a trimeric structure with a unique three-bladed, propeller-like architecture. This structure includes a central ion-conducting pore module and three surrounding peripheral propeller blades, which function as the mechanotransduction module (Saotome2017Structure; Zhao2018The). The protein features an unprecedented 38-transmembrane topology, organized into repetitive transmembrane helical units (THUs) and a C-terminal OH-IH pair (Zhao2018The). Each THU consists of four transmembrane helices, contributing to the protein's curved transmembrane region (Saotome2017Structure).

The C-terminal region is crucial for the ion-permeation properties of PIEZO1, with specific residues like a conserved glutamate playing a significant role in ion conduction (Coste2015Piezo1). The protein also includes a central cap formed by a trimeric complex of the C-terminal extracellular domain (CED), which is extracellular along with the blades, while the beams and C-terminal domains (CTDs) are intracellular (Wang2017The).

PIEZO1 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can affect its function and localization. The protein's structure allows it to convert mechanical forces into selective cation permeation, essential for various physiological processes (Zhao2018The).

## Function
PIEZO1 is a mechanosensitive ion channel that plays a critical role in converting mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals in various cell types. It is primarily located in the plasma membrane but can also be found in the endoplasmic reticulum and near the nucleus (Wei2019Adenosine). PIEZO1 is involved in the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in response to mechanical forces such as membrane stretch, shear stress, and compression. This ATP release activates purinergic P2 receptors, which are essential for mechanoregulation in mechanosensitive cells (Wei2019Adenosine).

In endothelial cells, PIEZO1 mediates ATP release in response to shear stress, leading to vasodilation and regulation of vascular function through the activation of P2Y2 receptors (Wei2019Adenosine). In red blood cells, PIEZO1 regulates mechanotransductive ATP release and calcium influx, which are crucial for maintaining cell volume and integrity (Cinar2015Piezo1). PIEZO1 also plays a role in the alignment and migration of endothelial cells in response to shear stress, influencing vascular formation and function (Bagriantsev2014Piezo). These functions highlight PIEZO1's importance in mechanosensation and cellular homeostasis across various tissues.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PIEZO1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role as a mechanosensitive ion channel. Hereditary xerocytosis (HX), also known as dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS), is a notable condition linked to gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO1. These mutations lead to delayed inactivation of the ion channel, resulting in red blood cell dehydration, hemolytic anemia, and symptoms such as jaundice, splenomegaly, and iron overload (More2020Mechanosensitive; Bae2013Xerocytosis; Albuisson2013Dehydrated). 

In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in PIEZO1 are implicated in generalized lymphatic dysplasia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by lymphedema and non-immune hydrops fetalis. This condition is marked by full-body edema and other severe symptoms, including growth retardation and intellectual disability (Alper2017Genetic; Martin‐Almedina2018Human). 

PIEZO1 mutations also affect other physiological processes, such as vascular development and blood pressure regulation, and have been linked to cancer progression and polycystic kidney disease (Alper2017Genetic; Jankovsky2021Recent). The diverse clinical manifestations of PIEZO1 mutations underscore the gene's critical role in various cellular functions and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PIEZO1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, engages in several significant protein interactions that influence its function. One notable interaction is with the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2). This interaction occurs at the ER-PM junction and is crucial for regulating PIEZO1's mechanosensitivity. The linker region of PIEZO1, rich in positively charged residues, is essential for this interaction. Mutations in this region can reduce SERCA2 binding and its inhibitory effect on mechanosensitive currents (Zhang2017A). 

PIEZO1 also interacts with phosphoinositides and cholesterol, which are important for its function. Specific binding sites on PIEZO1 for these lipids are characterized by basic residues, such as lysines and arginines. These interactions are functionally significant and can influence PIEZO1-mediated pathologies (Buyan2020Piezo1).

In the context of the inner ear, PIEZO1 forms multiprotein complexes with other components of the mechanotransduction (MET) complex, such as Tmc1, Tmc2, and Pcdh15. These interactions are crucial for auditory and vestibular functions, suggesting that PIEZO1 plays a significant role in the MET channel complex (Lee2024The).
