# ABHD12B

## Overview
ABHD12B is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 12B, which is part of the alpha/beta hydrolase superfamily. This protein is characterized by its hydrolase activity, which involves the catalysis of the hydrolysis of chemical bonds. The ABHD12B protein is implicated in various biological processes, although its specific functions and interactions within cellular pathways are still under investigation. Research into the gene and its encoded protein is ongoing, with studies focusing on its potential roles in metabolic pathways and disease mechanisms (Qiu2020aarFDC).
