# CDPF1

## Overview
The CDPF1 gene encodes the protein cysteine rich DPF motif domain containing 1, which is characterized by the presence of a cysteine-rich domain. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth, transformation, and survival, and is categorized as a regulatory protein due to its potential roles in these biological functions (BrinkmeyerLangford2021Resilience). While the precise mechanisms of action for the CDPF1 protein remain under investigation, it has been identified as a biomarker for resilience in response to viral infections in mouse models and is implicated in the progression of certain cancers, such as salivary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (xi2023The). Despite its involvement in these processes, the direct link between CDPF1 gene mutations and specific human diseases is not yet fully established, necessitating further research to elucidate its clinical significance (Dorr2018Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The CDPF1 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although specific diseases directly resulting from its mutations or expression alterations are still under investigation. In the context of salivary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), CDPF1 is among the 193 significantly differentially expressed genes identified in a study exploring the genomic landscape of MEC. This suggests a potential role in the progression of this type of cancer, although the exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (xi2023The).

In another study, CDPF1, referred to as Cdpf1, is highlighted as a biomarker for resilience in genetically diverse mouse strains responding to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). This gene is associated with biological functions such as cell growth, transformation, and survival, indicating a possible role in cancer, inflammation, and tissue morphology (BrinkmeyerLangford2021Resilience).

Despite being sequenced in a study on tacrolimus metabolism in kidney transplant recipients, no specific diseases or conditions have been directly linked to CDPF1 gene mutations or expression alterations in this context (Dorr2018Identification). Further research is needed to clarify the clinical significance of CDPF1 in human health and disease.
