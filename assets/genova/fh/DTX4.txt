# DTX4

## Overview
DTX4, or deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 4, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the deltex family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. This protein is characterized by its involvement in the ubiquitination process, a post-translational modification critical for regulating protein stability and function. DTX4 is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm and plays a pivotal role in several cellular signaling pathways, most notably the Notch signaling pathway, where it facilitates the ubiquitination and internalization of the Notch receptor, a key step in cell differentiation and development (Wang2021Functions; Chastagner2017Ligandactivated). Additionally, DTX4 is involved in the regulation of the innate immune response by modulating the degradation of TBK1, a kinase essential for antiviral signaling (Wang2021Functions; Charoenthongtrakul2012The). The gene's expression and activity are influenced by DNA promoter methylation and microRNAs, highlighting its complex regulatory role in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer and immune-related diseases (Wang2021Functions; Kulesh2023Quantitative).

## Structure
DTX4 is a member of the Deltex family of ubiquitin E3 ligases, characterized by a conserved domain architecture. The protein contains three primary domains: the N-terminal WWE motifs, a proline-rich region, and a C-terminal RING domain. The WWE motifs are involved in binding to the ankyrin repeats of the Notch receptor, which is crucial for DTX4's role in Notch signaling regulation (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The). The proline-rich region contributes to protein interactions and is located upstream of the RING domain (Scalia2023The). The RING domain, specifically the RING-H2 type, is essential for the E3 ligase activity of DTX4, facilitating the ubiquitination process (Wang2021Functions; Scalia2023The).

DTX4 is primarily expressed in the cytoplasm but can translocate to the nucleus under specific conditions, as suggested by the presence of a predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS) within the proline-rich region (Scalia2023The). The protein is involved in post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which are critical for its function in cellular signaling pathways, including Notch and IFN-I signaling (Wang2021Functions; Chastagner2017Ligandactivated).

## Function
DTX4 (deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 4) is a member of the deltex family of ubiquitin E3 ligases, primarily expressed in the cytoplasm and involved in several critical cellular processes. It plays a significant role in the Notch signaling pathway by ubiquitinating Notch1, which facilitates its internalization and subsequent cleavage by ADAM10. This cleavage is crucial for the formation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), essential for proper cell signaling and development (Wang2021Functions). DTX4 also participates in the regulation of the IFN-I signaling pathway in innate immunity, where it forms a complex to polyubiquitinate and degrade TBK1, modulating the immune response to viral infections (Wang2021Functions).

In terms of cell differentiation, DTX4 influences T-cell development and preadipocyte differentiation by regulating the expression of key transcription factors and adipogenic markers (Wang2021Functions). It is also involved in the differentiation of hepatic stellate cells, with its activity being modulated by DNA promoter methylation (Wang2021Functions). DTX4's expression is regulated by DNA promoter methylation and various microRNAs, indicating its complex role in cellular processes and potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2021Functions).

## Clinical Significance
DTX4 (deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 4) is implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In chronic hepatitis B, reduced expression of DTX4 affects the IFN-I signaling pathway, potentially increasing the persistence of the hepatitis B virus (Wang2021Functions). DTX4 is also associated with cancer progression, as its expression is upregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, suggesting a role in tumor development and metastasis (Wang2021Functions). The gene's expression is influenced by DNA promoter methylation and microRNAs, which can impact cellular processes like differentiation and apoptosis, contributing to cancer development (Wang2021Functions).

In the context of retinal development, DTX4 expression levels correlate with variations in AII amacrine cell numbers, indicating its regulatory role in cell proliferation and differentiation. Overexpression of DTX4 reduces the proportion of amacrine cells, likely due to its positive regulation of Notch signaling, which suppresses pro-neural gene activity (Kulesh2023Quantitative). These findings suggest that DTX4's modulation of Notch signaling and other pathways can have significant implications for both developmental processes and disease states.

## Interactions
DTX4 (deltex E3 ubiquitin ligase 4) is involved in several protein interactions that play crucial roles in cellular signaling pathways. It acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of specific target proteins. In the Notch signaling pathway, DTX4 interacts with the Notch receptor, promoting its ubiquitylation and internalization, which are essential steps for Notch activation and subsequent processing by ADAM10 (Chastagner2017Ligandactivated). DTX4 co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with Notch, indicating a stable interaction that persists even without ligand activation (Chastagner2017Ligandactivated).

DTX4 also plays a role in the regulation of innate antiviral signaling by interacting with TBK1, a kinase involved in the immune response. It forms a complex with NLRP4, which acts as an adaptor to recruit DTX4 for the ubiquitination and degradation of TBK1, thereby modulating the immune response (Wang2021Functions; Charoenthongtrakul2012The). Additionally, DTX4 interacts with CDK2, which recruits it to enhance the K48-linked ubiquitination of TBK1, further promoting its degradation (Lu2024Fish). These interactions highlight DTX4's role in both developmental and immune regulatory processes.
