# CREB3

## Overview
CREB3, also known as Luman or LZIP, is a gene that encodes the cAMP responsive element binding protein 3, a type II membrane-associated transcription factor. This protein is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization, and a transmembrane domain that anchors it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Chan2011CREB3; Ohhashi2018Elucidating). As a transcription factor, CREB3 is involved in regulating gene expression in response to cellular stress and metabolic signals, playing a pivotal role in processes such as the unfolded protein response and lipid metabolism (Khan2019The). The protein undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis, allowing its N-terminal fragment to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription (Audas2008A). CREB3's interactions with other proteins, such as HDAC3, and its involvement in various cellular pathways underscore its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in disease states (Kim2010HDAC3).

## Structure
CREB3, also known as Luman or LZIP, is a type II endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-bound transcription factor characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, which facilitates DNA binding and dimerization (Chan2011CREB3; Ohhashi2018Elucidating). The protein also contains a transmembrane domain located C-terminally to the bZIP domain, anchoring it to the ER membrane (Khan2019The). This structural configuration allows CREB3 to be classified as a type II membrane-associated protein, with the N-terminus facing the cytoplasm and the C-terminus penetrating the ER membrane (Chan2011CREB3).

CREB3 undergoes regulated intramembrane proteolysis, a process that releases the N-terminal fragment, enabling it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription (Audas2008A). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which is conserved across the CREB3 family and plays a role in regulating its activity (Khan2019The). CREB3 also interacts with other proteins, such as HDAC3, through its bZIP domain, influencing transcriptional activity (Kim2010HDAC3). The protein's stability and activity are further modulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and interactions with ER-Golgi resident factors (Ohhashi2018Elucidating).

## Function
CREB3, also known as Luman or LZIP, is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to cellular stress and metabolic signals. It is part of the CREB3 subfamily of membrane-bound bZIP transcription factors and is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. CREB3 is activated through regulated intramembrane proteolysis, a process that involves its transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved to release the N-terminal fragment. This fragment then translocates into the nucleus to activate genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Chan2011CREB3).

In healthy human cells, CREB3 is involved in the regulation of secretory machinery and metabolism. It regulates the transcription of genes involved in COPII vesicle formation, which is crucial for protein secretion (Khan2019The). CREB3 also plays a role in lipid metabolism and is implicated in the regulation of plasma triglyceride levels and cholesterol metabolism (Khan2019The). Additionally, CREB3 is involved in the cellular response to Golgi stress, mediating the upregulation of ARF4, a process that is essential for maintaining Golgi integrity and mediating stress responses (Reiling2013A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CREB3L1 gene are associated with various diseases and conditions. In cancer, CREB3L1 plays a significant role in tumor progression and metastasis. Its expression is often altered in different cancer types, with upregulation observed in invasive cancer cells, promoting invasion and metastasis through mechanisms like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mTOR signaling (Feng2017Cancerspecific; Lin2022Pancancer). In breast cancer, CREB3L1 acts as a metastasis suppressor, and its loss is linked to increased metastatic potential (Mellor2013CREB3L1). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CREB3L1 expression levels can predict the response to doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, with higher expression correlating with better treatment outcomes (Denard2018CREB3L1).

CREB3L1 is also implicated in osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones. A specific variant in the CREB3L1 gene disrupts normal protein secretion processes, contributing to the development of this condition (Keller2018Monoallelic). In low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, CREB3L1 is involved through genetic fusions, which are associated with tumor formation (Zhao2024The). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of CREB3L1 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
CREB3, also known as Luman, is a transcription factor that engages in various protein-protein interactions crucial for its function. It interacts with the host cell factor 1 (HCF1) through a tetrapeptide motif, which is similar to the binding sequence of the herpes simplex virus transactivator VP16. This interaction is essential for CREB3's role in transcriptional regulation (Raggo2002Luman; Lu1997Luman).

CREB3 is also involved in regulated intramembrane proteolysis, where it is cleaved by site 1 protease (S1P), allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription (Chan2011CREB3; Raggo2002Luman). It can bind to DNA elements such as the cAMP response element (CRE) and C/EBP element, showing a preference for CRE (Lu1997Luman).

CREB3 interacts with HDAC3, a class I histone deacetylase, specifically through its bZIP domain. This interaction is unique to HDAC3 among class I HDACs and plays a role in repressing CREB3-mediated transcription and migration in metastatic breast cancer cells (Kim2010HDAC3).

Additionally, CREB3 can form homo- and hetero-dimers with other members of the CREB3 subfamily, influencing its transcriptional activity (Chan2011CREB3). These interactions highlight CREB3's involvement in various cellular processes, including the unfolded protein response and transcriptional regulation.
