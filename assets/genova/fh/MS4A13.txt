# MS4A13

## Overview
The MS4A13 gene encodes the protein membrane spanning 4-domains A13, which is a member of the MS4A gene family. This family is characterized by proteins with a tetraspan structure, featuring four transmembrane domains. The MS4A13 protein is particularly noted for its role in sperm development, with high expression levels in the testis and epididymis (Kaneko2017Subcellular). The protein's structure allows it to form lateral associations and potential oligomerization, akin to tetraspanins, which may facilitate its involvement in protein complexes within spermatozoa (Mattiola2021The; Kaneko2017Subcellular). Despite its structural characterization, the specific functional interactions and clinical implications of MS4A13 remain to be fully elucidated.

## Structure
The MS4A13 protein is a member of the MS4A gene family, characterized by its tetraspan structure, which includes four transmembrane-spanning domains (Mattiola2021The; Zuccolo2010Phylogenetic). The MS4A13 gene is composed of 8 exons, and its isoform MS4A13-2 is formed by the removal of exon 7 through splicing, resulting in an open reading frame of 522 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 174 amino acids (Kaneko2017Subcellular). The predicted molecular mass of MS4A13-2 is 19,345 Da, with an isoelectric point of 8.26 (Kaneko2017Subcellular).

The protein structure includes transmembrane regions located at amino acids 14-36, 56-77, 87-109, and 131-153 (Kaneko2017Subcellular). MS4A13-2 has an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and an extracellular C-terminus, with a CD20 domain comprising amino acids 15-117 (Kaneko2017Subcellular). The MS4A13 protein family is noted for having a truncated N-terminal domain, which is unusual compared to other family members (Zuccolo2010Phylogenetic).

MS4A13 proteins can form lateral associations with each other and other protein partners, similar to tetraspanins, suggesting potential oligomerization (Mattiola2021The; Kaneko2017Subcellular). The protein's expression is particularly high in the testis and epididymis, indicating a role in sperm development (Kaneko2017Subcellular).

## Interactions
The MS4A13 protein, part of the membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A, is involved in potential protein interactions within mouse spermatozoa. The study by Kaneko et al. suggests that MS4A13-2 can form protein complexes, as indicated by the presence of bands at 19 kDa, 40 kDa, and larger than 40 kDa in acrosome-reacted spermatozoa. This implies potential homophilic or heterophilic interactions involving MS4A13-2 (Kaneko2017Subcellular). The use of the BS3 crosslinker, a cell-surface crosslinker, supports the idea that MS4A13-2 can form oligomers in sperm membranes (Kaneko2017Subcellular).

While specific interactions of MS4A13 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively documented, the MS4A family, to which MS4A13 belongs, is known for forming lateral associations with other proteins, similar to tetraspanins. These interactions are facilitated by the structural features of MS4A proteins, which include four transmembrane domains and diverse extracellular loops (Mattiola2021The). However, detailed interaction partners for MS4A13 specifically remain largely undefined in the current literature.
