# SLC7A9

## Overview
The SLC7A9 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 7 member 9, also known as b(0,+)AT1, which is a critical component of the heteromeric amino acid transporter system. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and is part of the Amino acid, Polyamine, and Organocation (APC) superfamily. It plays a vital role in the sodium-independent transport of dibasic amino acids and cystine across cell membranes, particularly in the kidneys and small intestine (Chillarón2001Heteromeric; Wu2020Structural). The b(0,+)AT1 protein forms a heterodimer with the rBAT protein, encoded by the SLC3A1 gene, to create the b(0,+) amino acid transport system, which is essential for maintaining amino acid homeostasis (Di2008TwentyFour). Mutations in the SLC7A9 gene are associated with cystinuria, a genetic disorder that leads to the formation of cystine stones in the urinary tract due to impaired reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids (Chillarón2010Pathophysiology; FontLlitjos2005New).

## Structure
The SLC7A9 gene encodes the b(0,+)AT1 protein, a light chain subunit of the heteromeric amino acid transporter complex. This protein is part of the Amino acid, Polyamine, and Organocation (APC) superfamily and features a LeuT fold with 12 transmembrane segments, adopting an inward open conformation (Wu2020Structural). The b(0,+)AT1 protein forms a heterodimer with the rBAT protein, encoded by the SLC3A1 gene, through a disulfide bridge, creating the b(0,+) amino acid transport system (Di2008TwentyFour). 

Key residues such as Trp230 and Asp233 are involved in substrate binding and transport activity, with Trp230 forming an occlusion gate to the extracellular surface (Wu2020Structural). The protein's structure is crucial for its function in reabsorbing cystine and dibasic amino acids in the renal proximal tubule and small intestine (Wu2020Structural). 

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, are important for the maturation and trafficking of the associated rBAT protein, although specific glycosylation sites on b(0,+)AT1 are not detailed (Wu2020Structural). The protein's structure and function are affected by various mutations, which can lead to cystinuria (Di2008TwentyFour).

## Function
The SLC7A9 gene encodes the b0,+ amino acid transporter (b0,+AT), which is a crucial component of the heteromeric amino acid transporter system, specifically system b0,+. This system is responsible for the sodium-independent transport of dibasic amino acids and cystine across cell membranes, primarily in the kidneys and small intestine, but also in the pancreas and liver (Chillarón2001Heteromeric). The transporter functions as an amino acid exchanger, facilitating the electrogenic exchange of dibasic amino acids for neutral amino acids with a stoichiometry of 1:1, which is essential for maintaining amino acid homeostasis in cells (Chillarón2001Heteromeric).

In healthy human cells, SLC7A9 plays a vital role in the reabsorption and absorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids, preventing their accumulation and the formation of kidney stones (Chillarón2001Heteromeric). The proper functioning of this transporter is crucial for maintaining amino acid balance, as it operates as a tertiary active mechanism, mediating the exchange of amino acids across cell membranes (Chillarón2001Heteromeric). The SLC7A9 protein, in conjunction with the heavy subunit rBAT, forms a heterotetrameric complex that is essential for its transport activity and proper localization to the plasma membrane (Chillarón2001Heteromeric).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC7A9 gene are primarily associated with cystinuria, a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of cystine stones in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. This condition arises due to defective transport of cystine and dibasic amino acids in the renal tubules, leading to their excessive excretion in urine (Chillarón2010Pathophysiology; FontLlitjos2005New). SLC7A9 mutations are linked to non-type I cystinuria, which can present a broad range of cystine excretion levels (Schmidt2003Significant). 

The genetic complexity of cystinuria is highlighted by the identification of various mutations in SLC7A9, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice mutations, as well as large genomic rearrangements (Chatzikyriakidou2005Identification; FontLlitjos2005New). Specific mutations such as Gly105Arg, Pro482Leu, and Arg333Trp are frequently observed in different populations, with Pro482Leu being particularly prevalent in Japanese patients (Chillarón2010Pathophysiology; Shigeta2006A). 

These mutations can lead to varying clinical presentations, from normal urinary cystine patterns in some heterozygous carriers to significant kidney stone formation in others (Schmidt2003Significant). The presence of these mutations underscores the importance of genetic testing for accurate diagnosis and management of cystinuria (Botzenhart2002Cystinuria).

## Interactions
The SLC7A9 gene encodes the b0,+AT protein, which forms a heterodimeric complex with the rBAT protein, encoded by the SLC3A1 gene. This complex is crucial for the transport of dibasic and neutral amino acids, including cystine, across cell membranes, particularly in the kidney and small intestine (Chillarón2001Heteromeric; Wu2020Structural). The b0,+AT-rBAT complex functions as a tertiary active transporter, mediating the electrogenic exchange of dibasic amino acids for neutral amino acids with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Chillarón2001Heteromeric).

The interaction between b0,+AT and rBAT involves several structural elements, including van der Waals contacts and disulfide bonds, which are essential for the stability and function of the transporter complex (Wu2020Structural). The complex can form higher-order assemblies, such as super-dimers, which are stabilized by calcium ions (Ca2+) and are critical for the biogenesis and trafficking of the transporter (Lee2022Ca2+mediated). Mutations affecting these interactions, such as those in the Ca2+-binding site, can impair the transport system's function and lead to disorders like cystinuria (Lee2022Ca2+mediated).
