# FOXRED1

## Overview
FOXRED1 is a gene that encodes the protein FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain containing 1, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial function. This protein is categorized as an oxidoreductase and acts as a molecular chaperone specific to mitochondrial complex I, a key component of the electron transport chain involved in oxidative phosphorylation. FOXRED1 is essential for the assembly, stability, and proper functioning of complex I, facilitating the formation of mid-late stage subcomplexes necessary for its full assembly (Zurita2016A; Fassone2010FOXRED1). The protein is localized within the mitochondria, specifically in the inner membrane and matrix, where it contributes to electron transfer processes crucial for ATP production (Fassone2010FOXRED1). Mutations in the FOXRED1 gene can lead to complex I deficiencies, which are associated with various mitochondrial disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular energy metabolism (Fassone2010FOXRED1).

## Structure
The FOXRED1 protein is encoded by the FOXRED1 gene and functions as an FAD-dependent oxidoreductase. It contains an FAD-binding domain, which is crucial for its role in electron transfer and its function as a molecular chaperone specific to mitochondrial complex I (Fassone2010FOXRED1). The protein is composed of 486 amino acids, with an approximate mass of 53 kDa (Fassone2010FOXRED1). 

The primary structure of FOXRED1 includes a highly conserved arginine residue at position 352, which is critical for its function. Mutations at this site, such as the R352W mutation, can disrupt the protein's function by affecting the FAD-binding site (Fassone2010FOXRED1). 

In terms of subcellular localization, FOXRED1 is targeted to the mitochondria, specifically the inner membrane and matrix, facilitated by an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (Fassone2010FOXRED1). The protein is not a structural subunit of complex I but is essential for its assembly, stability, and function, interacting with various complex I subunits and assembly factors (Zurita2016A). 

The tertiary structure of FOXRED1 is suggested to be similar to that of sarcosine oxidase from Bacillus spp., indicating potential structural features that support its function (Fassone2010FOXRED1). However, specific details on the secondary and quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The FOXRED1 gene encodes a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent oxidoreductase that functions as a molecular chaperone specific to mitochondrial complex I, a crucial component of the electron transport chain involved in oxidative phosphorylation. In healthy human cells, FOXRED1 is essential for the assembly, stability, and proper functioning of complex I, facilitating the formation of mid-late stage subcomplexes necessary for its full assembly (Zurita2016A; Fassone2010FOXRED1). Although FOXRED1 is not a structural subunit of complex I, it plays a critical role in its biogenesis by interacting with various subassemblies and assembly factors, such as ACAD9 and AIFM1 (Zurita2016A; Fassone2010FOXRED1).

FOXRED1 is localized within the mitochondria, specifically in the inner membrane and matrix, where it contributes to the electron transfer processes essential for ATP production (Fassone2010FOXRED1). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular energy metabolism, and its dysfunction can lead to complex I deficiencies, which are associated with various mitochondrial disorders (Fassone2010FOXRED1). The presence of FOXRED1 orthologues in higher order fungi, but not in yeast, further underscores its specific role in complex I function (fassone2012biochemical).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FOXRED1 gene are associated with mitochondrial disorders, particularly those involving complex I deficiency. These mutations can lead to mitochondrial encephalopathy, a condition characterized by early infantile onset and progressive neurological symptoms such as neurodevelopmental delay, epilepsy, and elevated lactic acid levels. Patients may also experience poor feeding, vision loss, and multisystem involvement, including cardiovascular dysfunction and abnormal liver function (Fassone2010FOXRED1; Hu2021Clinical).

Specific mutations in FOXRED1, such as c.1054C>T (p.R352W) and c.612_615dupAGTG (p.A206SfsX15), have been identified as pathogenic. These mutations disrupt the assembly and function of mitochondrial complex I, leading to reduced enzyme activity and the accumulation of non-productive subcomplexes (Fassone2010FOXRED1; Formosa2015Characterization). The p.R352W mutation, in particular, is known to interfere with FAD binding, affecting the protein's structure and function (Fassone2010FOXRED1).

FOXRED1 mutations have also been linked to Leigh Syndrome, a severe neurological disorder, and other conditions involving complex I deficiency. These mutations result in decreased levels of mature complex I and impaired energy production in cells (Calvo2010Highthroughput; Zurita2016A).

## Interactions
FOXRED1 is involved in the assembly of oxidative phosphorylation complexes, particularly complex I. It interacts with several nuclear-encoded structural subunits of complex I, including NDUFA9, NDUFV1, NDUFB10, NDUFS6, NDUFA11, and NDUFA13, as well as complex I assembly factors AIFM1 and ACAD9 (Zurita2016A). FOXRED1 also co-immunoprecipitates with the structural subunit of complex III, UQCRC1, and the electron transfer flavoprotein complex subunit ETFB, suggesting its role in forming supercomplexes containing complexes I and III (Zurita2016A).

FOXRED1 is not a structural subunit of complex I but acts as a molecular chaperone necessary for its proper function. It is localized to mitochondria, specifically the inner membrane and matrix, and is thought to associate with the mitochondrial inner membrane near complex I (Fassone2010FOXRED1). The protein's interactions are crucial for the assembly and stability of complex I, as evidenced by its coexpression with complex I subunits and its absence in organisms lacking complex I (Fassone2010FOXRED1). The interactions of FOXRED1 with other proteins are essential for maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity.
