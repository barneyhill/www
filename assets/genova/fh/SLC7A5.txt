# SLC7A5

## Overview
The SLC7A5 gene encodes the solute carrier family 7 member 5 (LAT1), a transmembrane protein that is part of the Amino acid Polyamine organo Cation (APC) superfamily. LAT1 functions as a critical transporter of large neutral amino acids across cell membranes, operating as a Na+-independent antiporter. It forms a heterodimeric complex with the glycoprotein CD98 (SLC3A2), which is essential for its localization and function on the cell surface (Uchino2002Transport; Scalise2018Thea). LAT1 is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain, placenta, and testis, playing a significant role in cellular processes like the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which is vital for cell growth and metabolism (Sokolov2020The; Scalise2018The). The protein's activity is particularly crucial at the blood-brain barrier, ensuring the supply of essential amino acids to the central nervous system (Bay2022Functional). Dysregulation of SLC7A5 is implicated in various pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (El2018The; Scalise2018The).

## Structure
The SLC7A5 gene encodes the LAT1 protein, which is a part of the Amino acid Polyamine organo Cation (APC) superfamily and forms a heterodimeric complex with the glycoprotein CD98 (SLC3A2) (Scalise2018Thea). LAT1 is characterized by its interaction with CD98 through a disulfide bridge at conserved cysteine residues, which is crucial for the trafficking of the LAT1/CD98 complex to the plasma membrane (Scalise2021Chemical). The LAT1 protein has a molecular mass of 55,010 Da and consists of 507 amino acids (Scalise2018Thea).

The tertiary structure of LAT1 includes a LeuT fold, characterized by unwound portions of transmembrane helices 1 and 6, which are involved in substrate binding (Kanai2022Amino). The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of LAT1 has revealed a large hydrophobic pocket around Gly255, which is crucial for the binding of high-affinity inhibitors (Kanai2022Amino). LAT1's activity is modulated by cholesterol, which interacts with conserved regions in the protein, affecting its transport activity and stability (Dickens2017Modulation). The LAT1/CD98 heterodimer is essential for the uptake of essential amino acids and is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer (Scalise2018Thea).

## Function
The SLC7A5 gene encodes the L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1), which is crucial for the transport of large neutral amino acids across cell membranes. LAT1 functions as a heterodimer with the 4F2 cell surface antigen heavy chain (4F2hc), also known as CD98, which is essential for its localization and activity on the cell surface (Uchino2002Transport; Scalise2018The). LAT1 operates as a Na+-independent antiporter, facilitating the exchange of amino acids such as leucine, phenylalanine, and histidine, which are vital for various cellular processes (Dickens2017Modulation; Scalise2018The).

In healthy human cells, LAT1 plays a significant role in regulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is crucial for cell growth, protein synthesis, and metabolism. The transporter facilitates the uptake of leucine, an amino acid that activates mTORC1, a key component of the mTOR pathway (Sokolov2020The; Yoon2018Role). LAT1 is highly expressed in tissues such as the brain, placenta, and testis, where it supports the uptake of essential amino acids necessary for normal development and function (Scalise2018The; Bay2022Functional). Its activity is particularly important at the blood-brain barrier, where it ensures the supply of amino acids to the central nervous system (Bay2022Functional).

## Clinical Significance
The SLC7A5 gene, also known as LAT1, is implicated in various diseases due to its role in amino acid transport. In cancer, SLC7A5 is often overexpressed, contributing to tumor growth and progression. High expression levels are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative, HER2+, and luminal B subtypes, where it correlates with larger tumor size, higher grade, and poor Nottingham Prognostic Index (El2018The). SLC7A5 is also linked to the development of distant metastases in the brain and lung (El2018The). In bladder cancer, SLC7A5 overexpression is associated with higher stage and grade, promoting proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer cells (Zhang2024SLC7A5).

SLC7A5's role extends to neurological disorders, where its dysfunction can affect amino acid transport in the brain. Alterations in its function are linked to conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), where mutations in LAT1 affect histidine transport (Scalise2018The). In ASD, this is significant due to histidine's high affinity for LAT1 (Scalise2018The). The gene's expression is also influenced by factors like cytokines, microRNAs, and DNA methylation, which can impact its role in various physiological and pathological conditions (Scalise2018The).

## Interactions
The SLC7A5 gene encodes the LAT1 protein, which forms a heterodimeric complex with the glycoprotein CD98 (SLC3A2). This interaction is crucial for the transport of large neutral amino acids across cell membranes, particularly in the placenta and blood-brain barrier (Scalise2018The). The LAT1/CD98 complex is involved in the uptake of essential amino acids and is implicated in various cellular processes, including mTOR signaling (Scalise2018The).

LAT1 also interacts with the Nedd4-2 protein, which mediates its ubiquitylation and endocytosis. This interaction involves the ubiquitylation of lysines in LAT1's N-terminal tail, leading to its endocytosis and degradation, a process significant in both normal and tumor cells (Barthelemy2019Ubiquitylation).

In addition to its role in amino acid transport, LAT1 has been shown to interact with the Kv1.2 voltage-gated potassium channel. This interaction affects Kv1.2's function by reducing its expression and altering its gating properties, which can lead to a non-conducting state. The presence of CD98 can modulate these effects, suggesting a complex regulatory mechanism involving LAT1 and Kv1.2 (Baronas2018Slc7a5).
