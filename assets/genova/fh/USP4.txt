# USP4

## Overview
USP4 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 4) is a gene that encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of protein ubiquitination, a post-translational modification critical for protein degradation, signaling, and cellular homeostasis. The protein ubiquitin specific peptidase 4, encoded by USP4, is categorized as a deubiquitinating enzyme and is involved in the removal of ubiquitin moieties from target proteins, thereby influencing their stability, localization, and function. USP4 is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction, inflammation, and DNA repair, by modulating pathways such as TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB (Hu2021Spotlight). The gene is located on chromosome band 3p21.3 and is expressed in multiple isoforms, which contribute to its diverse functional roles in both normal physiology and disease states, including cancer and immune disorders (Hu2021Spotlight; Wang2020USP4).

## Structure
USP4 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 4) is a deubiquitinating enzyme characterized by a complex molecular structure. The protein contains a C-terminal catalytic domain spanning residues 296-925, which includes two main domains, D1 and D2, and a ubiquitin-like (UBL) containing insert. The catalytic core of USP4 adopts a structure resembling an extended right hand, comprising fingers, thumb, and palm domains. The D1 fragment includes the thumb and part of the fingers, containing the Cys box and QQD box of the active site, while the D2 fragment completes the active site with the His box and the rest of the fingers and palm (Hu2021Spotlight).

USP4 also features a zinc-finger ribbon within the fingers domain, which is involved in the dynamic exchange of ubiquitin at the active site. The N-terminal DUSP-UBL domain (residues 1-228) is separated from the catalytic domain by a linker and is crucial for activating USP4 by promoting catalytic domain turnover. This domain forms a dimer and is essential for USP4 activation (Hu2021Spotlight).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating USP4's activity and localization. Phosphorylation by AKT influences its subcellular distribution, promoting its presence in the membrane and cytoplasm (Das2019Phosphorylation). USP4 is encoded by a gene located on chromosome band 3p21.3 and exists in two dominant isoforms, long and short, with 963 and 916 amino acids, respectively (Hu2021Spotlight).

## Function
USP4 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 4) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes by removing ubiquitin from target proteins, thereby regulating their stability, localization, and activity. In healthy human cells, USP4 is involved in the regulation of SMAD4 monoubiquitination, which is essential for activin and BMP signaling pathways. This regulation is important for maintaining proper signaling required for stem cell fate determination, embryogenesis, and tissue homeostasis (Zhou2017USP4).

USP4 also modulates inflammatory responses by targeting TAK1, a key component in the TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling pathway. By deubiquitinating TAK1, USP4 downregulates NF-κB activation, thus preventing excessive inflammatory responses and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Fan2011USP4).

In the kidney, USP4 regulates water homeostasis by deubiquitinating aquaporin 2, a water channel, thereby influencing its membrane accumulation (Hu2021Spotlight). USP4 is also involved in pre-mRNA splicing and DNA repair, interacting with components like PRP3 and CtIP, respectively, to ensure proper cellular function (Hu2021Spotlight).

USP4 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various signaling pathways, including TGF-β, Wnt/β-catenin, and NF-κB, highlighting its broad role in cellular regulation (Hu2021Spotlight).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the USP4 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In melanoma, USP4 is up-regulated, promoting metastasis and inhibiting apoptosis, which suggests its role as an oncogene. Targeting USP4 could be a therapeutic strategy for melanomas resistant to cisplatin (Guo2018Up‐regulated). In lung adenocarcinoma, USP4 expression is downregulated, and its preserved expression is associated with better survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhong2018USP4).

USP4 also plays a role in other cancers, such as breast, colorectal, and liver cancers, where it can act as both a tumor promoter and suppressor depending on the context. In colorectal cancer, USP4 stabilizes β-catenin and PRL-3, promoting cancer progression (Wang2020USP4). In liver cancer, it promotes tumor growth by stabilizing TβRI and activating the TβRI/pSmad2 pathway (Wang2020USP4).

Beyond cancer, USP4 is involved in immune regulation and inflammation. It modulates the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway, affecting immune responses and potentially impacting autoimmune diseases (Wang2020USP4). In neural injury, USP4 is upregulated after intracerebral hemorrhage and may be involved in neural apoptosis (Wang2020USP4). These diverse roles highlight USP4 as a potential therapeutic target in various conditions.

## Interactions
USP4 (ubiquitin specific peptidase 4) is involved in various protein interactions that influence multiple cellular processes. It interacts with the S9/Rpn6 subunit of the proteasome, a major proteolytic machine in cells, through its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of proteasome structure and function, as well as the turnover of specific proteasomal substrates (Zhao2012The).

USP4 also interacts with ARF-BP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, stabilizing it through deubiquitination. This interaction reduces p53 levels, as ARF-BP1 promotes p53 ubiquitination and degradation, thereby modulating p53 activity and cellular responses to DNA damage (Zhang2011USP4).

In the context of NF-κB signaling, USP4 interacts with TAK1, a key kinase in the pathway, and deubiquitinates it, thereby downregulating TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. This interaction affects the phosphorylation of IKK and IκBα, modulating the expression of NF-κB target genes (Fan2011USP4).

USP4 also plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing by deubiquitinating PRP3, a component of the U4 snRNP, and RNPS1, which aids in splicing site selection (Hu2021Spotlight).
