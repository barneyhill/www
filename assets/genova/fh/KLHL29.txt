# KLHL29

## Overview
KLHL29 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch-like family member 29, which is part of the Kelch-like (KLHL) gene family. This protein functions primarily as an adapter in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, facilitating the degradation of specific target proteins through its interaction with the CUL3 E3-ligase complex. Structurally, kelch-like family member 29 is characterized by the presence of a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and six Kelch repeat motifs, which are essential for its role in protein-protein interactions and substrate recruitment (Dhanoa2013Update; Yao2023KLHL29-mediated). The protein has been implicated in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, particularly in the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it mediates the degradation of oncogenic proteins such as DDX3X (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated). The study of KLHL29 and its encoded protein continues to provide insights into its potential therapeutic applications in cancer treatment.

## Structure
KLHL29 is a protein that belongs to the Kelch-like (KLHL) gene family, characterized by specific structural domains that facilitate its function. The protein contains a BTB/POZ domain, a BACK domain, and six Kelch repeat motifs, which are crucial for its role in protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Dhanoa2013Update; Yao2023KLHL29-mediated). The BTB domain is responsible for binding to the CUL3 E3-ligase, a critical interaction for the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins such as DDX3X (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated). The Kelch motifs form a β-propeller structure, which is essential for recruiting specific substrates, including the RNA-binding protein DDX3X (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated).

The tertiary structure of KLHL29 is defined by these domains, which allow it to function as an adapter protein, bridging CUL3 and its substrates. This structural configuration is vital for its tumor suppressive role in triple-negative breast cancer, where it facilitates the degradation of oncogenic proteins (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated). The presence of these domains and motifs underscores the protein's involvement in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and tumor progression (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated).

## Clinical Significance
KLHL29 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene with significant implications in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). It is notably downregulated in TNBC tissues compared to normal tissues, and this downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, including worse overall survival and relapse-free survival in patients. The gene's low expression levels correlate with increased tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting its role in the aggressive nature of TNBC (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated).

KLHL29 functions by promoting the degradation of the RNA-binding protein DDX3X through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This degradation is crucial because DDX3X is upregulated in TNBC and acts as an oncogenic protein, promoting tumor growth and metastasis. The interaction between KLHL29 and DDX3X is essential for suppressing TNBC progression, as KLHL29's overexpression reduces DDX3X levels, leading to cell cycle arrest and increased chemosensitivity (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated).

In colon cancer, a novel fusion transcript, NR5A2-KLHL29FT, has been identified, resulting from a polymorphic germline insertion at the KLHL29 locus. Although this fusion transcript is expressed at lower levels in colon cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, its role in cancer progression remains unclear and requires further investigation (Sun2017The).

## Interactions
KLHL29 is known to interact with the protein DDX3X, an RNA-binding protein involved in gene expression regulation. KLHL29 promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of DDX3X, a process that is crucial for suppressing the growth of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. This interaction is facilitated by KLHL29's recruitment of the CUL3 E3-ligase, which is essential for the ubiquitination process. The BTB domain of KLHL29 is necessary for binding to CUL3, and deletion of this domain impairs KLHL29's ability to interact with CUL3 and regulate DDX3X levels (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated).

KLHL29's interaction with DDX3X leads to the destabilization of CCND1 mRNA and induces cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, thereby inhibiting TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. This suggests a tumor-suppressive role for KLHL29 in TNBC by mediating the degradation of DDX3X through its interaction with CUL3 (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated). The study highlights the potential therapeutic implications of targeting the KLHL29-DDX3X axis in TNBC treatment, particularly in enhancing chemosensitivity when combined with DDX3X inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy (Yao2023KLHL29-mediated).
