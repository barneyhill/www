# PSD

## Overview
The PSD gene encodes the pleckstrin and Sec7 domain containing protein, which is a member of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) family. This protein is characterized by the presence of pleckstrin homology (PH) and Sec7 domains, which are crucial for its role in cellular signaling pathways. The PH domain is involved in membrane association, while the Sec7 domain is responsible for activating ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), small GTPases that regulate vesicular trafficking and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. The PSD protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal organization, and has been studied for its potential involvement in pathological conditions (Qiu2020aarFDC).
