# RNF207

## Overview
RNF207 is a gene that encodes the ring finger protein 207, which is characterized by the presence of a RING domain, suggesting its function as a ubiquitin ligase. This protein plays a critical role in cardiac physiology, particularly in the regulation of cardiac excitation and energy metabolism. The RING domain of ring finger protein 207 is essential for its interaction with the HERG potassium channel, which is crucial for cardiac repolarization, thereby influencing heart rhythm and function (Roder2014RING). Additionally, ring finger protein 207 interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC1, implicating it in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism (Mizushima2016The). Alterations in the RNF207 gene have been associated with cardiac conditions such as long QT syndrome, highlighting its clinical significance in cardiac health (Fan2018Exome).

## Structure
RNF207 is a protein characterized by a structure reminiscent of tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins, featuring a zinc-binding RING domain, a single zinc-binding B-box of type 1, and a coiled-coil domain in the amino-terminal region (Roder2014RING). The RING domain suggests that RNF207 may function as a ubiquitin ligase, influencing ion channel synthesis, trafficking, and degradation (Roder2014RING). The coiled-coil region, specifically amino acid residues 263-302, is crucial for RNF207's interaction with the mitochondrial outer membrane porin, VDAC1, with lysine 277 and glutamate 278 being critical for this interaction (Mizushima2016The).

RNF207 interacts with several chaperone proteins, including HSP70, and this interaction is dependent on the C-terminal region of RNF207. Deletion of this region significantly reduces the interaction with HSP70, affecting HERG channel expression (Roder2014RING). The protein's interaction with HERG is crucial for cardiac repolarization, as RNF207 increases HERG protein levels and current density, dependent on the RING domain (Roder2014RING).

RNF207 is also involved in ubiquitination processes, promoting the ubiquitination of VDAC1, although it does not affect VDAC1's proteasomal degradation (Mizushima2016The). The protein's expression is significantly reduced in mouse models of cardiac disease, indicating its potential role in stress response and cardiac function (Mizushima2016The).

## Function
RNF207 is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation and energy metabolism. In healthy human cells, RNF207 plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of the HERG potassium channel, which is essential for cardiac repolarization. This protein increases HERG protein levels and current density, suggesting its involvement in the trafficking and localization of HERG channels, potentially through interactions with heat shock proteins such as HSP40, HSP70, and HSC70 (Roder2014RING). The RING domain of RNF207 is essential for its effect on HERG expression, indicating that RNF207 may function as a RING domain ubiquitin ligase (Roder2014RING).

RNF207 is also involved in cardiac energy metabolism. It interacts with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC1, which plays a critical role in mitochondrial function. This interaction is important for maintaining mitochondrial respiratory function and oxidative phosphorylation, as RNF207 knockdown leads to reduced ATP levels and impaired mitochondrial function (Mizushima2016The). RNF207's role in energy metabolism is particularly significant in the heart, where it is predominantly expressed and may serve as a cardiac marker for heart diseases (Mizushima2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the RNF207 gene have been linked to several cardiac conditions, particularly those affecting cardiac repolarization. A specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in RNF207, resulting in a glycine to alanine change (G603A), is associated with QT interval prolongation, a condition that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias (Roder2014RING). Long QT syndrome (LQTS), a rare inherited arrhythmia, has been associated with a novel nonsense mutation (c.439C>T/p.Q147X) in RNF207, which results in a premature stop codon and is linked to syncope and sudden cardiac death in affected individuals (Fan2018Exome).

Alterations in RNF207 expression levels are also implicated in cardiac diseases. The gene's expression is significantly reduced in mouse models of cardiac disease, such as transverse aortic constriction and ischemia/reperfusion, suggesting its involvement in cardiac hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure (Mizushima2016The). In zebrafish, knockdown of RNF207 leads to prolonged action potential duration and slowed conduction velocity, indicating its role in cardiac excitability and conduction (Roder2014RING). These findings highlight the clinical significance of RNF207 in cardiac health, particularly in conditions related to cardiac repolarization and energy metabolism.

## Interactions
RNF207, a heart-specific ring finger protein, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cardiac cells. One significant interaction is with the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC1, a key regulator of mitochondrial metabolism. This interaction is mediated by the coiled-coil region of RNF207, specifically amino acid residues 263-302, and is essential for RNF207's role in cardiac energy metabolism (Mizushima2016The). RNF207 also promotes the polyubiquitination of VDAC1, although it does not affect VDAC1's stability or oligomerization state (Mizushima2016The).

In addition to its interaction with VDAC1, RNF207 is involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation through its interaction with the HERG potassium channel. RNF207 increases HERG protein levels and current density, suggesting a role in HERG trafficking and localization. This interaction is dependent on the RING domain of RNF207, indicating its potential function as a ubiquitin ligase (Roder2014RING). RNF207 also interacts with chaperone proteins such as HSP70, which further elevates HERG expression, implicating a heat shock protein-dependent mechanism (Roder2014RING). These interactions highlight RNF207's role in maintaining cardiac function and its potential involvement in cardiac arrhythmias.
