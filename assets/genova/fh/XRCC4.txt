# XRCC4

## Overview
The XRCC4 gene encodes the X-ray repair cross complementing 4 protein, a pivotal component in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is essential for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. As a scaffolding protein, XRCC4 interacts with DNA ligase IV, stabilizing it during the ligation of DNA ends, a crucial step in the NHEJ process (Mahaney2013XRCC4). The protein is characterized by its ability to form dimers and tetramers, facilitating the formation of long helical filaments with XRCC4-like factor (XLF), which protect and align DNA ends for efficient repair (Mahaney2013XRCC4; Hammel2010XLF). Beyond its role in DNA repair, XRCC4 is also involved in V(D)J recombination, a process critical for immune system development (Li1995The). Mutations in the XRCC4 gene are linked to various clinical conditions, including primary microcephaly and short stature, underscoring its importance in genomic stability and neurodevelopment (Rosin2015Mutations).

## Structure
The XRCC4 protein is a critical component in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway for DNA double-strand break repair. Structurally, XRCC4 is composed of a globular head domain, an elongated α-helical stalk, and an unstructured C-terminal region (CTR) (Mahaney2013XRCC4). The head domain, spanning residues 1-115, facilitates dimerization through head-to-head interactions (Hammel2010XLF). The α-helical stalk, comprising residues 119-203, is responsible for tetramerization and interacts with the BRCT domain of DNA ligase IV (Mahaney2013XRCC4; Hammel2010XLF).

The C-terminal region, although less understood, is crucial for forming tetramers and filament-like structures, contributing to the protein's ability to form higher-order oligomers (Hammel2010XLF). XRCC4 can form long superhelical filaments with XLF, which align DNA ends for ligation, highlighting its scaffolding role in NHEJ (Mahaney2013XRCC4). The interaction between XRCC4 and XLF involves specific residues, forming a complex with a tilt angle between their coil-coil regions (Hammel2010XLF).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation by DNA-PK, regulate XRCC4's DNA binding ability, indicating a mechanism for controlling its function in DNA repair (Hammel2010XLF).

## Function
The XRCC4 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is essential for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. XRCC4 functions as a scaffolding protein that interacts with DNA ligase IV (LIG4), stabilizing it during the ligation of DNA ends, a crucial step in the NHEJ process (Mahaney2013XRCC4). XRCC4 also forms long helical protein filaments with XRCC4-like factor (XLF), which protect and align DNA ends, facilitating their accurate and efficient repair (Mahaney2013XRCC4).

In addition to its role in DNA repair, XRCC4 is involved in V(D)J recombination, a process necessary for the development of the immune system. This process assembles immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor variable region genes from germline segments during early lymphoid development (Li1995The). XRCC4 is required for joining both coding and recognition sequence ends during V(D)J recombination, and its function is non-redundant with other proteins like DNA-PK (Li1995The).

The absence of XRCC4 leads to increased genomic instability, characterized by chromosomal fragmentation and translocations, and is associated with embryonic lethality and defects in cellular proliferation (Gao2000Interplay).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the XRCC4 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily affecting neurological development and growth. These mutations can lead to primary microcephaly, short stature, and increased genomic instability, as observed in individuals from families with identified XRCC4 mutations (Rosin2015Mutations). Specific mutations, such as c.482G>A, disrupt normal splicing and result in a loss of protein function, contributing to these phenotypes (Rosin2015Mutations). 

XRCC4 mutations also result in a syndrome characterized by facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, and short stature, without an immunological phenotype, despite the gene's role in DNA repair pathways crucial for immune function (Rosin2015Mutations). Some mutations, like V83_S105del, show increased radiosensitivity, indicating impaired DNA repair functionality, which may contribute to developmental defects (Asa2021Functional).

In some cases, XRCC4 mutations lead to severe neurological phenotypes without overt immunodeficiency, highlighting a separation of impact where DNA repair defects do not necessarily correlate with immune dysfunction (Guo2015XRCC4). These findings underscore the gene's critical role in maintaining genomic stability and its involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders.

## Interactions
XRCC4 is a critical protein in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway for DNA double-strand break repair. It interacts with DNA ligase IV, forming a complex that is essential for the ligation of broken DNA ends. This interaction stabilizes and enhances the activity of DNA ligase IV, with XRCC4 existing in equilibrium between dimeric and tetrameric forms. Only the dimeric form can bind DNA ligase IV, forming a 2:1 stoichiometry complex, which is crucial for the ligase's function in NHEJ (Modesti2003Tetramerization).

XRCC4 also forms a complex with XRCC4-like factor (XLF), creating long helical protein filaments that are essential for protecting and aligning DNA ends, facilitating accurate and efficient ligation and repair of DSBs. This XRCC4-XLF complex can bridge DNA molecules, maintaining DNA ends in close proximity, which is crucial for effective repair. The interaction between XRCC4 and XLF is necessary for DNA bridging, and mutations that disrupt this interaction abolish the bridging activity (Andres2012A; Mahaney2013XRCC4).

The presence of DNA ligase IV BRCT domains can disrupt both DNA binding and bridging by the XRCC4-XLF complex, indicating that these interactions are mutually exclusive (Andres2012A). XRCC4's interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids underscore its multifaceted role in maintaining genomic stability.
