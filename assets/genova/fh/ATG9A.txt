# ATG9A

## Overview
ATG9A is a gene that encodes the autophagy-related protein 9A, a multi-span transmembrane protein integral to the autophagic process in human cells. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes multiple transmembrane helices and a central pore, facilitating its function as a lipid scramblase. ATG9A plays a pivotal role in the formation and expansion of autophagosomes, essential vesicles for cellular degradation and recycling. It is primarily localized to the trans-Golgi network and endosomal system, cycling between these compartments to support autophagosome formation. Beyond its role in autophagy, ATG9A is involved in lipid mobilization, mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, and various cellular signaling pathways. Mutations in the ATG9A gene have been associated with clinical conditions such as primary ovarian insufficiency and inflammatory pathologies, underscoring its significance in cellular homeostasis and human health (Huyghe2022ATG9A; Mailler2021The; Maeda2020Structure).

## Structure
The ATG9A protein is a multi-span transmembrane protein involved in autophagy, characterized by a complex structure that includes six predicted transmembrane helices (TMHs) and two reentrant membrane helices (RMHs) (Maeda2020Structure). The protein forms a tri-lobed trimer with a central pore, which is hydrophilic and positively charged, facilitating its role in lipid scrambling and autophagosome formation (Maeda2020Structure). The N- and C-terminal halves of ATG9A share membrane and tertiary topology, with TMH hairpins flanked by α-helices (Maeda2020Structure).

The quaternary structure of ATG9A is a stable trimer, with the TMH3-4 hairpins circularly swapped among the three lobes, contributing to its stability (Maeda2020Structure). The protein can adopt two conformations, with the central pore either closed or laterally opened, which is crucial for its function as a lipid scramblase (Maeda2020Structure). The ATG9A protein also shows structural similarities to type I ABC exporters, suggesting a potential transporter role (Maeda2020Structure).

ATG9A is glycosylated at Asn99, and its structure is dynamic, allowing for interactions with other proteins like ATG2A, which enhances lipid transfer efficiency (Wang2024Structural; Maeda2020Structure).

## Function
The ATG9A gene encodes a multispanning membrane protein that plays a crucial role in autophagy and lipid mobilization in human cells. ATG9A is involved in the formation of autophagosomes, essential vesicles for cellular degradation and recycling processes. It localizes primarily to the trans-Golgi network and endosomal system, cycling between these compartments through vesicle trafficking. This trafficking is critical for autophagosome formation, as ATG9A transiently localizes to autophagic membranes upon autophagy induction (Imai2016Atg9A).

ATG9A functions as a scramblase, flipping phospholipids between membrane leaflets, which is vital for the expansion of the phagophore membrane during autophagy. It also facilitates the mobilization of lipids from lipid droplets to mitochondria, supporting mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism and respiration (Mailler2021The). The protein is part of a module with TMEM41B and ATG2A/B, which is important for the transport of fatty acids and phospholipids (Mailler2021The).

In addition to its role in autophagy, ATG9A is involved in non-autophagic processes such as mitochondrial fatty acid import, β-oxidation, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. It also plays a role in the innate immune response and cellular signaling pathways (Mailler2021The). ATG9A's activity is modulated by its acetylation status, which influences its interactions with proteins involved in ER quality control and reticulophagy (Sheehan2021ATG9A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ATG9A gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily due to its role in autophagy. One significant condition associated with ATG9A mutations is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), a disorder characterized by premature depletion of ovarian follicles leading to infertility. The ATG9A p.Arg758Cys variant has been identified in women with POI, where it impairs autophagy, crucial for germ cell survival and ovarian reserve maintenance. This variant is associated with primary amenorrhea and a total depletion of follicles, indicating its severe impact on ovarian function (Delcour2019ATG7).

ATG9A is also implicated in preventing TNF-induced cytotoxicity through a lysosomal targeting pathway. Deficiencies in ATG9A can lead to embryonic lethality due to uncontrolled TNF-mediated apoptosis, particularly affecting fetal liver hematopoietic cells. This suggests that mutations in ATG9A could be linked to inflammatory pathologies in humans, as they result in the inactivation of Complex IIa detoxification (Huyghe2022ATG9A). In mouse models, keratinocyte-specific deletion of ATG9A results in severe inflammatory skin phenotypes, highlighting its role in maintaining skin homeostasis and preventing inflammatory skin diseases (Huyghe2022ATG9A).

## Interactions
ATG9A is a multi-span transmembrane protein involved in autophagy, primarily through its role in lipid redistribution and autophagosome formation. It interacts with ATG2A, forming a complex that is crucial for lipid transfer from donor membranes like the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the phagophore, a precursor to the autophagosome. This interaction is essential for establishing contact sites between the ER and phagophore, facilitating the expansion of the phagophore membrane (GómezSánchez2018Atg9; Wang2024Structural).

ATG9A forms a trimer that can bind to ATG2A through a single subunit, with the other two subunits being less resolved. This interaction is vital for the lipid transfer process, as ATG9A aligns its lateral pore with the ATG2A lipid transfer cavity, allowing for direct lipid transfer (Wang2024Structural). ATG9A also interacts with WIPI4, which anchors ATG2A to PI3P-positive phagophore membranes, further supporting its role in autophagy (Wang2024Structural).

Additionally, ATG9A may interact with other proteins such as VAMP1 and TMEM41B, which are ER resident lipid scramblases, suggesting a role in re-equilibrating membrane leaflets during lipid transfer (Wang2024Structural). The interaction with TMEM41B is dependent on ATG2A/B, as it is disrupted in cells lacking these proteins (Mailler2021The).
