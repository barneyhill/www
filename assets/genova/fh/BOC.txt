# BOC

## Overview
The BOC gene encodes a protein known as BOC cell adhesion associated, oncogene regulated, which is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is characterized by its structural composition, including an extracellular region with immunoglobulin-like domains and fibronectin type III repeats, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular region. BOC functions primarily as a co-receptor in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, playing a crucial role in developmental processes such as craniofacial development and myogenic differentiation. It is involved in both promoting and antagonizing Hedgehog signaling, depending on the tissue context, and interacts with other proteins like CDON and PTCH1 to form receptor complexes that modulate pathway activity. BOC's interactions and regulatory functions are significant in various biological processes and have implications in developmental disorders and conditions such as holoprosencephaly and heart failure (EchevarríaAndino2020The; Kang2002BOC; Ahmed2020Elevated).

## Structure
The BOC protein is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and is characterized by a specific structural motif. It consists of an extracellular region with four Ig-like domains followed by three fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats, a single-pass transmembrane domain, and a divergent intracellular region (SanchezArrones2012Cdon; Kang2002BOC). The FNIII domains are crucial for its function, particularly in the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway, where they interact with Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and PTCH1 (Hong2017BOC; Song2015Distinct).

The intracellular domain of BOC contains motifs such as YXXP, which facilitate interactions with proteins like ABL, and is subject to tyrosine phosphorylation (Vuong2017A). BOC undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions (SanchezArrones2012Cdon).

BOC forms both homophilic and heterophilic complexes, interacting with other proteins such as CDON and members of the Hedgehog signaling pathway (SanchezArrones2012Cdon). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in myogenic differentiation and axon guidance (Kang2002BOC; Song2015Distinct).

## Function
The BOC gene encodes a co-receptor involved in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway, which is crucial for various developmental processes, including craniofacial development and myogenic differentiation. BOC functions as a multi-functional regulator of Hedgehog (HH) signaling, capable of both promoting and antagonizing the pathway depending on the tissue context. It interacts with HH ligands and the canonical receptor PTCH1, potentially forming receptor complexes that can either activate or inhibit HH pathway activity (EchevarríaAndino2020The).

In craniofacial development, BOC appears to antagonize HH signaling, as evidenced by increased Gli1 expression in the absence of BOC, suggesting its role in restricting pathway activity (EchevarríaAndino2020The). BOC also influences tissue-specific functions, such as promoting the expression of the HH transcriptional target NKX2.2 in the spinal cord neuroepithelium but not in the telencephalon (EchevarríaAndino2020The).

BOC's activity is primarily at the cell membrane, where it contributes to the formation of protein complexes that regulate cellular responses and tissue organization. Its extracellular domain may sequester SHH ligand in areas of low concentration, thereby modulating HH signaling (EchevarríaAndino2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the BOC gene have been implicated in several developmental disorders and conditions. BOC is identified as a modifier gene in holoprosencephaly (HPE), a developmental defect of the forebrain and midface. Variants in BOC, such as p.Arg533Leu, p.Gly556Glu, p.Arg697Pro, and p.Pro828Arg, have been associated with HPE, influencing the severity of the condition by modulating Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling (Hong2017BOC). The p.Gly556Glu variant, in particular, is a gain-of-function mutant that enhances SHH signaling, while other variants may have loss-of-function effects (Hong2017BOC).

BOC also plays a role in craniofacial development, where its deletion can lead to increased Hedgehog (HH) pathway activity, resulting in facial widening. This suggests that BOC acts as an antagonist in HH signaling during craniofacial development (EchevarríaAndino2020The). In heart failure patients, elevated plasma BOC levels have been observed, which decrease after heart transplantation, indicating a potential role in cardiac function and as a biomarker for heart failure (Ahmed2020Elevated). These findings highlight BOC's involvement in various developmental and pathological processes.

## Interactions
BOC, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, interacts with the CDO protein to regulate myogenic differentiation. This interaction is specific, as BOC does not form complexes with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in transiently transfected cells. The interaction between BOC and CDO occurs in cis, within the same cell membrane, involving both their extracellular and intracellular domains. Soluble fusion proteins containing the ectodomains of BOC and CDO can associate in vitro, demonstrating direct binding without other cellular components (Kang2002BOC).

BOC also functions as a receptor for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in axon guidance, binding directly to Shh through its third FNIII domain. This interaction is crucial for Shh-mediated axon guidance, as shown by experiments where knocking down BOC expression in neurons diminished axon turning towards Shh (Okada2006Boc). BOC and CDO bind to Shh with high affinity, similar to the known Shh receptor Hhip1, and this binding is necessary for enhancing Shh signaling (Tenzen2006The).

BOC's interactions with Shh and CDO are part of a feedback network in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, where BOC and CDO expression is negatively regulated by Hh signaling (Tenzen2006The).
