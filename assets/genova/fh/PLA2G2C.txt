# PLA2G2C

## Overview
The PLA2G2C gene encodes the protein phospholipase A2 group IIC, which is a member of the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzyme family. These enzymes are involved in the hydrolysis of phospholipids, releasing arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids, which are precursors for bioactive lipid mediators. Phospholipase A2 group IIC is categorized as a secretory phospholipase, which typically functions in the extracellular environment to modulate inflammatory responses and other physiological processes. The specific biological roles and regulatory mechanisms of PLA2G2C remain less well-characterized compared to other PLA2 family members, but it is believed to play a role in lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways (Qiu2020aarFDC).
