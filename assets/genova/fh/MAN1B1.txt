# MAN1B1

## Overview
The MAN1B1 gene encodes the enzyme mannosidase alpha class 1B member 1, a crucial component of the glycosyl hydrolase family 47, which is involved in the processing of N-glycans. This enzyme, also known as endoplasmic reticulum mannosyloligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase (ERManI), plays a significant role in the quality control of glycoproteins within the secretory pathway of cells. It is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, where it participates in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) process by trimming mannose residues from glycoproteins, thus facilitating the degradation of misfolded proteins (Rymen2013MAN1B1; Sun2020The). Beyond its enzymatic activity, MAN1B1 also has a non-enzymatic role in protein quality control, acting as a gatekeeper in the Golgi apparatus to enhance the retention and degradation of misfolded proteins (Iannotti2014A). Mutations in the MAN1B1 gene are linked to several clinical conditions, including autosomal recessive intellectual disability and congenital disorders of glycosylation, underscoring its importance in maintaining cellular proteostasis (Rymen2013MAN1B1; Rafiq2011Mutations).

## Structure
The MAN1B1 protein is a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 47 and is involved in N-glycan processing. It is composed of 699 amino acids and includes several structural components: an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal luminal tail containing the catalytic domain (Sun2020The). The protein's structure features an (aa)7 barrel with a Ca2+ ion bound at the core of an active-site pocket, crucial for its enzymatic function (Rafiq2011Mutations).

The MAN1B1 protein has a luminal stem region that includes a highly conserved decapeptide sequence (DPS) from Val-205 to Glu-214, which is essential for its non-enzymatic role in protein quality control within the Golgi complex (Iannotti2014A). This region is conserved among vertebrate orthologs, indicating its evolutionary significance (Iannotti2014A).

Post-translational modifications of MAN1B1 include O-glycosylation and sialylation on four threonine residues within its luminal stem, affecting its molecular weight and appearance in Western blot analysis (Iannotti2014A). The protein's cytoplasmic tail has evolved to acquire a novel regulatory capacity, promoting the degradation of misfolded proteins (Sun2020The).

## Function
The MAN1B1 gene encodes the enzyme endoplasmic reticulum mannosyloligosaccharide 1,2-alpha-mannosidase (ERManI), which plays a crucial role in the quality control of glycoproteins within the secretory pathway of cells. In healthy human cells, MAN1B1 is involved in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) process, which targets misfolded proteins for degradation by the proteasome. This process is essential for maintaining protein homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins that can lead to cellular dysfunction (Rymen2013MAN1B1; Sun2020The).

MAN1B1 functions by cleaving the terminal mannose from the middle branch of Man9GlcNAc2, producing Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B, which is a key step in protein quality control. This trimming process is essential for the proper functioning of the glycosylation pathway (Rymen2013MAN1B1). Although traditionally thought to function primarily through its enzymatic activity, recent studies suggest that MAN1B1 also has a non-enzymatic role in quality control, particularly in the Golgi apparatus, where it may act as a gatekeeper, enhancing the retention and degradation of misfolded proteins (Iannotti2014A). This dual functionality highlights its importance in the proteostasis network, ensuring the proper degradation of misfolded proteins and preventing diseases related to protein misfolding (Sun2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MAN1B1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily autosomal recessive intellectual disability (NS-ARID) and congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), specifically a subtype known as CDG-II. These mutations lead to impaired glycosylation of proteins and lipids, resulting in a range of clinical phenotypes including intellectual and developmental disabilities, facial dysmorphism, truncal obesity, and hypotonia (Rymen2013MAN1B1; Rafiq2011Mutations; Balasubramanian2019MAN1BCDG:). 

MAN1B1 mutations disrupt the enzyme's function in the Golgi apparatus, affecting glycoprotein quality control and leading to altered Golgi morphology. This disruption contributes to the clinical features observed in patients, such as developmental delays and behavioral problems (Rymen2013MAN1B1; Zhalsanova2022Case). 

Rafiq syndrome, also known as MAN1B1-CDG, is a specific condition caused by these mutations, characterized by intellectual and motor development delays, facial dysmorphism, and behavior problems. The syndrome is rare, with over 40 cases described worldwide, and involves about 20 known pathogenic variants of the MAN1B1 gene (Zhalsanova2022Case). 

Whole-exome sequencing has been instrumental in identifying MAN1B1 mutations in affected individuals, highlighting the importance of genetic testing in diagnosing these conditions (Hoffjan2015MAN1B1).
