# HELZ2

## Overview
HELZ2, or helicase with zinc finger 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and DNA repair. The HELZ2 protein is characterized by its helicase activity, which enables it to unwind nucleic acids, and its zinc finger domains, which facilitate interactions with specific DNA and RNA sequences. As a transcriptional coactivator, HELZ2 plays a crucial role in modulating the activity of nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), thereby influencing adipocyte differentiation and energy homeostasis. Additionally, HELZ2 is implicated in lipid metabolism and antiviral responses, particularly through its interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and its role as an interferon-stimulated gene. The protein's ability to inhibit LINE-1 retrotransposition underscores its importance in maintaining genomic stability (Luqman-Fatah2022The; KatanoToki2021SFPQ; Fusco2017HELZ2).

## Function
HELZ2 (helicase with zinc finger 2) is a protein that plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and DNA repair. It functions as a coactivator for nuclear receptors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), which is crucial for adipocyte differentiation and energy homeostasis (KatanoToki2021SFPQ; KatanoToki2013THRAP3). HELZ2 is involved in lipid metabolism, interacting with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and influencing intracellular lipid states, which is important for its role in antiviral responses, particularly against the dengue virus (Fusco2017HELZ2).

In the context of interferon (IFN) response, HELZ2 acts as an IFN-stimulated gene, enhancing its protein levels in the nucleus and participating in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and immune response (Fusco2017HELZ2). HELZ2 also inhibits LINE-1 retrotransposition by destabilizing L1 RNA, thereby playing a protective role in maintaining genomic stability (Luqman-Fatah2022The). The protein's helicase activity is crucial for its function, as it unwinds nucleic acids and interacts with specific DNA and RNA sequences (Luqman-Fatah2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the HELZ2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In the context of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), a study identified a significant association between the A allele of the rs79267778 SNP in HELZ2 and PBC in the Chinese Han population. This mutation results in an amino acid change from Threonine to Methionine at position 1904, which is predicted to be possibly damaging and may increase protein stability (Li2016A).

HELZ2 has also been linked to metabolic disorders. HELZ2-deficient mice show protection against high-fat diet-induced obesity, attributed to enhanced expression of the hepatic leptin receptor, which activates the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, improving insulin sensitivity and reducing hepatic enlargement and triglyceride content (Yoshino2014Protection).

In endometrial cancer, mutations in HELZ2 are associated with longer overall survival, suggesting a potential role in cancer prognosis. HELZ2 is involved in regulating immune-related biological processes, including the type I interferon signaling pathway and T cell activation, which may influence cancer progression (Qiao2019Mutations).

HELZ2 also plays a role in viral infections, such as dengue virus, where its expression is upregulated by interferon, contributing to the suppression of viral replication (Fusco2017HELZ2).

## Interactions
HELZ2, a protein encoded by the human gene HELZ2, is involved in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the ORF1p protein of LINE-1 (L1) in an RNA-dependent manner, inhibiting L1 retrotransposition. This interaction is disrupted by RNase A treatment, indicating that RNA is crucial for the binding between HELZ2 and ORF1p (Luqman-Fatah2022The). HELZ2 also interacts with the nuclear receptor AHR (Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor), a relationship that is maintained during interferon (IFN) stimulation and treatment with the AHR ligand FICZ. This interaction suggests a role for HELZ2 in modulating lipid metabolism and antiviral responses (Fusco2017HELZ2).

HELZ2 is a transcriptional coactivator that interacts with THRAP3, a component of the Mediator complex, enhancing transcriptional activation mediated by PPARγ, a key regulator in adipogenesis. This interaction involves specific domains in both proteins and is crucial for adipocyte differentiation (KatanoToki2013THRAP3). HELZ2 also associates with SFPQ, a proline- and glutamine-rich protein, during white adipocyte differentiation, influencing the regulation of transcription factors essential for this process (KatanoToki2021SFPQ). These interactions highlight HELZ2's role in various cellular processes, including gene expression regulation and immune response modulation.
