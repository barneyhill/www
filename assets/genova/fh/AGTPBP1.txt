# AGTPBP1

## Overview
The AGTPBP1 gene encodes the protein ATP/GTP binding protein 1, also known as cytosolic carboxypeptidase 1 (CCP1), which is a member of the M14 metallocarboxypeptidase family. This protein functions as a deglutamylating enzyme, playing a pivotal role in the post-translational modification of tubulin by removing glutamate residues from the carboxy-termini of peptide chains. This enzymatic activity is essential for regulating microtubule functions, which are critical for neuronal development and function (Rogowski2010A; Shashi2018Loss). AGTPBP1 is widely expressed in differentiating neurons and is involved in the differentiation and survival of various neuronal types, including motor neurons (Kitano2015Bioinformatics). Mutations in AGTPBP1 have been linked to several neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal health and function (Sheffer2019Biallelic).

## Structure


## Function
The AGTPBP1 gene encodes ATP/GTP binding protein 1, also known as cytosolic carboxypeptidase 1 (CCP1), which plays a critical role in the post-translational modification of tubulin through deglutamylation. This process involves the removal of glutamate residues from the carboxy-termini of peptide chains, which is essential for regulating microtubule functions in cells (Shashi2018Loss). The microtubule cytoskeleton is vital for neuronal development, connectivity, plasticity, and function, as it influences neuronal morphology, polarity, cargo transport, and signaling events (Shashi2018Loss).

In healthy cells, AGTPBP1 is crucial for maintaining normal levels of tubulin polyglutamylation, which is important for neuronal function (Türay2021A). The protein is widely expressed in differentiating neurons, including motor neurons, and is involved in the differentiation and survival of cerebellar, retinal, and motor neurons (Kitano2015Bioinformatics). AGTPBP1's enzymatic activity is responsible for shortening polyglutamate side chains on tubulins, maintaining the balance of tubulin's post-translational modifications, which is crucial for microtubule stability and dynamics (Rogowski2010A). This activity is particularly enriched in neurons, making it a promising candidate mechanism for understanding neurodegenerative disorders (Shashi2018Loss).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the AGTPBP1 gene are associated with several neurological disorders. In humans, biallelic variants in AGTPBP1 have been linked to cerebellar degeneration and motor neuropathy, characterized by symptoms such as poor motor control, tremors, and cerebellar hypoplasia (Sheffer2019Biallelic). These mutations can lead to conditions like childhood-onset neurodegeneration with cerebellar atrophy (CONDCA), which includes symptoms such as muscular weakness, hypotonia, and motor developmental delay (Karakaya2019Biallelic). 

In animal models, such as mice and sheep, AGTPBP1 mutations result in similar neurodegenerative phenotypes. In sheep, a missense mutation in AGTPBP1 is associated with lower motor neuron disease, characterized by neuronal degeneration in the spinal cord and brain stem, and muscle atrophy (Zhao2012A). This mutation, specifically the Arg970Pro substitution, affects a conserved region crucial for the protein's catalytic activity (Zhao2012A).

The AGTPBP1 gene's role in deglutamylation of polyglutamylated proteins is crucial for maintaining neuronal health, and its dysfunction can lead to significant neurological disorders, including cerebellar ataxia and motor neuron disease (Sheffer2019Biallelic).

## Interactions
AGTPBP1, also known as ATP/GTP binding protein 1, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with the C9orf72 protein. This interaction has been confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells, where AGTPBP1 was tagged with HA and C9orf72 with Flag. The interaction was further validated using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting techniques (Kitano2015Bioinformatics). The CP domain of AGTPBP1, which is highly conserved, also interacts with full-length C9orf72 tagged with Myc or EGFP in HEK293 cells. This interaction was confirmed in SK-N-SH cells, where endogenous AGTPBP1 and C9orf72 proteins were found to interact (Kitano2015Bioinformatics).

AGTPBP1 is part of the M14 metallocarboxypeptidase family and functions as a deglutamylating enzyme, catalyzing the hydrolysis of polyglutamate chains on tubulins. This activity suggests interactions with tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins, which are crucial for maintaining microtubule stability (Li2024Targeting). In pancreatic cancer cells, AGTPBP1 knockdown led to decreased expression of microtubule-associated proteins MAP1A and MYLK, indicating its role in regulating microtubule dynamics (Li2024Targeting). These interactions highlight AGTPBP1's involvement in cellular processes related to neuronal function and cancer progression.
