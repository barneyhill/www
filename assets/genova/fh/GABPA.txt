# GABPA

## Overview
The GABPA gene encodes the GA binding protein transcription factor subunit alpha, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors. This protein is characterized by its ETS domain, which facilitates DNA binding and is crucial for its role as a transcription factor. GABPA forms a heterodimer with the GABPB subunit, enhancing its DNA-binding affinity and allowing it to regulate a wide array of genes involved in essential cellular processes such as embryonic development, immune response, and cell cycle progression. The protein is particularly significant in mitochondrial function and hematopoietic stem cell maintenance. Alterations in GABPA expression have been linked to various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Zhang2017GABPA; Manukjan2016GABP; Perdomo-Sabogal2016Human).

## Structure
The GABPA protein is a transcription factor that is part of the Ets family, characterized by its ETS domain, which is crucial for DNA binding. This domain consists of four antiparallel β-strands and five α-helices, forming a winged helix-turn-helix motif that binds to purine-rich DNA sequences, preferably 5'-GGAA/T-3' (kang2005structural). The N-terminal region of GABPA contains a novel domain spanning residues 35-121, which is structurally distinct and characterized by a five-stranded β-sheet and a distorted helix, adopting a unique fold related to ubiquitin-like proteins (kang2005structural).

The tertiary structure of this N-terminal domain includes a stable hydrophobic core and a region of negative electrostatic potential, suggesting potential interaction sites for positively charged molecules (kang2005structural). A putative sumoylation site is identified at Lys87, indicating a possible post-translational modification (kang2005structural). GABPA forms a heterotetrameric complex with GABPB subunits, although it is debated whether it exists as an αβ2α tetramer or an αβ heterodimer in solution (kang2005structural). There are no specific details on splice variant isoforms of GABPA in the provided context.

## Function
The GABPA gene encodes the GA binding protein transcription factor alpha subunit, which is a crucial component of the ETS transcription factor GABP. This protein plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It regulates a broad range of genes involved in embryonic development, innate and acquired immunity, myeloid and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, and migratory properties (Zhang2017GABPA).

GABPA is essential for mitochondrial function, as its inactivation leads to early embryonic lethality. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, conditional deletion of GABPA decreases Tfb1m expression, reduces mitochondrial mass and protein synthesis, ATP production, and oxygen consumption (Zhang2017GABPA). It is also involved in the maintenance and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells by activating DNA methyltransferases and histone acetylases (Zhang2017GABPA).

In the context of human hematopoiesis, GABPA is essential for maintaining stem/progenitor cell properties and facilitating myeloid differentiation. Impairment of GABPA leads to reduced myeloid differentiation and clonogenic capacity in CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (Manukjan2016GABP). GABPA also plays a role in cell survival and cell cycle progression through the Yes-associated protein (Zhang2017GABPA).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the GABPA gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), GABPA is downregulated, and its decreased expression is associated with poor prognosis, including shorter survival times and increased metastasis. GABPA acts as a tumor suppressor in HCC by regulating E-cadherin expression, which negatively affects cancer cell invasion and migration (Zhang2017GABPA).

In the context of neurological and metabolic diseases, changes in GABPA expression affect genes linked to cognitive disorders such as autism, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. It is also associated with metabolic diseases like diabetes types I and II through genes such as PCMT1 and UGGT2 (Perdomo-Sabogal2016Human).

GABPA plays a crucial role in myeloid differentiation. Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of GABPA leads to significant hematopoietic abnormalities, including a reduction in myeloid cells and aberrant differentiation, which could be linked to conditions like acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and neutropenia (Yang2011GABP).

In thyroid cancers, GABPA regulates DICER1 expression, influencing tumorigenesis and metastasis. Its role in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) involves inhibiting invasion and metastasis, potentially serving as a therapeutic target (Yuan2018GABPA; Paulsson2020GABPAdependent).

## Interactions
GABPA, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, forms a heterodimer with GABPB, which significantly enhances its DNA-binding affinity. This interaction is mediated by the ETS domain of GABPA and the ankyrin-type repeats of GABPB, allowing the complex to recognize specific DNA sequences, such as the core GGA motif (Brown1992Specificities; Batchelor1998The). The GABPA/GABPB heterodimer can further form a heterotetramer, which binds to DNA sequences with two tandem GGA motifs, enhancing transcriptional activation (Bell2015The; Batchelor1998The).

GABPA interacts with DNA by forming both direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the sequence GGAA at the center of its recognition motif. This interaction involves amino acid side chains in helix 3 of GABPA, which lies in the major groove of the DNA (Batchelor1998The). The COOH-terminal extension of GABPA is crucial for its interaction with GABPB, as it reorients the COOH-terminal helix of GABPA, preventing interference with DNA binding (Batchelor1998The).

GABPA's interaction with GABPB is highly specific, as GABPB does not enhance the DNA-binding activity of other ETS-related proteins like ER71, ER81, or Ets-1 (Brown1992Specificities). This specificity is crucial for the functional roles of GABPA in cellular processes.
