# STMN2

## Overview
STMN2 is a gene that encodes the protein stathmin 2, a phosphoprotein primarily involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics within the nervous system. Stathmin 2 plays a crucial role in neuronal development, plasticity, and regeneration by modulating microtubule destabilization, which is essential for processes such as neurite extension and axonal growth (Chauvin2015Neuronal; Gagliardi2022Stathmins). The protein is predominantly expressed in motor neurons and is localized in the cytosol, where it associates with the Golgi apparatus and vesicle membranes (Gagliardi2022Stathmins). Its activity is regulated through phosphorylation, which affects its ability to destabilize microtubules (Gagliardi2022Stathmins). STMN2 is also implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where its expression and splicing are disrupted, contributing to disease pathology (Melamed2019Premature; Gagliardi2022Stathmins).

## Function
Stathmin 2 (STMN2) is a phosphoprotein that plays a critical role in the regulation of microtubule dynamics, which is essential for neuronal development, plasticity, and regeneration. In healthy human cells, STMN2 is involved in promoting microtubule destabilization, a process necessary for neurite extension and axonal growth. It achieves this by sequestering free tubulin, thereby promoting microtubule dynamics or depolymerization, or by releasing free tubulin in response to extracellular signals (Chauvin2015Neuronal; Gagliardi2022Stathmins). 

STMN2 is specifically expressed in the nervous system and is one of the most abundantly expressed genes in motor neurons. It is localized in the cytosol and linked to the Golgi apparatus, where it is attached to trafficked vesicle membranes along axons and in axonal growth cones (Gagliardi2022Stathmins). The protein's activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status, with specific phosphorylation sites at Ser62 and Ser73 reducing its microtubule-destabilizing role when phosphorylated (Gagliardi2022Stathmins). 

STMN2 also plays a significant role in axonal maintenance and regeneration, particularly following axonal injury, where its expression is upregulated and the protein is transported toward the growth cones of regenerating axons (Gagliardi2022Stathmins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STMN2 gene are significantly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In ALS, the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43, a protein that regulates STMN2 splicing, lead to the production of a truncated, non-functional STMN2 mRNA. This dysfunction is linked to axonal degeneration, a hallmark of ALS (Melamed2019Premature; Gagliardi2022Stathmins). Over 40 mutations in the TARDBP gene, which encodes TDP-43, have been identified in ALS patients, underscoring the critical role of TDP-43 and STMN2 in the disease's pathology (Gagliardi2022Stathmins).

Reduced STMN2 expression is also observed in Parkinson's disease and FTD, indicating a broader role in neurodegeneration (Gagliardi2022Stathmins). In FTD, truncated STMN2 serves as a marker of TDP-43 pathology, being highly expressed in affected tissues (Prudencio2020Truncated). The presence of a novel structural variant within the STMN2 gene, specifically a 24 CA repeat, is associated with increased risk and reduced survival in sporadic ALS patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Theunissen2021Novel). These findings highlight the importance of STMN2 as a therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
Stathmin 2 (STMN2) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in neuronal development and plasticity. It interacts with tubulin heterodimers to regulate microtubule dynamics, forming a T2S complex that is influenced by phosphorylation (Chauvin2015Neuronal). STMN2 also interacts with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through its intracellular domain, which may influence APP processing and beta-amyloid production, relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathology (Li2005Interaction; Chauvin2015Neuronal).

STMN2 is palmitoylated by specific DHHC palmitoyl acyl transferases, which facilitates its membrane anchoring and transport within neurons (Chauvin2015Neuronal). This modification is crucial for its interaction with other proteins and its localization to specific cellular compartments. STMN2 is also involved in protein trafficking, particularly in the context of the secretory pathway, and is required for the proper loading of TRPC5 channels into transport packets destined for growth cones (Chauvin2015Neuronal).

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), STMN2 interacts with TDP-43, a protein that regulates its splicing. Mislocalization of TDP-43 leads to aberrant splicing of STMN2 pre-mRNA, contributing to motor neuron degeneration (Liu2024Stathmin; Klim2019ALSimplicated). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of STMN2 in neuronal function and disease.
