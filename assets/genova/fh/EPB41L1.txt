# EPB41L1

## Overview
The EPB41L1 gene encodes the protein erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 1, commonly referred to as protein 4.1N. This protein is a member of the protein 4.1 family, which is known for its role in linking the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, thereby maintaining cellular structure and integrity. Protein 4.1N is characterized by the presence of a FERM domain, which facilitates its interaction with various transmembrane proteins, playing a critical role in cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (Liu2021Abnormal; Liang2020Abnormal). It is particularly significant in neural tissues, where it stabilizes dopamine receptors and is involved in neuronal communication (Han2019Mechanism). Additionally, protein 4.1N has been implicated in tumor suppression, particularly in kidney tissues, by interacting with cell adhesion molecules such as CADM1 (Liang2020Abnormal). Alterations in the EPB41L1 gene have been associated with various cancers and neurological disorders, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states.

## Function
The EPB41L1 gene encodes protein 4.1N, a member of the protein 4.1 family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cell structure and function. Protein 4.1N is characterized by the presence of a FERM domain and is involved in linking the actin cytoskeleton to various transmembrane proteins, which is essential for cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (Liu2021Abnormal; Liang2020Abnormal). In healthy cells, protein 4.1N acts as a bridge connecting the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, contributing to the structural integrity and organization of the cytoskeleton (Astier2003Temporal).

Protein 4.1N is particularly important in neural tissues, where it stabilizes dopamine receptors at the neuronal plasma membrane, suggesting a role in neuronal function and communication (Han2019Mechanism). It is also involved in maintaining normal cell morphology and regulating cell division, proliferation, and intercellular signaling (Liu2021Abnormal). In the context of kidney tissues, protein 4.1N is associated with the cell adhesion molecule CADM1, which acts as a tumor suppressor, indicating its role in maintaining normal cellular adhesion and preventing tumorigenesis (Liang2020Abnormal).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the EPB41L1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), the EPB41L1 gene is epigenetically silenced due to promoter hypermethylation and the overexpression of miR-454-3p. This silencing is associated with decreased expression of the gene, contributing to tumor progression and poor prognosis in these cancer subtypes (Yang2022Tumor).

In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), another form of cancer, EPB41L1 expression is suppressed by miR-431-5p, which enhances tumor cell proliferation and invasion. This suggests that EPB41L1 acts as a tumor suppressor in GBM (Han2019Mechanism).

EPB41L1 is also linked to neurological disorders. A missense mutation in the gene has been reported in a patient with severe intellectual disability and hypotonia, indicating that EPB41L1 haploinsufficiency may contribute to these symptoms (Loddo2018First). Additionally, a de novo single nucleotide deletion in EPB41L1 was identified in a patient with developmental delay and ataxia, associated with Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 11 (Yamada2023Anin).

## Interactions
The EPB41L1 gene encodes the protein 4.1N, which is involved in various interactions with other proteins, particularly in the nervous system and cancer cells. In the nervous system, 4.1N interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGluR8) in the retina, binding to its intracellular C-terminus, and with the α7 acetylcholine receptor (α7AChr), where it is essential for the receptor's plasma membrane localization (Yang20214.1NMediated). It also binds to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1) in neuronal dendrites, linking it to actin filaments and regulating calcium release (Yang20214.1NMediated). 

In cancer cells, 4.1N interacts with the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), influencing spindle orientation and cortical stability, and acts as an antiproliferative mediator by antagonizing NuMA's role in mitosis (Yang20214.1NMediated). It also competes with phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) for binding to PIKE, affecting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (Yang20214.1NMediated). In non-small-cell lung cancer, 4.1N interacts with βII spectrin, E-cadherin, and β-catenin at the lateral membrane of human bronchial epithelial cells (Yang20214.1NMediated). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of 4.1N in cellular processes, particularly in synaptic plasticity, cell proliferation, and adhesion.
