# OR7A10

## Overview
The OR7A10 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 7 subfamily A member 10, which is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by binding specific odorants and initiating signal transduction pathways that lead to the perception of smell (Nahalka20221L). OR7A10 is characterized by its multiple transmembrane domains, a common feature of GPCRs that facilitates interaction with G proteins (Isildayancan2022Proteins). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR7A10 is expressed in other tissues, such as the skin, where it may influence processes like keratinocyte proliferation and immune response regulation (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). The gene has also been implicated in various clinical contexts, including Alzheimer's disease and congenital anomalies, highlighting its potential significance in broader physiological and pathological processes (Jensen2009A; Nahalka20221L).

## Function
The OR7A10 gene encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, primarily involved in the detection of odor molecules. These receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where they bind specific odorants, initiating a signal transduction pathway that results in the perception of smell (Nahalka20221L). The protein structure of OR7A10 includes multiple transmembrane domains typical of GPCRs, which facilitate its role in signal transduction by interacting with G proteins on the intracellular side (Isildayancan2022Proteins).

In addition to its role in olfaction, OR7A10 and other olfactory receptors have been implicated in various physiological processes beyond the nasal cavity. For instance, olfactory receptors, including OR7A10, are expressed in the skin and may influence epidermal homeostasis by affecting keratinocyte proliferation, migration, and cytokine production (Uehara2021Non‐invasive). This suggests that OR7A10 may have broader biological roles, potentially contributing to processes such as skin regeneration and immune response regulation. However, the specific molecular activities of OR7A10 in these contexts remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The OR7A10 gene, which encodes an olfactory receptor, has been implicated in several conditions due to its altered expression or genetic mutations. In Alzheimer's Disease (AD), olfactory dysfunction is a recognized symptom, and OR7A10 has been identified among genes associated with cortical thickness in AD. This suggests a potential link between OR7A10 expression and Alzheimer's, particularly concerning olfactory dysfunction and cortical changes (Nahalka20221L).

In a study on nonsyndromic mental retardation linked to chromosome 19p13, OR7A10 was part of a shared haplotype among affected siblings in a consanguineous family. This haplotype included clusters of olfactory receptor genes, indicating a possible role in the genetic basis of the condition (Nolan2008Fine).

Additionally, a novel chromosome 19p13.12 deletion, which includes OR7A10, was identified in a child with multiple congenital anomalies. Although the study primarily focused on the chromosomal deletion and associated anomalies, it highlights the presence of OR7A10 within the deleted interval, suggesting its potential involvement in the observed clinical features (Jensen2009A). However, specific diseases directly resulting from OR7A10 mutations remain underexplored.

## Interactions
The human gene OR7A10, an olfactory receptor, has been identified to interact with multiple Ece1 peptides secreted by the fungus Candida albicans. These interactions were discovered through a high-throughput enhanced yeast two-hybrid (HT-eY2H) screening, which mapped the global interactome between Ece1 peptides and human proteins. OR7A10 consistently interacted with several Ece1 peptides, including Ece1-I, Ece1-II, Ece1-III, Ece1-IV, and Ece1-V, suggesting its potential role in host-pathogen interactions (Zhang2024Global).

In the context of cancer, OR7A10 is part of a protein-protein interaction network associated with the 'olfactory receptor' protein domain. This network includes other olfactory receptor genes, indicating potential interactions within this domain, although specific interactions involving OR7A10 are not detailed (Ge2017Identification).

Additionally, OR7A10 is located within a genomic region that was found to be deleted in a child with multiple congenital anomalies. However, the study focused on the genomic characterization of the deletion and did not provide specific information on protein interactions involving OR7A10 (Jensen2009A). 

Overall, while OR7A10's interactions with Ece1 peptides are documented, further research is needed to elucidate its broader interaction network and functional implications.
