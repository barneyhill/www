# ID4

## Overview
ID4, or inhibitor of DNA binding 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of proteins, which are known for their role in regulating transcriptional activities by inhibiting DNA binding. The ID4 protein is characterized by its lack of a DNA binding domain, which allows it to modulate cellular processes by forming heterodimers with other HLH proteins, thereby sequestering them and preventing their interaction with DNA. This regulatory mechanism is crucial in maintaining the undifferentiated state of stem and progenitor cells, influencing cell cycle control, differentiation, and development. ID4 is particularly significant in neural development, where it is expressed in neural progenitor cells, and plays a role in inhibiting premature differentiation in various cell types. Additionally, ID4 has been implicated in cancer biology, where its expression can act as either a tumor suppressor or promoter, depending on the cellular context and cancer type (Galatro2013Differential; Patel2015Inhibitor; Ruzinova2003Id).

## Structure
The ID4 protein is a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family and is characterized by its unique structural features. It consists of three exons, with exons 1 and 2 coding for the protein and exon 3 serving as a 3′ untranslated region (Patel2015Inhibitor). The primary structure of ID4 includes 161 amino acid residues, making it the longest protein in the ID family (Patel2015Inhibitor). The secondary structure features a core HLH domain, which is crucial for dimerization with other proteins, such as E47 and ID proteins (Sharma2015Inhibitor).

The N-terminal domain of ID4 is rich in alanine, forming a poly-alanine tract that acts as a flexible spacer element essential for protein conformation and interactions (Patel2015Inhibitor; Sharma2015Inhibitor). The C-terminal domain is proline-rich, contributing to internal disorder and allowing multiple protein-protein interactions (Patel2015Inhibitor). ID4 has the highest predicted disorder among ID proteins, suggesting a lack of a defined three-dimensional structure at the C-terminal (Patel2015Inhibitor).

ID4 can homodimerize and heterodimerize with other ID proteins, such as ID1, ID2, and ID3, which is essential for its function in inhibiting their activities (Sharma2015Inhibitor). The HLH domain is critical for these interactions, and mutations in this domain can disrupt dimerization (Sharma2015Inhibitor). The protein's ability to form heterodimers with other ID proteins is unique to ID4 and not observed with ID1 or ID2 (Sharma2015Inhibitor).

## Function
ID4 (inhibitor of DNA binding 4) is a member of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) superfamily of transcription factors, which plays a significant role in maintaining the self-renewal capacity, pluripotency, and undifferentiated state of stem and progenitor cells. It functions by sequestering and inhibiting the activity of specific target proteins due to its lack of a DNA binding domain, thereby regulating cell cycle control, growth, differentiation, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis (Galatro2013Differential). In healthy organisms, ID4 is particularly expressed in the developing brain, especially in neural progenitor cells, where it is crucial for neural development and morphology (Ruzinova2003Id).

ID4 is involved in inhibiting premature differentiation in certain cell types, such as oligodendrocyte precursors, suggesting its role in regulating cell fate decisions and differentiation processes (Ruzinova2003Id). In the human cornea, ID4 is expressed in corneal fibroblasts and is regulated by cytokines like Transforming Growth Factor β1 (TGFβ1), indicating its involvement in cellular processes such as proliferation and fibrosis (Mohan2016Characterization). ID4's expression is generally lower compared to other ID proteins in various tissues, but it remains a critical component in maintaining cellular homeostasis and development (Yang2013Id).

## Clinical Significance
The ID4 gene plays a significant role in various cancers, acting as either a tumor suppressor or promoter depending on the context. In breast cancer, ID4 expression is often epigenetically silenced in cases like Columnar Cell lesions and Ductal Carcinoma in situ, but it is present in basal cell-like and triple-negative breast cancers (Patel2015Inhibitor). In prostate cancer, ID4 is downregulated, particularly in high-grade tumors, due to promoter hypermethylation, leading to a castration-resistant phenotype (Patel2015Inhibitor). The epigenetic silencing of ID4 is also observed in leukemia, gastric, pancreatic, and lung cancers, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Patel2015Inhibitor).

In glioblastoma, high ID4 expression is associated with angiogenesis and chemoresistance (Patel2015Inhibitor). ID4 is also involved in transcriptional regulation without directly binding DNA, influencing cancer cell growth by down-regulating BRCA1 (Patel2015Inhibitor). The regulation of ID4 expression involves epigenetic mechanisms, including promoter hypermethylation and interactions with transcription factors and hormonal receptors (Patel2015Inhibitor). In prostate cancer, EZH2-dependent H3K27me3 is involved in the epigenetic silencing of ID4, suggesting that targeting the EZH2-DNMT pathway could be a therapeutic strategy (Chinaranagari2014EZH2).

## Interactions
ID4 interacts with various proteins, particularly within the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family, influencing cellular differentiation and proliferation. ID4 lacks a DNA binding domain and functions by forming heterodimers with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, such as OLIG1 and OLIG2, inhibiting their DNA binding activity and thus oligodendroglial lineage commitment (Samanta2004Interactions). This interaction is supported by bacterial two-hybrid analyses and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, which demonstrate that ID4 binds to OLIG proteins, sequestering them in the cytoplasm and preventing their nuclear translocation (Samanta2004Interactions).

ID4 also interacts with other ID proteins, such as ID1, ID2, and ID3, forming heterodimers that can inhibit the pro-oncogenic activities of these proteins. This interaction promotes the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of bHLH proteins like E47, counteracting the inhibitory effects of ID1 and ID2 on E47 (Sharma2015Inhibitor). ID4's ability to form higher-order complexes, such as heterotrimers with ID1 and ID2, highlights its role in modulating transcriptional networks and suggests potential therapeutic applications in cancer biology (Sharma2015Inhibitor).
