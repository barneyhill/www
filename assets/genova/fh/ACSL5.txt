# ACSL5

## Overview
ACSL5, or acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 5, is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. The protein product of ACSL5 is a member of the acyl-CoA synthetase family, which plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism by converting free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters. This conversion is essential for various cellular processes, including energy production, lipid biosynthesis, and the maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis. The enzyme is predominantly localized in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, where it influences both fatty acid oxidation and lipid synthesis (Rajkumar2018ACSL5; PérezNúñez2019Splicesite). ACSL5 is expressed in several tissues, notably in brown adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle, and its activity is crucial for maintaining metabolic balance and supporting physiological functions (Rajkumar2018ACSL5; Bowman2016Acyl). The gene's expression and function have been implicated in various clinical conditions, including metabolic disorders and cancer, highlighting its significance in health and disease (Quan2021ACSL; Tang2018Fatty).

## Function
ACSL5 (acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 5) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in fatty acid metabolism by catalyzing the conversion of free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters. This process is essential for lipid metabolism, energy production, and the synthesis of complex lipids. ACSL5 is primarily active in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, influencing cellular energy homeostasis and lipid biosynthesis (Rajkumar2018ACSL5; PérezNúñez2019Splicesite).

In healthy human cells, ACSL5 is involved in the initial steps of fatty acid metabolism, which is vital for maintaining cellular energy balance and supporting various physiological processes (PérezNúñez2019Splicesite). The enzyme is highly expressed in tissues such as brown adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle, where it contributes significantly to fatty acid oxidation and energy metabolism (Rajkumar2018ACSL5; Bowman2016Acyl).

ACSL5's activity in the mitochondria is particularly important for fatty acid oxidation, a process that provides energy for cellular functions. The enzyme's role in the endoplasmic reticulum is linked to lipid biosynthesis, which is crucial for cell membrane formation and function (Rajkumar2018ACSL5). The presence of specific genetic variants, such as the rs2419621 T allele, can influence ACSL5 expression and enhance fatty acid oxidation, highlighting its potential role in personalized medicine for obesity treatment (Rajkumar2018ACSL5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACSL5 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. A novel variant in ACSL5 has been associated with severe failure to thrive (FTT) in neonates, characterized by symptoms such as recurrent vomiting, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia. This condition is treatable with dietary modifications, including total parenteral nutrition or medium-chain triglyceride-based formulas, which help manage the symptoms and promote normal development (Al‐Thihli2020Deficiency).

In cancer, ACSL5 expression levels have been implicated in various prognostic outcomes. In breast cancer, lower expression of ACSL5 is associated with a worse prognosis, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role (Tang2018Fatty). Conversely, in gastric cancer, ACSL5 has a pro-oncogenic function, where hypomethylation of its promoter region leads to high expression, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis (Quan2021ACSL). Additionally, ACSL5 is involved in drug resistance in gastric cancer cells, where its fusion with the FGFR2 gene confers resistance to FGFR inhibitors (Quan2021ACSL).

These findings highlight the complex role of ACSL5 in disease, where its expression and functional alterations can lead to diverse clinical outcomes.

## Interactions
ACSL5 interacts with several proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which may influence cancer progression. In pancreatic cancer cells, ACSL5 interacts with enzymes such as long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), and fatty acid synthase (FASN) (Quan2021ACSL; Ma2019LOX). These interactions suggest a role for ACSL5 in maintaining lipid metabolic homeostasis and potentially affecting disease progression through these pathways.

ACSL5 is also involved in the regulation of Wnt signaling by mediating the palmitoylation of Wnt2B, which affects its translocation and signaling activities (Quan2021ACSL). This interaction highlights its role in modulating signaling pathways that are crucial for cell proliferation and differentiation.

In the context of type 2 diabetes, ACSL5 expression is regulated by a genomic element containing the rs7903146 SNP within the TCF7L2 gene. This element establishes physical interactions with the ACSL5 promoter, influencing its expression levels (Xia2016The). These interactions underscore the gene's involvement in broader regulatory networks that impact both metabolic and proliferative processes.
