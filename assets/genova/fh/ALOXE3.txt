# ALOXE3

## Overview
ALOXE3 is a gene that encodes the enzyme arachidonate lipoxygenase 3 (eLOX3), which is a member of the lipoxygenase family of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily expressed in the epidermis and plays a critical role in lipid metabolism, particularly in the formation and maintenance of the skin barrier. Unlike typical lipoxygenases, eLOX3 functions as a hydroperoxide isomerase, converting fatty acid hydroperoxides into epoxyalcohols and ketones, which are essential for the processing of skin ceramides and the formation of the corneocyte lipid envelope (CLE) (Krieg2013Aloxe3). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the skin's permeability barrier and overall integrity. Mutations in the ALOXE3 gene have been linked to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI) and other skin disorders, as well as neurological conditions such as Dravet syndrome, underscoring its importance in both dermatological and neurological health (Yu2003The; Gao2021The).

## Structure
The ALOXE3 gene encodes the enzyme epidermis-type lipoxygenase-3 (eLOX3), which is involved in lipid metabolism. The primary structure of eLOX3 consists of 711 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 80.6 kDa and a calculated isoelectric point of 6.85 (Kinzig1999cDNA). The amino acid sequence of eLOX3 shows about 54% identity with other lipoxygenases, such as murine and human 12(R)-lipoxygenases, mouse 8-lipoxygenase, and human 15-lipoxygenase-2 (Kinzig1999cDNA).

The secondary structure includes conserved residues typical of lipoxygenases, such as histidine residues in the lipoxygenase motif and putative iron-binding residues (Kinzig1999cDNA). The enzyme contains an N-terminal β-barrel LH2 domain and a C-terminal catalytic lipoxygenase domain, along with an inserted specific extra domain (Eckl2009Molecular).

eLOX3 functions as a hydroperoxide isomerase, converting hydroperoxide substrates into specific epoxyalcohols, such as hepoxilins, rather than exhibiting typical lipoxygenase oxygenase activity (Yu2003The). The enzyme's activity is crucial for the conversion of 12R-HPETE to specific epoxy alcohols, which is important for epidermal differentiation (Eckl2005Mutation). The specific details of the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as post-translational modifications and splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available context.

## Function
The ALOXE3 gene encodes the enzyme epidermal lipoxygenase-3 (eLOX-3), which is part of the lipoxygenase family and plays a crucial role in skin barrier formation. eLOX-3 is primarily active in the epidermis, where it functions as a hydroperoxide isomerase, converting fatty acid hydroperoxides into epoxyalcohols and ketones. This enzymatic activity is essential for the processing of skin ceramides, which are critical for forming the corneocyte lipid envelope (CLE), a key component of the skin's permeability barrier (Krieg2013Aloxe3).

eLOX-3 is involved in the oxygenation of linoleate-containing ceramides, facilitating their hydrolysis and covalent linkage to proteins in the CLE. This process is vital for maintaining the skin's water barrier and overall integrity. In eLOX-3-deficient models, there is a significant reduction in covalently bound ceramides, leading to barrier defects and increased transepidermal water loss (Krieg2013Aloxe3).

Beyond its structural role, eLOX-3 also functions as a hepoxilin synthase, producing hepoxilin metabolites that may influence inflammation and neurotransmission by affecting intracellular calcium concentrations (Krieg2013Aloxe3). These metabolites might interact with membrane receptors or PPAR receptors, potentially impacting skin physiology (Krieg2013Aloxe3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALOXE3 gene are associated with autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), a group of skin disorders characterized by abnormal keratinization and scaling. Specifically, ALOXE3 mutations have been linked to non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE), a form of ichthyosis marked by hyperkeratosis and epidermal dysfunction, leading to symptoms such as white, flaky skin and transepidermal water loss (Yu2003The; Jobard2002Lipoxygenase3). The mutations in ALOXE3 often result in a complete loss of enzymatic activity, which is believed to disrupt epidermal differentiation and contribute to the ARCI phenotype (Eckl2005Mutation).

In addition to skin disorders, variants in the ALOXE3 gene have been implicated in Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy. Certain variants, such as c.-50C > G and c.1939A > G (p.I647 V), are associated with decreased gene expression and enzyme activity, potentially contributing to epileptogenesis through the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway (Gao2021The). These findings suggest that ALOXE3 plays a role in both skin and neurological conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in diverse pathological contexts.
