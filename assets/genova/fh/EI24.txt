# EI24

## Overview
EI24, also known as PIG8, is a gene that encodes the EI24 autophagy associated transmembrane protein, which plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis by participating in autophagy and apoptosis. This transmembrane protein is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species through the modulation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (NOX4) mRNA translation. By controlling hydrogen peroxide production, EI24 maintains redox balance within cells, which is essential for processes such as insulin synthesis in pancreatic beta cells (Pei2024Translational). Additionally, EI24 functions as a tumor suppressor, engaging in p53-mediated apoptotic pathways and interacting with proteins like Bcl-2 to promote cell death and inhibit proliferation (Zhou2021miR‑483; Mazumder2011Inactivation). The gene's involvement in cancer biology, particularly its altered expression in various malignancies, underscores its significance as a potential biomarker for cancer prognosis and therapeutic response (Duan2020EI24; Zhao2005Apoptosis).

## Function
The EI24 gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in autophagy and apoptosis. EI24 is a transmembrane protein localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it regulates the translation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (NOX4) mRNA. This regulation is crucial for controlling the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive oxygen species, thereby maintaining redox balance within cells (Pei2024Translational).

In pancreatic beta cells, EI24 interacts with the RNA transcription, translation, and transport factor (RTRAF) to inhibit the translation of Nox4 mRNA, preventing excessive H2O2 production. This process is vital for normal insulin synthesis, as high levels of H2O2 can suppress the translation of the transcription factor MafA, which is essential for insulin production (Pei2024Translational).

EI24 also functions as a tumor suppressor by participating in p53-mediated apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. It interacts with Bcl-2, a protein that regulates cell death, to promote apoptosis and inhibit its anti-apoptotic function (Zhou2021miR‑483; Mazumder2011Inactivation). These activities highlight EI24's role in both cellular survival and the prevention of tumorigenesis.

## Clinical Significance
The EI24 gene, also known as PIG8, is implicated in various cancers due to its role in tumor suppression and autophagy. Alterations in EI24 expression are frequently observed in aggressive breast cancers, where its reduced expression is linked to increased invasiveness and tumor progression (Mork2007Loss; Zhao2005Apoptosis). In colorectal cancer, EI24 downregulation is associated with poor prognosis, and its expression is inhibited by miR-483, which promotes cancer metastasis (Zhou2021miR‑483). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), low EI24 expression correlates with larger tumor size and advanced disease stages, while its overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and enhances sensitivity to chemotherapy (Duan2020EI24).

In cervical cancer, although mutations in EI24 are rare, its expression is altered, suggesting a role in tumor invasiveness (Mazumder2011Inactivation). EI24 is also involved in drug resistance, with its loss linked to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents like etoposide in breast cancer (Mork2007Loss). These findings highlight EI24's potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and treatment response.

## Interactions
EI24, also known as EI24 autophagy associated transmembrane protein, participates in several interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is involved in the translational repression of Nox4 mRNA by interacting with its 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs). EI24 recruits RTRAF, an RNA transcription, translation, and transport factor, to the 3'-UTRs of Nox4 mRNA, which is crucial for inhibiting the translation of Nox4. This interaction is essential for maintaining hydrogen peroxide homeostasis and insulin synthesis. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the interaction between EI24 and the 3'-UTR of Nox4 mRNA, and mass spectrometry identified RTRAF as a protein that binds to the 3'-UTRs of Nox4 mRNA in the presence of EI24 (Pei2024Translational).

The absence of EI24 leads to a decrease in RTRAF levels and alters its subcellular localization, with more RTRAF found in the nucleus. This suggests that EI24 may trap RTRAF in the cytoplasm, facilitating its binding to the 3'-UTR motifs of Nox4 and inhibiting translation. Co-immunoprecipitation further revealed that RTRAF can bind to EI24, indicating that they may form a protein complex (Pei2024Translational).
