# SYNRG

## Overview
The SYNRG gene encodes the protein synergin gamma, which is a cytosolic protein involved in intracellular trafficking and vesicle-mediated transport. Synergin gamma is categorized as an adaptor protein, playing a pivotal role in the sorting and transport of proteins within the cell. It is particularly significant in the context of the endosomal sorting pathways, where it interacts with various proteins, including golgin-97 and AP-1 adaptors, to facilitate vesicle tethering and transport (Shin2020Spatial). Additionally, synergin gamma has been implicated in the regulation of protein networks associated with the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and SQSTM1, suggesting its involvement in critical cellular processes such as acrosome biogenesis and fertilization (Rondón2023Proximity; Silva2015Amyloid). These interactions underscore the functional importance of synergin gamma in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in various physiological and pathological contexts.

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SYNRG (synergin gamma) is involved in various protein interactions that play a crucial role in cellular processes such as vesicle-mediated transport and intracellular trafficking. It has been identified as an interacting partner of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) in human testis, where it is involved in vesicle-mediated transport, a process essential for acrosome biogenesis and fertilization (Silva2015Amyloid). SYNRG also interacts with golgin-97, a protein involved in vesicle tethering, and is associated with AP-1 adaptors, which are part of the endosomal sorting pathways (Shin2020Spatial).

In the context of the SQSTM1 protein network, SYNRG was identified as a novel interactor. The interaction between SQSTM1 and SYNRG was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating that SYNRG co-purifies with SQSTM1, suggesting a potential role in mediating the association of SQSTM1 with other proteins such as b-arrestin and cannabinoid receptor-2 (Rondón2023Proximity). These interactions highlight SYNRG's involvement in complex protein networks and its potential functional significance in various cellular processes.
