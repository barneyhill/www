# RTL4

## Overview
RTL4 is a gene that encodes the protein retrotransposon Gag like 4, which is part of a family of proteins derived from retroviral elements. This protein is categorized as a retrovirus-derived protein, reflecting its evolutionary origins from ancient viral sequences that have been integrated into the host genome. Although the precise biological functions of the RTL4-encoded protein remain to be fully elucidated, it is implicated in the regulation of monoamine metabolism, particularly influencing the expression of dopamine β-monooxygenase, a key enzyme in neurotransmitter synthesis. The gene's expression is notably low in the brain, yet it is believed to provide an evolutionary advantage in eutherian mammals, suggesting a specialized role in neurodevelopment (Chesnokova2022The; KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The RTL4 gene, also known as SIRH11 or ZCCHC16, is implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in RTL4 have been associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A study identified a family with a rare nonsense mutation in ZCCHC16, leading to ASD in a male proband and his male sibling, highlighting its significance as an X-linked gene (KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived). In mice, knockout of the RTL4 gene results in behavioral abnormalities such as increased impulsivity and decreased spatial memory, which are linked to dysregulation of the noradrenergic system in the brain (KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived). These findings suggest that RTL4 may play a role in the regulation of monoamine metabolism, particularly affecting dopamine β-monooxygenase expression, which is crucial for normal brain function (Chesnokova2022The).

Despite its low expression in the brain, RTL4 is considered to confer an evolutionary advantage in the eutherian brain, although its precise role and expression sites remain unclear (KanekoIshino2023RetrovirusDerived). The gene's involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders underscores its potential clinical significance, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms and interactions.
