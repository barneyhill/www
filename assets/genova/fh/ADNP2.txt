# ADNP2

## Overview
ADNP2 (Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein 2) is a gene that encodes the ADNP homeobox 2 protein, which is primarily involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. This protein plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment and cellular differentiation, particularly within the central nervous system. As a nuclear protein, ADNP homeobox 2 influences gene expression and is implicated in essential cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. It is notably expressed in oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system, where its expression is developmentally regulated and peaks during the maturation phase, suggesting a significant role in myelin formation and neurodevelopment (Malishkevich2015ADNPADNP2). Additionally, ADNP homeobox 2 may be involved in RNA splicing, particularly affecting tau splicing, which is vital for neuronal differentiation and maturation (Malishkevich2015ADNPADNP2). The gene's expression pattern and functional roles underscore its importance in maintaining healthy brain development and function.

## Function
ADNP2 (ADNP homeobox 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, playing a significant role in neurodevelopment and cellular differentiation. The protein is active in the nucleus, where it influences gene expression and contributes to cellular processes such as proliferation and apoptosis. In oligodendrocytes, which are the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system, ADNP2 is expressed alongside its family member ADNP, although at lower levels. The expression of ADNP2 is developmentally regulated, with higher levels observed during the maturation of oligodendrocytes and in the newborn rat brain, suggesting its involvement in myelin formation and neurodevelopment (Malishkevich2015ADNPADNP2).

ADNP2 may also play a role in chromatin remodeling and RNA splicing, particularly affecting tau splicing, which is crucial for neuronal differentiation and maturation (Malishkevich2015ADNPADNP2). The protein's expression pattern parallels that of ADNP, indicating a potential impact on myelin formation in both health and disease (Malishkevich2015ADNPADNP2). These functions highlight the importance of ADNP2 in maintaining healthy brain development and function.
