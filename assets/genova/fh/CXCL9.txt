# CXCL9

## Overview
CXCL9 is a gene that encodes the protein C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9, a member of the CXC chemokine family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by mediating the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation, thereby contributing to immune surveillance and response. CXCL9 is primarily produced by macrophages and endothelial cells in response to the cytokine IFN-γ and interacts with the CXCR3 receptor, which is expressed on various immune cells, including activated T cells and natural killer cells. The protein is characterized by its ability to bind glycosaminoglycans, which influences its localization and function in forming chemotactic gradients. CXCL9's involvement in immune modulation extends beyond traditional receptor signaling, impacting the expression of other chemokines and immunomodulatory genes. Clinically, CXCL9 expression levels have been associated with different prognostic outcomes in various cancers, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Ding2016CXCL9:; Liang2021CXCL9; Vanheule2017CXCL9Derived).

## Structure
CXCL9, also known as MIG, is a chemokine involved in immune responses and belongs to the CXC chemokine family. The primary structure of CXCL9 includes a signal peptide and a mature peptide. The secondary structure typically features beta-sheets and alpha-helices, contributing to its functional conformation (Vanheule2017CXCL9Derived). The tertiary structure of CXCL9 involves a compact fold stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining structural integrity and function (Miller2017Chemokines). 

CXCL9 interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) through its COOH-terminal domain, which contains specific GAG-binding motifs such as BBXB and BBBXXB, where B represents a basic amino acid and X a non-basic one. This domain is important for its high affinity binding to heparan sulfate and low molecular weight heparin, influencing its role in inhibiting neutrophil migration (Vanheule2017CXCL9Derived). 

CXCL9 functions primarily as a monomer, with no known quaternary structure (Vanheule2017CXCL9Derived). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications like glycosylation, which can affect its stability and interactions (Vanheule2017CXCL9Derived).

## Function
CXCL9, also known as MIG, is a chemokine involved in the immune response, primarily produced by macrophages and endothelial cells in response to IFN-γ. It plays a significant role in recruiting leukocytes to sites of inflammation, which is crucial for immune surveillance and response (Ding2016CXCL9:). CXCL9 binds to the CXCR3 receptor, which is expressed on activated/memory CD4/CD8 cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, facilitating the recruitment of T cells to inflamed tissues (Marshall2017Tissuespecific).

In healthy human cells, CXCL9 is involved in the chemotaxis of immune cells, contributing to the regulation of immune responses. It is secreted by various cell types, including immune cells like T lymphocytes and non-immune cells such as endothelial cells and fibroblasts (Ding2016CXCL9:). The transcriptional regulation of CXCL9 involves transcription factors such as STAT1, NF-κB, and PU.1, which are activated by IFN-γ, influencing immune responses and potentially affecting conditions like liver inflammation and fibrosis (Ding2016CXCL9:).

CXCL9 also exhibits immunomodulatory properties independent of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling, inducing the expression of various chemokines and genes with immunomodulatory functions in monocytic cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Gong2010Gproteincoupled).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXCL9 gene have significant clinical implications in various cancers. In breast cancer, particularly estrogen receptor (ER)-negative subtypes, high CXCL9 expression is associated with favorable prognosis and increased immune cell infiltration, suggesting its role as a potential biomarker for immune response and prognosis (Liang2021CXCL9). However, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), CXCL9 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. It promotes tumor progression by suppressing CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, crucial for anti-tumor immunity, through the STAT3 pathway (Gao2020CXCL9).

In uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), CXCL9 is upregulated and correlates with antitumor immunity, predicting favorable prognosis. Its expression is associated with immune cell infiltration and enhanced response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (Xue2023CXCL9). The CXCL9-CXCR3 axis is crucial for immune cell recruitment and activation, impacting the tumor microenvironment and potentially serving as a therapeutic target (Xue2023CXCL9). These findings highlight the dual role of CXCL9 in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context.

## Interactions
CXCL9, also known as MIG, is a chemokine that primarily interacts with the CXCR3 receptor, facilitating immune cell recruitment and activation. The interaction between CXCL9 and CXCR3 involves specific regions of both the chemokine and the receptor. The N-loop region of CXCL9 interacts with the N-terminal region of CXCR3, which is crucial for receptor binding and activation. Additionally, the N-terminal of CXCL9 interacts with loops 2 and 3 of CXCR3, contributing to the binding affinity and activation of the receptor (Trotta2009Modelling).

CXCL9 also interacts with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as heparin and heparan sulfate (HS). The COOH-terminal tail of CXCL9 is highly positively charged, facilitating its binding to GAGs. This interaction is essential for the localization of chemokines within capillary venules and the formation of chemotactic gradients that guide leukocyte migration. CXCL9-derived peptides, such as CXCL9(74-103), can inhibit neutrophil migration by interfering with the interaction between CXCL8 and GAGs, highlighting the role of CXCL9 in modulating chemokine activity and inflammatory responses (Vanheule2017CXCL9Derived).
