# ZNF608

## Overview
ZNF608 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 608, a member of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in transcriptional regulation. This protein is primarily involved in modulating gene expression within the nucleus, functioning as a transcription repressor. ZNF608 is particularly significant in neurodevelopmental processes, as evidenced by its expression patterns in embryonic mouse brains. It is also a component of the Integrator complex interaction network, which is crucial for regulating stress response genes. The gene has been implicated in various biological processes, including B lymphocyte development and body composition traits, such as fat mass and body mass index (BMI) regulation. Additionally, ZNF608 is associated with several diseases, including follicular lymphoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker and its involvement in disease pathogenesis (Rothammer2014Genomewide; Jeong2023Colocalization; Sabath2024Mechanistic).

## Structure


## Function
ZNF608 is a zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily active in the nucleus where it interacts with DNA to modulate gene expression. It is identified as a transcription repressor and is involved in neurodevelopment, particularly in mouse embryonic brains, where it is expressed mutually exclusively with ZNF609 (Sabath2024Mechanistic). ZNF608 is part of the Integrator complex (INT) interaction network, which plays a role in regulating stress response genes. The depletion of INTS13 and its transcription factor interactors, including ZNF608, leads to the misregulation of genes involved in various stress responses, suggesting that ZNF608 co-regulates overlapping gene sets involved in stress response pathways (Sabath2024Mechanistic).

In the context of blood cell traits, ZNF608 is implicated in B lymphocyte development and is enriched for mutations in follicular lymphoma, a cancer involving B lymphocytes (Jeong2023Colocalization). Although the molecular function of ZNF608 remains unclear, it appears to play a fundamental role in body composition traits across species, influencing fat mass and potentially affecting body mass index (BMI) in humans (Rothammer2014Genomewide).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF608 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to mutations or alterations in its expression. In follicular lymphoma (FL), ZNF608 is identified as a candidate gene with potential involvement in lymphomagenesis. Mutations in ZNF608 have also been reported in other lymphomas, such as splenic marginal zone, primary central nervous system, and T-cell lymphoma, as well as in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients, suggesting a broader role in lymphoma development (Krysiak2017Recurrent).

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), ZNF608 is recognized as a significant independent prognostic biomarker. The study highlights the role of DNA methylation in regulating ZNF608 expression, which may influence cancer progression and prognosis (Lu2019Identification).

ZNF608 is also considered a likely pathogenic gene in Keshan disease, a type of dilated cardiomyopathy. Although specific clinical significance in this context is not detailed, its inclusion among candidate pathogenic genes suggests a potential role in the disease's genetic etiology (Huang2021Integrative).

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), ZNF608 appears in the context of SF3B1 mutational status prediction, although its direct clinical significance in CLL is not explicitly addressed (Fernández‐Martínez2017Genomic).
