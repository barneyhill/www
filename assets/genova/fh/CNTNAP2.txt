# CNTNAP2

## Overview
The CNTNAP2 gene encodes the contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2), a type I transmembrane cell adhesion molecule that is part of the neurexin superfamily. CASPR2 plays a crucial role in the nervous system, particularly in cell-cell adhesion and synaptic interactions, which are essential for maintaining synaptic function and neuronal communication (D’Onofrio2023Genotype–phenotype). The protein is predominantly located at the juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons, where it facilitates neuron-glia interactions and the clustering of voltage-gated potassium channels, thereby influencing synaptic homeostasis (Saint‐Martin2018Contactin‐associated). Mutations in CNTNAP2 have been linked to various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and language impairments, highlighting its significance in brain development and function (Saint‐Martin2018Contactin‐associated; Peñagarikano2011Absence). The gene's involvement in these processes underscores its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in related conditions.

## Structure
The CNTNAP2 protein, encoded by the CNTNAP2 gene, is a type I transmembrane cell adhesion molecule that is part of the neurexin superfamily. It features a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a small intracellular portion (Lu2016Molecular; RodenasCuadrado2013Shining). The extracellular region of CNTNAP2 is composed of several domains, including a discoidin/neuropilin homology domain, a fibrinogen-like region, four laminin G domains, and two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains (RodenasCuadrado2013Shining). These domains are involved in receptor-ligand interactions, cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation.

The protein adopts an F-shaped molecular architecture, with three distinct lobes: a large lobe containing the F58C, L1, and L2 domains; a middle lobe with the FBG and L3 domains; and a small lobe containing the L4 domain (Lu2016Molecular). The lobes are connected by molecular hinges, allowing for conformational flexibility (Lu2016Molecular). CNTNAP2 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, with 13 potential N-linked glycosylation sites identified in its extracellular domain (Falivelli2012Inherited). The protein also undergoes proteolytic processing, including ectodomain shedding, which is crucial for its function (Zhang2024Contactinassociated).

## Function
The CNTNAP2 gene encodes the CASPR2 protein, a member of the neurexin superfamily, which plays a significant role in the nervous system. CASPR2 is involved in cell-cell adhesion and synaptic interactions, crucial for maintaining proper synaptic function and neuronal communication (D’Onofrio2023Genotype–phenotype). It is primarily found in the inhibitory presynaptic compartment and, to a lesser extent, in the excitatory postsynaptic compartment, where it contributes to neurite development, synapse maturation, stability, and function (D’Onofrio2023Genotype–phenotype).

CASPR2 is active at the juxtaparanodes of myelinated axons, where it mediates neuron-glia interactions and the clustering of voltage-gated potassium channels via interaction with contactin 2 (TAG-1). This clustering is essential for maintaining synaptic homeostasis and function, influencing the balance of excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents (Saint‐Martin2018Contactin‐associated; D’Onofrio2023Genotype–phenotype). CASPR2 also plays a role in organizing axonal microdomains and is involved in the formation of neuronal networks during development, affecting the differentiation and activity of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (Saint‐Martin2018Contactin‐associated). These functions are critical for normal brain development and function, impacting language development and cognitive functions (D’Onofrio2023Genotype–phenotype).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CNTNAP2 gene are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, intellectual disability, speech and language impairments, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Saint‐Martin2018Contactin‐associated; RodenasCuadrado2013Shining). The gene is particularly linked to a syndromic form of ASD known as cortical dysplasia-focal epilepsy syndrome (CDFE), characterized by epileptic seizures, language regression, intellectual disability, hyperactivity, and autism (Peñagarikano2011Absence).

CNTNAP2 mutations can be heterozygous or homozygous, with homozygous mutations often leading to more severe phenotypes, such as early-onset epilepsy and severe intellectual disability (RodenasCuadrado2016Characterisation; Smogavec2016Eight). The gene's variants are also associated with language endophenotypes and communicative behavioral delays, highlighting its role in language development (Agarwala2021Role).

The clinical presentations of CNTNAP2 mutations are diverse, with some variants present in healthy individuals, suggesting that multiple factors contribute to CNTNAP2-associated diseases (Saint‐Martin2018Contactin‐associated). The gene's involvement in neuron-glia interactions and synaptic function underscores its significance in early brain development and its potential as a target for therapeutic research in ASD (Peñagarikano2011Absence).

## Interactions
CNTNAP2, or contactin-associated protein-like 2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in the nervous system. It forms a multiprotein complex with CASK and GluA1 in interneurons, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. This complex modulates the subcellular distribution of GluA1, particularly in dendrites, affecting its expression patterns (Gao2019The). CNTNAP2 also interacts with the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) in the cerebellum, which is significant for regulating Purkinje cell morphology and calcium signaling (Argent2020Caspr2).

The protein's C-terminal PDZ-binding motif interacts with the PDZ domain of CASK, stabilizing interneuron dendritic arbors (Gao2018CNTNAP2). CNTNAP2 also interacts with PAR3, a polarity protein, through its PDZ-binding domain, which affects its spatial localization and mobility within endocytic vesicles (Gao2019CNTNAP2).

Additionally, CNTNAP2's ectodomain interacts with PMCA2, a Ca2+ transporter, enhancing its activity and modulating neuronal Ca2+ levels, which may have implications for autism spectrum disorder (MartindeSaavedra2019CNTNAP2). These interactions highlight CNTNAP2's role in synaptic function and neuronal connectivity.
