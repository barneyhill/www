# MTDH

## Overview
Metadherin (MTDH) is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA binding and regulation of mRNA translation. The protein, also referred to as metadherin, is predominantly found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells, where it plays a critical role in RNA and protein complex formation, stress response, and cellular homeostasis. Metadherin is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and is known for its interactions with other proteins such as SND1 and RPL4, which are essential for preventing stress granule formation. The gene is notably overexpressed in several cancer types, where it contributes to cancer progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance, making it a potential target for cancer therapy (Sriramulu2021Emerging; Khan2021The; Meng2012Cytoplasmic).

## Function
MTDH, also known as metadherin, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including RNA binding and regulation of mRNA translation. In healthy human cells, MTDH is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it plays a role in RNA and protein complex formation, stress response, and regulation of mRNA translation. MTDH associates with proteins such as SND1 and RPL4, and this interaction is dependent on nucleic acids. It is involved in the regulation of stress granule formation, as its knockdown increases stress granule formation in response to stress, suggesting that MTDH prevents stress granule formation (Meng2012Cytoplasmic).

MTDH also associates with various mRNAs, some of which are linked to chemoresistance, and its association with mRNAs can be altered by PI3K/mTOR inhibition. It appears to negatively regulate the translation of certain mRNAs, as knockdown of MTDH increases protein levels of specific mRNAs like PDCD11 and KDM6A (Meng2012Cytoplasmic). In non-cancerous cells, MTDH is present in the nucleus and nucleolus, unlike its predominant cytoplasmic location in cancer cells (Meng2015Genetic). The protein's involvement in these processes highlights its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and response to stress.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the MTDH gene, also known as astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1), are significantly associated with various cancers. MTDH is overexpressed in numerous cancer types, including breast, prostate, liver, gastric, colorectal, and esophageal cancers, as well as osteosarcoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Sriramulu2021Emerging; Khan2021The). This overexpression is linked to cancer progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis (Khan2021The). In breast cancer, MTDH is associated with metastasis to the lungs and poor overall survival, making it a potential prognostic marker (Khan2021The). In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high MTDH expression correlates with lower overall survival and higher recurrence rates, serving as an independent prognostic factor (Khan2021The).

MTDH also plays a role in chemoresistance, particularly in breast and ovarian cancers, where its overexpression is linked to resistance to treatments like cisplatin (Khan2021The). In colorectal cancer, MTDH expression is higher in metastases and is associated with worse disease-free survival (Khan2021The). The gene's involvement in oncogenic signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT and NF-κB, contributes to its role in promoting tumor cell survival and invasion (Sriramulu2021Emerging; Khan2021The).

## Interactions
MTDH (metadherin) is known to participate in various interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes and cancer progression. MTDH acts as an RNA-binding protein, interacting with SND1 and RPL4, with these interactions being dependent on the presence of nucleic acids. This interaction is crucial for preventing the formation of stress granules in response to stress, such as heat shock (Meng2012Cytoplasmic).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, MTDH interacts with PRMT5 and β-catenin. PRMT5 and β-catenin competitively bind to the same domain on MTDH, affecting the distribution of β-catenin between the cytoplasm and nucleus. This interaction influences the WNT-β-catenin signaling pathway, which is important for cancer metastasis (Zhu2019Metadherin–PRMT5).

MTDH also interacts with SND1 in colon cancer and glioma cells, where it is involved in RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) activity. This interaction is associated with aggressive cancer characteristics and poor prognosis (Wang2012Prognostic; Tong2016Correlated).

In ovarian cancer, MTDH interacts with PTEN, a relationship that is implicated in cisplatin resistance. Modulating this interaction can restore sensitivity to chemotherapeutics (Han2020Overcoming). These interactions highlight MTDH's role in various signaling pathways and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
