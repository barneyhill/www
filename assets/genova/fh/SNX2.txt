# SNX2

## Overview
SNX2, or sorting nexin 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in endosomal sorting and membrane remodeling. The protein, sorting nexin 2, is a member of the sorting nexin family, characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain, which facilitates binding to phosphoinositides and is crucial for membrane association and signaling pathways (Teasdale2011Insights). SNX2 plays a significant role in the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Cardoso2020Host). It is a component of the retromer complex, which is involved in the recycling of transmembrane cargo proteins, such as the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (Teasdale2011Insights). SNX2's interactions with various proteins, including viral proteins and the DEAD-box helicase Abstrakt, underscore its involvement in both cellular protein sorting mechanisms and viral pathogenesis (Cardoso2020Host; Abdul‐Ghani2005Abstrakt). Alterations in SNX2 expression have been implicated in several cancers, highlighting its clinical significance (Duclos2017Caspasemediated).

## Structure
SNX2 (sorting nexin 2) is characterized by the presence of a Phox homology (PX) domain, which is a conserved region approximately 70-110 residues in length. This domain is crucial for binding phosphoinositides, particularly PtdIns3P, and is involved in membrane association (Teasdale2011Insights). The PX domain of SNX2 includes specific amino acid residues such as R183, F184, K211, and R236, which are involved in lipid binding (Teasdale2011Insights).

The SNX2 protein is part of the SNX1 subgroup, which is noted for having large C-terminal domains with multiple coiled-coil regions. These regions are potential sites for protein-protein interactions and are important for the function of membrane transport proteins (TEASDALE2001A). SNX2 can form homo- or heterodimers, indicating a quaternary structure that is significant for its role in retrograde endosomal protein trafficking (Teasdale2011Insights).

SNX2 is also involved in forming a multimeric complex with human orthologues of Vps proteins, contributing to the retromer coat complex on vesicular membranes, which is essential for receptor recycling from the endosome to the late Golgi (TEASDALE2001A). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can regulate its function (Lenoir2018Phosphorylation).

## Function
Sorting nexin 2 (SNX2) is a protein involved in intracellular trafficking, particularly in endosomal sorting and membrane remodeling. It is part of the sorting nexin family, characterized by a PX domain that binds phosphoinositides, which are crucial for its role in membrane association and signaling pathways (Teasdale2011Insights). SNX2 is active in endosomes and plays a significant role in the retrograde transport of proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis (Cardoso2020Host).

SNX2, along with SNX1, forms part of the retromer complex, which is involved in the endosome-to-TGN recycling of transmembrane cargo proteins. This complex is crucial for the proper trafficking of proteins such as the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) (Teasdale2011Insights). SNX2 can form homo- or hetero-dimers and higher-order oligomeric complexes, which are important for its function in membrane tubulation (Teasdale2011Insights).

SNX2 also interacts with the DEAD-box helicase Abstrakt (Abs), suggesting a regulatory mechanism where Abs can reduce the cellular expression of SNX2 without altering its mRNA levels, indicating a role in protein expression regulation (Abdul‐Ghani2005Abstrakt). This interaction may link vesicle trafficking to protein expression, highlighting SNX2's involvement in maintaining appropriate levels of endocytic proteins (Abdul‐Ghani2005Abstrakt).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in SNX2 expression and its interactions have been implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), SNX2 mRNA expression is significantly decreased in tumors compared to normal tissues, with this reduction evident from stage I and persisting in advanced stages. Patients with the lowest quartile of SNX2 expression have a significantly higher mortality rate, being twice as likely to die compared to those with the highest expression levels (Duclos2017Caspasemediated). The cleavage of SNX2 by caspases, particularly caspase-6, disrupts its interaction with the retromer complex, potentially enhancing Met/hepatocyte growth factor receptor signaling, which may contribute to CRC development (Duclos2017Caspasemediated).

SNX2 is also involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) through the SNX2-ABL1 fusion gene, which is functionally related to ALL pathogenesis. This fusion gene exhibits a BCR-ABL1positive ALL-like gene expression profile, and its presence can lead to poor prognosis when combined with the loss of IKZF1 (Yang2020Sorting). Additionally, SNX2 interacts with formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17), which is involved in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) development (Fuchs2001The). Dysregulation of SNX2 has also been linked to melanoma tumor development and progression (Yang2020Sorting).

## Interactions
Sorting nexin 2 (SNX2) is involved in various protein interactions, playing a crucial role in intracellular trafficking and viral processes. SNX2 is a component of the retromer complex, which includes SNX1, Vps26, Vps29, and Vps35, and is involved in retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (Cardoso2020Host). It interacts with human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) structural proteins, specifically the M and N proteins, and colocalizes with these proteins in inclusion bodies and vesicles, suggesting its role in viral assembly and production (Cardoso2020Host). SNX2 also interacts with the influenza A virus PA protein, where it negatively regulates viral replication, indicating a potential antiviral role (Koçmar2021Human).

SNX2 interacts with the DEAD-box helicase Abstrakt (Abs), where the N-terminal domain of Abs binds to the PX domain of SNX2. This interaction is involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and may influence protein trafficking (Abdul‐Ghani2005Abstrakt). These interactions highlight SNX2's involvement in both viral pathogenesis and cellular protein sorting mechanisms.
