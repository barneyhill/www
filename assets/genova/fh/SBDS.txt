# SBDS

## Overview
The SBDS gene encodes the SBDS ribosome maturation factor, a protein integral to ribosome biogenesis and cellular homeostasis. This protein is categorized as a ribosome maturation factor due to its pivotal role in the assembly and maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit, a process essential for effective protein synthesis. The SBDS protein facilitates the release of the anti-association factor eIF6 from the 60S subunit, a critical step in forming functional 80S ribosomes. Additionally, SBDS is involved in telomere maintenance and cellular stress responses, including DNA damage repair and endoplasmic reticulum stress management. Mutations in the SBDS gene are linked to Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, a disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, pancreatic insufficiency, and skeletal abnormalities, underscoring the gene's importance in human health (Ball2009Shwachman-Bodian; Warren2018Molecular).

## Structure
The SBDS protein, encoded by the SBDS gene, is crucial for ribosome maturation and is composed of three highly conserved domains. The N-terminal domain, known as the FYSH domain, consists of a twisted five-stranded anti-parallel beta sheet with four alpha helices (Finch2011Uncoupling). This domain shares structural similarities with a yeast protein involved in translational regulation (Warren2018Molecular). The central domain forms a three-helical right-handed twisted bundle, while the C-terminal domain exhibits a ferredoxin-like fold, similar to domain V of elongation factor EF-2 (Finch2011Uncoupling; Gijsbers2018Interaction).

The SBDS protein is highly dynamic, with distinct conformations observed across different species, and it exhibits fast internal mobility (Warren2018Molecular). This flexibility is thought to facilitate functional interactions with ribosomal proteins (Ng2009Conformational). The protein's structure is evolutionarily conserved, as evidenced by its similarity to archaeal SBDS orthologs (Finch2011Uncoupling).

Mutations in SBDS, particularly those affecting domains I and II, can impact protein stability or alter surface epitopes, which are critical for its interaction with the GTPase Elongation Factor Like-1 (EFL1) (Finch2011Uncoupling; Gijsbers2018Interaction). These mutations are associated with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, highlighting the importance of SBDS's structural integrity for its function.

## Function
The SBDS gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in ribosome biogenesis and maturation, particularly in the assembly of the 60S ribosomal subunit in the cytoplasm of healthy human cells. The SBDS protein is involved in the removal of the anti-association factor eIF6 from the 60S subunit, a necessary step for the formation of functional 80S ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis (Warren2018Molecular). This process is facilitated by the GTPase EFL1, with which SBDS interacts to enhance GTP hydrolysis, thereby promoting eIF6 release (Warren2018Molecular).

SBDS also plays a role in maintaining telomere length by regulating the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres. It interacts with the TPP1 protein during the S phase of the cell cycle, ensuring proper telomerase function and telomere maintenance (Liu2018ShwachmanDiamond). Additionally, SBDS is involved in cellular stress responses, including managing endoplasmic reticulum stress and DNA damage repair, which are crucial for maintaining genomic stability and cellular homeostasis (Ball2009Shwachman-Bodian). These functions highlight the multifaceted role of SBDS in cellular and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SBDS gene are primarily associated with Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. SDS is characterized by bone marrow failure, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and skeletal abnormalities. Patients with SDS have an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Dror2011Draft; Warren2018Molecular). The SBDS gene mutations lead to defects in ribosome assembly, specifically affecting the maturation of the large 60S ribosomal subunit, which is crucial for protein synthesis (Finch2011Uncoupling; Warren2018Molecular).

The clinical manifestations of SDS are linked to impaired ribosomal function, which results in translation insufficiency. This insufficiency particularly impacts tissues with high protein synthesis demands, such as the pancreas, leading to pancreatic dysfunction and growth failure (Tourlakis2015In). Mutations in SBDS can also cause increased apoptosis through the Fas pathway, contributing to bone marrow failure (Rujkijyanont2008SBDSdeficient).

In some cases, structural variations in the SBDS locus, rather than point mutations, can affect SBDS protein expression, further contributing to the disease phenotype (Carvalho2014Structural). The absence of functional SBDS protein is lethal, highlighting its critical role in cellular viability (Warren2018Molecular).

## Interactions
The SBDS protein is involved in several critical interactions essential for ribosome biogenesis and function. It interacts with the GTPase elongation factor-like 1 (EFL1), acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to facilitate the release of eIF6 from the 60S ribosomal subunit. This interaction is crucial for ribosome maturation, with SBDS mutations potentially disrupting this process and affecting ribosome assembly (Gijsbers2018Interaction). The interaction between SBDS and EFL1 involves cooperative binding events, with domains 2-3 of SBDS initiating contact, followed by domain 1 docking (Gijsbers2018Interaction).

SBDS also interacts with HsNip7, a human ortholog of the yeast protein Nip7p, which is involved in 60S ribosome subunit biogenesis. This interaction is part of a ribonucleoprotein complex necessary for ribosomal RNA processing and maturation (Hesling2007The). Additionally, SBDS is identified as a direct target of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in acute myeloid leukemia, interacting with PP2A and its regulatory subunits, which may influence cell signaling pathways (Dun2020Shwachman–Bodian–Diamond). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SBDS in ribosome biogenesis and cellular function.
