# PTPN6

## Overview
PTPN6 is a gene that encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 6, commonly referred to as SHP-1. This protein is a non-receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase, which plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by acting as a negative regulator of signal transduction pathways. SHP-1 is primarily expressed in hematopoietic and epithelial cells, where it modulates immune responses and maintains cellular homeostasis by dephosphorylating specific phosphotyrosine residues on target proteins. The protein's structure is characterized by two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, a catalytic domain, and a COOH-terminal tail, which together facilitate its regulatory functions. SHP-1's activity is crucial for immune system regulation, glucose homeostasis, and insulin signaling, and its dysregulation is implicated in various hematological malignancies and inflammatory diseases (Hendriks2023Hereditable; Beghini2013PTPN6; Lorenz2009SHP‐1).

## Structure
The PTPN6 protein, also known as SHP-1, is a non-receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase characterized by its distinct structural domains. The primary structure of PTPN6 includes two adjacent NH2-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, a catalytic domain, and a COOH-terminal tail consisting of 100 amino-acid residues (Beghini2013PTPN6). These SH2 domains play a crucial role in maintaining the protein in a closed, inactive conformation by preventing access to the catalytic domain. Activation occurs when the N-terminal SH2 domain binds to phospho-tyrosine residues in other proteins, thereby opening the catalytic domain (Hendriks2013Protein).

The secondary structure of PTPN6 features alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the overall folding and stability of the protein. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a functional conformation, allowing for specific interactions with target proteins. PTPN6 may also form dimers, indicating a quaternary structure component.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are common in PTPN6 and play a role in regulating its activity. Splice variants of PTPN6 can result in different isoforms, each with potentially distinct functions, contributing to the protein's versatility in cellular signaling pathways.

## Function
PTPN6, also known as SHP-1, is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a critical role in regulating signaling pathways in hematopoietic and epithelial cells. It functions primarily as a negative regulator of signaling pathways by dephosphorylating specific phosphotyrosine residues on target proteins, which is essential for turning off signal transduction pathways. This activity is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammatory responses (Beghini2013PTPN6).

In healthy human cells, PTPN6 is involved in the regulation of immune cell activation and function. It interacts with various signaling molecules, including those in the JAK/STAT pathway, which is important for cytokine signaling. By modulating these pathways, PTPN6 helps prevent the overactivation of immune responses, which can lead to autoimmune diseases (Beghini2013PTPN6).

PTPN6 also plays a role in glucose homeostasis and insulin activity by dephosphorylating CEACAM-1, affecting insulin receptor signaling and downstream pathways like PI3K and Akt. This regulation is significant in the context of hyperglycemia and diabetic vascular complications (Beghini2013PTPN6). The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it modulates immune cell signaling and maintains cellular homeostasis (Hendriks2023Hereditable).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PTPN6 gene, also known as SHP-1, have significant clinical implications, particularly in hematological and oncological conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), altered PTPN6 expression is linked to disease pathology. In AML, RNA editing events in the PTPN6 transcript may contribute to the disease, while in CML, loss of PTPN6 is associated with resistance to Imatinib treatment (Beghini2013PTPN6). 

PTPN6 expression is often reduced in malignant T cells due to promoter methylation, which enhances JAK3/STAT3 signaling and affects proteasome degradation of key proteins in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (Beghini2013PTPN6). In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), decreased PTPN6 expression is associated with tumor progression and poor patient survival, linked to promoter methylation (Liu2019Aberrant).

PTPN6 mutations also lead to inflammatory diseases. In mice, mutations result in conditions resembling human neutrophilic dermatoses, characterized by spontaneous inflammation (Tartey2020Ets2). In humans, similar pathologies are observed in conditions like pyoderma gangrenosum and Sweet's syndrome, associated with hematological tumors (Hendriks2013Protein). These findings underscore the gene's role in immune regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
PTPN6, also known as SHP-1, is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that participates in various protein interactions, playing a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. SHP-1 interacts with JAK1, a kinase involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, where it dephosphorylates JAK1 to downregulate kinase activity. This interaction is characterized by the binding of SHP-1 to a JAK1-derived substrate peptide, as revealed by co-crystal structure studies (AliceaVelázquez2013Structureguided).

SHP-1 is also recruited to the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor complex upon IL-2 stimulation, where it decreases the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-2 receptor β chain and associated kinases Jak1 and Jak3. This recruitment is specific to SHP-1 and is mediated by phosphorylated tyrosine-based motifs (Migone1998Recruitment).

In T-cell signaling, SHP-1 interacts with inhibitory receptors containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) or switch motifs (ITSMs), such as CEACAM1, PD-1, and BTLA. These interactions mediate inhibitory effects by decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR components, impacting T-cell activation and IL-2 production (Lorenz2009SHP‐1).

In natural killer (NK) cells, SHP-1 is essential for the inhibitory function of MHC class I receptors, interacting with receptors like Ly49C/I and CD94/NKG2A to regulate NK cell activation and anti-tumor functions (Viant2014SHP1mediated).
