# EPB41L5

## Overview
EPB41L5 is a gene that encodes the protein erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 5, which is a member of the FERM domain-containing protein family. This protein plays a critical role in maintaining cell polarity and adhesion, particularly within epithelial cells and the retina. It is a component of the Crumbs (CRB)–MPP5 polarity complex, interacting with Crumbs homologues and MPP proteins to regulate cell polarity and stabilize tight junctions. EPB41L5 is also involved in ciliary function, influencing ciliary motility and left-right patterning, which are essential for normal development. The protein's interactions and localization underscore its importance in cellular architecture and function, contributing to tissue homeostasis and development (Gosens2007FERM; Yu2020Epb41l5). Additionally, EPB41L5 has been implicated in pathological processes such as cancer progression, particularly through its role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Hashimoto2016ZEB1).

## Structure
EPB41L5 is a protein that belongs to the band 4.1 superfamily and contains a FERM domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other proteins, such as Crumbs proteins. The FERM domain is composed of three structural modules (A, B, and C) and is responsible for binding to the intracellular domains of CRB proteins, including CRB1, CRB2, and CRB3 (Gosens2007FERM). This domain facilitates the protein's role in maintaining cell polarity and adhesion, particularly in the retina and kidney (Gosens2007FERM).

EPB41L5 is known to undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may affect its function and migration characteristics in Western blot analyses (Gosens2007FERM). The protein exists in multiple isoforms, as suggested by the presence of different bands in Western blot analysis, indicating potential alternative splicing or post-translational modifications (Gosens2007FERM).

The protein's interaction with other components of the CRB-MPP5 polarity complex, such as MPP5, is mediated through its FERM domain, which binds to the HOOK domain of MPP5 (Gosens2007FERM). This interaction is essential for the formation and regulation of tight junctions in epithelial cells (Gosens2007FERM).

## Function
EPB41L5 encodes a FERM domain protein that is a component of the Crumbs (CRB)–MPP5 polarity complex, which is crucial for maintaining cell polarity in epithelial cells and the retina. In healthy human cells, EPB41L5 localizes to the basolateral side of epithelial cells during embryonic development and to the apical side in adult tissues, indicating its role in regulated expression and cell polarity (Gosens2007FERM). The protein interacts with Crumbs homologues and MPP proteins, forming a complex that regulates cell polarity and stabilizes tight junctions, essential for maintaining the structure and function of epithelial and retinal cells (Gosens2007FERM).

EPB41L5 is also involved in the regulation of ciliary function. It interacts with IQCB1 and Cep290 at the ciliary base, influencing ciliary motility and left-right patterning, which are crucial for normal development (Yu2020Epb41l5). The protein's role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular architecture and function, contributing to tissue homeostasis and development. EPB41L5's interactions and localization suggest it plays a significant role in the structural organization and polarity of epithelial cells in various tissues (Gosens2007FERM).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the EPB41L5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor, EPB41L5 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer progression and metastasis. The transcription factor ZBTB7A acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing EPB41L5 expression. When ZBTB7A is downregulated, EPB41L5 expression increases, promoting GBM tumorigenesis through enhanced EMT, cell migration, and invasion. This suggests that the ZBTB7A-EPB41L5 axis is a potential therapeutic target for GBM treatment (Jeong2023ZBTB7A).

EPB41L5 is also associated with retinal defects. Mutations in the Crumbs complex, which includes EPB41L5, can lead to retinal patterning defects and impaired cell adhesion, affecting retinal integrity. These defects have been observed in zebrafish models, indicating the gene's role in maintaining retinal structure (Gosens2007FERM).

In zebrafish, EPB41L5 is involved in ciliary function, and its deficiency leads to cilia with reduced motility and left-right patterning defects. This suggests a potential link to ciliopathies, conditions involving ciliary dysfunction (Yu2020Epb41l5).

## Interactions
EPB41L5, a member of the FERM domain-containing protein family, participates in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. In the context of cancer, particularly breast cancer, EPB41L5 is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and interacts with several proteins to promote cancer progression. It binds to AMAP1, a downstream effector of ARF6, facilitating invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance in cancer cells (Hashimoto2016ZEB1). EPB41L5 also interacts with paxillin, a focal adhesion protein, enhancing cell motility and contributing to invadopodia formation in breast cancer cells (Hashimoto2016ZEB1).

In the context of cell polarity, EPB41L5 is a component of the Crumbs-MPP5 polarity complex. It interacts with the intracellular domains of CRB1, CRB2, and CRB3 proteins, with the FERM domain of EPB41L5 showing high binding affinity for these CRB proteins (Gosens2007FERM). EPB41L5 also binds to the HOOK domain of MPP5, forming a complex that regulates cell polarity in tissues like the retina and kidney (Gosens2007FERM). These interactions are essential for maintaining adherens junctions and epithelial cell polarity (Gosens2007FERM).
