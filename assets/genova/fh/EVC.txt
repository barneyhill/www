# EVC

## Overview
The EVC gene encodes the EvC ciliary complex subunit 1, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which is crucial for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. The EVC protein is a component of the EvC ciliary complex, which localizes to the base of primary cilia and acts as a positive regulator of Hh signaling. This complex, formed by the interaction of EVC with EVC2, is essential for the transduction of signals from the Smoothened (Smo) protein to Gli transcription factors, thereby influencing various developmental processes (Blair2011Evc2; Yang2012Smoothened). The EVC protein is characterized by coiled-coil regions that facilitate its interaction with EVC2, forming a heterodimeric complex at the cilia membrane (Blair2011Evc2). Mutations in the EVC gene are associated with Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and Weyers acrofacial dysostosis, both of which are linked to disruptions in the Hh signaling pathway (Baujat2007EllisVan; Muensterer2013Ellis–van).

## Structure
The EVC protein is a 1005 amino acid protein with a predicted signal anchor sequence. It contains coiled-coil regions, which are structural motifs where 2-7 alpha-helices are coiled together like the strands of a rope. These coiled-coil regions are crucial for the interaction of EVC with EVC2, another protein resulting from an ancient gene duplication event. Significant binding between EVC and EVC2 was observed with constructs containing the third and fourth coiled-coil regions, indicating their importance in protein interaction (Blair2011Evc2).

The EVC protein interacts with EVC2 at the cilia membrane, forming a complex that is essential for the proper localization of both proteins to the base of primary cilia. This interaction suggests a quaternary structure involving complex formation at the cilia membrane (Blair2011Evc2). The EVC protein is intracellular, while EVC2 spans the cilia membrane with an extracellular N-terminal portion (Blair2011Evc2).

The tertiary structure of EVC is not explicitly detailed, but the presence of coiled-coil regions suggests a helical structure (Blair2011Evc2). The primary structure, specific domains, and post-translational modifications of the EVC protein are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The EVC gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the EvC ciliary complex, which plays a significant role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This pathway is essential for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. The EVC protein, along with EVC2, forms a heterodimeric complex that localizes to the base of primary cilia, acting as a positive regulator of Hh signaling (Blair2011Evc2; Yang2012Smoothened). The EVC-EVC2 complex is involved in the transduction of the Hh signal from the Smoothened (Smo) protein to Gli transcription factors, which are key components of the pathway (Yang2012Smoothened). 

In healthy human cells, the EVC-EVC2 complex is essential for the proper functioning of primary cilia, which serve as cellular antennae for signal transduction. The complex's stability and targeting are regulated by post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and sumoylation, which influence its localization and function within the cilia (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2). The EVC protein's activity at the cilia base is crucial for skeletal morphogenesis and the regulation of various stem cell populations, contributing to normal cellular functions and development (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the EVC gene are primarily associated with Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EVC syndrome), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition is characterized by a combination of skeletal dysplasia, polydactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and congenital heart defects. Patients often present with short stature, short ribs, and small chests, which can lead to respiratory compromise (Yuca2008ELLISVAN; Muensterer2013Ellis–van). The syndrome is also linked to dental anomalies, dysplastic fingernails, and genu valgum (Aminabadi2010Chondroectodermal).

EVC syndrome is particularly prevalent among the Old Order Amish in Pennsylvania due to a founder effect, where a specific mutation in the EVC gene leads to aberrant splicing (McKusick2000Ellisvan). The condition is part of the short rib-polydactyly group of disorders, which are characterized by short ribs, short limbs, and polydactyly (Baujat2007EllisVan).

Mutations in the EVC gene can also result in Weyers acrofacial dysostosis, an allelic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. This condition presents with similar but milder symptoms compared to EVC syndrome (Baujat2007EllisVan). The genetic basis of these disorders involves disruptions in the Hedgehog signaling pathway, crucial for normal developmental processes (NegreteTorres2023Identification).

## Interactions
The EVC protein is a component of the EVC-EVC2 complex, which plays a crucial role in the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. This complex interacts with the Smoothened (Smo) protein, a key component of the Hh pathway. The interaction between EVC/EVC2 and Smo is dependent on the phosphorylation of Smo's C-terminal tail, which is necessary for the recruitment of the EVC/EVC2 complex. This interaction facilitates the transduction of the Hh signal to the Gli transcription factors, acting upstream of Sufu to regulate Gli activity (Yang2012Smoothened).

The EVC-EVC2 complex also interacts with other proteins such as EFCAB7 and IQCE, which are involved in the localization and function of the complex at the base of primary cilia. The interaction with EFCAB7 is mediated by specific motifs within the EVC2 protein, which are essential for the proper targeting of the complex to the EvC zone (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2).

Additionally, the EVC-EVC2 complex is involved in interactions with USP7, a deubiquitinating enzyme, although no deubiquitinating activity on the complex has been detected (Barbeito2023EVCEVC2). These interactions highlight the complex's role in modulating Hh signaling and its involvement in various cellular processes.
