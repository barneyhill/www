# FADS3

## Overview
FADS3, or fatty acid desaturase 3, is a gene that encodes the enzyme fatty acid desaturase 3, which is categorized as a ceramide desaturase. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in lipid metabolism, specifically in the biosynthesis of 4,14-sphingadiene (SPD) ceramides. FADS3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it introduces a cis double bond into SPD ceramides, influencing the composition and properties of cell membranes (Jojima2020Biosynthesis). The enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining the balance of sphingolipid species, which may impact cellular membrane dynamics and signaling. Additionally, FADS3 interacts with various kinases, suggesting its involvement in complex cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response (Zhao2023Investigating). Understanding the function and interactions of FADS3 is essential for elucidating its role in cellular physiology and potential implications in human health.

## Function
FADS3 (fatty acid desaturase 3) is an enzyme that functions as a ceramide desaturase, specifically involved in the biosynthesis of 4,14-sphingadiene (SPD) ceramides. This enzyme introduces a cis double bond into SPD ceramides, which are distinct from other sphingolipids due to their structure and tendency to localize outside lipid microdomains. This localization suggests a potential role in negatively regulating lipid microdomain formation, contrasting with other sphingolipids that typically support lipid-lipid interactions within these domains (Jojima2020Biosynthesis).

FADS3 is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum, the known site of sphingolipid synthesis up to ceramide production. Its activity is crucial for the desaturation process necessary for SPD ceramide production, a function that was not well understood before recent studies (Jojima2020Biosynthesis). The enzyme acts on sphinganine (SPH) ceramides rather than SPH itself, converting them to SPD ceramides, which influences the composition and properties of cell membranes (Jojima2020Biosynthesis).

FADS3's role in maintaining the balance of sphingolipid species in cells may impact cellular membrane dynamics and signaling, highlighting its importance in cell biology (Jojima2020Biosynthesis).

## Interactions
FADS3, a member of the fatty acid desaturase family, is implicated in various protein interactions that suggest its involvement in complex cellular processes. Notably, FADS3 has been found to interact with several kinases, including PRKCA, PRKCD, ATM, CDK1, and CDK2. These interactions indicate that FADS3 may play a role in diverse signaling pathways and cellular processes, potentially influencing cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response (Zhao2023Investigating).

In the context of lipid metabolism, FADS3 is crucial for the biosynthesis of sphingoid base 4,14-sphingadiene (SPD). This role is evidenced by its interaction with sphingoid base (SPH) in HEK 293T cells, where overexpression of FADS3 significantly increases the levels of d7-SPD ceramides. This specific interaction underscores FADS3's importance in converting SPH to SPD ceramides, highlighting its functional role in sphingolipid metabolism (Jojima2020Biosynthesis).

While the precise physical interactions of FADS3 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not extensively detailed, its involvement in these pathways suggests a significant role in lipid metabolic processes and cellular signaling networks. Further research is needed to elucidate the full spectrum of FADS3's interactions and their biological implications.
