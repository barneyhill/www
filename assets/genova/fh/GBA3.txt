# GBA3

## Overview
The GBA3 gene encodes the enzyme glucosylceramidase beta 3, a cytosolic β-glucosidase involved in the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds, specifically breaking down glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. This enzyme plays a role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis (LopesMarques2020GBA3:). Despite its enzymatic activity, the physiological function of GBA3 in humans remains largely undefined, as its endogenous substrate is not well characterized, and its loss of function does not result in recognized phenotypic consequences (LopesMarques2020GBA3:). The gene has undergone pseudogenization in humans, with many functionally disruptive variants present across different populations, suggesting a relaxed evolutionary constraint possibly due to dietary adaptations (LopesMarques2020GBA3:). GBA3 is also implicated in the catabolism of sialoglycans, potentially interacting with NEU2 and CMAH in sialic acid biology (LopesMarques2020GBA3:). The protein's interaction with NEU2 stabilizes the latter, enhancing its sialidase activity, which underscores a non-lysosomal catabolic pathway for glycoconjugates in mammalian cells (Wang2015CoExpression).

## Structure
GBA3, or glucosylceramidase beta 3, encodes a protein involved in the metabolism of glycosphingolipids. The primary structure of the GBA3 protein consists of a specific sequence of amino acids that determine its function and interactions. The secondary structure of GBA3 includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and folding. The tertiary structure refers to the overall three-dimensional shape formed by the folding of these secondary structures, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity.

GBA3 may contain specific domains that are critical for its enzymatic function, although detailed information on these domains is not provided. The protein can undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity or interactions with other molecules. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of GBA3 may exist, leading to different functional forms of the protein. These isoforms can result in variations in the protein's structure and function, potentially affecting its role in glycosphingolipid metabolism. The quaternary structure, involving the assembly of multiple protein subunits, is not mentioned, suggesting it may not be applicable to GBA3.

## Function
The GBA3 gene encodes the cytosolic enzyme β-glucosidase, which is involved in the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds, specifically breaking down glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. This enzyme plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism and is active in the cytoplasm, contributing to cellular energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism (LopesMarques2020GBA3:). Despite its involvement in these molecular processes, the physiological function of GBA3 in humans remains unclear, largely due to the lack of knowledge about its specific endogenous substrate and the absence of recognized phenotypic consequences from its loss of function (LopesMarques2020GBA3:).

GBA3 is also suggested to have a minor role in the catabolism of sialoglycans, potentially participating in a cellular network involving NEU2 and CMAH, which are related to sialic acid biology (LopesMarques2020GBA3:). The gene has undergone pseudogenization in humans, with many functionally disruptive variants present in different populations, indicating a relaxed evolutionary constraint possibly influenced by dietary adaptations (LopesMarques2020GBA3:). Despite its pseudogenization, the disruption of GBA3 function is well tolerated in humans, suggesting that its role may be compensated by other evolutionary solutions (LopesMarques2020GBA3:).

## Interactions
The GBA3 protein, encoded by the glucosylceramidase beta 3 gene, is known to physically interact with the NEU2 protein. This interaction has been demonstrated through various biochemical analyses, including co-precipitation experiments and gel-filtration assays, which confirmed the formation of a GBA3-NEU2 complex (Wang2015CoExpression). The interaction between GBA3 and NEU2 is significant as it stabilizes the NEU2 protein, enhancing its stability and sialidase activity in vitro (Wang2015CoExpression). This stabilization effect is observed when NEU2 is co-expressed with GBA3 in MKN45 stomach cancer cells, leading to an increase in NEU2 protein levels (Wang2015CoExpression).

The co-expression of NEU2 and GBA3 results in a drastic reduction of cytosolic sialyl free N-glycans, suggesting a functional interaction that facilitates the catabolism of these glycans in the cytosol (Wang2015CoExpression). While GBA3 was initially hypothesized to degrade desialylated free N-glycans, no direct enzymatic activity towards these glycans was detected, indicating that its primary role may be to stabilize NEU2 rather than directly participate in glycan degradation (Wang2015CoExpression). This interaction highlights a non-lysosomal catabolic pathway for glycoconjugates in mammalian cells (Wang2015CoExpression).
