# INKA1

## Overview
INKA1 (inka box actin regulator 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for various cellular processes such as motility, shape, and division. The INKA1 protein functions as a regulatory molecule, specifically interacting with p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), a kinase that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is mediated through the inka-box domain of the INKA1 protein, which acts as a potent endogenous inhibitor of PAK4, stabilizing its ATP-bound conformation and preventing ATP hydrolysis. This regulatory mechanism is essential for maintaining proper cellular functions and has implications in cellular transformation and cancer metastasis. The INKA1 gene is evolutionarily conserved and is particularly important in embryonic development, influencing the migration of neural crest cells necessary for craniofacial cartilage formation (Iwasaki2015Expression; Baskaran2015An).

## Function
INKA1 (inka box actin regulator 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, playing a crucial role in cell motility, shape, and division. The INKA1 protein interacts with p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), a kinase involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and migration. This interaction occurs through the inka-box domain, which is essential for modulating cytoskeletal dynamics, particularly in neural crest cells (Iwasaki2015Expression; Baskaran2015An).

In healthy human cells, INKA1 functions as a potent endogenous inhibitor of PAK4, stabilizing the ATP-bound conformation of PAK4 and preventing ATP hydrolysis. This inhibition is crucial for maintaining the proper conformation and activity of PAK4, which is involved in cellular transformation and cancer metastasis (Baskaran2015An). The INKA1 protein is active in the cytoplasm, where it influences cellular processes such as migration and adhesion, impacting tissue development and repair (Baskaran2015An).

The INKA1 gene is evolutionarily conserved and plays a significant role in embryonic development, particularly in the migration of neural crest cells, which is essential for craniofacial cartilage formation (Iwasaki2015Expression).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
INKA1 is known to interact with the protein kinase PAK4, acting as a potent endogenous inhibitor. This interaction is facilitated by the iBox domain within INKA1, which binds to the substrate-binding pocket of PAK4, stabilizing the ATP-bound conformation of the kinase and preventing ATP hydrolysis (Baskaran2015An). INKA1 contains two functional PAK4 inhibitory modules, which are absent in INKA2, another member of the INKA protein family (Baskaran2015An). The binding of INKA1 to PAK4 is highly specific, as it does not affect PAK1, indicating a preference for group II PAKs, which includes PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6 (Baskaran2015An).

The interaction between INKA1 and PAK4 is significant for the formation of intracellular crystals, which have been used to study the structural basis of this interaction through in-cellulo X-ray crystallography (Baskaran2015An). The INKA1-PAK4 complex is characterized by hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds, with specific amino acids in INKA1, such as arginines, playing a critical role in binding to acidic substrate-binding pockets on PAK4 (Baskaran2015An). This interaction is crucial for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of PAK4 activity and its implications in cellular processes like transformation and metastasis.
