# EPC2

## Overview
EPC2 (enhancer of polycomb homolog 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and the regulation of gene expression. The protein, also referred to as EPC2, is a member of the polycomb group of proteins, which are crucial for maintaining transcriptional repression during development. EPC2 is characterized by its involvement in the formation of repressive chromatin structures and is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex, playing a significant role in histone modification and transcriptional regulation (Villaseñor2020ChromID). The protein's structure includes domains that contribute to both transcriptional activation and repression, highlighting its dual role in cellular processes. EPC2's activity is particularly significant in the context of oncogenesis, where it acts as a cofactor in certain leukemias, and its genetic variations have been linked to clinical conditions such as medulloblastoma and a syndrome associated with intellectual disabilities (Williams2009Haploinsufficiency; Paret2021Identification).

## Function
EPC2 (enhancer of polycomb homolog 2) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is a member of the polycomb group of genes (PcG) and plays a crucial role in maintaining the transcriptional repression of genes during development. The EPC2 protein contains several domains, including EPcA, EPcB, and EPcC, which contribute to its dual role in transcriptional regulation. The EPcA domain is linked to a zinc-finger domain, suggesting its involvement in DNA interaction and functioning as a strong transcriptional activator. In contrast, the EPcB and EPcC domains exhibit repressive characteristics, with the EPcC domain being involved in heterochromatin formation (Paret2021Identification).

EPC2 is active in the nucleus, where it contributes to the formation of repressive chromatin structures, influencing cell differentiation and proliferation. It is part of the EP400 complex and plays a critical role as an oncogenic cofactor in certain leukemias, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and MLL leukemia stem cells. The protein's dual transcriptional activity, depending on its splice variant, may explain its varied roles in cellular processes, including apoptosis induction and potential oncogenic activity (Paret2021Identification).

## Clinical Significance
The EPC2 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. In medulloblastoma, a common pediatric brain tumor, a specific fusion involving EPC2 and GULP1 has been identified. This fusion results in a protein that can produce neoantigens capable of activating CD8+ T cells, suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy in medulloblastoma patients (Paret2021Identification). The fusion retains the EPcA domain of EPC2, linked to transcriptional activation, but loses the repressive EPcB and EPcC domains, potentially altering its normal function (Paret2021Identification).

EPC2 has also been associated with a syndrome characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, severe speech impairment, and seizures due to haploinsufficiency. This condition is linked to deletions on chromosome 2q23.1, which include EPC2, resulting in reduced expression of the gene (Williams2009Haploinsufficiency). Additionally, genetic variations in EPC2 have been studied in the context of chemotherapy response, particularly with the drug gemcitabine, where specific SNPs in EPC2 have shown associations with drug response variability (Jarjanazi2008Discovery).

## Interactions
EPC2, a member of the polycomb group of genes, is involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. It is a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex, which plays a role in histone modification and transcriptional regulation (Villaseñor2020ChromID). EPC2 is also part of the EP400 complex, which is implicated in chromatin regulatory mechanisms and has been identified as a critical oncogenic cofactor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Paret2021Identification).

EPC2 interacts with various proteins within the TIP60/p400 complex, a histone acetyltransferase complex. This interaction includes associations with subunits such as Tip60, Epc1, and Dmap1, as demonstrated through proximity labeling and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Barry2022Rap1). Although specific physical interactions of EPC2 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, its involvement in these complexes suggests a role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling (Barry2022Rap1).

The EPcA domain of EPC2 is linked to a zinc-finger domain, indicating potential interactions with DNA, although the zinc-finger portion is lost in certain fusion proteins, affecting its DNA binding capability (Paret2021Identification).
