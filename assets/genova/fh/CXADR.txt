# CXADR

## Overview
The CXADR gene encodes the Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is integral to various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, maintenance of epithelial tight junctions, and regulation of cell growth. CAR is characterized by its two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its role in cellular signaling (Howitt2003Adenovirus; Herrmann2020Naturally). As a receptor, CAR is pivotal in mediating viral entry, particularly for coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses, and is involved in the immune response by interacting with proteins such as JAML on γδ T cells (Schreiber2013The). Additionally, CXADR expression is significant in hematopoietic processes and has been implicated in various hematologic disorders, highlighting its clinical relevance (Bauer2023CAR; Guojin2020Membrane).

## Structure
The CXADR gene encodes the Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a transmembrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The CAR protein is composed of 345 amino acids and includes a signal sequence (amino acids 1-19), two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain (Howitt2003Adenovirus). The extracellular region features a distal Ig variable-type domain (CAR D1) and a proximal C2-type Ig domain (CAR D2) (Howitt2003Adenovirus). The CAR D1 domain adopts a β-sandwich fold characteristic of Ig variable domains and is sufficient for interaction with the adenovirus fiber knob (Bewley1999Structural).

The transmembrane region spans amino acids 238-258, and the cytoplasmic domain contains functional motifs such as the PDZ-binding domain and SH3 domain recognition motif, which are important for intracellular signaling (Howitt2003Adenovirus; Herrmann2020Naturally). CAR can form homodimers, which are involved in mediating cell-cell contacts (Herrmann2020Naturally). The protein is subject to post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms (Howitt2003Adenovirus).

## Function
The CXADR gene encodes the Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. CAR is an integral membrane protein that plays a significant role in cell adhesion and the maintenance of epithelial tight junctions. It interacts with PDZ-domain-containing proteins, such as MAGI-1, PICK1, and PSD-95, which are crucial for the formation of epithelial tight junctions and paracellular permeability, thereby maintaining the junction adhesion complex in polarized epithelia (Excoffon2004A).

CAR is also involved in the regulation of cell growth. Its expression affects cellular growth, with increased expression leading to decreased cell growth in transformed models, suggesting a role in contact inhibition through CAR:CAR interactions (Excoffon2004A). In the context of cardiac function, CAR is essential for the proper localization of connexin 45, β-catenin, and ZO-1 at cell-cell junctions in the atrioventricular node and intercalated discs of the myocardium, which is crucial for maintaining normal AV-node function and cardiac conduction (Lim2008Coxsackievirus; Lisewski2008The).

CAR is also implicated in erythroid differentiation and migration, as its expression promotes the differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells and enhances their migration capabilities (Bauer2023CAR).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CXADR gene, also known as the Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor, have been implicated in several hematologic disorders. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), CXADR is significantly downregulated in erythroid progenitors, contributing to the maturation defects and anemia observed in these patients. This downregulation is particularly pronounced in higher-risk MDS subtypes, such as MDS with excess blasts (MDS-EB1/EB2), and correlates with poorer prognostic outcomes, although these correlations are not statistically significant (Bauer2023CAR). Reduced CXADR expression is also observed in other myeloid neoplasms, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), suggesting a broader role in hematologic malignancies (Bauer2023CAR).

In the context of hematopoietic regeneration, CXADR is crucial for the transition of hematopoietic stem cells into the cell cycle under stress conditions, such as after 5-fluorouracil treatment or bone marrow transplantation. Its expression is upregulated during these stress conditions, facilitating hematopoietic recovery. CAR knockout mice exhibit impaired hematopoietic regeneration, highlighting the importance of CXADR in this process (Guojin2020Membrane). These findings suggest that CXADR plays a significant role in both the pathogenesis of hematologic disorders and the response to hematopoietic stress.

## Interactions
The CXADR gene encodes the Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), which is involved in various protein interactions crucial for its function in cell adhesion and viral entry. CAR interacts with several PDZ-domain-containing proteins, including ZO-1, MAGI-1b, PICK1, and PSD-95, through its C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (GSIV). These interactions are essential for CAR's role in cell adhesion and growth regulation (Excoffon2004A; Schreiber2013The). CAR also associates with microtubules by binding to tubulin, which influences cell migration and microtubule stability. This interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of CAR and is significant in glioma cells, where CAR expression reduces cell invasion and growth (Fok2007The).

CAR forms homodimers through D1-D1 interactions and engages in heterophilic interactions with extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, tenascin-R, and agrin, primarily mediated by the D2 domain (Schreiber2013The). It also interacts with JAML on γδ T cells, facilitating neutrophil transmigration across tight junctions (Schreiber2013The). These interactions highlight CAR's multifaceted role in cellular adhesion and immune response.
