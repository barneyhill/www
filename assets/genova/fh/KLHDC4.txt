# KLHDC4

## Overview
KLHDC4 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch domain containing 4, which is characterized by the presence of a kelch domain, a structural motif involved in protein-protein interactions. This protein is implicated in various cellular processes, including cell growth and apoptosis, and has been categorized as having oncogenic potential due to its role in cancer progression. The expression of KLHDC4 is notably upregulated in several types of cancer, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease stages. The protein's involvement in cancer makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Lian2016Upregulation).

## Clinical Significance
KLHDC4 has been implicated in the progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis. Studies have shown that KLHDC4 is significantly upregulated in NPC tissues compared to normal nasopharyngeal epithelia, with a positive expression rate of 68.9% in tumor tissues. This overexpression correlates with advanced T and N classifications and overall staging, but not with gender, age, or M stage. High levels of KLHDC4 expression are linked to reduced overall survival and metastasis-free survival in NPC patients, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Lian2016Upregulation).

Functional studies using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out KLHDC4 in NPC cell lines have demonstrated reduced cell growth, migration, and invasion, alongside increased apoptosis. These findings indicate that KLHDC4 may play an oncogenic role by inhibiting apoptosis, making it a potential therapeutic target in NPC (Lian2016Upregulation).

In addition to NPC, elevated KLHDC4 mRNA levels have been observed in other cancers, including breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, and thyroid cancers, suggesting a broader role in cancer development (Lian2016Upregulation). However, specific diseases or conditions directly linked to KLHDC4 mutations remain under investigation.
