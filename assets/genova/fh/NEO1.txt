# NEO1

## Overview
The NEO1 gene encodes the neogenin 1 protein, a transmembrane receptor that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Neogenin 1 is characterized by its structural components, including four immunoglobulin-like domains and six fibronectin type III domains, which are integral to its function in cellular signaling and adhesion (Vielmetter1997Molecular). This receptor is involved in a variety of biological processes, such as cell adhesion, migration, and axon guidance, by interacting with ligands like netrins and repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs) (Robinson2021Simultaneous). The NEO1 gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, including cancer and cerebrovascular disorders, highlighting its role as a potential tumor suppressor and its involvement in vascular function (Ren2021Linking; Zhang2020Identification).

## Structure
The NEO1 (neogenin 1) protein is a single-pass transmembrane receptor that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. Its molecular structure includes four N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and six fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, followed by a transmembrane helix and an intracellular domain (Robinson2021Simultaneous; Vielmetter1997Molecular). The FN5 and FN6 domains are particularly significant as they contain the binding site for repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs) (Bell2013Structure).

NEO1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, which are present in its extracellular domains (Vielmetter1997Molecular). The intracellular domain contains potential serine or threonine phosphorylation sites, which may play a role in signal transduction (Vielmetter1997Molecular).

The protein can form homodimers, indicating a quaternary structure, and is capable of forming higher-order oligomers in complex with ligands such as NET1 and RGMB, resulting in a 'trimer-of-trimers' assembly (Robinson2021Simultaneous; Bell2013Structure). NEO1 is expressed in at least two isoforms derived from alternative splicing in the intracellular domain, which may affect its overall structure and function (Vielmetter1997Molecular).

## Function
Neogenin 1 (NEO1) is a receptor involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, and axon guidance. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and shares structural similarities with the deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) tumor suppressor. NEO1 contains four immunoglobulin-like domains, six fibronectin type III domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain, which are crucial for its function in cell signaling and adhesion (Vielmetter1997Molecular).

NEO1 plays a significant role in maintaining adherens junction (AJ) stability and tension during epithelial morphogenesis. It is a key component of the actin nucleation machinery, promoting actin nucleation at AJs by recruiting the Wave regulatory complex (WRC) and Arp2/3. This process is essential for regulating junctional tension through actomyosin contractility, which is necessary for epithelial integrity and organogenesis (Lee2016Neogenin).

In the nervous system, NEO1 is involved in axon guidance and neuron migration. It interacts with ligands such as netrin-1 and repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs), forming complexes that modulate attractive and repulsive signaling pathways. This dual role allows NEO1 to integrate signals from different guidance cues, influencing neuronal migration and guidance (Robinson2021Simultaneous).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NEO1 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly in cancer and cerebrovascular disorders. In colorectal cancer (CRC), NEO1 is significantly down-regulated, and its low expression is associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and increased risk of metastasis. This suggests that NEO1 acts as a tumor suppressor, with its absence potentially inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical process for cancer metastasis (Zhang2020Identification). NEO1 also interacts with pathways involved in inflammation and angiogenesis, which are important in the tumor microenvironment, although the exact mechanisms require further research (Zhang2020Identification).

In the context of moyamoya disease (MMD), a rare cerebrovascular disorder, NEO1 deficiency is linked to the development of moyamoya-like vasculopathy. This condition is characterized by the formation of small, dysfunctional blood vessels in the brain. Studies have shown that reduced NEO1 expression in the cortex of MMD patients correlates with increased vessel density and branch points, suggesting its role in maintaining normal vascular function (Ren2021Linking).

NEO1 is also involved in atherogenesis, where its upregulation in endothelial cells by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) leads to increased leukocyte adhesion, contributing to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis (Li2022Upregulation).

## Interactions
Neogenin 1 (NEO1) is a transmembrane receptor that interacts with various ligands, including netrins and repulsive guidance molecules (RGMs), to participate in complex signaling pathways. NEO1 forms a ternary complex with Netrin-1 (NET1) and RGMs, creating a 'trimer-of-trimers' assembly that inhibits RGMA-NEO1-mediated growth cone collapse and neuron migration. This complex allows NET1 and RGMs to bind simultaneously to NEO1, preventing the formation of signaling-competent RGM-NEO1 complexes and NET1-induced NEO1 ectodomain clustering, effectively silencing downstream signaling pathways (Robinson2021Simultaneous).

NEO1 also interacts with integrin β1 and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in neuroblastoma cells, forming a complex with NET1 that is crucial for cell migration. This interaction promotes FAK autophosphorylation and integrin β1 activation, which are essential for neuroblastoma cell migration and may play a role in cancer progression (Villanueva2021The).

Structurally, NEO1 interacts with RGMB through its FN6 domain, forming both 1:1 and 2:2 stoichiometries. These interactions are crucial for the RGMB-NEO1 complex's role in neuronal signaling and are influenced by site-specific mutations (Bell2013Structure).
