# STOML1

## Overview
STOML1, or stomatin-like 1, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the stomatin-domain family, which is involved in the modulation of ion channels and mechanosensation. The protein, also referred to as SLP-1, is primarily localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, with occasional presence in the nucleus, suggesting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and sensory functions (Wang2020Coexisting). STOML1 is expressed in various tissues, with notable levels in the brain, and plays a critical role in modulating acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in sensory neurons, which are essential for mechanosensory functions (GonzalezVelandia2022Expression). The protein's interactions with other members of the stomatin family, such as STOML3, further highlight its involvement in cellular processes related to sensory perception and signal transduction (Wetzel2016Smallmolecule). Additionally, STOML1 has been implicated in the pathology of oral squamous cell carcinoma, where it is significantly overexpressed, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2020Coexisting).

## Function
STOML1 (stomatin-like 1) is a protein that plays a role in modulating ion channels and is involved in mechanosensation. It is part of the stomatin-domain family, which includes proteins like STOM, STOML2, and STOML3. In healthy human cells, STOML1 is expressed at varying levels across different tissues, with high expression in the brain and lower levels in the heart, skeletal muscle, and dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons (GonzalezVelandia2022Expression). In these sensory neurons, STOML1 modulates the activity of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), which are crucial for mechanosensory functions (GonzalezVelandia2022Expression).

STOML1 is primarily localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, and it is also found in the nucleus in certain contexts (Wang2020Coexisting). The protein's presence in these cellular compartments suggests its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis and contributing to sensory functions. Although the specific molecular mechanisms of STOML1 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its role in ion channel regulation and potential interactions with other stomatin-domain proteins indicate its importance in cellular processes related to sensory perception and signal transduction (GonzalezVelandia2022Expression).

## Clinical Significance
STOML1 has been implicated in the pathology of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Studies have shown that STOML1 is significantly overexpressed in OSCC tissues compared to normal oral tissues, with a strong association with early tumor stages (T1 and T2). This overexpression suggests that STOML1 may play a critical role in OSCC development and could serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target (Wang2020Coexisting). Additionally, whole transcriptome sequencing has identified STOML1 as one of the significantly mutated genes in OSCC, indicating its potential involvement in tumor evolution and progression (Zhang2013Whole).

In the context of exfoliation syndrome (XFS), STOML1 has been studied for its genetic associations. However, its link to XFS is considered an artifact due to its proximity to the LOXL1 gene, which is the true signal associated with the condition. Conditional analyses have shown that when accounting for LOXL1 expression, the STOML1 signal disappears, suggesting that STOML1's association with XFS is not direct (Hirbo2023Analysis). Despite this, STOML1 was used as a negative control in studies examining gene expression in XFS, indicating its lack of significant downregulation in this condition (Hirbo2023Analysis).

## Interactions
STOML1, a member of the stomatin family, is involved in various protein interactions that may influence its function in cellular processes. In the context of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), STOML1 is significantly overexpressed and primarily localizes to the cell membrane and cytoplasm, with some presence in the nucleus. This suggests potential interactions with other cellular components, although specific interaction partners in OSCC are not detailed (Wang2020Coexisting).

STOML1 is also known to interact with other proteins in the stomatin family, such as STOML3. STOML3 modulates the sensitivity of Piezo mechanically-gated ion channels, and small molecule inhibitors have been identified that disrupt STOML3 oligomerization. These inhibitors also affect the self-association of STOML1, indicating a potential interaction or shared pathway between these proteins (Wetzel2016Smallmolecule).

In the context of endocytic trafficking, STOML1, also referred to as SLP-1, has been shown to localize to late endosomes, suggesting a role in this cellular process. This localization is consistent with its involvement in endocytic trafficking, although specific interaction partners in this pathway are not detailed (Gosney2018Proteomics).
