# PDZD8

## Overview
PDZD8 is a gene that encodes the PDZ domain containing 8 protein, which is a multidomain protein involved in critical cellular processes. The PDZD8 protein is categorized as a membrane-associated protein, primarily residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the ER and other organelles, such as mitochondria and late endosomes/lysosomes. These MCSs are essential for lipid and calcium ion transfer, which are crucial for cellular signaling, energy metabolism, and synaptic development. The protein's structure includes domains such as the Synaptotagmin-like Mitochondrial lipid-binding Proteins (SMP) domain, which is involved in lipid transport, and the PDZ domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions. PDZD8's interactions with proteins like Rab7 and Protrudin underscore its role in interorganellar communication and neuronal health (Hirabayashi2017ERmitochondria; ElbazAlon2020PDZD8; Khan2021Structural).

## Structure
The PDZD8 protein is a multidomain protein encoded by the PDZD8 gene, featuring several distinct structural domains. It includes an N-terminal transmembrane helix that anchors it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, followed by a Synaptotagmin-like Mitochondrial lipid-binding Proteins (SMP) domain, a PDZ domain, a C1 domain, and a coiled-coil (CC) domain (ElbazAlon2020PDZD8; Khan2021Structural). The SMP domain is involved in lipid transport between membranes, while the C1 domain binds specific lipids in the membranes (Khan2021Structural).

The coiled-coil domain of PDZD8 forms a flat structure composed of three α-helices arranged in an α1-α3-α2 topology, which allows it to interact with two GTP-bound Rab7 molecules on opposite sides, facilitating ER-late endosome tethering (Khan2021Structural). This interaction is crucial for membrane tethering and lipid transport at membrane contact sites (Khan2021Structural).

PDZD8 also interacts with the ER protein Protrudin, forming a complex that regulates endosome trafficking (Khan2021Structural). The protein's structure and domain organization enable it to play a significant role in interorganellar communication and phospholipid transfer (ElbazAlon2020PDZD8).

## Function
The PDZD8 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through its involvement in membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other organelles. PDZD8 is an ER-resident protein that localizes at ER-mitochondria contact sites, where it is essential for the formation and maintenance of these contacts. This localization is crucial for the regulation of calcium ion (Ca2+) dynamics, as PDZD8 facilitates the transfer of Ca2+ from the ER to mitochondria, a process important for cellular signaling and energy metabolism in neurons (Hirabayashi2017ERmitochondria).

PDZD8 also functions at ER-late endosome/lysosome (LEL) contact sites, where it interacts with the GTPase Rab7. This interaction is important for endosome maturation and lipid transport, processes that are vital for synaptogenesis and neuronal integrity. PDZD8's SMP domain is involved in lipid transfer, enhancing lysosome maturation and autophagic flux, which are critical for the degradation of damaged organelles and protein aggregates (Thakur2023PDZD8; Shirane2020Protrudin; Khan2021Structural). Through these functions, PDZD8 contributes to synaptic development and plasticity, highlighting its importance in maintaining neuronal health (Thakur2023PDZD8).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the PDZD8 gene have been linked to several neurological and metabolic disorders. In the brain, PDZD8 is crucial for lipid metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol esters, resulting in behavioral abnormalities such as growth retardation, hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and impaired memory functions. These symptoms are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability and conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Kurihara2023PDZD8deficient).

In the context of diabetes, PDZD8 is involved in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts, which are critical for calcium dynamics and cell survival. Increased expression of PDZD8 in pancreatic β-cells has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and β-cell death, contributing to the pathophysiology of diabetes (Liu2024PDZD8).

In neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, PDZD8-mediated mitochondria-ER contacts have been implicated in mitochondrial quality control. Alterations in these contacts can exacerbate conditions like Alzheimer's by affecting calcium transfer and mitochondrial function, suggesting a potential therapeutic target in reducing PDZD8 expression to mitigate disease progression (Hewitt2022Decreasing).

## Interactions
PDZD8 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes involving membrane contact sites (MCSs). It interacts with Rab7, a small GTPase, in a GTP-dependent manner, facilitating the formation of MCSs between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and late endosomes/lysosomes (LE/lys). This interaction is essential for PDZD8's recruitment to vesicular structures and is mediated by its C-terminal region (ElbazAlon2020PDZD8; GuillénSamander2019PDZD8).

PDZD8 also interacts with Protrudin, an ER transmembrane protein, to form ER-LE/lys MCSs. This interaction is crucial for lipid transfer and endosomal positioning, which are important for processes like neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis (Gao2021PDZD8mediated; ElbazAlon2020PDZD8). The PDZD8-Protrudin-Rab7 network is involved in endosomal maturation and may also influence mitochondrial interactions, suggesting a role in interorganellar communication (ElbazAlon2020PDZD8).

PDZD8's SMP domain is involved in lipid binding and transfer, which is critical for its function at MCSs. This domain allows PDZD8 to bind glycerophospholipids and ceramides, facilitating lipid transport between the ER and LE/lys (Gao2021PDZD8mediated). These interactions highlight PDZD8's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting neuronal functions.
