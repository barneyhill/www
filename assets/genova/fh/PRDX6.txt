# PRDX6

## Overview
Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is a gene that encodes a unique member of the peroxiredoxin family of proteins, which are known for their antioxidant properties. The protein product, peroxiredoxin 6, is a bifunctional enzyme with both peroxidase and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities, distinguishing it from other peroxiredoxins (Chowhan2020Structural; RiveraSantiago2015Solution). This enzyme plays a crucial role in cellular defense against oxidative stress by reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage (Jia2023AntiOxidant; Manevich2005Peroxiredoxin). Additionally, peroxiredoxin 6 is involved in the repair of peroxidized cell membranes and participates in the deacylation/reacylation pathway, which is vital for maintaining membrane integrity (Fisher2017Peroxiredoxin). The protein is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and lysosomes, where its activity is modulated by factors such as pH and phosphorylation (Arevalo2018The; Fisher2017Peroxiredoxin). PRDX6's interactions with other proteins, such as glutathione S-transferase π (GSTπ) and TXNDC5, further underscore its multifaceted role in cellular antioxidant defense and lipid metabolism (Zhou2016Peroxiredoxin; Bidooki2023Endoplasmic).

## Structure
Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is a unique member of the peroxiredoxin family, characterized by its bifunctional enzyme activities, including peroxidase and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) functions. The primary structure of PRDX6 consists of a single polypeptide chain with a conserved cysteine residue, Cys 47, which is crucial for its peroxidase activity (Chowhan2020Structural; RiveraSantiago2015Solution). The secondary structure of PRDX6 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, forming a thioredoxin fold typical of peroxiredoxins (Chowhan2020Structural).

PRDX6 functions as a homodimer, with its dimerization involving hydrophobic interactions, particularly involving residues L145 and L148 (Zhou2016Peroxiredoxin). The enzyme's tertiary structure is characterized by distinct domains for its enzymatic activities, with the N-terminal domain important for glutathione peroxidase activity and the C-terminal domain featuring a thioredoxin fold (Zhou2016Peroxiredoxin). 

Post-translational modifications of PRDX6 include phosphorylation, particularly at Thr 177, which enhances its PLA2 activity (RiveraSantiago2015Solution). The enzyme also undergoes various oxidative modifications at the active site cysteine, which are crucial for its function in oxidative stress responses (Jeong2012Comprehensive).

## Function
Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is a multifunctional enzyme that plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting cells from oxidative stress. It exhibits both peroxidase and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities, which are essential for reducing hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, thereby safeguarding cells against oxidative damage (Jia2023AntiOxidant; Manevich2005Peroxiredoxin). PRDX6 is unique among peroxiredoxins for its ability to reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides, a function it shares only with glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) (Arevalo2018The).

The enzyme is involved in the repair of peroxidized cell membranes through its glutathione peroxidase activity, which reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides, and its PLA2 activity, which facilitates the removal of oxidized fatty acyl chains (Fisher2017Peroxiredoxin). PRDX6 also participates in the deacylation/reacylation pathway, crucial for maintaining the integrity of cell membranes (Fisher2017Peroxiredoxin).

PRDX6 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm and lysosomes, where its enzymatic activities are regulated by factors such as pH and phosphorylation (Arevalo2018The; Fisher2017Peroxiredoxin). Its expression is modulated by oxidative stress and transcription factors like Nrf2, which regulate its activity in response to changes in reactive oxygen species levels (Jia2023AntiOxidant).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the PRDX6 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of oxidative stress-related conditions. In lens epithelial cells, the absence of PRDX6 leads to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, spontaneous apoptosis, and phenotypic abnormalities, which are associated with cataractogenesis. This suggests that PRDX6 mutations or altered expression could contribute to age-related cataract formation (Fatma2005Impaired).

In cancer, PRDX6 expression is notably altered. It is down-regulated in kidney cancers and associated with poor survival outcomes in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), where it is highly expressed in tumor tissues. Genetic alterations in PRDX6, such as copy number variations and methylation changes, are linked to its expression levels and are observed in several cancers, including BLCA, endometrial carcinoma, and ovarian epithelial tumors. These alterations suggest a role for PRDX6 in cancer progression and prognosis, potentially through pathways like JAK2-STAT3, which are involved in cell proliferation and survival (Gao2021Integrative).

PRDX6 deficiency also leads to increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis, highlighting its role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and survival signaling pathways (Fatma2011Deficiency).

## Interactions
Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is known for its interactions with several proteins, which are crucial for its enzymatic activities. PRDX6 forms homodimers and heterodimers with glutathione S-transferase π (GSTπ). These interactions are essential for its peroxidase activity but not for its phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity. The heterodimerization with GSTπ is necessary for the glutathionylation and reduction of the oxidized enzyme, facilitating the regeneration of the active form of PRDX6 (Zhou2016Peroxiredoxin). The hydrophobic amino acids L145 and L148 are critical for PRDX6's dimerization, and mutations at these sites impair its interaction with GSTπ, reducing peroxidase activity (Zhou2016Peroxiredoxin).

PRDX6 also interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum protein TXNDC5, which is involved in redox regulation and protein folding. This interaction is important for maintaining glutathione metabolism and lipid peroxidation in hepatic cells. TXNDC5 deficiency leads to reduced PRDX6 protein levels, suggesting a role in regulating PRDX6 protein stability or translation (Bidooki2023Endoplasmic). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of PRDX6 in cellular antioxidant defense and lipid metabolism.
