# YJU2B

## Overview
YJU2B is a gene that encodes the YJU2 splicing factor homolog B, a protein involved in the pre-mRNA splicing process. This protein is categorized as a splicing factor, which plays a critical role in the assembly and function of the spliceosome, a complex responsible for the removal of introns from pre-mRNA transcripts. The YJU2 splicing factor homolog B is essential for the accurate and efficient splicing of pre-mRNA, which is a crucial step in the post-transcriptional modification of RNA. This process ensures that mature mRNA is properly formed, allowing for the correct translation of genetic information into functional proteins. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of ongoing research due to their potential implications in various biological processes and diseases (Qiu2020aarFDC).
