# MAP3K9

## Overview
MAP3K9 is a gene that encodes the protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 9, a serine/threonine kinase that plays a pivotal role in the MAPK signaling pathway. This protein is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, by acting as an upstream kinase that activates downstream MAPK pathways such as JNK and ERK (NIE2015MicroRNA148b; Fawdar2013Targeted). MAP3K9 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is crucial for stress response and immune signaling, where it phosphorylates and activates MAP2K4, subsequently influencing JNK activity (Stark2011Frequent). Dysregulation of MAP3K9 has been associated with several pathological conditions, including cancer, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target (Abbasi2021MAP3K1).

## Structure
The MAP3K9 protein, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 9, is a serine/threonine kinase involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. Its molecular structure includes a crucial kinase domain responsible for its enzymatic activity. Mutations within this domain can significantly impact the protein's function. For instance, the p.Trp333* mutation results in a truncated kinase domain, likely rendering it non-functional, while the p.Arg160Cys mutation disrupts hydrogen bonds with Glu167, potentially affecting the protein's structure (Stark2011Frequent).

The structural analysis of MAP3K9's kinase domain has been conducted using PDB ID 3DTC, although detailed structural data for other parts of the protein, such as the SH3 domain, are not available (Stark2011Frequent). The protein's structure is further characterized by specific mutations that disrupt hydrogen bonds, potentially altering the kinase domain surface and affecting interactions with other molecules (Stark2011Frequent).

MAP3K9 is part of a cluster of eight STE kinases within the TKL group branch, as identified through phylogenetic analysis (Modi2019A). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, and alternative splicing can result in different isoforms, potentially affecting its function and interactions. However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
MAP3K9, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 9, is a crucial component of the MAPK signaling pathway, which is involved in regulating various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. As an upstream kinase, MAP3K9 activates downstream MAPK pathways, including the JNK and ERK pathways, which are essential for transmitting extracellular signals to intracellular responses (NIE2015MicroRNA148b; Fawdar2013Targeted).

In healthy human cells, MAP3K9 is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a significant role in stress response and immune signaling. It functions by phosphorylating and activating MAP2K4, which in turn activates JNK, a key player in the regulation of apoptosis and cell survival (Stark2011Frequent). The MAPK/JNK signaling pathway, modulated by MAP3K9, has dual functions, exerting both pro- and anti-apoptotic effects depending on the cellular context (NIE2015MicroRNA148b).

MAP3K9's activity is tightly regulated, and its dysregulation can lead to various pathological conditions, including cancer. However, in normal physiological conditions, it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis by modulating responses to environmental stressors and cytokines (Abbasi2021MAP3K1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MAP3K9 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In metastatic melanoma, somatic mutations in MAP3K9 are frequent, occurring in about 15% of samples. These mutations are often inactivating, leading to reduced kinase activity and contributing to chemoresistance. The mutations in MAP3K9, such as p.Trp333*, result in a truncated kinase domain, affecting its function and potentially promoting melanoma progression and resistance to treatment (Stark2011Frequent).

In cholangiocarcinoma, MAP3K9 mutations, including the p.Glu38del variant, are associated with increased peri-vascular tumor invasion. These mutations may activate the MEK/ERK pathway independently of RAF, contributing to cholangiocarcinogenesis (Quinn2023Genomic).

MAP3K9 is also involved in autoimmune conditions. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, miR-20a targets MAP3K9, suppressing regulatory T cell differentiation. This interaction suggests a role for MAP3K9 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, with potential therapeutic implications for modulating immune responses (Wang2021miR20a).

Alterations in MAP3K9 expression are linked to intervertebral disc degeneration, where miR-15a targets MAP3K9, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis in nucleus pulposus cells (Cai2017Role).

## Interactions
MAP3K9, also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 9, is involved in several protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), MAP3K9 interacts with PCDH20, a tumor suppressor gene. This interaction is significant in the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, where PCDH20 overexpression leads to reduced levels of phosphorylated AKT, phosphorylated GSK3β, and active β-catenin, thereby inhibiting the pathway. The interaction between PCDH20 and MAP3K9 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Ning2022PCDH20).

In pancreatic cancer, MAP3K9 is involved in the activation of the MEK/ERK and NF-kB pathways, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. This is demonstrated by increased expression of pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, and NF-kB upon MAP3K9 overexpression (Xia2018miR7). In hepatocellular carcinoma, MAP3K9 is targeted by miR-361-5p, which inhibits its expression and affects the MAPK kinase/JNK signaling pathway, crucial for regulating cell apoptosis (Ren2021MicroRNA‑361‑5p). These interactions highlight MAP3K9's role in various signaling pathways, impacting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cancer progression.
