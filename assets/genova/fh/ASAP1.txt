# ASAP1

## Overview
The ASAP1 gene encodes the protein ArfGAP with SH3 domain, ankyrin repeat, and PH domain 1, which is a multifunctional GTPase-activating protein (GAP) involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. This protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, ankyrin repeats, and an SH3 domain, which facilitate its interactions with various cellular components and phosphoinositides (Brown1998ASAP1; Che2005Regulation). ASAP1 plays a critical role in cellular processes such as cell migration, adhesion, and cytoskeletal organization by modulating the activity of ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) proteins (Randazzo2000The). It is also implicated in cancer progression and metastasis, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (He2020Integrative; Xie2023ASAP1).

## Structure
The ASAP1 protein is a phospholipid-dependent Arf GTPase-activating protein characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function in cellular processes. The primary structure of ASAP1 includes a polypeptide chain with specific domains such as a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, a zinc finger motif, ankyrin repeats, a proline-rich region, and an SH3 domain (Brown1998ASAP1). The PH domain is crucial for phosphoinositide binding, particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which is essential for its GAP activity (Che2005Regulation; Soubias2020Membrane).

The secondary structure of the PH domain is described as a seven-stranded β-sandwich with an α-helix, which is common in proteins involved in membrane recruitment (Soubias2020Membrane). The tertiary structure involves interactions between the PH, Arf GAP, and ankyrin repeat domains, although these domains do not form a single integrated structure (Luo2008Dynamic).

ASAP1 exists in at least two splice variants, ASAP1a and ASAP1b, which differ in the proline-rich region due to alternative splicing (Brown1998ASAP1). These variants influence the protein's interactions and functions, particularly in relation to Src family kinases (Brown1998ASAP1). The protein is phosphorylated by Src, which affects its association with other proteins (Brown1998ASAP1).

## Function
ASAP1 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that plays a crucial role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in various cellular processes, including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and cell migration. It interacts with ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) proteins, particularly Arf1, Arf5, and Arf6, to modulate their activity, which is essential for membrane traffic and cytoskeletal changes (Randazzo2000The). ASAP1 localizes to focal adhesions and is involved in their assembly and turnover, affecting cell adhesion and spreading. It interacts with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and other focal adhesion components like paxillin, influencing the dynamics of these structures (Liu2002The).

ASAP1's activity is regulated by its interaction with phosphoinositides and proteins such as Src, which integrate signals to coordinate cytoskeletal remodeling during cell movement (Randazzo2000The). Overexpression of ASAP1 can inhibit cell spreading and alter focal adhesion morphology, while mutations affecting its GAP activity can lead to increased dorsal ruffle formation (Randazzo2000The). These functions highlight ASAP1's role as a regulatory component in cytoskeletal dynamics, essential for proper cell movement and structural integrity.

## Clinical Significance
ASAP1 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in promoting tumor progression, metastasis, and chemotherapy resistance. In gastric cancer, ASAP1 is highly expressed and correlates with poor prognosis. It enhances CDC42 activity by stabilizing IQGAP1, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis, and upregulates the EGFR-MAPK pathway, contributing to chemotherapy resistance, particularly to oxaliplatin (Xie2023ASAP1).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), ASAP1 is frequently amplified and overexpressed, driving tumor progression and correlating with poor metastasis-free survival. It modulates cytokine and apoptosis signaling pathways, influencing TNBC survival outcomes (He2020Integrative).

ASAP1 also plays a significant role in colorectal cancer, where its expression is associated with increased tumor cell motility, invasiveness, and poor survival outcomes. It interacts with SH3-domain-containing proteins, crucial for its metastasis-promoting activity (Müller2010ASAP1).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, high ASAP1 expression is linked to shorter overall and recurrence-free survival, although it is not an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analyses (Bang2022Clinicopathological). These findings suggest that ASAP1 is a potential target for therapeutic intervention across various cancers.

## Interactions
ASAP1 is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the Rab11 effector FIP3 through its BAR domain, forming a ternary complex with Rab11. This interaction stimulates ASAP1's GAP activity against Arf1 and is significant for the positioning of the recycling endosome containing the transferrin receptor (Inoue2008Arf).

ASAP1 also associates with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) through its SH3 domain, interacting with the second proline-rich motif of FAK. This interaction contributes to focal adhesion assembly and links ASAP1 activity to integrin signaling pathways (Liu2002The).

The protein interacts with Src family kinases via proline-rich sequences that bind to the SH3 domain of Src, leading to its phosphorylation. This interaction is important for coordinating membrane traffic with cellular responses mediated by Src (Brown1998ASAP1).

ASAP1's PH domain binds to phosphoinositides, such as PI(4,5)P2, which is crucial for its recruitment to membrane surfaces and regulation of its GAP activity (Che2005Regulation; Soubias2020Membrane). The N-BAR domain of ASAP1 also directly binds and bundles actin filaments, organizing the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts (Chen2020The).
