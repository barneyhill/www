# HACD4

## Overview
HACD4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 4, which is involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in humans. This enzyme is categorized as a dehydratase and plays a critical role in the fatty acid elongation cycle, a key process in lipid metabolism that occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum. Despite its essential function in maintaining cellular membrane integrity, HACD4 exhibits the lowest enzymatic activity among its family members and is primarily expressed in leukocytes. The specific role of HACD4 in healthy human cells remains unclear, but it may be involved in the metabolism of specialized substrates, such as pathogen-derived short fatty acids. Dysregulation of HACD4 has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Cao2022Identification; Chittka2018Longterm; Sawai2017The).

## Function
HACD4 (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 4) is an enzyme involved in the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in humans. It catalyzes the dehydration step in the fatty acid elongation cycle, a crucial process for lipid metabolism that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. This enzyme is essential for maintaining cellular membrane integrity and function. Despite its role in fatty acid metabolism, HACD4 exhibits the lowest activity among the HACD family, approximately 16-fold lower than HACD2, and its mRNA expression is restricted to leukocytes (Sawai2017The).

HACD4's activity in fatty acid elongation pathways was not detected in cell-based assays, and overexpression experiments indicated no activity in fatty acid elongation, irrespective of the fatty acid species tested (Sawai2017The). The enzyme's function in healthy human cells remains unclear, but it may have specialized substrates, possibly short or branched-chain 3-OH acyl-CoAs, rather than longer chain 3-OH acyl-CoAs (Sawai2017The). HACD4 is specifically expressed in leukocytes, suggesting a potential role in the metabolism of pathogen-derived 3-OH short fatty acids, such as those found in the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria like E. coli (Sawai2017The).

## Clinical Significance
HACD4 (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 4) plays a significant role in fatty acid metabolism, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases. In ovarian cancer, HACD4 is upregulated, suggesting its involvement in cancer progression and pathogenesis. This upregulation is part of a broader alteration in fatty acid metabolism, which is crucial for cancer prognosis and therapy response. Targeting fatty acid pathways, including HACD4, is considered a potential therapeutic strategy for ovarian cancer (Cao2022Identification).

In diabetic nephropathy, the expression of HACD4 is decreased, particularly in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. This reduction may be linked to impaired insulin sensitivity, highlighting the gene's role in metabolic processes associated with diabetes (Chittka2018Longterm).

In bovine mammary epithelial cells, HACD4 is involved in the very long-chain fatty acid biosynthetic process. Although its expression was not significantly altered in the context of ASIP gene knockout, HACD4 is associated with fatty acid transport and elongation, indicating its potential impact on lipid metabolism (Xie2022The).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of HACD4 in metabolic disorders and cancer, suggesting that alterations in its expression or function can contribute to disease development.
