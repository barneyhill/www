# UGT2B15

## Overview
UGT2B15 is a gene that encodes the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B15, which is part of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family. This enzyme is integral to the glucuronidation process, a critical phase II metabolic pathway that facilitates the detoxification and excretion of various endogenous and exogenous compounds, including steroid hormones and drugs. UGT2B15 is characterized by its ability to transfer glucuronic acid to substrates, enhancing their solubility and promoting their elimination from the body (Sun2010Allelic; Turgeon2000Isolation). The protein is predominantly expressed in the liver and other tissues such as the prostate and mammary gland, indicating its role in both hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism (Tchernof1999Expression; Turgeon2001Relative). UGT2B15's activity is influenced by genetic polymorphisms, which can affect its function and have clinical implications, particularly in the context of hormone regulation and cancer risk (PARK2004ASP85TYR; Chouinard2007UDPglucuronosyltransferase).

## Structure
The UGT2B15 protein is a member of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family, characterized by a typical architecture that includes a signal peptide, an N-terminal domain (NTD) for substrate binding, a C-terminal domain (CTD) for UDPGA binding, and a transmembrane domain (Zhang2020Insight). The CTD of UGT2B15 has been crystallized, revealing a globular structure with a Rossmann-type fold, similar to the GT-B fold, consisting of a six-strand antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by seven long α-helices (Zhang2020Insight). The CTD structure was determined using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing, and the electron density map showed continuous density from residues L284 to R446, except for a loop region from F296 to S299 (Zhang2020Insight).

The UGT2B15 protein shares approximately 85% identity with UGT2B4 and UGT2B7, with specific differences in residues that may affect cofactor interaction and substrate specificity (Zhang2020Insight). Tartrate binding to the CTD of UGT2B15 has been shown to inhibit its activity by occupying the cofactor-binding site, which suggests potential implications for liver metabolism and drug interactions (Zhang2020Insight). The protein's structure and interactions are crucial for understanding its role in drug metabolism and detoxification processes.

## Function
UGT2B15 is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the glucuronidation process, a phase II metabolic pathway that aids in the detoxification and excretion of various compounds, including steroid hormones, drugs, and xenobiotics. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of glucuronic acid to substrates, making them more water-soluble and facilitating their excretion from the body (Sun2010Allelic; Turgeon2000Isolation).

UGT2B15 is particularly involved in the metabolism of steroid hormones, such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and androstane-3α,17β-diol (3α-Diol), by glucuronidating them at the 17β-hydroxy position. This activity is significant in maintaining steroid homeostasis and regulating hormone levels in peripheral tissues (Turgeon2000Isolation; Turgeon2001Relative). The enzyme is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, prostate, mammary gland, and adipose tissue, indicating its role in both hepatic and extrahepatic steroid metabolism (Tchernof1999Expression; Turgeon2001Relative).

In addition to its role in steroid metabolism, UGT2B15 is involved in the glucuronidation of bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical with endocrine activity. Genetic polymorphisms in UGT2B15 can affect its function, influencing the clearance of BPA and potentially impacting systemic exposure to this compound (Partosch2013Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the UGT2B15 gene have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. The Asp85Tyr polymorphism, specifically the UGT2B15 85Asp/Asp genotype, has been linked to a significantly higher risk of prostate cancer, with an odds ratio of 2.7, suggesting that this genotype may lead to increased androgen exposure due to decreased enzyme activity (PARK2004ASP85TYR). This polymorphism results in a reduced ability to glucuronidate dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent androgen involved in prostate cancer development (Chouinard2007UDPglucuronosyltransferase).

Alterations in UGT2B15 expression, influenced by factors such as DNA methylation and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling, can also impact prostate cancer progression. Downregulation of UGT2B15 expression, linked to increased DNA methyltransferase activity, leads to higher levels of bioactive DHT, promoting cancer cell proliferation (ShafieeKermani2020Expression). Additionally, genetic variants of UGT2B15, such as rs1902023, have been associated with prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness, indicating that these polymorphisms may affect androgen metabolism and contribute to disease progression (GauthierLandry2015Multiple).

The UGT2B15 gene is also a target for IGF1 and insulin action, with its expression being negatively regulated by these factors. This regulation may play a role in cancer protection mechanisms, as seen in conditions like Laron syndrome, where increased UGT2B15 expression is associated with reduced cancer incidence (Sarfstein2022Identification).

## Interactions
UGT2B15 participates in various protein-protein interactions that influence its function and regulation. Chimeric forms of UGT2B15, resulting from intergenic splicing, have been shown to interact with other UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) proteins, such as UGT2B7. These interactions can inhibit the glucuronidation activity of wild-type UGTs through protein-protein interactions, forming heterodimers that reduce enzymatic activity (Hu2018Intergenic). Co-immunoprecipitation assays have demonstrated that chimeric UGT2B15 can form complexes with UGT2B7, suggesting a mechanism for its inhibitory effects on glucuronidation (Hu2018Intergenic).

UGT2B15 also interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction has been observed in breast cancer cells, where UGT2B15 was found in p53 immunoprecipitates, indicating a physical association. This interaction is supported by bioinformatics analysis and in vivo studies, which suggest a negative feedback loop between UGT2B15 and p53 (Sarfstein2022Identification). These interactions highlight the role of UGT2B15 in modulating cellular processes and its potential impact on cancer biology. The regulation of UGT2B15 by sex hormones and its involvement in androgen metabolism further underscore its significance in cellular interactions and metabolic pathways (Chouinard2007UDPglucuronosyltransferase).
