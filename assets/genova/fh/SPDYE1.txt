# SPDYE1

## Overview
SPDYE1 is a gene that encodes the protein speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member E1, which is part of the Speedy/RINGO family known for its role in cell cycle regulation. This protein functions as an activator of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK2, facilitating the progression of the cell cycle, especially the transition from the G1 to S phase. SPDYE1 is predominantly active in the nucleus, where it influences DNA replication and cell division, contributing to cellular proliferation and development. The gene is characterized by a novel domain architecture and exhibits diverse expression patterns across tissues, with notable expression in the testis, suggesting a role in reproduction. Additionally, SPDYE1 is involved in complex regulatory networks, including competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactions, which may impact gene expression and cellular processes. Its expression levels have been linked to cancer progression and patient survival, highlighting its potential as a biomarker in oncology (Wang2018Extensive).

## Function
SPDYE1, a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation by acting as an activator of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are essential for cell cycle progression. This gene is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences key processes such as DNA replication and cell division, thereby contributing to normal cellular proliferation and organismal development (Wang2018Extensive).

SPDYE1 is part of the Speedy subfamily E, which has undergone extensive expansion in humans. This subfamily is characterized by a novel domain architecture and shows functional differentiation, with distinct expression patterns and regulatory networks associated with the cell cycle and various signaling pathways (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE1, along with other Speedy members, exhibits diverse expression patterns across different tissues, with high expression levels noted in the testis, suggesting a role in reproduction (Wang2018Extensive).

The gene is also involved in potential regulatory relationships among Speedy members, with significant positive expression correlations and possible competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks mediated by common microRNAs (Wang2018Extensive). These interactions highlight SPDYE1's involvement in complex regulatory mechanisms within the cell.

## Clinical Significance
SPDYE1, a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation and has been implicated in various cancers. Alterations in the expression levels of SPDYE1 are associated with tumorigenesis, particularly in breast cancer and gliomas, where high expression levels correlate with tumor grade and patient survival (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE1 is part of a gene cluster enriched in reproduction-related functions and is expressed in both normal tissues and tumors, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), indicating its fundamental role in these tissues (Wang2018Extensive).

The expression levels of SPDYE1 and other Speedy family members have been found to be predictive of patient survival across various cancers, suggesting their potential as prognostic biomarkers (Wang2018Extensive). The study highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory networks and expression patterns of SPDYE1 in human tissues and tumors to better comprehend its role in cancer progression (Wang2018Extensive). However, specific mutations or expression alterations of SPDYE1 in a clinical context are not detailed in the available literature (Wang2018Extensive).

## Interactions
SPDYE1, a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, is known for its role in cell cycle regulation through interactions with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK2. These interactions are crucial for promoting cell cycle progression, especially the transition from the G1 to S phase (Wang2018Extensive). SPDYE1 is also involved in competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks, where it shares a microRNA target, has-miR-6730-3p, with its pseudogene SPDYE20P. This suggests a regulatory interaction that may influence gene expression through ceRNA mechanisms (Wang2018Extensive).

In cancer contexts, SPDYE1 is expressed in various tumors, and its expression levels can predict patient survival in certain cancer types, indicating its potential role in cancer progression and as a biomarker (Wang2018Extensive). Although specific protein-protein interactions beyond CDK2 are not detailed, SPDYE1's involvement in ceRNA networks and its expression profile in tumors suggest it may participate in broader regulatory networks affecting cell cycle and cancer-related pathways (Wang2018Extensive).
