# FAP

## Overview
Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a gene that encodes the protein fibroblast activation protein alpha, a serine protease involved in tissue remodeling and repair. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protease and is primarily expressed in activated fibroblasts, particularly during processes such as wound healing and tissue repair. FAP's enzymatic functions include dipeptidyl peptidase and endopeptidase activities, which enable it to degrade components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), such as collagen, thereby facilitating cell migration and tissue remodeling (Basalova2023Fibroblast; Fitzgerald2020The). While FAP expression is typically low in normal tissues, it is significantly upregulated in pathological conditions, including cancer and fibrotic diseases, where it contributes to disease progression by modulating the tumor microenvironment and fibrotic processes (JuilleratJeanneret2017Fibroblast; Puré2018Pro-tumorigenic).

## Structure


## Function
Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) is a serine protease involved in various molecular processes, primarily associated with tissue remodeling. In healthy human cells, FAP expression is generally low but can be induced under specific conditions such as wound healing, where it contributes to scar formation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling (Fitzgerald2020The). FAP's enzymatic activity includes dipeptidyl peptidase and endopeptidase functions, allowing it to cleave substrates like neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, and denatured collagen types I and III (Fitzgerald2020The). This activity facilitates ECM degradation, which is crucial for processes like cell migration and tissue repair (Basalova2023Fibroblast).

FAP is primarily localized in invadopodia, membrane regions associated with ECM degradation during cell migration and invasion (Basalova2023Fibroblast). It forms active homodimers and heterodimers with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), contributing to its functional diversity (Puré2018Pro-tumorigenic). Although FAP is not essential for embryonic development, as evidenced by viable FAP-deficient mice, it plays a significant role in tissue remodeling processes (Fitzgerald2020The). Its expression in healthy tissues, such as muscle, bone marrow, and adipose tissue, suggests a role in maintaining ECM integrity and facilitating tissue repair mechanisms (Fitzgerald2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) is significantly implicated in various diseases, particularly cancer and fibrogenic disorders. In cancer, FAP is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and is crucial for tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis. Its expression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancers, where it facilitates tissue remodeling and tumor invasion by degrading extracellular matrix components like collagen and fibronectin (JuilleratJeanneret2017Fibroblast; ZI2015Fibroblast). FAP's enzymatic activity is necessary for extracellular matrix remodeling, influencing signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt and SHH/Gli1, which are involved in cell proliferation and invasion (Fitzgerald2020The).

In fibrogenic disorders, FAP is overexpressed in myofibroblasts and is involved in conditions like Crohn's disease and fibrotic lungs, where it plays a role in collagen catabolism (JuilleratJeanneret2017Fibroblast). FAP is also linked to cardiovascular diseases, being overexpressed in atheromatous plaques and contributing to plaque instability (Stein2020Deletion; Fitzgerald2020The). These roles make FAP a potential therapeutic target, with ongoing research into FAP-specific inhibitors and prodrugs for delivering cytotoxic agents to FAP-expressing cells (JuilleratJeanneret2017Fibroblast).

## Interactions
Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP) is involved in various interactions with other proteins, influencing both cancer progression and fibrosis. FAP forms heterodimeric complexes with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), which promotes cell migration (Basalova2023Fibroblast). It is also associated with the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and integrin α3β1, facilitating cellular migration via the Rac1 pathway in ovarian cancer cells (Fitzgerald2020The). FAP interacts with membrane-bound proteases such as MMP-2, MMP-14, and uPA, enhancing pericellular proteolysis (Basalova2023Fibroblast).

In cancer-associated fibroblasts, FAP influences the abundance of proteins involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) processing and TGFβ signaling, affecting cell morphology and angiogenesis (Koczorowska2015Fibroblast). FAP's interaction with integrins is crucial for its localization to invadopodia, which are involved in ECM degradation (Basalova2023Fibroblast). FAP also interacts with proteins like caveolin-1 and stomatin, which are associated with lipid rafts, and is involved in cleaving and inactivating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) (Puré2018Pro-tumorigenic). These interactions highlight FAP's role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and fibrotic processes.
