# ASAP2

## Overview
The ASAP2 gene encodes the protein ArfGAP with SH3 domain, ankyrin repeat, and PH domain 2, also known as development-and differentiation-enhancing factor-2 (DDEF2). This protein is categorized as a multi-domain Arf-GTPase-activating protein (Arf-GAP) and is involved in various cellular processes, including vesicular transport, cellular migration, and autophagy. The protein's structure comprises several functional domains, such as a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an Arf-GAP domain, ankyrin repeats, and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, which facilitate its role in membrane association, signaling, and protein-protein interactions (Seuter2014The). ASAP2 is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus and at the plasma membrane, where it interacts with proteins like protein tyrosine kinase 2-beta (Pyk2) and CIN85, influencing cellular signaling pathways and contributing to processes such as phagocytosis and cell migration (Seuter2014The; Ma2023ASAP2). The gene's expression is regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, particularly in immune cells, and its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Fujii2021The; Seuter2014The).

## Structure
The ASAP2 protein, also known as development-and differentiation-enhancing factor-2 (DDEF2), is a multi-domain protein composed of 1006 amino acids. Its molecular structure includes several distinct domains that contribute to its functional versatility. The N-terminal region features an α-helical structure with a coiled-coil motif, which is followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. This domain is involved in phosphoinositide binding, which is crucial for membrane association and signaling functions (Seuter2014The).

The protein also contains an ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf)-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, which is essential for its role in regulating GTPase activity. Additionally, ASAP2 includes an ankyrin homology region that provides structural stability and a proline-rich region that may facilitate interactions with other proteins. The C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain is involved in protein-protein interactions, further enhancing the protein's ability to participate in complex signaling pathways (Seuter2014The).

ASAP2 is localized in the Golgi apparatus and at the plasma membrane, where it co-localizes with protein tyrosine kinase 2-beta (Pyk2), indicating its involvement in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking (Seuter2014The). The protein's structure and domain composition enable it to modulate various cellular processes, including vesicle budding, phagocytosis, and cell migration.

## Function
The ASAP2 gene encodes a multi-domain protein involved in several critical cellular processes, including vesicular transport, cellular migration, and autophagy. This protein is localized in the Golgi apparatus and at the plasma membrane, where it co-localizes with protein tyrosine kinase 2-beta (Pyk2) (Seuter2014The). ASAP2 functions as an Arf-GAP, which regulates Arf-mediated vesicle budding when recruited to Golgi membranes, thereby modulating constitutive secretion. It also plays a role in phagocytosis via the Fcγ receptor and Arf6, and in cell migration through the organization of focal contacts (Seuter2014The).

ASAP2 is a primary target of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in human monocytes and macrophages, with its expression being more inducible in monocytes than in M2-type macrophages. The genomic region around the ASAP2 gene contains three vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding sites, which are involved in the regulation of ASAP2 expression in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 (Seuter2014The). The expression of ASAP2 is low in monocytes but increases significantly upon differentiation into macrophages, indicating its role in immune cell function (Seuter2014The).

## Clinical Significance
ASAP2 is implicated in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), due to its altered expression and interactions. In HCC, ASAP2 is upregulated, partly due to genomic variations such as increased DNA copy number and decreased methylation levels. This upregulation is associated with poor prognosis, shorter recurrence-free survival, and progression-free survival. ASAP2 promotes cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis, and enhances migration and invasion, contributing to metastasis. It disrupts the CIN85-c-MET interaction, preventing c-MET degradation and sustaining its signaling, which is crucial for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression (Ma2023ASAP2).

In PDAC, ASAP2 is identified as a novel driver gene, with its overexpression linked to genomic amplification. High ASAP2 mRNA expression correlates with lower overall survival and recurrence-free survival. It activates migration and proliferation, possibly through the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway. Niclosamide, a repositioned drug, can inhibit ASAP2 expression and attenuate tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Fujii2021The). These findings suggest that ASAP2 plays a significant role in cancer progression and could serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ASAP2, also known as ArfGAP with SH3 domain, ankyrin repeat, and PH domain 2, is involved in several protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, ASAP2 interacts with CIN85, a protein also known as SH3KBP1. This interaction disrupts the association between CIN85 and c-MET, preventing the lysosomal degradation of activated c-MET and sustaining c-MET signaling activation. This mechanism is significant for maintaining the malignant potential of HCC cells, as it promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Ma2023ASAP2).

ASAP2 also competes with c-MET to bind to CIN85 in a dose-dependent manner, effectively blocking c-MET degradation upon hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation. This interaction enhances the stability and prolonged activation of c-MET, which is essential for promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and recurrence in HCC (Ma2023ASAP2).

In addition to its interactions in HCC, ASAP2 has been identified as a binding partner of the 440-kD giant ankyrin-B (gAnkB), showing strong binding affinity with a dissociation constant (Kd) of approximately 68 nM (Li2024Arf). These interactions highlight ASAP2's role in regulating signaling pathways and cellular dynamics.
