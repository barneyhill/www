# LCN9

## Overview
Lipocalin 9 (LCN9) is a gene that encodes the protein lipocalin 9, which is a member of the lipocalin family. Lipocalins are a diverse group of small, secreted proteins known for their ability to bind and transport small hydrophobic molecules, such as lipids, steroids, and retinoids. The LCN9 gene is expressed in various tissues and is involved in several physiological processes, including immune response and cellular homeostasis. The protein lipocalin 9 plays a role in modulating inflammatory responses and may have implications in disease states characterized by inflammation and immune dysregulation (Qiu2020aarFDC).
