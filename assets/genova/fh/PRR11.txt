# PRR11

## Overview
PRR11 (proline rich 11) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, particularly during the late S phase and G2/M phase. The PRR11 protein is characterized by its proline-rich domain, which is crucial for its interactions with other cellular components. It plays a significant role in modulating cell cycle dynamics and is implicated in various cellular processes, including DNA synthesis and mitotic progression. The protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm and is known to interact with several key proteins, influencing cellular motility and chromatin organization. PRR11 has garnered attention in cancer research due to its overexpression in several malignancies, where it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Its involvement in critical signaling pathways and cellular interactions underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Ni2023PRR11; Lee2020Proline; Zhang2015PRR11).

## Function
PRR11 (proline rich 11) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, particularly during the late S phase and G2/M phase. In healthy human cells, PRR11 is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner, with high expression levels during the G2/M phase. It plays a critical role in modulating proper cell cycle progression, ensuring the transition from the late S phase to mitosis (Ji2013PRR11; Zhang2015PRR11).

The protein is primarily located in the cytoplasm, despite having a putative nuclear localization signal, and its expression oscillates during the cell cycle, accumulating in the late S phase and decreasing significantly in telophase (Zhang2015PRR11). PRR11 is essential for proper mitotic progression, as its depletion leads to mitotic defects such as multipolar spindles and multinuclear structures, although it does not appear to be a centrosome-associated protein (Zhang2015PRR11).

PRR11 also influences the expression of key enzymes and proteins involved in DNA synthesis and cell cycle regulation, such as ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) and cyclin A1 (CCNA1), which are important for S phase progression (Ji2013PRR11). These roles highlight PRR11's importance in maintaining normal cell cycle dynamics and cellular proliferation.

## Clinical Significance
PRR11 (proline rich 11) is implicated in various cancers, where its altered expression is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis. In breast cancer, PRR11 overexpression is linked to antiestrogen resistance and poor outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cases. It amplifies PI3K signaling, promoting estrogen-independent proliferation and endocrine resistance. PRR11 amplification is more common in metastatic breast cancer and is mutually exclusive with other resistance mechanisms, suggesting its role in PI3K pathway activation (Lee2020Proline).

In gastric cancer, PRR11 expression correlates with decreased survival rates, serving as an independent prognostic predictor. Knockdown of PRR11 affects molecular pathways, indicating its potential as an oncogene (Song2015PRR11). In pancreatic cancer, high PRR11 expression is associated with poor survival and aggressive features, influencing oncogenesis and cell cycle progression through the PI3K/AKT pathway (Olsson2021PRR11).

PRR11 is also overexpressed in bladder urothelial carcinoma, correlating with tumor staging and immune cell infiltration, impacting the tumor immune microenvironment and prognosis (Ni2023PRR11). These findings highlight PRR11's significance as a prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
PRR11 (proline rich 11) is involved in several critical interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cancer progression. One of its primary interactions is with the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, which is crucial for actin polymerization. PRR11 recruits the Arp2/3 complex, facilitating F-actin assembly and promoting cellular processes such as cell motility and chromatin reorganization in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells (Wei2022PRR11; Zhang2020Prolinerich). This interaction is essential for the formation of cellular structures like filopodia, which are important for cell movement (Wei2022PRR11).

PRR11 also interacts with nuclear lamins, affecting chromatin organization and nuclear lamina integrity. This interaction is mediated through its role in F-actin polymerization, which is dependent on the Arp2/3 complex (Zhang2020Prolinerich). Additionally, PRR11 is involved in transcriptional regulation by interacting with the E2F1 transcription factor, enhancing the expression of the PTTG1 gene, which is linked to cell proliferation in various cancers (Zhang2022PRR11). These interactions highlight PRR11's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and cancer progression.
