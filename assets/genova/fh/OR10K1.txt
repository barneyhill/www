# OR10K1

## Overview
The OR10K1 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 10 subfamily K member 1, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This protein is involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the olfactory system by initiating neuronal responses that lead to the perception of smell. As a transmembrane receptor, it spans the cell membrane and transduces extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins, which subsequently activate intracellular signaling pathways. The olfactory receptor family is one of the largest gene families in the human genome, highlighting the complexity and diversity of the olfactory system (Qiu2020aarFDC).
