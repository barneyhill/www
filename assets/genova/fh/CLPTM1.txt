# CLPTM1

## Overview
CLPTM1, or Cleft Lip and Palate Transmembrane Protein 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein known as CLPTM1 regulator of GABA type A receptor forward trafficking. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of GABA A receptor trafficking, playing a crucial role in modulating inhibitory synaptic transmission. By interacting with various subunits of GABA A receptors, CLPTM1 influences their localization within cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, thereby affecting their surface expression and synaptic strength (Ge2018Clptm1). The protein's ability to broadly associate with multiple GABA A receptor subunits, including both synaptic and extrasynaptic types, highlights its significance in the regulation of inhibitory neurotransmission (Ge2018Clptm1).

## Interactions
CLPTM1 interacts with GABA A receptors (GABA A Rs) and plays a significant role in modulating their function. It co-immunoprecipitates with various subunits of GABA A Rs, including g2, a1, a2, b2, and b3, indicating it may be a universal binding partner for different GABA A R subtypes (Ge2018Clptm1). This interaction is specific to GABA A Rs, as CLPTM1 does not bind to Glycine Receptors (GlyR), which are structurally similar (Ge2018Clptm1). CLPTM1 reduces the surface expression of GABA A Rs by increasing their localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex, thereby limiting their forward trafficking to the cell surface (Ge2018Clptm1). This results in a decrease in the surface-to-total ratio of GABA A Rs, affecting inhibitory synaptic strength (Ge2018Clptm1).

In hippocampal neurons, altering CLPTM1 levels affects GABAergic transmission but not glutamatergic transmission, acting as a negative regulator of inhibitory synaptic transmission by limiting the postsynaptic and extrasynaptic accumulation of GABA A Rs (Ge2018Clptm1). CLPTM1's broad association with many GABA A R subunits, including synaptic and extrasynaptic classes, distinguishes it from other proteins (Ge2018Clptm1).
