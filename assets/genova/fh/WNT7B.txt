# WNT7B

## Overview
WNT7B is a gene that encodes the protein Wnt family member 7B, which is part of the Wnt family of signaling molecules. This protein plays a pivotal role in various signaling pathways, particularly the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is crucial for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Wnt family member 7B is characterized as a signaling molecule that interacts with frizzled receptors and co-receptors to mediate its effects. It is notably involved in embryonic development, influencing the formation and integrity of organs such as the lungs, trachea, eyes, and kidneys. The protein's function is facilitated by post-translational modifications, which are essential for its stability and interaction with other cellular components. Alterations in WNT7B expression and function have been associated with various pathological conditions, including lung cancer, Dupuytren's contracture, and psoriasis, highlighting its clinical significance (Assarsson2019Narrowband; Wang2005Wnt7b; Bouasker2022Biallelic).

## Structure
The WNT7B protein is a member of the Wnt family, which plays a crucial role in signaling pathways involved in embryonic development and cell growth. The primary structure of WNT7B consists of a sequence of 349 amino acids, featuring N-terminal and C-terminal domains connected by a linker sequence (Bouasker2022Biallelic). The C-terminal domain is particularly important as it binds to Frizzled receptors, a function that is disrupted by certain genetic variants (Bouasker2022Biallelic).

In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, WNT proteins typically include conserved cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds, contributing to the protein's three-dimensional conformation. Although specific details about the secondary and tertiary structures of WNT7B are not provided in the context, these structural features are common among Wnt family proteins.

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and palmitoylation are essential for the function and secretion of WNT proteins, including WNT7B. These modifications help stabilize the protein and facilitate its interaction with receptors and other signaling molecules.

The WNT7B gene also has multiple isoforms, which are expressed in various tissues and play roles in different developmental processes (Bouasker2022Biallelic).

## Function
The WNT7B gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In healthy human cells, WNT7B interacts with frizzled receptors Fzd1 and Fzd10, and the co-receptor LRP5, to activate this pathway. This activation leads to the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), resulting in the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. The stabilized β-catenin then activates transcription factors of the LEF/TCF family, which regulate gene expression (Wang2005Wnt7b).

WNT7B is particularly important in lung development, where it is expressed in the airway epithelium and acts in a paracrine manner to regulate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) development. This signaling is crucial for maintaining pulmonary vascular smooth muscle integrity and proper lung morphogenesis (Shu2002Wnt7b; Wang2005Wnt7b). The absence of WNT7B leads to severe lung hypoplasia and defects in vascular smooth muscle integrity, resulting in pulmonary hemorrhage (Wang2005Wnt7b). Additionally, WNT7B is involved in the development of other organs, including the trachea, eyes, and kidneys, highlighting its broad role in embryonic development (Bouasker2022Biallelic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and methylation of the WNT7B gene have been implicated in various diseases. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), WNT7B expression is significantly higher compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is most pronounced in LUAD, where WNT7B shows the highest relative expression among the WNT gene family. In LUSC, WNT7B expression is also elevated, and its methylation level is significantly increased, suggesting a distinct pattern that may influence tumorigenesis and serve as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target (Wang2022Validation).

In Dupuytren's contracture, a chronic fibroproliferative condition, the WNT7B rs6519955 TT genotype is associated with a 3.5-fold increased risk of developing the disease. This suggests that WNT7B may act as a pro-fibrotic agent, contributing to the pathogenesis of the condition through its role in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway (Samulėnas2021Evaluation).

In psoriasis, WNT7B expression is significantly decreased in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin and healthy controls. This decrease is linked to the suppression of the canonical WNT pathway, which may affect keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Narrowband UVB treatment has been shown to increase WNT7B expression, indicating a potential therapeutic effect (Assarsson2019Narrowband).

## Interactions
WNT7B is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various signaling pathways. It binds specifically to frizzled (Fzd) receptors, including Fzd1 and Fzd10, and the co-receptor LRP5, to activate canonical Wnt signaling pathways. This interaction is crucial for processes such as lung development and vascular smooth muscle cell integrity (Wang2005Wnt7b). 

In the context of the central nervous system, WNT7B forms a complex with the proteins RECK and GPR124, which are essential receptor cofactors for WNT7B-specific signaling. This complex is involved in CNS angiogenesis and blood-brain barrier regulation, highlighting the specificity of WNT7B interactions with these cofactors (Cho2017Reck). 

WNT7B also participates in non-canonical signaling pathways. In pancreatic progenitor cells, it promotes proliferation through a protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated pathway, independent of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This involves interactions with PKCα and its substrate MARCKS, indicating a distinct signaling mechanism (Kimura2020Combined). 

These interactions underscore the multifaceted role of WNT7B in cellular signaling, influencing both canonical and non-canonical pathways across different tissues and developmental stages.
