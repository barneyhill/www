# ZNF106

## Overview
ZNF106 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 106, a large nucleolar matrix protein characterized by its involvement in RNA processing and gene expression regulation. The protein is distinguished by its multiple zinc finger motifs and WD40 repeats, which facilitate nucleic-acid binding and the formation of multi-protein complexes. ZNF106 is expressed ubiquitously and in a muscle-specific manner, with alternative splicing resulting in several isoforms. Functionally, zinc finger protein 106 is crucial for neuromuscular health, playing a significant role in RNA splicing and mitochondrial regulation. It is particularly important for the maintenance and survival of motor and sensory neurons, with deficiencies linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Joyce2015Deficiency; Celona2023Zfp106). The protein's interactions with RNA repeats and other ALS-associated proteins underscore its involvement in RNA metabolic pathways and its potential therapeutic relevance in neurodegenerative diseases (Celona2017Suppression).

## Structure
ZNF106, also known as zinc finger protein 106, is characterized by its complex molecular structure, which includes multiple domains and motifs. The protein contains two N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger motifs and two C-terminal CWCH2 zinc finger motifs, which are crucial for nucleic-acid binding and protein-protein interactions (Joyce2015Deficiency). Additionally, ZNF106 features seven WD40 repeats, which facilitate the formation of large multi-protein complexes (Joyce2015Deficiency). These WD40 domains are also involved in nucleolar targeting and protein interactions (Grasberger2005Subcellular).

ZNF106 is expressed from two distinct promoter regions, leading to ubiquitous and striated muscle-specific expression, and undergoes alternative splicing, resulting in four major isoforms (Grasberger2005Subcellular). The molecular weight of these isoforms is higher than predicted, suggesting post-translational modifications, although phosphatase treatment does not correct this discrepancy (Grasberger2005Subcellular). The protein is primarily localized in the nuclear matrix, specifically the nucleolus, with the region encompassing amino acids 833-1888 being crucial for nuclear matrix association (Grasberger2005Subcellular).

The C-terminal fragment of ZNF106, which includes the WD40 domains and two C-terminal zinc fingers, is sufficient for binding to GGGGCC repeats, indicating its role in RNA binding and processing (Celona2023Zfp106). This binding is significant for inhibiting RAN translation and RNA foci formation, which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Celona2023Zfp106).

## Function
ZNF106, a zinc finger protein, plays a crucial role in maintaining neuromuscular health by participating in RNA processing and gene expression regulation. In healthy human cells, ZNF106 is primarily localized in the nucleus, where it is involved in pre-mRNA processing. It associates with core splicing factors, such as RNA binding motif protein 39 (RBM39), and localizes to nuclear speckles near spliceosomes, indicating its role in RNA splicing (Anderson2016Severe).

ZNF106 is also implicated in the maintenance and survival of neurons, particularly motor and sensory neurons. Its deficiency in model organisms leads to neurodegeneration, characterized by motor neuron loss and muscle atrophy, suggesting its importance in neuronal integrity and function (Joyce2015Deficiency).

Additionally, ZNF106 is involved in mitochondrial regulation, as its deficiency is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including the inhibition of Complex I and activation of Complex II in motor neurons. This suggests a potential link between ZNF106 and mitochondrial function, which is crucial for energy metabolism and cellular homeostasis (Joyce2015Deficiency). Overall, ZNF106 is essential for proper neuromuscular signaling and cellular energy regulation.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ZNF106 gene have been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders. ZNF106, known as Zfp106 in mice, is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The gene is involved in RNA metabolism, including pre-rRNA processing and splicing, and binds to G-quadruplex RNAs formed by GGGGCC repeats in the C9orf72 gene, which are linked to ALS and FTD. ZNF106 inhibits the formation of RNA foci and reduces repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation, suggesting its role in mitigating the cytotoxic effects of these repeats (Celona2023Zfp106).

In mouse models, the absence of Zfp106 leads to severe neurodegenerative phenotypes, including muscle wasting, loss of muscle strength, and motor neuron degeneration, resembling ALS. Restoring Zfp106 expression in motor neurons can suppress these phenotypes, highlighting its potential therapeutic relevance (Anderson2016Severe; Celona2017Suppression). The gene's location on chromosome 15 is also linked to juvenile recessive ALS and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, suggesting that mutations in ZNF106 might contribute to these conditions (Anderson2016Severe). These findings underscore the critical role of ZNF106 in maintaining neuromuscular integrity and its potential involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.

## Interactions
ZNF106, also known as zinc finger protein 106, is involved in various protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is a large nucleolar matrix protein that interacts with several other proteins, including TSPYL and TSG118. TSG118 is a nucleolar protein that shares structural features with nucleostemin, a protein involved in stem cell self-renewal, and is expressed in stem cells and certain cancer cell lines. The interaction between ZNF106 and TSG118 suggests a role in nucleolar recruitment and stem cell populations (Grasberger2005Subcellular).

ZNF106 also interacts with the core splicing factor RNA binding motif protein 39 (RBM39), localizing to nuclear speckles near spliceosomes. This interaction is crucial for pre-mRNA processing, and its absence leads to altered splicing of certain genes, such as the Nogo gene, which affects nerve regeneration (Anderson2016Severe).

In the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ZNF106 interacts with GGGGCC RNA repeats associated with the C9orf72 gene, as well as other ALS-associated proteins like TDP-43 and FUS. These interactions suggest ZNF106's involvement in RNA metabolic pathways linked to neurodegeneration (Celona2017Suppression).
