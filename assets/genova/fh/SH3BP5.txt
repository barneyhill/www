# SH3BP5

## Overview
SH3BP5 is a gene that encodes the SH3 domain binding protein 5, also known as Sab, which is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular signaling pathways. The protein is characterized by its V-shaped structure composed of coiled coils, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins and its function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab11, a small GTPase involved in intracellular trafficking (GotoIto2019Structural; Jenkins2018Structural). SH3BP5 plays a critical role in the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway, particularly in mitochondrial-dependent cell death processes, by acting as a JNK-interacting protein (WILTSHIRE2002A; Win2024Mitochondrial). Additionally, SH3BP5 interacts with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), serving as a negative regulator of its activity (Yamadori1999Bruton’s). The gene's expression is implicated in various diseases, including adrenocortical carcinoma and mucopolysaccharidoses, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker and its involvement in pathological conditions (Alshabi2019Identification; Gaffke2020Changes).

## Structure
The SH3BP5 protein is characterized by a V-shaped structure composed of two coiled coils, formed by four α-helices (α1-α4) (GotoIto2019Structural; Jenkins2018Structural). The coiled coil formed by α1 and α4 is responsible for binding to Rab11a and exhibits guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity (GotoIto2019Structural). The α2 and α3 helices form another coiled coil, which may have functions involving interactions with other proteins or membrane lipids (GotoIto2019Structural).

The central helical region of SH3BP5, selected for crystallography, is crucial for its structural integrity and function. Specific mutations, such as the R260A/R261A/R262A triple mutation, were introduced to reduce degradation and improve solubility (GotoIto2019Structural). The protein's structure is maintained by staggered hydrophobic interactions in the hinge region, involving residues like Leu84, Leu87, Val88, Val95, Pro210, Tyr211, and Phe212 (GotoIto2019Structural).

SH3BP5 also contains a putative SH3-binding site for BTK, located at the turn from helix α3 to α4, although this region does not resemble previously identified SH3-binding sites (Jenkins2018Structural). The protein's structure shares homology with the archaeal chaperone prefoldin, suggesting an evolutionary path to stabilizing the partially unfolded Rab11 nucleotide-free state (Jenkins2018Structural).

## Function
SH3BP5, also known as Sab, is a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly through its interactions with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Rab11. In healthy human cells, SH3BP5 is involved in the JNK signaling pathway, where it acts as a JNK-interacting protein associated with mitochondria. It binds to JNK through a kinase interaction motif (KIM) and serves as a substrate for JNK phosphorylation. This interaction is crucial for the translocation of activated JNK to mitochondria, which is a key step in regulating mitochondrial-dependent cell death processes, including apoptosis and mitochondrial permeability transition-driven necrosis (WILTSHIRE2002A; Win2024Mitochondrial).

SH3BP5 also functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab11, a small GTPase involved in intracellular trafficking. It facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab11, thereby activating it. This activation is essential for Rab11's role in vesicular trafficking and receptor recycling, impacting processes such as membrane trafficking and receptor recycling (Jenkins2018Structural). SH3BP5's activity is highly selective for Rab11, and its interaction with Rab11 involves significant conformational changes that are crucial for nucleotide exchange (Jenkins2018Structural).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SH3BP5 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), high mRNA expression of SH3BP5 is associated with worse overall survival, indicating its potential role as a prognostic marker in this cancer type (Alshabi2019Identification). Additionally, SH3BP5 expression is significantly altered in various types of mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), a group of lysosomal storage diseases. The gene is up-regulated in all examined MPS types and subtypes, suggesting a role in the cellular dysfunctions and symptoms associated with these conditions, including neurodegeneration (Gaffke2020Changes).

In the context of mitochondrial function, SH3BP5, also known as SAB, is crucial for the regulation of cell death through its interaction with Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). This interaction is essential for mitochondrial-dependent cell death mechanisms, such as apoptosis and necrosis. Dysregulation of this pathway could be relevant to conditions involving oxidative stress and cell death, such as liver injury and hepatotoxicity (Win2024Mitochondrial). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SH3BP5 in various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
SH3BP5, also known as Sab, is a protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a role in various signaling pathways. It is known to bind to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) through its kinase interaction motifs (KIMs), serving as both a binding partner and a substrate for JNK. This interaction is crucial for the phosphorylation of Sab by JNK, and the N-terminal KIM is essential for this binding (WILTSHIRE2002A). Sab also interacts with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) by binding to its Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, acting as a negative regulator of Btk activity. This interaction inhibits Btk's auto- and transphosphorylation, affecting downstream signaling events in B cells (Yamadori1999Bruton’s; Ortutay2008Phylogeny).

In addition to these interactions, SH3BP5 has been shown to associate with Rab11a, a small GTPase, facilitating guanine nucleotide exchange. This interaction involves specific regions of Rab11a, including the switch regions and P loop, and is crucial for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of SH3BP5 (GotoIto2019Structural). SH3BP5 primarily localizes to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, indicating its role in endosomal trafficking (GotoIto2019Structural).
