# ADAM8

## Overview
ADAM8 is a gene that encodes the ADAM metallopeptidase domain 8 protein, a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their involvement in proteolysis, cell adhesion, and signaling processes. The ADAM8 protein is a transmembrane metalloprotease with a complex modular structure, including domains such as a metalloprotease domain, disintegrin domain, and a transmembrane domain, among others (Stone1999Structure–Function; Kelly2004Metalloprotease‐disintegrin). It plays significant roles in various physiological processes, including cell migration, neural development, and immune responses. ADAM8 is expressed in multiple tissues, including the placenta and nervous system, where it facilitates cell-matrix interactions and ectodomain shedding of specific substrates (Le2018ADAM8; Naus2004Ectodomain). Clinically, ADAM8 is implicated in several diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Schick2019Elevated; Conrad2019ADAM8).

## Structure
ADAM8 is a transmembrane protein that belongs to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, characterized by a modular domain structure. The full-length ADAM8 protein includes a signal peptide, pro-domain, metalloprotease domain, disintegrin domain, cysteine-rich domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Stone1999Structure–Function; Kelly2004Metalloprotease‐disintegrin). The metalloprotease domain contains a catalytic zinc ion coordinated by a canonical histidine motif (HEX-XHXXGXXHD), essential for its enzymatic activity (Hall2012Structure).

The secondary structure of ADAM8 features a central five-stranded β-sheet, flanked by several α-helices, forming a characteristic fold similar to other metalloproteinases (Hall2012Structure). The protein's tertiary structure is stabilized by three disulfide bridges, contributing to its stability and function (Hall2012Structure).

ADAM8 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which may influence its activity and interactions (Seegar2019Domain). Alternative splicing of ADAM8 can result in different isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not extensively documented in the provided context (Fourie2003Catalytic). The protein is expressed as a monomer with a high degree of purity (Hall2012Structure).

## Function
ADAM8 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 8) is a member of the ADAM family of proteins, which are involved in cell adhesion, proteolysis, and signaling. In healthy human cells, ADAM8 plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and migration, particularly in trophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface. It enhances cell attachment to the fibronectin matrix through a β1 integrin-mediated mechanism, which is essential for trophoblast cell migration (Le2018ADAM8). ADAM8 is expressed in various trophoblast subtypes within the human placenta, especially in extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) and placental anchoring columns, where it promotes cell migration by facilitating cell-matrix attachment (Le2018ADAM8).

ADAM8 is also involved in the nervous system, where it participates in the ectodomain shedding of the neural recognition molecule CHL1. This process promotes neurite outgrowth and suppresses neuronal cell death, indicating a role in neuronal survival and development (Naus2004Ectodomain). The protein is active in the central nervous system, including neurons and oligodendrocytes, and is involved in the processing of CHL1, which is crucial for its physiological function (Naus2004Ectodomain). ADAM8's activity is not inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), highlighting its unique regulatory mechanism (Amour2002The).

## Clinical Significance
ADAM8 is implicated in various diseases due to its altered expression and interactions. In cancer, ADAM8 is overexpressed in several types, including glioblastoma, lung, breast, pancreatic, and colorectal cancers, where it is associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance. In glioblastoma, ADAM8 contributes to chemoresistance against temozolomide by recruiting tumor-associated macrophages through the HB-EGF/EGFR signaling pathway, enhancing tumor growth and reducing survival (Liu2022The; Conrad2019ADAM8). In lung cancer, ADAM8 overexpression is linked to advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis, with specific isoforms increasing invasiveness and contributing to metastatic spread (Conrad2019ADAM8). 

In vascular diseases, elevated ADAM8 expression is associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, where it correlates with increased proinflammatory markers and is found in endothelial cells and leukocytes in affected regions (Schick2019Elevated). 

ADAM8 also plays a role in intervertebral disc degeneration, where its enzymatic activity affects collagen fiber assembly and inflammatory processes, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target to slow degeneration (Zhang2021Elevated). 

These findings highlight ADAM8's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target across various pathological conditions.

## Interactions
ADAM8 is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in various biological processes. It physically associates with the membrane-bound form of CD23, the low affinity IgE receptor, facilitating its ectodomain shedding. This interaction is crucial as it leads to the release of soluble CD23, which can up-regulate IgE production and inflammatory cytokines (Fourie2003Catalytic). Immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated a physical association between ADAM8 and CD23, indicating that ADAM8 may undergo autocatalytic activation in association with its substrate, leading to ectodomain cleavage of CD23 (Fourie2003Catalytic).

ADAM8 also interacts with the neural recognition molecule CHL1, cleaving its extracellular domain. This interaction promotes neurite outgrowth and reduces neuronal cell death, highlighting ADAM8's role in neural development and survival (Naus2004Ectodomain). The cleavage of CHL1 by ADAM8 is specific, as neither ADAM10 nor ADAM17 can cleave CHL1, indicating a defined substrate-protease relationship (Naus2004Ectodomain).

ADAM8 contains a disintegrin domain that allows it to bind integrins, such as the β1-integrin subunit, activating integrin signaling transduction pathways. This interaction involves focal adhesion kinase (FAK), extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and protein kinase B (AKT/PKB) (Mierke2023The).
