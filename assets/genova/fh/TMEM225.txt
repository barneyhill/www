# TMEM225

## Overview
TMEM225 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 225, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions remain to be fully elucidated. TMEM225 has garnered attention due to its differential expression in certain pathological conditions, such as cancer and reproductive disorders. In particular, the protein is overexpressed in bladder cancer, suggesting a potential role in tumor progression and its utility as a biomarker for this malignancy (Yazarlou2018Expression). Additionally, TMEM225 is implicated in male infertility, where its expression levels vary in conditions like nonobstructive azoospermia and late maturation arrest, indicating its involvement in spermatogenesis (Malcher2013Potential; Zheng2018Identification). These associations highlight the importance of TMEM225 in both oncological and reproductive health contexts, making it a subject of ongoing research.

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
TMEM225 has been implicated in several clinical conditions due to its altered expression levels. In bladder cancer, TMEM225 is overexpressed in urinary cell pellets of patients compared to those with nonmalignant conditions, with a significant fold change of 19.37 and a p-value of 0.01, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for this type of cancer (Yazarlou2018Expression). Its expression is notably higher in high-grade tumors compared to low-grade ones, indicating a possible role in tumor progression (Yazarlou2018Expression). This overexpression in aggressive tumor types highlights TMEM225's potential diagnostic value in bladder cancer (Yazarlou2018Expression).

In the context of male infertility, TMEM225 has been identified as a differentially expressed gene in nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). It is downregulated in azoospermia patients, suggesting its involvement in spermatogenesis failure (Zheng2018Identification). Conversely, TMEM225 is upregulated in men with late maturation arrest, indicating its potential as a biomarker for assessing spermatogenic impairment (Malcher2013Potential). These findings suggest that TMEM225 may play a role in both cancer progression and reproductive health, warranting further investigation into its clinical significance.
