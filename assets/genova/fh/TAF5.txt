# TAF5

## Overview
TAF5 is a gene that encodes the protein TATA-box binding protein associated factor 5, which is a crucial component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex. This protein is integral to the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, playing a significant role in the assembly and structural integrity of the TFIID complex (Bernardini2023Hierarchical). TAF5 is characterized by a WD40 repeat domain, which forms a seven-blade β propeller structure, facilitating interactions with other proteins and contributing to the assembly of transcription regulatory complexes such as TFIID and SAGA (Helmlinger2021What). In addition to its structural role, TAF5 is involved in maintaining pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells and is part of a non-canonical TAF complex that regulates active promoters (Maston2012Noncanonical). The protein's interactions within these complexes underscore its importance in transcriptional regulation and cellular function.

## Structure


## Function
TAF5 is a critical component of the transcription factor IID (TFIID) complex, which plays a pivotal role in the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. In healthy human cells, TAF5 is involved in the assembly and structural integrity of the TFIID complex, contributing to the formation of stable intermediates essential for transcription initiation (Bernardini2023Hierarchical). TAF5 interacts with TAF6, forming a heterodimer that is crucial for the structural integrity of the SAGA complex, another transcription regulatory complex (Helmlinger2021What). 

TAF5 contains a WD40 repeat domain that forms a seven-blade β propeller, which is central to the core module's structure and interacts with other histone fold pairs, facilitating the assembly of the TFIID complex (Helmlinger2021What). This domain also interacts with the chaperonin TRiC/CCT in the cytoplasm, suggesting a role in the quality control and biogenesis of chromatin regulatory complexes (Helmlinger2021What).

In human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), TAF5 is essential for maintaining pluripotency and self-renewal capabilities. It is part of a non-canonical TAF complex that regulates active promoters, and its presence is necessary for the transcriptional activity of certain genes (Maston2012Noncanonical).

## Interactions
TAF5 is a key component of the TFIID complex, which is essential for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. Within the TFIID complex, TAF5 interacts with several other TAFs, including TAF1, TAF4, TAF6, TAF9, TAF11, and TAF12, indicating its central role in the structural organization of the complex (Yatherajam2003Proteinprotein). TAF5 is part of the core-TFIID structure, which includes two copies of TAF5, TAF4/TAF12, and TAF6/TAF9, forming the basis of lobes A and B of TFIID (Hisler2023RNA). 

TAF5 also plays a role in the SAGA complex, where it interacts with TAF5L and histone-fold domain pairs to form the core structure. In SAGA, TAF5's interactions prevent its homodimerization, a feature observed in TFIID (Timmers2021SAGA). The WD40 domain of TAF5 binds to an octamer of histone-fold domain subunits, forming a disc-shaped spiral, which is crucial for the structural integrity of the SAGA complex (Timmers2021SAGA).

TAF5's interactions are not limited to stable complexes; it also participates in co-translational interactions, particularly with TAF6, during the hierarchical assembly of TFIID (Bernardini2023Hierarchical). These interactions are essential for the assembly and stabilization of the TFIID complex, facilitating the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and the initiation of transcription (Hisler2023RNA).
