# MYBPC1

## Overview
The MYBPC1 gene encodes the slow skeletal muscle isoform of myosin binding protein-C (sMyBP-C), a crucial component of the sarcomeric structure in muscle cells. This protein is categorized as a structural and regulatory protein, playing a significant role in muscle contraction by stabilizing thick filaments and modulating actomyosin interactions. sMyBP-C is primarily expressed in slow-twitch skeletal muscles and is involved in the regulation of muscle contraction dynamics through its interactions with myosin and actin filaments. The protein's function is further modulated by phosphorylation, which affects its binding affinities and, consequently, muscle contraction efficiency. Mutations in MYBPC1 have been linked to various muscle disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining normal muscle function (Geist2016MYBPC1; Ackermann2013Myosin; Stavusis2019Novel).

## Structure
The MYBPC1 gene encodes the slow skeletal isoform of Myosin Binding Protein-C (sMyBP-C), which is a member of the MyBP-C family characterized by a modular structure. This protein consists of seven immunoglobulin (Ig) C2 motifs and three fibronectin type III (Fn-III) domains, arranged from the NH2-terminus to the COOH-terminus as C1-C10 (Geist2016MYBPC1; Ackermann2013Myosin). The NH2-terminal region includes a Proline/Alanine-rich motif and a MyBP-C specific M-motif (Geist2016MYBPC1). The COOH-terminal domain, particularly the last Ig C2 motif, is crucial for high-affinity binding to myosin (Okagaki1993The).

MYBPC1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with molecular weights ranging from 126 to 132 kDa. These isoforms are co-expressed in varying amounts in both slow and fast-twitch skeletal muscles (McNamara2018Skeletal; Ackermann2013Myosin). Phosphorylation is a significant post-translational modification, with specific sites such as Ser-59, Ser-62, Thr-84, and Ser-204 being substrates for kinases like PKA and PKC, which modulate the protein's function under different physiological conditions (Geist2016MYBPC1). The interactions at the NH2-terminus are dynamic and regulated via phosphorylation, affecting the protein's binding to myosin and actin (Geist2016MYBPC1).

## Function
The MYBPC1 gene encodes the slow skeletal muscle isoform of myosin binding protein-C (sMyBP-C), which plays a crucial role in muscle contraction by stabilizing thick filaments and regulating actomyosin interactions. This protein is primarily expressed in slow-twitch skeletal muscles and is located in the C-zone of the sarcomeric A-band, where it interacts with both thick and thin filaments to modulate the cycling of actomyosin crossbridges (Geist2016MYBPC1; Shashi2019Heterozygous).

sMyBP-C acts as an adaptor, connecting myosin, an ATP consumer, with muscle-type creatine kinase, an ATP regenerator, to facilitate efficient energy metabolism and homeostasis in muscle cells (Markus2012Autosomal). The protein's NH2-terminal domains bind to myosin subfragment 2, while the COOH-terminal domain binds to light meromyosin, with interactions enhanced by titin binding. These interactions are dynamic and regulated by phosphorylation, which affects contraction rates by altering binding affinities (Geist2016MYBPC1).

The phosphorylation of sMyBP-C, primarily occurring in the Pro/Ala-rich motif and to a lesser extent in the M-motif, is mediated by PKA and PKC. This post-translational modification plays a role in modulating the structural and regulatory activities of sMyBP-C, influencing muscle contraction efficiency and force generation (Geist2016MYBPC1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MYBPC1 gene are associated with several muscle-related disorders. Autosomal recessive mutations, such as the nonsense mutation R318Stop, lead to Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome type 4 (LCCS4), a severe neonatal lethal form of arthrogryposis myopathy. This mutation results in the loss of the sMyBP-C protein, as heterozygous carriers show no phenotypic abnormalities (Markus2012Autosomal; Geist2016MYBPC1). 

Autosomal dominant missense mutations in MYBPC1, such as P319L and E359K, are linked to Distal Arthrogryposis type 2 (DA-2), which affects muscle function by potentially altering binding to myosin and actin (Geist2016MYBPC1). Other dominant mutations, like W236R and Y856H, are associated with Distal Arthrogryposis type 1 (DA-1), characterized by contractures in the hands and feet (Ackermann2013Loss; Geist2016MYBPC1).

Novel mutations, such as E248K and Y247H, have been identified in families with mild skeletal myopathy and myogenic tremor. These mutations increase the binding affinity of the mutant sMyBP-C protein to myosin, disrupting normal muscle function and contributing to tremor genesis (Stavusis2019Novel). These findings highlight the diverse clinical manifestations resulting from MYBPC1 mutations, ranging from severe congenital syndromes to milder myopathies with tremor.

## Interactions
MYBPC1, encoding the slow skeletal muscle myosin-binding protein-C (sMyBP-C), participates in several critical protein interactions that influence muscle function. It interacts with muscle-type creatine kinase (MM-CK) and myosin, forming a complex that is essential for efficient energy metabolism in muscle cells. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal domains of MYBPC1, which serve as binding sites for both MM-CK and myosin, facilitating the recruitment of MM-CK to myosin and enhancing ATP regeneration at the myofibrillar regions (Chen2011Slow).

MYBPC1 also interacts with actin and myosin subfragment-2 (S2), modulating actomyosin cross-bridge formation. The NH2-terminal domains, specifically the C1-M-C2 region, bind to myosin S2, while the COOH-terminal C10 domain binds to light meromyosin (LMM) (Geist2016MYBPC1). These interactions are dynamic and regulated through phosphorylation, which can alter the binding affinity and influence muscle contraction (Ackermann2013Myosin).

Mutations in MYBPC1, such as p.E248K and p.Y247H, have been shown to increase binding to myosin, potentially affecting cross-bridge kinetics and leading to clinical symptoms like myogenic tremor and mild myopathy (Stavusis2019Novel).
