# VCAM1

## Overview
VCAM1, or vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein, also referred to as VCAM-1, plays a pivotal role in mediating cell adhesion and signal transduction, particularly in the context of immune and inflammatory responses. Expressed primarily on endothelial cells, VCAM-1 is upregulated in response to inflammatory cytokines, facilitating the adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium. This interaction is crucial for immune surveillance and the inflammatory response, as it allows immune cells to exit the bloodstream and enter tissues where they are needed (Neish1992Functional; Osborn1989Direct). Additionally, VCAM-1 is involved in vascular development and the retention of hematopoietic progenitor cells within the bone marrow, underscoring its importance in both vascular biology and hematopoiesis (Ulyanova2005VCAM1; GarmySusini2005Integrin). The protein's structure, characterized by multiple immunoglobulin-like domains, enables its interaction with integrins such as VLA-4, further highlighting its role in cell adhesion and signaling pathways (Osborn1992Activated; Cybulsky1991Gene).

## Structure
The VCAM1 gene encodes the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, a transmembrane protein that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The primary structure of VCAM-1 includes multiple immunoglobulin-like domains, with the predominant form, VCAM-7D, containing seven such domains (Osborn1992Activated; Cybulsky1991Gene). Alternative splicing of the VCAM1 gene results in isoforms with either six or seven domains, with the six-domain form, VCAM-6D, lacking the fourth domain (Osborn1992Activated; Cybulsky1991Gene).

The secondary structure of VCAM-1 features beta-sheets typical of immunoglobulin folds. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains into a compact form, with domain 1 being crucial for integrin binding due to the presence of a functionally important C-D loop containing Asp-40 (Wang1995The). The quaternary structure of VCAM-1 includes the potential for homodimer formation, which may enhance its binding capabilities (Osborn1994Arrangement).

Post-translational modifications of VCAM-1 include glycosylation, which is common in cell surface proteins and may affect its adhesion properties (Pirozzi1994Murine). The structural arrangement and specific domains of VCAM-1 are critical for its interaction with the integrin VLA-4, playing a significant role in leukocyte adhesion and migration (Osborn1994Arrangement; Vonderheide1994Residues).

## Function
VCAM1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) is a critical protein involved in mediating cell adhesion and signal transduction processes in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed on the surface of endothelial cells in response to inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). VCAM1 facilitates the adhesion of leukocytes, particularly lymphocytes and monocytes, to the endothelium, playing a significant role in their recruitment to sites of inflammation (Neish1992Functional; Osborn1989Direct).

The interaction between VCAM1 and its ligand, the integrin VLA-4 (very late antigen-4), is crucial for the adhesion and migration of leukocytes across the endothelial barrier. This process is essential for immune surveillance and the inflammatory response, as it allows immune cells to exit the bloodstream and enter tissues where they are needed (Elices1990VCAM1).

VCAM1 is also involved in the development and maturation of blood vessels, as it mediates adhesion between endothelial cells and mural cells, which is necessary for blood vessel formation and stability (GarmySusini2005Integrin). Additionally, VCAM1 plays a role in the retention of hematopoietic progenitor cells within the bone marrow, contributing to the regulation of hematopoiesis (Ulyanova2005VCAM1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the VCAM1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In atherosclerosis, VCAM1 plays a significant role in the early stages of lesion formation by mediating the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium, which is a critical step in the development of atherosclerotic plaques (Cybulsky2001A). Variants in the VCAM1 gene, such as missense mutations, can increase monocyte adhesion, potentially exacerbating inflammatory conditions like atherosclerosis (Schmitz2013Increased).

VCAM1 is also implicated in heart failure, where its expression correlates with immune cell infiltration in the myocardium. Elevated VCAM1 expression is linked to increased risk of heart failure through pathways involving immune cell infiltration and inflammation (Wang2021VCAM1). In sickle cell disease, VCAM1 variants may modify the risk of symptomatic stroke, suggesting a role in the disease's pathogenesis (VI2002Variants).

In cancer, VCAM1 expression is associated with tumorigenicity and metastasis. It facilitates the recruitment and retention of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment, which is crucial for metastasis (Schlesinger2014Vascular). These findings highlight the clinical significance of VCAM1 in various inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, as well as in cancer progression.

## Interactions
VCAM1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cell adhesion and signaling. It serves as a ligand for the integrin VLA-4, facilitating leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of monocytes to inflammatory sites and is distinct from the fibronectin binding site on VLA-4 (Elices1990VCAM1).

VCAM1 also interacts with ERM proteins, specifically moesin and ezrin, in endothelial cells. These interactions occur at the apical surface of activated endothelial cells, where VCAM1 colocalizes with these proteins in microspikes and microvilli. The cytoplasmic tail of VCAM1 can directly bind to the active NH2-terminal domain of moesin or ezrin, suggesting a role in the redistribution of VCAM1 during leukocyte adhesion (Barreiro2002Dynamic).

In endothelial cells, VCAM1 cross-linking activates Rac, a small GTPase, leading to the formation of stress fibers and intercellular gaps. This process involves the production of reactive oxygen species and the activation of p38 MAPK, which are essential for modulating cell-cell adhesion and facilitating leukocyte transmigration (van2003VCAM1mediated).
