# TMEM143

## Overview
TMEM143 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 143, which is a member of the transmembrane protein family. These proteins are characterized by their ability to span the lipid bilayer of cell membranes, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes, including signaling, transport, and maintaining cellular structure. The specific functions of transmembrane protein 143 remain under investigation, but it is believed to be involved in cellular communication and may have implications in certain signaling pathways. Understanding the role of TMEM143 and its encoded protein is essential for elucidating its potential impact on human health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
