# MFAP3

## Overview
Microfibril-associated protein 3 (MFAP3) is a gene that encodes a unique protein component of the extracellular matrix, specifically associated with microfibrils. The MFAP3 protein is integral to the structural integrity and function of microfibrils, particularly within ocular zonules, where it contributes to microfibril assembly and stability (Abrams1995Molecular). Unlike many other proteins, MFAP3 does not share homology with known protein families, underscoring its distinct role in the extracellular matrix (Abrams1995Molecular). The protein is characterized by its acidic nature and potential sites for O-linked glycosylation, which may influence its interactions and stability within the matrix (Abrams1995Molecular).

## Structure
The MFAP3 protein is composed of 362 amino acids and is encoded by a gene with a simple structure consisting of two translated exons (Abrams1995Molecular). The protein has a predicted molecular weight of approximately 40,165 Da and features a hydrophobic amino terminal sequence, indicative of a signal sequence (Abrams1995Molecular). It is characterized as an acidic protein with a predicted isoelectric point of 4.71 and is rich in serine residues, which may serve as sites for O-linked carbohydrate chains (Abrams1995Molecular).

The MFAP3 protein does not share homology with any other known proteins, highlighting its unique structure within the extracellular matrix (Abrams1995Molecular). Immunoelectron microscopy has confirmed that MFAP3 is a component of microfibrils, particularly in ocular zonules, suggesting its role in microfibril assembly and stability (Abrams1995Molecular). The protein's specific domains or prominent folds have not been detailed in the available literature, and there is no information on its tertiary or quaternary structures. Additionally, no splice variant isoforms or post-translational modifications beyond potential O-linked glycosylation have been reported.
