# CD5

## Overview
CD5 is a gene that encodes the CD5 protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily. The CD5 protein is primarily expressed on the surface of T cells and a subset of B cells, where it functions as a co-receptor involved in the modulation of immune responses. It plays a critical role in fine-tuning T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, acting predominantly as a negative regulator to maintain immune tolerance and prevent autoimmunity (Dennehy1998Thymocyte; PerezVillar1999CD5). Structurally, CD5 features an extracellular region with three SRCR domains and a cytoplasmic domain containing several conserved motifs, including immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating and inhibitory motifs (ITAM and ITIM-like sequences), which are essential for its role in signal transduction (PerezVillar1999CD5; Soldevila2011The). The gene's expression and the protein's function are implicated in various clinical contexts, including autoimmune diseases and cancer, highlighting its significance in both normal immune regulation and pathological conditions (He2023CD5; CasadóLlombart2021Contribution).

## Structure
The CD5 protein is a 67-kDa monomeric type I transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) superfamily. Its extracellular region comprises three type B SRCR domains, each containing eight cysteines, which are crucial for maintaining the protein's structure (CarneroMontoro2011Evolutionary; Soldevila2011The). The cytoplasmic domain of CD5 is large and contains several conserved motifs involved in signal transduction, including tyrosine residues at positions 378, 429, 441, and 463. These residues are part of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating and inhibitory motifs (ITAM and ITIM-like sequences), which play roles in the regulation of T-cell receptor signaling (PerezVillar1999CD5).

CD5 undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is important for its function and interaction with other molecules. The glycosylation status can affect the binding of antibodies and the protein's structural configuration (Pospisil2009Characterization). CD5 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may influence its cellular localization and function (Soldevila2011The). The protein's structure allows it to modulate antigen receptor signaling in T-cells and B-cells, impacting immune responses (BurgueñoBucio2019The).

## Function
CD5 is a surface glycoprotein expressed on T cells and a subset of B cells, playing a crucial role in modulating immune responses. It acts as a co-receptor that fine-tunes T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, primarily functioning as a negative regulator to maintain immune tolerance and prevent autoimmunity (Dennehy1998Thymocyte; PerezVillar1999CD5). CD5 is involved in the regulation of cell death and survival, particularly in T cells, by modulating signaling pathways that influence the threshold of immune responses (BurgueñoBucio2019The; Soldevila2011The).

The protein is part of the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) family and is associated with phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity, specifically interacting with SHP-1, which is crucial for the down-regulation of TCR-CD3 signaling (PerezVillar1999CD5). CD5's cytoplasmic domain contains tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated following TCR stimulation, contributing to its regulatory functions (Dennehy1998Thymocyte). It also interacts with ubiquitin ligases CBL and CBLB, facilitating the ubiquitination of signaling proteins, which further modulates TCR signaling (Voisinne2018CD5).

In addition to its role in T cells, CD5 is expressed in B-1a cells, where it influences B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and contributes to the survival and homeostasis of these cells (Soldevila2011The). CD5's expression levels are regulated during T-cell activation, with alternative polyadenylation and miRNA interactions influencing its mRNA stability and protein expression (Domingues2016CD5).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD5 gene are associated with various autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CD5, such as rs595158, have been linked to increased susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (CasadóLlombart2021Contribution). In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), specific alleles like rs2241002 C (Pro224) and rs2229177 C (Ala471) are associated with lupus nephritis, a severe disease manifestation (CasadóLlombart2021Contribution). These genetic variations may influence the immunomodulatory properties of CD5, affecting disease progression and patient outcomes.

In cancer, CD5 expression levels correlate with prognosis. For instance, higher CD5 expression on dendritic cells (DCs) is linked to better outcomes in melanoma and lung cancer, as it enhances antitumor T cell immunity and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy (He2023CD5). Conversely, the absence of CD5+ DCs in melanoma patients suggests a regulatory role of the tumor microenvironment (He2023CD5).

CD5 also plays a role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where the ancestral Ala471 allele is associated with higher progression-free survival in less aggressive CLL subgroups (CasadóLlombart2021Contribution). These findings underscore the clinical significance of CD5 in immune-related disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
CD5 is a type-I transmembrane glycoprotein that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It contains an extracellular region with three scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains and a cytoplasmic tail with multiple phosphorylation sites. Upon TCR stimulation, CD5 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, which are regulated by Src kinases. These phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for effectors such as RasGAP and PI3K (Voisinne2018CD5).

CD5 forms a signaling complex with adapter proteins like c-CBL, CIN85, and CRKL, linking it to both positive regulators such as PI3K and negative regulators like UBASH3A and SHIP1. The phosphorylation of tyrosine 429 on CD5 is crucial for the recruitment of c-CBL, which coordinates the signaling complex (Blaize2020CD5). CD5 also interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and pp120 in thymocytes, with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase showing selective binding affinity to CD5 (Dennehy1997Thymocyte).

CD5 is associated with the TCR/CD3 complex, as evidenced by co-precipitation experiments, and can augment CD3-mediated signaling pathways (Osman1992Evidence). It also interacts with Fyn kinase, where CD5 stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of Fyn, modulating T cell responses (Bamberger2011A).
