# CYLC2

## Overview
CYLC2 is a gene that encodes the protein cylicin 2, which is a testis-specific structural protein crucial for the development and function of sperm cells. Cylicin 2 is categorized as a component of the sperm calyx, a part of the perinuclear theca, and plays a significant role in the structural organization of sperm, particularly during the process of spermiogenesis (Schneider2023Cylicins). The protein is involved in the formation and maintenance of the manchette, a microtubular structure essential for the transport of proteins necessary for flagellum formation, acrosome assembly, and cytoplasm removal (Schneider2023Cylicins). The dynamic localization of cylicin 2 during spermatid development is critical for the proper attachment of the acrosome to the nuclear envelope and the maintenance of the perinuclear theca structure (Schneider2023Cylicins). Deficiencies or mutations in the CYLC2 gene can lead to significant structural anomalies in sperm, affecting male fertility (Schneider2023Cylicins).

## Function
CYLC2, or cylicin 2, is a testis-specific protein that plays a crucial role in the structural organization of sperm cells, particularly during spermiogenesis. It is a component of the sperm calyx, a part of the perinuclear theca, which is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm head and ensuring proper sperm function (Schneider2023Cylicins). CYLC2 is involved in the formation and maintenance of the manchette, a microtubular structure necessary for the transport of proteins required for flagellum formation, acrosome assembly, and cytoplasm removal (Schneider2023Cylicins).

In healthy human cells, CYLC2 is expressed during the round spermatid stage and localizes initially in the subacrosomal region, later moving to the postacrosomal calyx region as spermatids elongate (Schneider2023Cylicins). This dynamic localization is critical for the correct attachment of the acrosome to the nuclear envelope and the maintenance of the perinuclear theca structure (Schneider2023Cylicins). The absence or deficiency of CYLC2 leads to significant structural anomalies in sperm, such as malformed spermatids, reduced sperm count, and impaired motility, ultimately affecting male fertility (Schneider2023Cylicins).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or deficiencies in the CYLC2 gene have significant clinical implications for male infertility. CYLC2 is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of sperm, particularly in the sperm calyx, and its deficiency leads to severe morphological defects in sperm cells. These defects include abnormal elongation and disassembly of the manchette, coiling of the sperm tail, dislocation of the head-tail connecting piece, and absence of the posterior portion of the PT-calyx, which result in reduced sperm motility and count (Schneider2023Cylicins). In humans, variants in CYLC2 have been associated with sperm morphological defects and infertility, resembling a severe form of oligo-asthenoteratozoospermia syndrome (OAT) (Schneider2023Cylicins).

A case study identified a CYLC2 variant in an infertile man, although this variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance according to ACMG-AMP criteria, indicating that its clinical significance is not fully established (Schneider2023Cylicins). The study suggests that pathogenic heterozygous CYLC2 variants might affect fertility, although more research is needed to confirm this (Schneider2023Cylicins). These findings underscore the potential role of CYLC2 in diagnosing and understanding male infertility related to structural sperm defects.

## Interactions
CYLC2, or cylicin 2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm calyx, which is essential for male fertility. CYLC2 interacts with several proteins to ensure proper sperm morphology and function. Notably, CYLC2 is involved in the localization and interaction with calyx-specific proteins such as CCIN and CapZα3. In CYLC2-deficient sperm, the mislocalization of CCIN to the tail or random parts of the sperm head and the failure of CapZα3 to localize correctly in the calyx indicate that CYLC2 is essential for the proper assembly and localization of these components (Schneider2023Cylicins).

CYLC2 is also implicated in the intra-manchette transport (IMT) system during spermiogenesis, which is crucial for the correct assembly and disassembly of the manchette and the formation of the calyx structure. The loss of CYLC2 results in the mislocalization of CCIN and CPα3, suggesting its role in maintaining the integrity and function of the perinuclear theca (PT) structure (Schneider2023Cylicins). These interactions highlight the importance of CYLC2 in the structural and functional integrity of sperm cells, which is vital for male fertility.
