# IGF2BP3

## Overview
IGF2BP3, or insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3, is a gene that encodes a member of the IGF2 mRNA-binding protein family, which is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA. The protein encoded by IGF2BP3 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in mRNA stability, localization, and translation, impacting various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. It is characterized by its RNA recognition motifs and K homology domains, which facilitate its interaction with specific RNA sequences and other proteins. IGF2BP3 is particularly significant in developmental processes and is implicated in the regulation of fetal growth and placental function. Additionally, it has been associated with oncogenesis, as its dysregulation is linked to the progression of several cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Mancarella2020IGF2BP3; Wächter2013Subcellular; Elagib2017Neonatal).

## Structure
IGF2BP3, a member of the IGF2 mRNA-binding protein family, is characterized by its RNA-binding domains, which include two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and four C-terminal K homology (KH) domains. These domains are organized into two di-domains: KH1 + 2 and KH3 + 4, with the KH3 + 4 di-domain being particularly important for RNA association (Wächter2013Subcellular). The KH domains are known for their conserved α β -topology and typically bind single-stranded nucleic acids through a hydrophobic groove formed by two short α-helices and an intervening GxxG-loop (Wächter2013Subcellular). 

The KH domains of IGF2BP3 contribute to RNA-binding, subcellular sorting, and protein-complex formation, although their role is less pronounced compared to IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP2 (Wächter2013Subcellular). The protein's structure allows for interactions with specific RNA motifs, with the KH3-4 domains recognizing motifs like 5'-CGGAC-N10-25nt-(C/A)CA(C/U)-3' (Korn2021Structures). IGF2BP3's RNA-binding specificity is influenced by the KH domains in a paralogue-dependent manner (Wächter2013Subcellular). 

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may influence IGF2BP3's function and interactions, although specific details on these modifications are not extensively covered in the provided context (Korn2021Structures).

## Function
IGF2BP3, an RNA-binding protein, plays a significant role in the regulation of mRNA stability, localization, and translation in healthy human cells. It is involved in the transition from fetal to adult megakaryocytes, where it stabilizes the 7SK snRNP complex, crucial for regulating P-TEFb activation, a factor important for transcriptional elongation (Elagib2017Neonatal). This stabilization affects megakaryocyte development by modulating cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation, and it is associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in neonatal megakaryocytes (Elagib2017Neonatal).

IGF2BP3 is also highly expressed in human placental cytotrophoblast cells, where it is associated with cell invasion and migration, processes essential for successful placentation and pregnancy. It affects the stability and translation of IGF-2 mRNA, influencing cell motility and invasion through pathways like the AKT signaling pathway (Li2014Role). In the context of embryonic development, IGF2BP3 is involved in the regulation of IGF-II mRNA translation, which is crucial for fetal growth, by binding to specific mRNA regions and repressing translation during late development (Nielsen1999A).

## Clinical Significance
IGF2BP3 is implicated in various cancers due to its role in stabilizing oncogenic mRNAs, leading to altered expression levels that contribute to tumor progression and metastasis. In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), particularly with MLL rearrangements, IGF2BP3 is overexpressed and necessary for the survival and proliferation of leukemic cells. Its knockdown results in decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in leukemogenesis (Palanichamy2016RNA-binding). In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IGF2BP3 overexpression promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, with its knockdown affecting pathways related to apoptosis and cell cycle processes (Zhang2022The).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), IGF2BP3 is upregulated and stabilizes EGFR mRNA, promoting tumorigenesis and resistance to cetuximab, an EGFR-targeted therapy (Chen2023IGF2BP3). IGF2BP3 is also overexpressed in gliomas, where it is associated with poor prognosis and reduced overall survival, acting as an independent prognostic factor (Sun2021Identification). In bladder cancer, high IGF2BP3 expression correlates with poor prognosis and immune evasion, promoting cancer cell migration and invasion (Huang2023IGF2BP3). These findings suggest that IGF2BP3 plays a critical role in cancer progression and could be a potential therapeutic target.

## Interactions
IGF2BP3, also known as IMP3, is an RNA-binding protein that engages in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. It forms large ribonucleoprotein granules called locasomes, which serve as a protected repository for target transcripts. IGF2BP3 can recruit the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to these locasomes, adding complexity to its function (Mancarella2020IGF2BP3). It interacts with approximately 1000 to 4000 transcripts in humans, influencing RNA stability, degradation, localization, and miRNA biogenesis (Mancarella2020IGF2BP3).

IGF2BP3 directly interacts with proteins such as the ribonuclease XRN2 and the deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 (USP10), leading to the degradation of EIF4EBP mRNA and p53 protein, respectively (Mancarella2020IGF2BP3). It also interacts with nuclear ribonucleoprotein HNRNPM, which is crucial for its nuclear localization and the stability of its transcript targets (Mancarella2020IGF2BP3). IGF2BP3 is involved in stress granule formation by interacting with stress granule-associated proteins like G3BP1 and G3BP2, enhancing mRNA stability and transport during stress conditions (Mancarella2020IGF2BP3).

IGF2BP3's interactions extend to non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, affecting their stability and function (Mancarella2020IGF2BP3). It also interacts with 7SK RNA, contributing to its stability and participating in the regulation of megakaryocyte development (Elagib2017Neonatal). These interactions highlight IGF2BP3's multifaceted role in cellular regulation and its potential implications in oncogenesis.
