# GSKIP

## Overview
GSKIP (GSK3B interacting protein) is a gene that encodes a cytosolic scaffolding protein involved in critical cellular signaling pathways. The protein, also referred to as GSKIP, is a member of the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) family and plays a pivotal role in modulating the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), particularly within the Wnt signaling pathway. This modulation is essential for various cellular processes, including cell signaling, metabolism, and apoptosis. GSKIP's interactions with GSK3β and protein kinase A (PKA) facilitate the regulation of β-catenin phosphorylation, thereby influencing β-catenin-dependent transcription. The protein's structural features, such as its ACT domain and specific binding residues, enable it to form complexes with other proteins, underscoring its function as a scaffolding protein. GSKIP's involvement in cellular signaling pathways has significant implications for understanding and potentially treating diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, where dysregulation of these pathways is often observed (Ko2019GSKIPMediated; Dema2016The; Beurel2015Glycogen).

## Structure
The GSKIP (GSK3B interacting protein) gene encodes a protein that plays a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. The primary structure of GSKIP includes specific residues crucial for its interactions, such as the N-terminal residue V41/L45, which binds to protein kinase A (PKA) RII, and the C-terminal residue L130, which is essential for binding with glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (Ko2019GSKIPMediated). 

The secondary structure of GSKIP features an ACT domain that folds with a ferredoxin-like βαββαβ topology, which is a common structural motif in proteins involved in regulatory functions (Tsai2022Deciphering). The tertiary structure of GSKIP has been refined through molecular dynamics simulations, providing a detailed three-dimensional model (Tsai2022Deciphering).

GSKIP functions as a cytosolic scaffolding protein, forming complexes with other proteins, which suggests a quaternary structure involving interactions with PKA and GSK3β (Ko2019GSKIPMediated). The protein is also involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it interacts with β-catenin, affecting its phosphorylation state (p&gt; MiR181c5p; Li2020&lt). GSKIP's role as an A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) highlights its importance in cellular signaling and its potential involvement in various diseases (Ko2019GSKIPMediated).

## Function
GSKIP (GSK3B interacting protein) is a member of the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) family and plays a significant role in regulating glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3B) activity. It functions primarily by inhibiting GSK3B within the Wnt signaling complex, which is crucial for various cellular processes, including cell signaling, metabolism, and apoptosis (Beurel2015Glycogen). GSKIP's interaction with GSK3B allows for substrate-selective regulation, directing GSK3B phosphorylation to specific functions and enabling precise control over its activity (Beurel2015Glycogen).

In healthy human cells, GSKIP is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it modulates cellular signaling pathways. Its role in the Wnt signaling pathway is particularly important for neuronal development and function, highlighting its involvement in maintaining normal cellular and organismal physiology (Beurel2015Glycogen). Understanding the domains and amino acid sequences in GSK3B that associate with GSKIP and other regulatory proteins is crucial for developing therapeutic methods to selectively interfere with GSK3B actions, which could have implications for treating diseases where GSK3B is dysregulated (Beurel2015Glycogen).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the GSKIP gene have been implicated in several diseases. Overexpression of GSKIP is associated with increased Wnt signaling, which is linked to various cancers, including breast cancer and melanoma (Dema2016The). In cervical squamous cell carcinoma, miR-181c-5p targets GSKIP to reduce tumorigenesis, indicating that GSKIP plays a role in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis (p&gt; MiR181c5p; Li2020&lt).

GSKIP is also involved in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. It participates in the phosphorylation of Tau protein, a process crucial in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's. Mutations affecting GSKIP's interaction with GSK3β and PKA can alter Tau phosphorylation, potentially contributing to the disease (Ko2019GSKIPMediated).

In hematological conditions, a germline duplication involving GSKIP predisposes individuals to familial myeloid malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This duplication leads to overexpression of GSKIP, enhancing the sensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors to thrombopoietin and contributing to the disease phenotype (Saliba2015Germline).

## Interactions
GSKIP (GSK3B interacting protein) is a cytosolic scaffolding protein that interacts with glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and protein kinase A (PKA). These interactions are crucial for regulating β-catenin and Wnt signaling pathways. GSKIP binds to GSK3β through specific residues, such as F122, L126, R129, and L130, which are essential for its interaction. Mutations at these sites can abolish the binding, highlighting their importance (Howng2009Involvement). GSKIP competes with other proteins like Axin1 and AKAP220 for binding to GSK3β, suggesting that it forms distinct functional pools of GSK3β in various cellular compartments (Dema2016The).

GSKIP facilitates the phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser-675 by PKA, stabilizing it, and at Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41 by GSK3β, destabilizing it. This dual role in phosphorylation highlights its regulatory function in β-catenin-dependent transcription (Dema2016The). GSKIP also influences the phosphorylation of GSK3β by PKA at Ser-9, inhibiting GSK3β activity (Dema2016The). Despite its significant role in modulating these interactions, GSKIP does not form a stable complex with β-catenin, indicating that direct binding is not necessary for its regulatory role (Dema2016The).
