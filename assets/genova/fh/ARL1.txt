# ARL1

## Overview
ARL1 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 1) is a gene that encodes a small GTPase protein, which is a member of the ARF-like protein family. This protein plays a pivotal role in vesicular trafficking, particularly within the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of human cells. As a GTPase, ARL1 functions as a molecular switch, cycling between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, which is crucial for its role in recruiting GRIP domain-containing proteins to the Golgi apparatus. The ARL1 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including the regulation of vesicle transport, protein secretion, and cytoskeletal reorganization, thereby maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi complex (Lu2003Interaction; Yu2017Multiple). Additionally, ARL1 has been implicated in clinical contexts, such as its involvement in oncogenic fusions in non-small cell lung cancer and its role in fungal virulence, highlighting its significance in both human health and disease (PatiñoMedina2019Role; Ma2022Case).

## Structure
ARL1 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase 1) is a small GTPase involved in vesicular trafficking, particularly in recruiting GRIP domain-containing proteins to the Golgi apparatus. The primary structure of ARL1 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form the protein, which is part of the ARF-like protein family, sharing significant amino acid identity with ADP ribosylation factors (Lu2003Interaction).

The secondary structure of ARL1 includes a typical G domain fold of Ras-like small GTPases, characterized by a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by five α-helices (Wu2003Structural). The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is crucial for its function. In its GTP-bound form, ARL1 undergoes conformational changes, particularly in the switch I and switch II regions, which are essential for its interaction with the GRIP domains of Golgin-97 and Golgin-245 (Lu2003Interaction; Wu2003Structural).

ARL1 interacts with other proteins to form quaternary structures, such as its interaction with the GRIP domain of golgin-245, which forms a homodimer to facilitate Golgi targeting (Wu2003Structural). The switch II region of ARL1 is critical for this interaction, with specific residues like Cys80 playing a crucial role (Wu2003Structural). The protein may also undergo post-translational modifications, such as myristoylation, which could anchor it to the Golgi membrane (Wu2003Structural). However, specific details on splice variant isoforms are not provided in the context.

## Function
The ARL1 gene encodes a small GTPase protein that is integral to various cellular processes, particularly in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of human cells. ARL1 is involved in regulating vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal reorganization, playing a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi complex (Yu2017Multiple). It interacts with several effectors, including GRIP-domain golgins and arfaptins, to modulate vesicle transport and protein secretion (Yu2017Multiple). Specifically, ARL1 is essential for the recruitment of Golgin-97 and Golgin-245 to the Golgi apparatus, a process mediated through its interaction with the GRIP domains of these proteins (Lu2003Interaction).

ARL1 is also involved in the transport of cargo such as E-cadherin, TNFα, IL-6, IL-10, and HLA-class I, which are vital for cell adhesion, tissue integrity, and immune responses (Yu2017Multiple). In pancreatic β cells, ARL1 plays a role in insulin secretion, where it interacts with arfaptin-1 and arfaptin-2 to influence membrane curvature and tubule formation at the Golgi (Yu2017Multiple). Additionally, ARL1 is implicated in the retrograde transport pathway from endosomes to the TGN, crucial for maintaining proper Golgi structure and function (Lu2004Autoantigen).

## Clinical Significance
The ARL1 gene has been implicated in various diseases due to its role in cellular processes. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a novel ARL1-MET fusion has been identified as an oncogenic driver. This fusion retains the tyrosine kinase domain of MET, potentially leading to oncogenic activity. A case report highlighted a patient with NSCLC who exhibited a significant response to crizotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, due to the presence of this ARL1-MET fusion. However, resistance mechanisms can develop, as seen in the case where the ARL1-MET fusion disappeared and an ERBB2 insertion mutation emerged, leading to disease progression (Ma2022Case).

In the context of fungal infections, ARL1 plays a crucial role in the virulence and antifungal susceptibility of the fungus Mucor circinelloides. Mutations in the arl1 gene result in increased sensitivity to antifungal drugs and affect fungal development, including spore production and hyphal morphology. These mutations also impact vesicle trafficking and secretion processes, which are critical for fungal virulence. The altered expression of ARL1 in this fungus can lead to increased virulence, as demonstrated in a nematode model (PatiñoMedina2019Role).

## Interactions
ARL1, a member of the ARF family of GTP-binding proteins, is involved in various interactions crucial for its function in vesicular trafficking. In its GTP-bound form, ARL1 specifically interacts with the GRIP domains of Golgin-97 and Golgin-245/p230, facilitating their recruitment to the Golgi apparatus. This interaction is essential for the proper localization of these proteins to the Golgi, as demonstrated by the dissociation of Golgin-97 and Golgin-245 from the Golgi upon ARL1 knockdown (Lu2003Interaction).

In yeast, ARL1 interacts with the GRIP domain of Imh1p, a Golgi-localized protein, in a GTP-dependent manner. This interaction is crucial for the recruitment of Imh1p to membranes, highlighting the role of ARL1 in Golgi apparatus functions (Panic2003The).

ARL1 also interacts with Mon2, a negative regulator that modulates ARL1's activity by stabilizing it in its nucleotide-free form, preventing GTP binding. This interaction is significant for maintaining cellular processes such as membrane traffic and ion homeostasis (Manlandro2012Mon2). These interactions underscore ARL1's role as a molecular switch in cellular trafficking pathways.
