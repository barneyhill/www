# SDK2

## Overview
SDK2, or sidekick cell adhesion molecule 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in cell adhesion processes. The protein, also referred to as SDK2, is characterized by its complex structure, including multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) and fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. This structural composition facilitates its function as a transmembrane adhesion molecule, crucial for the formation and maintenance of neural circuits, particularly in the retina. SDK2 is involved in synaptic specificity and localization, contributing to the precise wiring of neural networks by ensuring specific synaptic connections. Its interactions with PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as MAGI scaffolding proteins, underscore its role in synaptic organization. Mutations in the SDK2 gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders, although the full extent of its clinical significance is still under investigation (Yamagata2020Structure; Goodman2016Molecular).

## Structure
The SDK2 protein is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and plays a role in cell adhesion processes. Its molecular structure includes six immunoglobulin (Ig) domains and 13 fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain of approximately 200-400 amino acids (Yamagata2020Structure). The N-terminal four Ig domains (Ig1-4) form a stable horseshoe conformation, characterized by anti-parallel interactions between Ig1-2 and Ig3-4, connected by an eight amino acid linker (Goodman2016Molecular). This horseshoe structure is crucial for the protein's dimerization, which is essential for its function in cell-cell adhesion (Goodman2016Molecular).

The Ig1-4 domains interact in a back-to-back manner, forming dimers that are central to SDK2's homophilic binding specificity (Yamagata2020Structure). The Ig1:Ig4 interface is conserved, while the Ig2:Ig3 interface is more flexible, involving main chain to side chain hydrogen bonds and van-der-Waals interactions (Goodman2016Molecular). The FNIII domains are associated with the plasma membrane, although their specific roles are not fully understood (Yamagata2020Structure).

SDK2 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which can influence its function and interactions. The protein also has splice variant isoforms, contributing to its functional diversity (Yamagata2020Structure).

## Function
SDK2 (sidekick cell adhesion molecule 2) is a protein that plays a critical role in cell-cell adhesion, particularly in the retina, where it is involved in the formation and maintenance of neural circuits. SDK2 is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and forms homodimers through interactions between its Ig-domain regions, specifically the Ig1-4 horseshoe regions, which are crucial for cell-cell adhesion and synaptic specificity (Goodman2016Molecular).

In the retina, SDK2 is expressed by specific subsets of retinal neurons and is essential for the restriction of neuronal processes to specific sublaminae within the inner plexiform layer (IPL). This laminar specificity is vital for forming functional neural circuits that respond to specific visual stimuli (Yamagata2020Structure). SDK2's role in synaptic localization and function is mediated by its PDZ-binding motif, which is necessary for its association with MAGI scaffolding proteins. This interaction is crucial for the synaptic localization of SDK2 in photoreceptors and for maintaining the structural organization of synapses in the retina (Yamagata2010Synaptic).

Overall, SDK2 contributes to the precise wiring of neural networks, impacting cognitive and sensory functions by ensuring specific synaptic connections and maintaining synaptic organization (Goodman2016Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SDK2 gene have been implicated in various clinical conditions. A specific mutation, c.3778A>G p.Ser1260Gly, has been identified in a patient with multiple primary cancers, including breast cancer and leiomyosarcoma. This mutation is predicted to have a damaging effect and is highly conserved, as indicated by a high Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) score. However, this specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is not associated with any known conditions in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) or ClinVar (Timoshkina2021A).

SDK2 is also suggested to be linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Human genetic studies and animal experiments indicate that mutations in SDK2 may be associated with autism spectrum disorders and panic disorders (Yamagata2020Structure). Although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, alterations in SDK2 expression or function could disrupt neural circuit formation and maintenance, contributing to these conditions (Yamagata2020Structure).

Despite these associations, the clinical significance of SDK2 mutations remains under investigation, with limited information available on their direct impact on specific diseases (Yamagata2020Structure; Goodman2016Molecular).

## Interactions
Sidekick-2 (Sdk2) is involved in several protein interactions crucial for its function in cell adhesion and synaptic localization. Sdk2 interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins, particularly members of the PSD-95 and MAGI protein families. These interactions are mediated by the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of Sdk2, which is essential for its synaptic localization and function. In photoreceptor synapses, Sdk2 preferentially associates with MAGI-1, a scaffolding protein, which is crucial for its synaptic localization and the laminar targeting of neuronal processes (Yamagata2010Synaptic).

Sdk2 also forms homophilic and heterophilic interactions through its immunoglobulin domains, with a preference for homophilic binding. These interactions are mediated by the Ig1-2 domains, which are critical for dimerization and cell-cell adhesion. The Ig3-4 domains contribute to these interactions but to a lesser extent (Goodman2016Molecular). The specificity of Sdk2 interactions is influenced by conserved differences in interfacial residues, which may affect binding affinities and mimic the specificity of Sdk1 (Goodman2016Molecular). These molecular interactions are essential for the role of Sdk2 in neural circuit development and synaptic specificity.
