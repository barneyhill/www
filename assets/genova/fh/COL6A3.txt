# COL6A3

## Overview
The COL6A3 gene encodes the collagen type VI alpha 3 chain, a vital component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that plays a significant role in maintaining tissue integrity and structural organization. The protein is categorized as a structural ECM protein and is involved in forming a microfibrillar network essential for the stability of various tissues, including muscle and connective tissues. The alpha 3 chain of type VI collagen is characterized by its unique structural features, including multiple von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domains, which facilitate interactions with other ECM components and cell surface structures (Lamandé2018Collagen; SolomonDegefa2020Structure). These interactions are crucial for the protein's role in anchoring cells and tissues, mediating cell adhesion, and regulating the availability of growth factors and cytokines (Theocharidis2016Type). Mutations in COL6A3 are linked to several muscular disorders, highlighting its clinical significance in maintaining muscle and connective tissue function (Bönnemann2011The; Demir2002Mutations).

## Structure
The COL6A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 chain of type VI collagen, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix. The primary structure of the collagen VI α3 chain includes a long triple-helical domain flanked by globular N- and C-terminal regions (Lamandé2018Collagen). The secondary structure features an alternating α/β Rossman fold, typical of the von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domain family, consisting of a central twisted core of five parallel β-strands and one anti-parallel β-strand, surrounded by six α-helices (SolomonDegefa2020Structure).

The tertiary structure involves the folding of these domains, with the N2 domain showing structural conservation among N-terminal α3 chain VWA domains (SolomonDegefa2020Structure). The quaternary structure forms a heterotrimer with COL6A1 and COL6A2, assembling into larger complexes through interactions that include the formation of dimers and tetramers (SolomonDegefa2020Structure).

The α3 chain contains multiple VWA domains, which are protein-protein interaction modules that contribute to the structural adaptability and function of collagen VI (SolomonDegefa2020Structure). Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and hydroxylation are common, and multiple splice variants exist, contributing to the functional diversity of the protein (Lamandé2018Collagen). The α3 chain's N-terminal tandem VWA domain array is crucial for collagen VI's self-assembly into microfibrils and its integration into the extracellular matrix (SolomonDegefa2020Structure).

## Function
The COL6A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 chain of type VI collagen, a crucial component of the extracellular matrix. This protein plays a significant role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues by forming a microfibrillar network. In healthy human cells, the alpha 3 chain is involved in the assembly of collagen VI microfibrils, which are essential for the stability and organization of the extracellular matrix (Pan2013COL6A3; Lamandé1998The). The alpha 3 chain contains several globular domains that are similar to those found in von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and protease inhibitors, suggesting roles in binding to collagen, heparin, and cell surface structures (Chu1990Mosaic).

Type VI collagen, including the alpha 3 chain, is involved in anchoring blood vessels, nerves, and mesenchymal cells, and serves as a repository for growth factors and cytokines, mediating their activity and availability (Theocharidis2016Type). It regulates dermal matrix assembly and fibroblast motility, impacting wound healing and tissue repair (Theocharidis2016Type). The protein's unique structural features, including its additional domains, indicate specialized functions in type VI collagen, potentially related to its assembly and matrix formation (Chu1990Mosaic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the COL6A3 gene, which encodes the collagen type VI alpha 3 chain, are associated with several muscular disorders, most notably Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) and Bethlem myopathy (BM). UCMD is characterized by early-onset muscle weakness, joint laxity, and progressive contractures, often leading to respiratory failure. It can result from both recessive and dominant mutations in COL6A3, with exon skipping mutations being common. These mutations can lead to in-frame deletions that disrupt the assembly and secretion of collagen VI, affecting the extracellular matrix and muscle tissue structure (Demir2002Mutations; Lampe2008Exon).

Bethlem myopathy, a milder condition, is also linked to COL6A3 mutations and presents with proximal muscle weakness and joint contractures, typically with a slower progression. The clinical spectrum of collagen VI-related myopathies includes intermediate phenotypes with symptoms less severe than typical UCMD but still significant (Bönnemann2011The; Morel2023Retrospective).

In addition to muscular dystrophies, mutations in COL6A3 have been implicated in early-onset isolated dystonia, specifically DYT27, characterized by involuntary muscle contractions and posturing. This condition is associated with compound heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene (Panda2020COL6A3).

## Interactions
The COL6A3 gene encodes the alpha 3 chain of type VI collagen, which is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and interacts with various proteins to maintain tissue integrity. COL6A3 is involved in forming a microfibrillar network in the ECM, interacting with other collagen types and proteins such as fibronectin and integrins, which are essential for cell adhesion and structural stability (Demir2002Mutations). The protein product of COL6A3, collagen VI, forms a triple helical structure with collagen VI subunits A1 and A2, contributing to the pericellular matrix (PCM) surrounding chondrocytes (Bloks2022A).

Mutations in COL6A3 can affect its binding interactions. For instance, the R1504W mutation in the N-terminal domain of COL6A3 reduces its binding affinity to fibronectin, a key PCM protein, which can influence cartilage metabolism and ECM organization (Bloks2022A). In the context of fibrotic diseases, COL6A3 is involved in ECM remodeling and integrin signaling, with its depletion affecting chemokine secretion and myofibroblast migration (Williams2020Identifying). These interactions highlight the role of COL6A3 in maintaining ECM integrity and its involvement in various pathological conditions.
