# TMEM185B

## Overview
TMEM185B is a gene in humans that encodes the transmembrane protein 185B, which is part of a family of proteins characterized by the presence of the TMEM185A domain. This domain is implicated in various cellular processes, including signal transduction and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The protein is typically localized to the cell membrane, where it may be involved in ion transport or cellular communication, potentially influencing cell growth and differentiation. Although the specific functions of TMEM185B are not fully understood, its similarity to other proteins with the TMEM185A domain, such as TMEM203, suggests a possible role in calcium regulation. However, further research is necessary to confirm these functions and to elucidate the precise physiological roles of TMEM185B (Attwood2016Topology).

## Function
TMEM185B is a transmembrane protein encoded by the TMEM185B gene in humans. While specific functions of TMEM185B in healthy human cells are not fully characterized, it is known to be part of a group of proteins containing the Pfam domain TMEM185A. This domain is associated with roles in cellular processes such as signal transduction and maintaining cellular homeostasis (Attwood2016Topology). TMEM185B is typically located in the cell membrane, where it may play a role in ion transport or cellular communication, influencing physiological outcomes such as cell growth and differentiation.

The protein shares some sequence identity with other proteins containing the TMEM185A domain, such as TMEM203, which is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of intracellular calcium levels required for spermatogenesis. This suggests that proteins with the TMEM185A domain, including TMEM185B, may have roles related to calcium regulation, although this is not explicitly confirmed for TMEM185B (Attwood2016Topology). Despite its potential involvement in these processes, the specific molecular activities and cellular functions of TMEM185B remain to be elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify its precise role in cellular and organismal physiology.
