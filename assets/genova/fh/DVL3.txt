# DVL3

## Overview
DVL3, or dishevelled segment polarity protein 3, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, a critical regulator of various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and migration. The DVL3 protein is categorized as a scaffold protein, characterized by its structured domains, including the DIX, PDZ, and DEP domains, which facilitate its role in signal transduction. These domains enable DVL3 to interact with multiple proteins, including membrane receptors and co-receptors, to propagate Wnt signaling. The protein's function is modulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which influence its interactions and activity. DVL3 is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including development, cancer progression, and congenital disorders, underscoring its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Wu2012Delicate; White2016DVL3; Etheridge2008Murine).

## Structure
The DVL3 protein, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, is characterized by several conserved domains that contribute to its structure and function. It contains three structured domains: the N-terminal DIX domain, the centrally located PDZ domain, and the C-terminal DEP domain. These domains are connected by intrinsically disordered regions, with an additional approximately 200 amino acid long intrinsically disordered C-terminus (Hanáková2019Comparativea).

The PDZ domain of DVL3 is a protein recognition motif composed of six β-strands and two α-helices, with a binding site situated in a groove between the β2 strand and α2 helix. This domain is crucial for protein-protein interactions and is highly conserved, showing 98% identity with Dvl1 and Dvl2 over a stretch of 60 amino acids (Jurásek2021Phosphorylationinduced; Tsang1996Isolation).

Phosphorylation is a common post-translational modification of DVL3, affecting its structure and function. Specific phosphorylation sites within the PDZ domain, such as S263 and S280, can modulate the domain's structure and ligand binding affinity, acting as an on/off switch for PDZ binding and influencing the secondary binding site (Jurásek2021Phosphorylationinduced). These modifications are crucial for the regulation of DVL3's activity in signaling pathways.

## Function
DVL3 (dishevelled segment polarity protein 3) is a crucial component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is essential for various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, DVL3 acts as a scaffold protein, interacting with the membrane receptor Frizzled and the co-receptor LRP5/6. This interaction facilitates the polymerization and phosphorylation of LRP5/6 with Axin and GSK3β, leading to the disassembly of the β-catenin destruction complex. As a result, β-catenin accumulates and translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with transcription factors to initiate the transcription of Wnt target genes (Wu2012Delicate).

DVL3 is involved in regulating myoblast proliferation and differentiation, requiring nuclear localization to exert its effects. It enhances proliferation through its DIX and PDZ domains, independent of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Pruller2022DVL1). In the testis, DVL3 plays a role in maintaining cytoskeletal integrity, crucial for proper spermatogenesis. Knockdown of DVL3 disrupts cytoskeletal organization, affecting spermatid polarity and adhesion (Li2019Planar). Despite its lower abundance compared to other DVL isoforms, DVL3 has distinct and significant roles in these cellular processes (Lee2008Differential).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DVL3 gene are associated with autosomal-dominant Robinow syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by mesomelic limb shortening, genital hypoplasia, and distinctive facial features. Specific -1 frameshift mutations in the last exon of DVL3 lead to this condition, resulting in a truncated protein that escapes nonsense-mediated decay (White2016DVL3). Individuals with DVL3 mutations exhibit clinical features such as telecanthus, congenital heart defects, cleft lip and/or palate, and notably, short stature, which distinguishes them from those with DVL1 mutations (White2016DVL3).

In cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, DVL3 is implicated in methotrexate resistance and the maintenance of stem cell-like properties. High expression levels of DVL3 are linked to increased resistance to methotrexate, while silencing DVL3 reduces cell proliferation and enhances drug susceptibility. This suggests that DVL3 plays a significant role in chemoresistance and cancer stemness, potentially through its involvement in the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways (Zhao2020Silencing).

DVL3 also plays a crucial role in murine development, particularly in cardiac, cochlear, and neural tube development. Dvl3 knockout mice exhibit severe developmental defects, including cardiac outflow tract abnormalities, highlighting its importance in normal development (Etheridge2008Murine).

## Interactions
DVL3, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, engages in various protein interactions essential for its function. It interacts with inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), facilitating its translocation to the cell membrane in response to Wnt3a stimulation. This interaction is crucial for the propagation of canonical Wnt signaling and requires the PDZ domain and the COOH-terminal prolyl-rich tail of DVL3 (Wang2012Dvl3). DVL3 also forms supermolecular complexes, or "signalsomes," which are essential for signal transduction from the Wnt receptor Frizzled to downstream elements. These complexes involve interactions with Axin, a scaffold protein critical for organizing the β-catenin destruction complex. The assembly of these complexes is dependent on specific phosphorylation events on DVL3 (Yokoyama2012Assembly).

DVL3's role in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is further highlighted by its interaction with the RNA-binding protein MEX3A in endometrial carcinoma. This interaction amplifies the Wnt/β-catenin pathway's impact, promoting cancer progression through the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process (Yang2022RNABinding). These interactions underscore DVL3's multifaceted role in cellular signaling and its potential implications in disease contexts.
