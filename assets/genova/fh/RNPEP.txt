# RNPEP

## Overview
RNPEP is a gene that encodes the enzyme arginyl aminopeptidase, a zinc metallopeptidase belonging to the M1 family of aminopeptidases. This enzyme is characterized by its ability to cleave N-terminal arginine residues from peptides, playing a pivotal role in protein processing and the regulation of peptide hormones (Thompson2009Arginyl). The arginyl aminopeptidase is distinguished by conserved motifs, including the HEXXHX18E motif essential for zinc binding and enzymatic activity, and the G/AMEN motif for substrate binding (Maynard2014Evolutionary). Functionally, RNPEP is involved in various physiological processes, such as blood pressure regulation and immune response, by contributing to the maturation of bioactive peptides and the processing of antigens for presentation on class I MHC molecules (Thompson2009Arginyl). Its activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has significant implications in clinical contexts, particularly in the progression and prognosis of multiple myeloma (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase).

## Structure
The RNPEP gene encodes the arginyl aminopeptidase, a member of the M1 aminopeptidase family, characterized by a conserved HEXXHX18E motif essential for zinc binding, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Maynard2014Evolutionary). This motif is a hallmark of the zinc metallopeptidase family, facilitating the removal of single amino acids from the amino terminal ends of proteins and peptides (Maynard2014Evolutionary). The enzyme also features a G/AMEN motif for substrate binding and two conserved active site residues: a glutamate in the zinc binding domain and a distal tyrosine, which are vital for its function (Maynard2014Evolutionary).

The RNPEP protein is structurally related to other members of the M1 family, sharing similarities in exon structure and gene organization with RNPEPL1, another aminopeptidase, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship (Maynard2014Evolutionary). The protein's structure likely includes secondary structures such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets, contributing to its tertiary conformation, although specific details on these structures are not provided in the context. The presence of splice variant isoforms is not explicitly mentioned for RNPEP, but such variations are common in related enzymes, potentially influencing their function and localization.

## Function
RNPEP, or arginyl aminopeptidase, is a zinc metallopeptidase involved in the cleavage of N-terminal arginine residues from peptides, playing a crucial role in protein processing and regulation of peptide hormones (Thompson2009Arginyl). This enzyme is part of the M1 family of aminopeptidases, characterized by conserved motifs such as the HEXXHX18E zinc-binding motif and the G/AMEN substrate-binding motif, which are essential for its enzymatic activity (Maynard2014Evolutionary).

In healthy human cells, RNPEP is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of physiological signaling cascades and the processing of peptide hormones. It is implicated in the maturation of bioactive peptides, impacting processes such as blood pressure regulation and immune response (Thompson2009Arginyl). RNPEP's activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis by ensuring the proper breakdown and recycling of amino acids from peptides (Maynard2014Evolutionary).

The enzyme's role extends to the processing of antigens for presentation on class I MHC molecules, highlighting its importance in immune system function (Thompson2009Arginyl). RNPEP's broad substrate specificity and involvement in various cellular processes underscore its significance in maintaining normal physiological functions.

## Clinical Significance
RNPEP (arginyl aminopeptidase) has been implicated in the progression and prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM). Alterations in RNPEP expression are associated with disease progression, particularly in the context of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). High expression levels of RNPEP are linked to poorer prognosis, with a median overall survival of 73 months for patients with high RNPEP expression compared to 100 months for those with low expression, and a hazard ratio of 2.271 (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase). RNPEP expression is also more pronounced in patients with specific cytogenetic markers such as del 13q, t(4;14), or 1q gain, and in those at International Staging System (ISS) stage 3 (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase).

The gene shows a gain in copy number in 20.12% of MM samples, indicating frequent alterations in its expression (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase). RNPEP is one of the aminopeptidases that can hydrolyze the peptide-drug conjugate melflufen to its active form, suggesting its role in treatment response (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase). These findings highlight RNPEP as a potential biomarker for disease progression and a target for therapeutic intervention in multiple myeloma (Miettinen2021Aminopeptidase).
