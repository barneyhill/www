# LHX9

## Overview
LHX9 is a gene that encodes the LIM homeobox 9 protein, a transcription factor characterized by its LIM-homeodomain structure. This protein plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly influencing neuronal differentiation and organogenesis. The LIM homeobox 9 protein is involved in forming transcriptional complexes through its LIM domains, which facilitate interactions with various cofactors, contributing to the establishment of a 'combinatorial code' essential for proper neuronal patterning and axonal guidance (Failli2000Lhx9; Avraham2009Transcriptional). LHX9 is also crucial in the development of the central nervous system and other tissues, such as the pineal gland, where it is necessary for the proliferation and specification of pinealocytes (Yamazaki2014The). Additionally, LHX9 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including differences in sex development and certain cancers, where its expression levels can influence disease progression and prognosis (Kunitomo202046; Li2019FGFinduced).

## Structure
The LHX9 protein is characterized by its LIM-homeodomain (LIM-HD) structure, which includes two LIM domains and a homeodomain. The LIM domains are located at the amino terminus and consist of cysteine-rich, double-zinc finger motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions (WANG2014LIM). The homeodomain is centrally located and is responsible for DNA binding, playing a crucial role in gene regulation (Zhu2019Cloning).

LHX9 exists in two isoforms, Lhx9 and Lhx9α, generated through alternative splicing. The Lhx9 isoform is a full-length protein with a complete homeodomain, while Lhx9α is a truncated version lacking the third helix of the homeodomain, which is essential for DNA binding (Failli2000Lhx9; Mollé2004Lhx9andLhx9α:). Despite this truncation, Lhx9α retains the LIM domains, allowing it to interact with cofactors like CLIM, potentially acting as a dominant-negative isoform by competing for these cofactors (Mollé2004Lhx9andLhx9α:).

The tertiary structure of LHX9 is influenced by its LIM domains, which are crucial for forming multimeric complexes with other proteins, thereby affecting its function in neuronal differentiation and development (Failli2000Lhx9). The quaternary structure involves the formation of complexes with cofactors, which can include homo- or hetero-multimeric assemblies (Failli2000Lhx9).

## Function
LHX9 is a LIM homeobox transcription factor that plays a significant role in the development of the central nervous system and other tissues. It is involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development, particularly influencing cell differentiation and organogenesis. LHX9 functions by forming transcriptional complexes through its LIM domains, which interact with cofactors such as NLI/Ldb1/CLIM, contributing to a 'combinatorial code' that defines neuronal differentiation and regional patterning (Failli2000Lhx9).

In the developing nervous system, LHX9 is crucial for axonal guidance and sorting, particularly in dorsal interneurons. It influences the direction of axonal projections, promoting rostral turning over caudal turning, and affects the dorsoventral position at which axons turn into the longitudinal plane (Avraham2009Transcriptional). This role in axonal pathfinding is essential for the proper topographic organization of axonal tracks (Avraham2009Transcriptional).

LHX9 is also involved in the development of the pineal gland, where it is essential for the proliferation, specification, or survival of pinealocytes. Its expression is high prenatally and decreases postnatally, indicating its primary role in early development (Yamazaki2014The). The gene's activity in the nucleus, where it binds to DNA, underscores its importance in regulating developmental processes at the molecular level.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the LHX9 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions. In the context of differences in sex development (DSD), biallelic mutations in LHX9 are associated with 46,XY DSD, which can manifest as testicular regression, micropenis, and hypospadias. A novel case involving a de novo heterozygous missense variant in LHX9 was reported in a girl with 46,XY DSD and limb abnormalities, marking the first such combination of abnormalities (Kunitomo202046).

In osteosarcoma, LHX9 is significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. This overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, as patients with lower LHX9 expression have a higher survival probability. Knockdown experiments in osteosarcoma cell lines have shown that reducing LHX9 expression impairs cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Li2019FGFinduced).

In gastric cancer, LHX9 is overexpressed and linked to poor prognosis. It enhances the activity of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), promoting glycolytic metabolic reprogramming in cancer stem cells, which supports tumor growth and survival. High LHX9 expression correlates with increased glycolytic activity and is considered a potential prognostic marker (Zhao2023Transcription).

## Interactions
LHX9 (LIM homeobox 9) is a transcription factor that participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing gene expression and cellular processes. In gastric cancer stem cells, LHX9 directly binds to the promoter region of the pyruvate kinase PKM2 gene, enhancing its activity and promoting glycolytic metabolic reprogramming. This interaction is crucial for the malignant characteristics of these cells, as confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays (Zhao2023Transcription).

In glioma, LHX9 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53. This interaction is significant in suppressing glycolysis by inhibiting the expression of the glycolysis-related enzyme PGK1. The downregulation of LHX9 leads to increased PGK1 expression, promoting glioma progression (Luo2021LHX9).

During murine heart development, LHX9 is regulated by the GATA4/FOG2 transcriptional complex, which binds to conserved GATA sites in the Lhx9 regulatory regions. This interaction is essential for the proper repression of LHX9 expression, influencing cardiac development (Smagulova2008GATA4FOG2).

LHX9 also plays a role in axonal guidance and sorting in dorsal interneurons, where it interacts with other transcription factors like Lhx1 to influence axonal projection patterns (Avraham2009Transcriptional).
