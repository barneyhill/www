# GJA10

## Overview
The GJA10 gene encodes the gap junction protein alpha 10, also known as connexin 62 (Cx62), which is a member of the connexin family of transmembrane proteins. These proteins are integral to the formation of gap junction channels that facilitate direct intercellular communication by allowing the passage of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells. The structural configuration of Cx62 includes four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, and cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains, which are characteristic of connexins and essential for their function in forming hexameric connexons (Kirichenko2021Structure). GJA10 is predominantly expressed in the human retina, particularly in the inner and outer plexiform layers, suggesting a specialized role in visual processing and retinal function (Söhl2010Expression). Additionally, the gene's expression and splicing patterns are conserved across species, as seen in its mouse ortholog, indicating its evolutionary significance in retinal physiology (Söhl2010Expression).

## Structure
The human gene GJA10 encodes the gap junction protein alpha 10, also known as connexin 62 (Cx62). The primary structure of Cx62 includes a reading frame of approximately 1629 base pairs, coding for 543 amino acid residues on exon 2 (Söhl2010Expression). The gene structure involves a splicing pattern where an additional exon, coding for 12 amino acid residues, is spliced to the nearly complete reading frame on exon 2. This splicing pattern is similar to that observed in its mouse ortholog, where a third exon is spliced to the C-terminal, replacing the last 63 amino acid residues with 12 specific amino acid residues (Söhl2010Expression).

Connexins, including Cx62, typically have a domain structure with four hydrophobic transmembrane helical domains, two extracellular loops, one cytoplasmic loop, and free N- and C-terminal domains. These structural features facilitate the formation of hexameric complexes known as connexons, which are essential for gap junction channel formation (Kirichenko2021Structure). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a crucial role in regulating the synthesis, transport, and channel gating of connexins, affecting their function and protein-protein interactions (Kirichenko2021Structure).

## Function
GJA10, also known as gap junction protein alpha 10 or connexin 62, is involved in forming gap junction channels that facilitate direct intercellular communication. These channels allow the transfer of ions and small molecules between adjacent cells, playing a crucial role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and enabling coordinated cellular responses. In the human retina, GJA10 is expressed in the inner and outer plexiform layers, suggesting its involvement in visual processing and retinal function (Söhl2010Expression). The gene is considered the human ortholog of the mouse gene Gja10, which is expressed in mouse horizontal cells, indicating a potential role in horizontal cell coupling and lateral inhibition in the retina (Söhl2010Expression).

GJA10 is located on chromosome 6q15-q16 and is expressed in retinal horizontal cells, suggesting a role in visual perception or retinal function (Oyamada2013Regulation). The expression of GJA10 in the retina, but not in other tissues like the lens or iris diaphragm, highlights its specific role in retinal physiology (Söhl2010Expression). The splicing pattern of GJA10 mRNA, which includes an additional exon coding for 12 amino acids, is thought to be important for its function (Söhl2010Expression).

## Clinical Significance
High mRNA expression levels of the GJA10 gene, which encodes the gap junction protein alpha 10, have been associated with poorer overall survival in patients with gastric cancer. This association is particularly significant in Her-2-positive patients and those with intestinal or diffuse type gastric cancer according to the Lauren classification. Elevated GJA10 expression is also linked to worse outcomes in patients with moderately or poorly differentiated gastric cancer. The prognostic value of GJA10 expression is notable in certain tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages, specifically T2 and T3 stages, as well as in N0 and N1+2+3 nodal stages, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer (Zhao2019Prognostic).

In breast cancer, the long non-coding RNA lnc-GJA10-12:1, associated with the GJA10 gene, has been identified as a potential regulator of sentinel lymph node metastasis. This lncRNA is significantly downregulated in patients with SLN-positive metastasis compared to SLN-negative ones, indicating its potential role as a biomarker for SLN metastasis diagnosis (Sun2020Long). However, specific diseases directly caused by mutations in the GJA10 gene have not been detailed in the provided context.
