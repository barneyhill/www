# FBXW9

## Overview
FBXW9 is a gene that encodes the protein F-box and WD repeat domain containing 9, which is a member of the F-box protein family. This protein is a crucial component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system by tagging proteins for degradation. The FBXW9 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation, by targeting specific substrates for ubiquitination (Huang2022Pancancer). It is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus and has been implicated in modulating immune responses through the degradation of proteins such as the interleukin-17 receptor A (Jin2024SCFFBXW11). The evolutionary conservation of FBXW9 from C. elegans to mammals underscores its potential importance in human biology, particularly in processes like synaptic transmission and mechanosensation (Sun2013The).

## Function
FBXW9, also known as F-box and WD repeat domain containing 9, is a protein that functions as part of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is involved in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a critical process for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In healthy human cells, FBXW9 plays a role in regulating protein stability by targeting specific substrates for ubiquitination, which influences various cellular activities such as cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation (Huang2022Pancancer).

FBXW9 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in the degradation of proteins like the interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA). Studies have shown that FBXW9, along with FBXW11, accelerates the degradation of IL-17RA, suggesting its involvement in modulating immune responses (Jin2024SCFFBXW11). Although the specific functions of FBXW9 in healthy human cells are not fully detailed, its evolutionary conservation from C. elegans to mammals indicates its potential significance in human biology, particularly in processes like synaptic transmission and mechanosensation in model organisms (Sun2013The).

## Clinical Significance
FBXW9 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in genetic alterations and expression changes. In a pan-cancer analysis, FBXW9 was found to have a protective role in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), but a detrimental role in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), and low-grade glioma (LGG) (Huang2022Pancancer). Genetic alterations in FBXW9, such as amplification, high mRNA expression, mutation, and deep deletion, were observed in approximately 7% of cancer patients, indicating its potential involvement in tumorigenesis (Huang2022Pancancer).

FBXW9 expression levels are notably higher in several cancers, including bladder urothelial carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma, among others. This overexpression is associated with advanced stages of certain cancers, such as liver hepatocellular carcinoma (Huang2022Pancancer). Additionally, FBXW9 expression is linked to immune scores and tumor purity, suggesting its influence on the immune microenvironment in different cancers (Huang2022Pancancer).

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, lower expression of FBXW9 is associated with MYC mutations, which are linked to better patient survival and attenuated oncogenic function (XuMonette2016Clinical).

## Interactions
FBXW9, a member of the F-box protein family, is involved in forming SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which play a crucial role in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. FBXW9 has been identified as a novel interactor with SKP1, a key adaptor subunit of the SCF complex. This interaction was confirmed through high-throughput interactome analysis using the MAPPIT (Mammalian Protein-Protein Interaction Trap) system and validated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, establishing FBXW9 as a binding partner of SKP1 (Lievens2009Array).

In the context of synaptic transmission in C. elegans, FBXW9, known as MEC-15, is part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and is implicated in the regulation of synaptic vesicle protein trafficking. MEC-15 specifically influences the abundance and localization of the synaptic vesicle SNARE protein SNB-1 at synapses, affecting GABA release in GABAergic motor neurons. This regulatory role suggests that MEC-15 interacts with SNB-1 to modulate its distribution and function, although direct physical interactions have not been explicitly detailed (Sun2013The).
