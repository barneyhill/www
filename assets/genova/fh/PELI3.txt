# PELI3

## Overview
PELI3, or Pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 3, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of immune responses and cellular signaling pathways. The protein, Pellino3, is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, characterized by its N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and C-terminal RING-like domain, which are essential for its ubiquitination activity (Siednienko2012Pellino3; Yang2013Pellino3). Pellino3 plays a critical role in modulating the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling pathways, acting as a negative regulator of TLR3 signaling and an activator of the p38 MAPK pathway (Siednienko2012Pellino3; Butler2005Pellino3). It is also involved in the NOD2 signaling pathway, contributing to the activation of NF-κB and the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins (Medvedev2015E3). The gene's expression and function have clinical significance, particularly in metabolic and inflammatory conditions, as well as in cancer, where it is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses and cellular stress pathways (Yang2014The; Li2020Long).

## Structure
PELI3, or Pellino E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 3, is characterized by specific structural domains that are crucial for its function. The protein contains an N-terminal forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, which is involved in phosphothreonine binding, and a C-terminal RING-like domain, which is essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Siednienko2012Pellino3; Yang2013Pellino3). These domains facilitate the ubiquitination of substrate proteins, a key process in immune signaling pathways (Yang2013Pellino3).

PELI3 exists in two splice variants, Pellino3a and Pellino3b, with Pellino3a containing a unique 24 amino acid insert not present in Pellino3b (Jensen2003Pellino3). The gene encoding PELI3 is located on chromosome 11 and consists of eight exons, with the third exon encoding the 24-amino acid peptide found in Pellino3a (Jensen2003Pellino3).

The protein's secondary structure includes a conserved single α-helix and 10 β-strands, although no significant matches for conserved functional or structural domains were identified beyond the FHA and RING-like domains (Jensen2003Pellino3). PELI3 can form complexes, indicating potential quaternary structures, although specific details on these structures are not provided in the available context.

## Function
PELI3, or Pellino3, is a member of the Pellino family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and plays a significant role in regulating immune responses in healthy human cells. It is involved in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling pathways, where it influences inflammation and immune system activation. Pellino3 acts as a negative regulator of TLR3 signaling by inhibiting the expression of type I interferons, such as IFN-β, through the targeting and inhibition of the transcription factor IRF7. This regulation is achieved by promoting the polyubiquitination of TRAF6, preventing its interaction with IRF7, and thereby reducing IFN-β expression (Siednienko2012Pellino3).

Pellino3 also plays a role in the p38 MAPK pathway, acting as an upstream regulator and activator. It interacts with proteins such as IRAK1, TRAF6, and TAK1 to mediate the activation of p38 MAPK, which is crucial for cellular responses to stress and inflammation (Butler2005Pellino3). Additionally, Pellino3 is involved in the NOD2 signaling pathway, where it mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of RIP2, facilitating the recruitment of TAK1 and IKK kinase complexes, leading to the activation of NF-κB and the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins (Medvedev2015E3).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the PELI3 gene have been implicated in several metabolic and inflammatory conditions. In the context of obesity, reduced expression of PELI3 in adipose tissue is associated with increased inflammation and insulin resistance. Pellino3-deficient mice exhibit exacerbated inflammation and insulin resistance when subjected to a high-fat diet, highlighting the gene's protective role against obesity-induced metabolic disturbances (Yang2014The). 

PELI3 also plays a role in regulating the stability of HIF-1a, a protein involved in inflammatory responses. Deficiency in PELI3 leads to increased stabilization of HIF-1a, resulting in elevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1b, which are linked to insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction (Yang2014The). 

In the realm of cancer, PELI3 expression is influenced by the long non-coding RNA MIAT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Higher levels of MIAT correlate with increased PELI3 expression, suggesting a regulatory axis that may contribute to NSCLC progression (Li2020Long). 

Additionally, PELI3 is involved in TLR4 signaling and is regulated by autophagy. Its degradation through autophagy can modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, which is significant in conditions like sepsis (Giegerich2014Autophagydependent).

## Interactions
Pellino3 (PELI3) is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with IRAK1, a kinase in the TLR/IL-1 signaling pathway, but only with its catalytically active forms. This interaction suggests a role for Pellino3 as a scaffolding protein in these pathways (Jensen2003Pellino3). Pellino3 also interacts with other signaling intermediates such as TRAF6, TAK1, and NIK, but not with MyD88, as confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Jensen2003Pellino3).

In the context of TNF signaling, Pellino3 interacts with RIP1 and caspase 8, components of complex II, which are crucial in the apoptotic pathway. The interaction with RIP1 is particularly important for Pellino3's regulatory effects on TNF-induced apoptosis, occurring in a FHA domain-dependent manner (Yang2013Pellino3). Pellino3's interaction with RIP1 inhibits the binding of FADD to RIP1, reducing the interaction of RIP1 with caspase 8 and decreasing apoptosis likelihood (Yang2013Pellino3).

Pellino3 is also a strong activator of the p38 MAPK pathway, interacting with proteins such as IRAK, TRAF-6, and TAK-1. These interactions are crucial for Pellino3's ability to activate p38 MAPK, with specific residues like Tyr-44 playing a key role (Butler2005Pellino3).
