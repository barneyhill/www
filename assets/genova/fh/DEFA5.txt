# DEFA5

## Overview
The DEFA5 gene encodes the protein human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5), which is a member of the defensin family of antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are crucial components of the innate immune system, primarily produced by Paneth cells in the small intestine. HD5 is involved in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and mucosal defense by exhibiting broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Beyond its antimicrobial properties, HD5 plays a significant role in immune regulation and metabolic processes, influencing gut microbiota composition and correlating with metabolic health. Alterations in DEFA5 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its potential role in tumor biology and progression (Nagao2023Reduced; Spencer2012Human; Fu2023Mechanisms).

## Structure


## Function
The DEFA5 gene encodes human alpha-defensin 5 (HD5), an antimicrobial peptide primarily expressed by Paneth cells in the small intestine. HD5 plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by contributing to the mucosal defense system. It is secreted into the lumen of intestinal crypts, where it helps regulate gut flora and protect epithelial stem cells at the base of the crypts from microbial invasion (Fu2023Mechanisms; R2016AlphaDefens). HD5 exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, directly killing pathogens and preventing their attachment to epithelial surfaces (Spencer2012Human).

In addition to its antimicrobial functions, HD5 is involved in immune regulation. It influences the balance of gut microbiota, particularly affecting the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and is associated with changes in immune cell levels, such as Th17 cells (Fu2023Mechanisms). HD5 also plays a role in metabolic regulation, with its levels inversely correlating with obesity and improving metabolic disorders in animal models (Fu2023Mechanisms). These functions highlight HD5's importance in maintaining both immune defense and metabolic balance in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DEFA5 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In early gastric cancers, particularly in the transition from intramucosal gastric cancer (IMGC) to submucosal-invasive gastric cancer (SMGC), DEFA5 expression is significantly downregulated. This downregulation is associated with the submucosal invasion of gastric cancers, suggesting a role in cancer progression. The study by Nagao et al. found that DEFA5 expression was lower at the tumor site in SMGCs compared to normal mucosa, and DEFA5 was positive in 58% of IMGC cases but only in 22% of SMGC cases (Nagao2023Reduced).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), DEFA5 expression is notably higher in patients with TP53 mutations. This increased expression is linked to significant genetic and microenvironmental differences, including variations in immune cell infiltration. DEFA5 is reported to inhibit cell proliferation and tumor growth in gastric cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, indicating a potential tumor inhibitory effect, although its specific mechanisms in LUAD require further research (Zeng2021Differences). These findings highlight the complex role of DEFA5 in cancer biology, where its expression levels can influence tumor behavior and progression.
