# ABL2

## Overview
ABL2, also known as Abelson tyrosine kinase 2, is a gene that encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein involved in various cellular processes, including cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction. The ABL2 protein, also referred to as ARG, shares structural similarities with its paralog ABL1, featuring a conserved SH3-SH2-kinase domain cassette that is essential for its autoregulated kinase activity (Colicelli2010ABL). This protein plays a pivotal role in regulating the cytoskeleton by binding to actin filaments and microtubules, thereby influencing cell movement and apoptosis (Colicelli2010ABL). ABL2 is implicated in several signaling pathways and interacts with various proteins, such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) and integrin β1, which are crucial for its activation and function (Wu2021Plateletderived; Simpson2015Direct). Clinically, alterations in the ABL2 gene, including amplification and overexpression, have been associated with the progression of various cancers, highlighting its significance in oncogenesis (Greuber2013Role).

## Structure
The ABL2 protein, also known as ARG, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with a highly conserved domain structure similar to its paralog ABL1. It features an SH3-SH2-kinase domain cassette, which is crucial for its autoregulated kinase activity (Colicelli2010ABL). The SH3-SH2-SH1 cassette includes a tyrosine kinase Src homology 1 (SH1) domain and regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains, preceded by an N-terminal cap region (Khatri2016Multifunctional). The C-terminal domain of ABL2 contains F-actin-binding domains and conserved proline-rich sequences that mediate protein-protein interactions (Khatri2016Multifunctional).

ABL2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can enhance its catalytic activity (Khatri2016Multifunctional). The protein also contains a myristoyl group that contributes to an autoinhibitory fold, maintaining the kinase in an inactive state (Colicelli2010ABL). Alternative splicing of the first exons produces various isoforms of ABL2, with some isoforms containing an N-terminal glycine that is myristoylated (Khatri2016Multifunctional).

Structurally, the ABL2 kinase domain consists of two lobes connected by a hinge, with the ATP-binding site located between them (Salah2011Crystal). The protein's structure allows it to interact with various binding partners, further regulating its activity and substrate specificity (Colicelli2010ABL).

## Function
ABL2, also known as Abelson tyrosine kinase 2, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a significant role in cytoskeletal dynamics and signal transduction in healthy human cells. It contains a calponin homology (CH)-type F-actin-binding domain at its C terminus, allowing it to bind directly to cytoskeletal elements, particularly actin filaments. This binding is crucial for the formation of F-actin bundles, which are important for membrane protrusions (Colicelli2010ABL). ABL2 also has a unique (I or L)WEQ domain that provides additional F-actin binding properties and a microtubule-binding domain, enabling it to remodel the cytoskeleton by associating with both thick and thin filaments (Colicelli2010ABL).

ABL2 is involved in regulating cytoskeletal structure and dynamics, as well as participating in signaling pathways that control cell movement and apoptosis. It interacts with various proteins through its SH2 and SH3 domains, engaging in signal transduction pathways. For instance, the RAS effector protein RIN1 binds to ABL2, enhancing its tyrosine kinase catalytic efficiency (Colicelli2010ABL). ABL2's interactions with adaptor proteins like CRK, CRKL, and SORBS suggest its involvement in cytoskeleton remodeling and signal transduction (Colicelli2010ABL). These functions are essential for maintaining cellular structure and dynamics, contributing to normal vertebrate development and differentiation (Colicelli2010ABL).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the ABL2 gene, including amplification, overexpression, and somatic mutations, are implicated in various cancers. ABL2 is often amplified or overexpressed in solid tumors such as invasive breast carcinoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma. These alterations are more common in ABL2 than in ABL1, with ABL2 amplification particularly prevalent in breast invasive carcinomas and non-small cell lung adenocarcinomas. Elevated ABL2 expression is associated with advanced high-grade colorectal, pancreatic, renal, and gastric tumors, suggesting a link between ABL2 activity and tumor progression (Greuber2013Role).

ABL2 is also involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for cancer invasion and metastasis. In melanoma, ABL2 is necessary for EMT transcription factor switching, contributing to invasion and metastasis (Tripathi2018Enabling). In breast cancer, ABL2 promotes invasion and metastasis by regulating actin polymerization and invadopodia maturation (Greuber2013Role).

In hematologic malignancies, ABL2 has been identified in rare fusion events, such as the RCSD1-ABL2 fusion in high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which contributes to leukemia progression (Raca2014RCSD1–ABL2fusion).

## Interactions
ABL2, also known as ARG, is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that participates in various protein interactions crucial for its function in cellular processes. ABL2 interacts with the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ), which directly phosphorylates ABL2 on multiple novel sites, activating its kinase activity. This interaction involves the binding of the ABL2 SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine 771 on PDGFRβ, a critical step for ABL2 activation (Wu2021Plateletderived).

ABL2 also interacts with integrin β1, where the Arg SH2 domain binds to the phosphorylated β1 tail, promoting integrin β1 phosphorylation and enhancing ABL2 kinase activity. This interaction is essential for integrin-mediated cell edge protrusion and cortactin phosphorylation, a substrate of ABL2 (Simpson2015Direct).

In addition to these interactions, ABL2 is involved in microtubule dynamics through its binding to tubulin dimers. The C-terminal half of ABL2 mediates this interaction, facilitating microtubule nucleation and repair via phase separation and co-condensation with tubulin (Lyu2022Abl2).
