# CUL5

## Overview
CUL5 is a gene that encodes the protein cullin 5, which is a key component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. As a member of the cullin family, cullin 5 functions as a scaffold protein within the Cullin-RING ligase 5 (CRL5) complex, a type of E3 ubiquitin ligase. This complex is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, a process essential for regulating various cellular activities such as signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and immune responses. The CUL5 gene is implicated in tumor suppression and has been associated with the regulation of viral infections, highlighting its significance in both cancer biology and virology (Zhang2020Cullin; Zhao2020CullinRING; BurnatowskaHledin2014New).

## Structure
CUL5 (cullin 5) is a protein that serves as a scaffold in E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. Its primary structure consists of a sequence of amino acids that form specific domains, including the cullin homology domain. The secondary structure of CUL5 is composed exclusively of alpha-helices, giving it a rod-like appearance (Kim2013Structural). The tertiary structure involves the overall 3D shape, which is elongated and arch-shaped, with the C-terminal end binding to Rbx1 or Rbx2 and the N-terminal end binding to an adaptor subunit (Kim2013Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, CUL5 forms part of a multi-subunit complex, interacting with elongin BC and SOCS box proteins. The N-terminal part of CUL5 interacts with the adaptor subunit elongin BC, which is crucial for its function in ubiquitin ligase complexes (Kim2013Structural). The interaction between CUL5 and elongin C involves specific residues, such as Arg63 and Pro49, which are not conserved in other cullins, explaining the selective binding of adaptors to CUL5 (Kim2013Structural).

CUL5 undergoes post-translational modification through neddylation, which is essential for its function. This modification involves the attachment of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8, which is crucial for the formation of E3-E3 ligases with ARIH2 (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2). The neddylation of CUL5 leads to significant conformational changes, facilitating interactions with ARIH2 and enhancing its ubiquitin ligase activity (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2).

## Function
CUL5 (cullin 5) is a crucial component of the Cullin-RING ligase 5 (CRL5) complex, which plays a significant role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In healthy human cells, CUL5 functions as a molecular scaffold within the CRL5 complex, facilitating the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins. This process is essential for regulating various cellular functions, including cytokine signal transduction, inflammation, and oncogenesis (Zhang2020Cullin; Zhao2020CullinRING).

CUL5 interacts with adaptor proteins Elongin B/C and a substrate receptor protein SOCS at its N-terminus, and a RING protein RBX1 or RBX2 at its C-terminus. This configuration allows CRL5 to recruit ubiquitin-loaded E2 enzymes and catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin to substrates recognized by SOCS, leading to their degradation by the 26S proteasome (Zhang2020Cullin; Zhao2020CullinRING).

CUL5 is also involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, src activity, and cytokine signaling. It acts as a tumor suppressor by degrading active SRC proteins and is implicated in controlling viral infections by targeting specific proteins for degradation (Zhao2020CullinRING; BurnatowskaHledin2014New). The proper functioning of CUL5 is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing diseases, including cancer (Zhang2020Cullin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the CUL5 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In breast cancer, a significant decrease in CUL5 expression has been observed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, suggesting a potential role in breast tumorigenesis (Fay2003AnalysisofCUL5expressioninbreastepithelialcells). This decrease in expression is associated with loss of heterozygosity in the chromosomal region where CUL5 is located, indicating its potential function as a tumor suppressor (Samant2014E3).

CUL5 also plays a critical role in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) metastasis. Deficiency in CUL5 leads to the stabilization of integrin β1, promoting cancer cell migration and metastasis through the activation of the FAK/SRC signaling pathway. Low levels of CUL5 are associated with poor prognosis in SCLC patients, and CUL5-deficient tumors may be more susceptible to treatment with the SRC inhibitor dasatinib (Zhao2019Cullin5).

In addition to its role in cancer, CUL5 influences immune responses. It regulates CD4+ T cell differentiation, affecting the balance between T helper and regulatory T cells. Alterations in CUL5 expression can lead to increased susceptibility to allergic inflammation, such as asthma, by promoting proinflammatory T cell differentiation (Kumar2022The).

## Interactions
CUL5 interacts with various proteins as part of its role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. It serves as a molecular scaffold in the Cullin-RING ligase 5 (CRL5) complex, binding to Elongin B/C and SOCS proteins at its N-terminus and to RING proteins RBX1 or RBX2 at its C-terminus. These interactions are crucial for the ubiquitination and degradation of substrates (Zhao2020CullinRING). The neddylation of CUL5, involving the binding of NEDD8, induces conformational changes that facilitate interactions with other proteins, such as ARIH2, which binds to the neddylated CUL5-RBX2 complex to form an E3-E3act superdomain essential for substrate ubiquitylation (Kostrhon2021CUL5-ARIH2).

CUL5 also interacts with the HIV-1 Vif protein, which contains a zinc-binding HCCH motif crucial for recruiting CUL5 to the Vif-EloBC complex. This interaction is necessary for the degradation of APOBEC3G, a process critical for HIV-1 infectivity (Mehle2006A). In the context of SARS-CoV-2, CUL5 targets the ORF9b protein for degradation, acting as an antiviral factor by promoting its ubiquitination and enhancing the expression of antiviral cytokines (Zhou2024A). These interactions highlight CUL5's role in regulating various cellular and viral processes through its participation in multiprotein complexes.
