# ADORA1

## Overview
The ADORA1 gene encodes the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its seven transmembrane domain structure. This receptor is integral to numerous physiological processes, including modulation of neurotransmission, regulation of cardiac function, and influence on renal and metabolic activities. The A1R is predominantly involved in inhibitory signaling pathways, where it modulates neurotransmitter release and neuronal excitability, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects (Hackett2018Adenosine; Borea2018Pharmacology). In the cardiovascular system, it plays a crucial role in controlling heart rate and conduction, while in the renal system, it affects fluid balance and blood pressure (Headrick2013Cardiovascular; Borea2018Pharmacology). The receptor's interactions with various proteins, such as neurabin and beta-arrestins, further underscore its importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis and its potential implications in clinical conditions like epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders (Saggu2022A; Huin2019Neurogenetics).

## Structure
The ADORA1 gene encodes the A1 adenosine receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) consisting of 326 amino acids. This receptor features a seven transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, with α helices connected by three extracellular loops (EL1, EL2, EL3) and three intracellular loops (IL1, IL2, IL3) (Merighi2018Adenosine; Varani2017Biochemical). The N-terminal tail is extracellular, while the C-terminal tail is cytoplasmic and interacts with G proteins, playing a crucial role in receptor surface expression (Varani2017Biochemical).

The receptor's orthosteric site is located within the transmembrane bundle, with the second extracellular loop (EL2) contributing to ligand affinity and signaling. Molecular modeling suggests an allosteric site near the orthosteric site within EL2 (Merighi2018Adenosine; Varani2017Biochemical). The receptor's active conformation is stabilized by G protein binding, with transmembrane domains 3 and 5-7 being conserved regions important for ligand binding (Varani2017Biochemical).

Post-translational modifications include glycosylation sites on the N-terminus, important for membrane recruitment, and phosphorylation and palmitoylation sites on the C-terminus, crucial for receptor desensitization and internalization (Merighi2018Adenosine). The A1 receptor can form homomers or heteromers with other receptors, such as A2A adenosine receptors, influencing neurotransmission (Varani2017Biochemical). Alternative splicing of the A1 AR gene results in different transcript variants, with exon 4, 5, and 6 transcripts found in all expressing tissues (Varani2017Biochemical).

## Function
The ADORA1 gene encodes the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R), a G-protein-coupled receptor that plays a significant role in various physiological processes. In the central nervous system, A1R is involved in modulating neurotransmission by inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate. This is achieved through the inhibition of N-type calcium channels and regulation of potassium currents, which reduces neuronal excitability and has neuroprotective effects (Hackett2018Adenosine; Borea2018Pharmacology). A1R also influences synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation and depression, by modulating ionotropic NMDA receptor activity (Hackett2018Adenosine).

In the cardiovascular system, A1R is expressed in the heart atria, where it exerts negative chronotropic, inotropic, and dromotropic effects, thereby regulating heart rate and conduction (Headrick2013Cardiovascular). In the renal system, A1R reduces renal blood flow and renin release, impacting fluid balance and blood pressure (Borea2018Pharmacology).

A1R is also active in adipose tissue and the pancreas, where it inhibits lipolysis and insulin secretion, respectively (Borea2018Pharmacology). In the immune system, A1R promotes proinflammatory effects in various immune cells (Borea2018Pharmacology). These diverse roles highlight the receptor's importance in maintaining physiological homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ADORA1 gene, which encodes the adenosine A1 receptor, have been implicated in various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. A specific missense mutation, c.835G>A, resulting in a p.Gly279Ser amino acid change, has been associated with early-onset parkinsonism and cognitive dysfunction in a consanguineous family. This mutation is rare, highly conserved, and segregates with the disease status, although it does not show a functional effect on the interaction between the A1 receptor and the dopamine D1 receptor (Jaberi2016Mutation). Despite initial findings, ADORA1 was later found not to be within the PARK16 locus associated with Parkinson's disease, and another gene, PTRHD1, was identified as a more likely candidate for causing similar clinical presentations (Huin2019Neurogenetics).

ADORA1 variants have also been linked to epilepsy following severe traumatic brain injury. Certain genotypes at specific SNPs in ADORA1 are associated with an increased incidence of early and late-onset post-traumatic seizures, suggesting a significant role in risk stratification and potential therapeutic strategies for epilepsy (Huin2019Neurogenetics). These findings highlight the clinical significance of ADORA1 in neurological conditions.

## Interactions
The adenosine A1 receptor (ADORA1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that engages in several significant protein interactions. One notable interaction is with neurabin, a neural tissue-specific scaffolding protein. Neurabin forms a complex with ADORA1 and the regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4), which modulates ADORA1 signaling by turning off G protein activation. This interaction diminishes ADORA1-induced signaling responses through Gi/o proteins, thereby regulating neuronal excitability and providing neuroprotection against seizures (Saggu2022A).

The interaction between ADORA1 and neurabin can be disrupted by a peptide known as A1R-CT, which consists of the C-terminal sequence of ADORA1. This disruption enhances ADORA1-mediated signaling and its anticonvulsant effects, as the peptide blocks the interaction interface involving the 3i loop and C-terminal of the receptor (Saggu2022A). The A1R-CT peptide has shown strong anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects in experimental models, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for seizure control (Saggu2022A).

ADORA1 also interacts with beta-arrestins, which influence receptor desensitization and internalization, modulating various physiological processes such as neurotransmission and cardiac function. However, specific details on these interactions are not provided in the context.
