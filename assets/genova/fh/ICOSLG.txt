# ICOSLG

## Overview
The ICOSLG gene encodes the Inducible T Cell Costimulator Ligand (ICOSL), a transmembrane protein that is integral to the immune system's function. ICOSL is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and interacts with the Inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) on T cells, facilitating critical immune processes such as T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine secretion (Roussel2021ICOSL). This interaction is essential for effective communication between T cells and APCs, contributing to the formation and function of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs, which are crucial for humoral immunity (Roussel2021ICOSL). Beyond its immune-related roles, ICOSL also participates in nonimmune functions, such as binding to αvβ3 integrin on renal podocytes, which suggests a protective role in kidney function (Koh2019Nonimmune). The gene's expression and function have significant clinical implications, including associations with immunodeficiency syndromes and various cancers, highlighting its importance in both health and disease (Roussel2021ICOSL; Iwata2019ICOSLGmediated).

## Structure
The ICOSLG protein is characterized by a specific sequence of amino acids that form its primary structure. Its secondary structure includes elements such as alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its overall stability and function. The tertiary structure of ICOSLG involves the three-dimensional folding of the protein, which is essential for its interaction with the ICOS receptor on T cells. This folding is crucial for the protein's role in the immune response.

ICOSLG can form homodimers, which represent its quaternary structure. This dimerization is important for its biological activity. The protein contains immunoglobulin-like domains, which are common in proteins involved in immune functions. These domains facilitate the interaction with other molecules and are integral to the protein's function.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, occur in ICOSLG and can influence its stability, localization, and activity. These modifications are important for the protein's proper function and regulation. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of ICOSLG may exist, contributing to its functional diversity and allowing it to participate in various immune processes. These isoforms can result in differences in the protein's structure and function, enhancing its versatility in the immune system.

## Function
The ICOSLG gene encodes the Inducible T Cell Costimulator Ligand (ICOSL), a protein that plays a pivotal role in the immune system by facilitating T cell activation and regulation. ICOSL is expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as on non-hematopoietic cells under certain conditions (Roussel2021ICOSL). It interacts with the Inducible T-cell co-stimulator (ICOS) on T cells, enhancing T cell activation, proliferation, cytokine secretion, and providing help to B cells for antibody production. This interaction is crucial for effective T cell-APC communication and is essential for the formation and function of germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs, which are vital for humoral immunity (Roussel2021ICOSL).

Beyond its immune functions, ICOSL also plays a role in nonimmune processes. It can bind to activated αvβ3 integrin on renal podocytes, suggesting a protective role in kidney function by acting as a renoprotective αvβ3 integrin-selective antagonist. This interaction is important for maintaining kidney integrity and protecting against glomerular damage, independent of its traditional immune-related functions (Koh2019Nonimmune).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the ICOSLG gene have significant clinical implications. Autosomal recessive mutations in ICOSLG can lead to a combined immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by recurrent respiratory tract infections and severe disease with DNA-based viruses, such as human papillomavirus (HPV). This condition highlights the critical role of the ICOSL:ICOS axis in mucocutaneous immunity (Roussel2021ICOSL). Deficiencies in ICOSLG are also associated with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and combined immunodeficiency (CID), conditions marked by recurrent respiratory tract infections, hypogammaglobulinemia, and impaired B cell differentiation (Roussel2021ICOSL).

In cancer, ICOSLG expression has been linked to the progression of glioblastoma (GBM). High ICOSLG expression in mesenchymal glioblastoma stem cells is associated with poor prognosis and contributes to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by promoting the expansion of IL-10-producing regulatory T cells (Iwata2019ICOSLGmediated). Conversely, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), ICOSLG is down-regulated, and its overexpression is correlated with a better prognosis, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhang2022Identification). Additionally, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ICOSLG gene are associated with alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease affecting hair follicles (Conteduca2012Single).

## Interactions
ICOSLG, also known as CD275, is a member of the B7 superfamily and interacts primarily with the inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) on T cells. This interaction is crucial for T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine secretion, playing a significant role in immune response regulation (Roussel2021ICOSL; Rujas2020Structural). The ICOS/ICOSLG complex is characterized by a 1:1 receptor-ligand stoichiometry, with specific binding interfaces involving motifs such as the FDPPPFK motif in ICOS and corresponding residues on ICOSLG (Rujas2020Structural).

Beyond its role in immune responses, ICOSLG also interacts with αvβ3 integrin on podocytes, a type of kidney cell. This interaction is facilitated by an RGD motif in ICOSLG, which is highly conserved and allows selective binding to the activated form of αvβ3 integrin. This binding modulates podocyte adhesion and provides renoprotection, acting as an endogenous antagonist to αvβ3 integrin activation, which is implicated in glomerular damage and proteinuria (Koh2019Nonimmune). ICOSLG's expression increases in response to immune stimuli, suggesting a protective mechanism against kidney injury (Koh2019Nonimmune).
