# RARRES2

## Overview
The RARRES2 gene encodes the protein retinoic acid receptor responder 2, commonly referred to as chemerin. Chemerin is a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role as an adipokine and chemoattractant, influencing both metabolic and immune processes. It is primarily secreted by adipocytes and hepatocytes and undergoes proteolytic activation to exert its biological functions. As an adipokine, chemerin is involved in adipocyte differentiation and glucose metabolism, while its role as a chemoattractant involves recruiting immune cells to sites of inflammation through interactions with receptors such as CMKLR1, GPR1, and CCRL2. Chemerin's involvement in signaling pathways, including those affecting intracellular calcium levels and kinase activation, underscores its importance in cellular functions and disease processes, including cancer and metabolic disorders (Zabel2005Chemerin; GonzálezAlvarez2015Molecular; Buechler2019Chemerin).

## Structure
RARRES2, also known as chemerin, is a protein encoded by the RARRES2 gene. The primary structure of chemerin consists of a polypeptide chain that includes a signal peptide, which is cleaved to produce the active form of the protein. The secondary structure of chemerin is characterized by the presence of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. Its tertiary structure is a globular conformation stabilized by disulfide bonds, which are crucial for maintaining its structural integrity.

Post-translational modifications of chemerin include proteolytic cleavage and glycosylation, which are essential for its biological activity and stability. These modifications play a significant role in the protein's function in immune response and adipogenesis. Chemerin exists in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which allows for the generation of different protein variants with potentially distinct functions.

The quaternary structure of chemerin is not detailed in the available context, and thus cannot be described. The presence of specific domains or prominent folds is not mentioned in the provided information. Overall, the structural features of chemerin are integral to its role in physiological processes.

## Function
The RARRES2 gene encodes the protein chemerin, which is involved in several critical molecular processes in human cells. Chemerin is primarily secreted by adipocytes and hepatocytes and functions as an adipokine, playing a significant role in adipocyte differentiation and glucose uptake (GonzálezAlvarez2015Molecular; Buechler2019Chemerin). It acts as a chemoattractant, recruiting immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells to sites of inflammation by binding to the CMKLR1 receptor (Zabel2005Chemerin; Huebner2018Expression).

Chemerin is secreted as an inactive precursor and becomes active through proteolytic cleavage by serine proteases, enhancing its chemotactic activity (Zabel2005Chemerin). This activation is crucial for its role in immune cell migration and inflammation regulation. Chemerin also influences metabolic processes, including lipid and glucose metabolism, and is linked to conditions such as obesity and insulin resistance (GonzálezAlvarez2015Molecular; Dahpy2020The).

In terms of cellular activity, chemerin is involved in signaling pathways that affect intracellular calcium levels, cyclic AMP, and the activation of kinases such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and Akt, which are important for various cellular functions (Buechler2019Chemerin).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the RARRES2 gene, also known as chemerin, have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), RARRES2 expression is significantly decreased in brain metastases compared to primary breast tumors. This downregulation is associated with enhanced cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that RARRES2 plays a crucial role in the development of brain metastasis in breast cancer. Overexpression of RARRES2 has been shown to inhibit these processes, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target or biomarker for brain metastasis in breast cancer (Li2023RARRES2).

In glioblastoma (GBM), high RARRES2 expression is associated with a worse prognosis, particularly in IDH wild-type GBM. It is linked to increased immune cell infiltration and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Targeting RARRES2 has been shown to suppress GBM progression and reduce macrophage infiltration, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in GBM treatment (Yan2023Targeting).

RARRES2 gene variants have also been associated with metabolic disorders. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RARRES2 gene are linked to increased serum chemerin levels and a higher risk of diabetic kidney disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes (Zhao2020Variants).

## Interactions
RARRES2, also known as chemerin, is a protein that interacts with several receptors, including chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), G-protein coupled receptor 1 (GPR1), and C-C chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2). These interactions play a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly in the context of cancer. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), chemerin interacts with CMKLR1 to enhance mesenchymal features of tumor cells. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which promotes tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) recruitment and M2 polarization, contributing to a pro-tumoral environment (Wu2022Chemerin).

In osteosarcoma, RARRES2 is involved in the communication between osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs) and TAMs. The IGF1-RARRES2 axis is identified as a key pathway in maintaining OSC stemness, with TAM-secreted IGF1 promoting OSC proliferation and migration. This interaction suggests that RARRES2 may influence the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is implicated in maintaining OSC stemness and tumorigenicity (Ma2024RARRES2).

These interactions highlight the potential of RARRES2 as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment, given its role in modulating tumor progression and immune cell recruitment.
