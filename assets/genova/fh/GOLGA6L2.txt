# GOLGA6L2

## Overview
GOLGA6L2 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family-like 2, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their coiled-coil structure and are primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins and lipids within the cell. Golgin A6 family-like 2 is implicated in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus and facilitating vesicular transport processes. The specific biological roles and interactions of GOLGA6L2 remain an area of active research, with potential implications for understanding cellular organization and function.
