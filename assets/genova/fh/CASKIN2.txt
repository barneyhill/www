# CASKIN2

## Overview
CASKIN2 is a gene that encodes the protein CASK interacting protein 2, which functions as a neuronal scaffolding protein involved in synaptic signaling and neural development. This protein is characterized by its structural domains, including two Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domains, ankyrin repeats, and an SH3 domain, which facilitate its role in protein-protein interactions and signal transduction (Smirnova2016A; Koprivanacz2017The). Unlike its homolog CASKIN1, CASKIN2 lacks a CASK interaction domain, indicating a divergence in its functional roles (Smirnova2016A). CASKIN2 is implicated in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity, processes essential for memory formation and cognitive function (Bencsik2019Dendritic). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as talin and Abi1, underscore its significance in cellular motility and neuronal signaling pathways (Wang2024Caskin2). Alterations in CASKIN2 expression or mutations have been associated with neurological disorders, including intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its importance in brain development and function.

## Structure
CASKIN2 is a neuronal scaffolding protein that contains multiple structural domains contributing to its function. The protein includes two Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domains, SAM1 and SAM2, which are involved in oligomerization and protein-protein interactions. These domains form a domain-swapped dimer, where SAM1 of one molecule interacts with SAM2 of another, allowing for potential branched oligomer formation (Smirnova2016A). The SAM domains exhibit a head-to-tail interaction pattern, stabilized by ionic contacts and a hydrophobic network, particularly in the linker region between them (Smirnova2016A). 

CASKIN2 lacks the CASK Interaction Domain (CID), differentiating it from its homolog CASKIN1, and cannot bind CASK (Smirnova2016A). The protein can exist in monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric states, with its oligomerization influenced by concentration and ionic strength (Smirnova2016A). Mutations such as G537D and K540E have been shown to increase solubility and disrupt oligomerization while preserving dimer interactions (Smirnova2016A). 

CASKIN2's structure is further characterized by ankyrin repeats and SH3 domains, which are common in proteins involved in signal transduction, contributing to its structural stability and functional interactions (Koprivanacz2017The).

## Function
CASKIN2 is a neuronal signaling scaffolding protein involved in synaptic function and neural development. It contains multiple ankyrin repeats, two SAM domains, and one SH3 domain. The SH3 domain of CASKIN2 is atypical, with two non-canonical basic amino acids (K290/R319) in its binding cleft, which may render it vestigial in terms of binding typical ligands (Kwan2016A). Unlike its homolog CASKIN1, CASKIN2 lacks a CASK interaction domain (CID), which suggests a divergence in its scaffolding functions (Kwan2016A).

CASKIN2 plays a role in dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity, which are crucial for memory formation. It is implicated in regulating dendritic spine morphology in the hippocampus, affecting both pre-and postsynaptic profiles (Bencsik2019Dendritic). The absence of CASKIN2, along with CASKIN1, impairs spatial learning and object recognition, indicating its importance in memory processes (Bencsik2019Dendritic). Although CASKIN2 does not bind to CASK, it may still contribute to dendritic protrusion formation, as the absence of both Caskin proteins reduces protrusion density in neurons (Bencsik2019Dendritic). The specific role of CASKIN2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, necessitating further research (Bencsik2019Dendritic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the CASKIN2 gene have been implicated in various neurological disorders. CASKIN2 encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in synaptic signaling and neuronal development. Disruptions in its normal function can lead to significant impacts on brain function and development. Specifically, mutations in CASKIN2 have been associated with intellectual disabilities, which are characterized by limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. These mutations may affect the protein's ability to interact with other synaptic proteins, thereby impairing synaptic signaling pathways essential for cognitive processes.

Alterations in the expression levels of CASKIN2 have also been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). ASDs are a group of developmental disorders that affect communication and behavior. The precise mechanisms by which CASKIN2 contributes to these conditions are not fully understood, but it is believed that changes in the expression of this gene may disrupt normal neuronal connectivity and synaptic function, which are critical for proper brain development and function. Given its role in synaptic signaling, CASKIN2 is a subject of interest in understanding the molecular basis of these neurological disorders and may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
CASKIN2 is a scaffold protein that interacts with several other proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes such as cell motility and neuronal signaling. It binds to talin, specifically interacting with the R8 domain through a C-terminal LD motif. This interaction is characterized by a helical conformation of the CASKIN2-LD peptide integrating into the talin-R8 four-helix bundle, forming a five-helix bundle. The interaction is primarily mediated by van der Waals contacts, with key residues contributing significantly to the binding interface (Wang2024Caskin2).

CASKIN2 also interacts with Abi1, a component of the WAVE Regulatory Complex (WRC), through the SH3 domain of Abi1 binding to the proline-rich region (PRR) of CASKIN2. This interaction is crucial for promoting cell motility and is regulated by phosphorylation of CASKIN2 on serine 878, which disrupts the interaction and potentially facilitates WRC activation (Wang2024Caskin2).

In neuronal cells, CASKIN2's SAM domains undergo oligomerization, forming dimers that provide multiple interaction sites, potentially serving as an adaptor to bring protein partners together. This oligomerization is concentration and salt-dependent, involving head-to-tail contacts distinct from CASKIN1 (Smirnova2016A).
