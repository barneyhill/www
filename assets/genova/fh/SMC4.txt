# SMC4

## Overview
SMC4 is a gene that encodes the protein structural maintenance of chromosomes 4, a critical component of the condensin complex involved in chromosome condensation and segregation during cell division. The SMC4 protein belongs to the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family, characterized by its unique molecular architecture, including a central hinge domain, coiled-coil regions, and ATPase motifs. These structural features enable SMC4 to participate in the ATP-dependent compaction of DNA, essential for mitotic chromosome formation. As part of the condensin complex, SMC4 plays a vital role in maintaining genomic stability by ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation. Its interactions with other condensin subunits and DNA are crucial for its function, and alterations in SMC4 expression have been linked to various cancers, highlighting its significance as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Harvey2002Structuralmaintenanceofchromosomes(SMC); Hassler2019Structural page 0 of 12; Kong2020Human page 0 of 11; Nie2021Clinical page 2 of 7).

## Structure
SMC4 is a protein that plays a crucial role in chromosome condensation and segregation. It is part of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein family, characterized by a distinctive molecular structure. The primary structure of SMC4 includes a central hinge domain, two extended coiled-coil regions, and globular head domains at the N- and C-termini, which contain ATPase motifs known as Walker A and Walker B (Harvey2002Structuralmaintenanceofchromosomes(SMC)proteins page 0 of 1; Hirano2002The page 0 of 8).

The secondary structure of SMC4 features coiled-coil motifs, where two α-helices twist together, forming an elongated rod-like structure. This coiled-coil domain is crucial for the protein's activity and regulation, contributing to conformational changes necessary for its function (Matityahu2017A).

In terms of quaternary structure, SMC4 forms a heterodimer with SMC2, which is a component of the condensin complex. This complex is essential for chromosome condensation during mitosis (Hirano2002The; Stray2003Biochemical).

Post-translational modifications of SMC4 include phosphorylation, which is significant for its regulatory roles during cell division. Acetylation of lysines in SMC4 has also been identified, although its biological significance requires further exploration (Matityahu2017A).

## Function
The SMC4 gene encodes a protein that is a core component of the condensin complex, which is essential for chromosome condensation and segregation during cell division. In healthy human cells, SMC4 plays a critical role in organizing and stabilizing chromosomal architecture. It is involved in the ATP-dependent compaction of nucleosome-bound DNA, a process crucial for forming mitotic chromosomes. This compaction is facilitated by the condensin complexes, which include SMC4 as a subunit, and involves loop extrusion mechanisms that allow the incorporation of nucleosomes into DNA loops without displacing them (Kong2020Human).

SMC4, as part of the condensin complex, is active in the nucleus, where it ensures proper chromosome alignment and segregation, maintaining genomic stability. The protein's ATPase activity, which is vital for its function, involves binding and hydrolysis of ATP, leading to conformational changes that facilitate DNA translocation and loop formation (Hassler2019Structural). Mutations affecting the ATPase activity of SMC4 can disrupt its ability to bind chromosomes, highlighting its importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the condensin complex (Hassler2019Structural).

## Clinical Significance
The SMC4 gene is implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In low-grade glioma (LGG), SMC4 is identified as an independent prognostic marker. Its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis, increased cell proliferation, and aggressive tumor characteristics. The transcription factor MYB regulates SMC4 expression, and its overexpression leads to increased SMC4 levels, impacting patient outcomes negatively (Wang2021The; Jiang2017Overexpression). 

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), high SMC4 expression correlates with poorer overall survival and is considered a potential prognostic marker. The gene exhibits lower DNA methylation levels in HCC tissues, which is linked to altered gene expression (Nie2021Clinical). 

SMC4 is also overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased cancer cell proliferation. It acts as an independent predictor of survival outcomes in lung ADC (Zhang2016SMC4). 

In pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), SMC4 overexpression is linked to advanced tumor stages and larger tumor sizes, suggesting its role in tumor progression (Nie2022Comprehensive). 

These findings highlight SMC4's potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
SMC4 is a core component of the condensin complex, which plays a crucial role in chromosome condensation and segregation during mitosis. In human cells, SMC4 forms a heterodimer with SMC2, creating a V-shaped structure that is essential for the function of the condensin complex (Onn2007Reconstitution). This interaction is strong, as evidenced by the co-precipitation of hSMC4 with hSMC2 even under high-salt conditions (Onn2007Reconstitution).

SMC4 also interacts with non-SMC subunits of the condensin complex, such as hCAP-H, hCAP-D2, and hCAP-G. The kleisin subunit hCAP-H acts as a linchpin, linking hCAP-D2 to hSMC2 and hCAP-G to hSMC4, facilitating the assembly of the condensin I holocomplex (Onn2007Reconstitution). These interactions occur independently of ATP, indicating that ATP binding is not crucial for the assembly of the condensin I complex (Onn2007Reconstitution).

SMC4's interaction with DNA is also significant, as it is involved in altering DNA topology. The condensin complex, including SMC4, can introduce positive supercoils into DNA, a process that is ATP-dependent and requires the presence of topoisomerase I (Hagstrom2002C.).
