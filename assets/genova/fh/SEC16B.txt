# SEC16B

## Overview
SEC16B is a gene that encodes the protein SEC16 homolog B, an endoplasmic reticulum export factor that plays a pivotal role in the secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells. This protein is integral to the formation of coat protein II (COPII) vesicles, which are essential for the transport of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. As a vertebrate-specific isoform, SEC16B functions as a scaffold at ER exit sites, facilitating the assembly of COPII coats and thereby influencing the export of peroxisomal membrane proteins, such as peroxin 16 (Pex16), which is crucial for peroxisome biogenesis (Budnik2011Characterization; Yonekawa2011Sec16B). The protein interacts with other components of the secretory machinery, including Sec13 and Sec16A, but not Sec31A, highlighting its specialized role in ER export (Budnik2011Characterization). Additionally, SEC16B is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the small intestine, where it regulates chylomicron maturation and secretion, linking it to metabolic processes and conditions such as obesity (Shi2021Intestinal).

## Function
The SEC16B gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of coat protein II (COPII) vesicles, which are essential for protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. SEC16B is involved in defining ER exit sites where these vesicles are formed, acting as a scaffold for COPII coat assembly (Budnik2011Characterization; Yonekawa2011Sec16B). This process is crucial for the export of peroxisomal membrane proteins, such as peroxin 16 (Pex16), from the ER, which is vital for peroxisome biogenesis in mammalian cells (Yonekawa2011Sec16B).

SEC16B is a vertebrate-specific isoform that interacts with other proteins like Sec13 and Sec16A, but not Sec31A, indicating its specialized role in ER export (Budnik2011Characterization). It is primarily localized to ER exit sites, and its depletion disrupts these sites, affecting the transport from the ER (Budnik2011Characterization). SEC16B's function is distinct from SEC16A, as it does not compensate for SEC16A loss, suggesting non-redundant roles in the secretory pathway (Budnik2011Characterization). Additionally, SEC16B is involved in lipid metabolism, particularly in the small intestine, by regulating chylomicron maturation and secretion (Shi2021Intestinal).

## Clinical Significance
The SEC16B gene has been implicated in obesity and related metabolic disorders through its role in dietary lipid absorption and chylomicron metabolism. Genetic variants in SEC16B, such as the minor 'C' variant of rs10913469 and the 'G' variant of rs543874, have been associated with increased obesity rates and higher body fat percentage across various populations (Shi2021Intestinal; Hotta2009Association). Studies have shown that SEC16B is crucial for chylomicron production and lipid absorption, with deficiencies leading to impaired lipid transport and absorption, potentially contributing to obesity (Shi2021Intestinal).

In SEC16B intestinal knockout mice, a reduction in chylomicron lipidation and increased lipid droplet formation were observed, suggesting a shift of lipids from chylomicrons to lipid droplets, which may protect against high-fat diet-induced obesity (Shi2021Intestinal). The gene's role in obesity appears more pronounced in females, as evidenced by more significant weight gain differences in female knockout mice (Shi2021Intestinal). These findings suggest that SEC16B could be a potential target for addressing diet-induced obesity, although further research is needed to explore therapeutic applications (Shi2021Intestinal).

## Interactions
SEC16B is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export and peroxisome biogenesis. It interacts with Sec13 through its central conserved domain, forming an ancestral coat element (ACE) similar to the integration of Sec13 into complexes with Sec31 and the nuclear pore complex. This interaction supports SEC16B's role in ER export (Budnik2011Characterization). SEC16B also binds to Sec16A, suggesting that these proteins may function together in a heteromeric complex, although SEC16B does not interact with Sec31A (Budnik2011Characterization).

In the context of peroxisome biogenesis, SEC16B interacts with peroxisomal membrane biogenesis factors such as Pex3 and Pex16. Overexpression of SEC16B leads to the redistribution of these factors from peroxisomes to SEC16B-positive ER membranes, indicating its role in the transport of these proteins from the ER to peroxisomes (Yonekawa2011Sec16B). SEC16B's interaction with COPII components is also noted, although the specific coat components for ER-to-peroxisome carriers remain unidentified (Tani2011Dual). These interactions highlight SEC16B's specialized functions in vesicle trafficking and organelle biogenesis.
