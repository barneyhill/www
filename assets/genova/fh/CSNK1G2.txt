# CSNK1G2

## Overview
CSNK1G2 is a gene that encodes the protein casein kinase 1 gamma 2, a member of the casein kinase 1 family of serine/threonine kinases. This protein is involved in several critical cellular processes, including the regulation of necroptosis and oxidative stress. Casein kinase 1 gamma 2 plays a pivotal role in inhibiting receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), thereby modulating necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, which is particularly significant in maintaining testicular cell viability and function (Li2020Casein). Additionally, CSNK1G2 interacts with components of the NADPH oxidase complex to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, highlighting its role in oxidative stress response (Hu2023Casein). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in cellular and tissue homeostasis, with implications for various diseases, including cancer and oxidative stress-related conditions.

## Function
The CSNK1G2 gene encodes the protein casein kinase 1 gamma 2, which is part of the casein kinase 1 family of serine/threonine kinases. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, by inhibiting receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). CSNK1G2 binds to RIPK3, preventing its activation and subsequent recruitment to the necrosome, thereby attenuating necroptosis. This function is particularly important in the testis, where CSNK1G2 helps prevent premature aging by maintaining cell viability and function (Li2020Casein).

CSNK1G2 also interacts with components of the NADPH oxidase complex, such as DUOXA2, to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. This interaction suggests a role in oxidative stress response, where CSNK1G2 promotes ROS levels, which can be modulated by casein kinase 1 inhibitors. This regulatory mechanism is conserved across species and is important for maintaining ROS homeostasis in human cells (Hu2023Casein).

Overall, CSNK1G2 is involved in critical cellular processes, including the suppression of necroptosis and the regulation of oxidative stress, contributing to the maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis in healthy human cells.

## Clinical Significance
CSNK1G2, encoding casein kinase 1 gamma 2, is implicated in various diseases and conditions through mutations, altered expression levels, and disrupted interactions. In testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), the long non-coding RNA CSNK1G2-AS1, which is associated with CSNK1G2, is significantly down-regulated. This down-regulation is linked to tumorigenesis, and its hypomethylation correlates with a better prognosis for TGCT patients. Overexpression of CSNK1G2-AS1 in vitro promotes metastasis and inhibits apoptosis, suggesting its role in cancer progression through pathways like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and AKT signaling (Li2023CSNK1G2AS1).

CSNK1G2 is also involved in regulating oxidative stress response. It interacts with the NADPH dual oxidase complex, affecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Overexpression of CSNK1G2 increases ROS levels, which can be inhibited by specific kinase inhibitors, indicating its role in oxidative stress regulation (Hu2023Casein). This regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and may have implications for diseases related to oxidative stress (Hu2023Casein). Additionally, CSNK1G2 has been associated with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1), where its expression correlates with clinical response scores, although specific disease mechanisms are not detailed (van2022Clinical).

## Interactions
CSNK1G2, or casein kinase 1 gamma 2, is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in cellular signaling and regulation. In HEK293T cells, CSNK1G2 has been shown to interact with DUOXA2, a component of the NADPH dual oxidase complex. This interaction is confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where CSNK1G2 and DUOXA2 co-localize on the plasma membrane and subcellular structures, suggesting a regulatory role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Hu2023Casein). 

CSNK1G2 also interacts with the estrogen receptor (ER) in breast cancer cells, affecting ER signaling pathways. Silencing CSNK1G2 influences the phosphorylation of ERα, particularly at Ser 118 and Ser 167, which are crucial for ER activation and associated with breast cancer progression. This interaction impacts the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K and ERK signaling pathways, especially in ER-positive breast cancer cells, and modulates the transcriptional activity of ER-responsive genes (Nguyen2021CSNK1G2).

Additionally, CSNK1G2 is regulated by miR-155 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, where miR-155 negatively affects CSNK1G2 mRNA levels, indicating a post-transcriptional regulatory interaction (Zhang2017MicroRNA155).
