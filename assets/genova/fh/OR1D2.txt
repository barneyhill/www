# OR1D2

## Overview
The OR1D2 gene encodes the olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily D member 2, a protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. This receptor is primarily involved in the detection of odorant molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. OR1D2 is characterized by its seven-transmembrane domain structure, typical of GPCRs, which facilitates its interaction with specific ligands and initiates signal transduction pathways (Adhikari2019In; Triller2008Odorant–Receptor). Beyond its olfactory functions, OR1D2 is expressed in various non-olfactory tissues, including human airway smooth muscle cells and spermatozoa, where it influences physiological processes such as muscle contraction, inflammation, and sperm motility (Kalbe2016Olfactory; Flegel2013Expression). The receptor's diverse roles underscore its significance in both sensory and non-sensory biological functions.

## Structure
The OR1D2 protein is an olfactory receptor that belongs to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, characterized by a seven-transmembrane domain structure typical of GPCRs. These transmembrane domains are involved in the receptor's ability to interact with odorant molecules and initiate signal transduction pathways (Adhikari2019In). The primary structure of OR1D2 consists of a sequence of amino acids that form these transmembrane helices, which are crucial for its function in odor detection (Triller2008Odorant–Receptor).

The secondary structure of OR1D2 includes alpha helices that span the cell membrane, facilitating the receptor's interaction with odorant molecules. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices into a specific three-dimensional conformation, allowing for the binding of specific ligands such as Bourgeonal, which is known to activate OR1D2 and has a lily of the valley odor character (Triller2008Odorant–Receptor).

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, are common in GPCRs and may occur in OR1D2, affecting its stability and function. However, specific details on these modifications for OR1D2 are not provided in the available context. The protein functions as a monomer, and no quaternary structure is applicable (Kalbe2016Olfactory).

## Function
The human gene OR1D2 encodes an olfactory receptor protein that is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. This receptor is involved in detecting odor molecules and initiating signal transduction pathways that result in the perception of smell. OR1D2 is expressed in the olfactory epithelium, where it binds specific odorants, triggering neuronal responses that contribute to the sense of smell.

Beyond its role in olfaction, OR1D2 is also expressed in non-olfactory tissues, such as human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). In these cells, OR1D2 is involved in modulating physiological processes, including muscle contraction and inflammation. Activation of OR1D2 by its ligands leads to a transient increase in intracellular calcium levels, which is crucial for muscle contraction. This process involves a cAMP-dependent signaling cascade, including the activation of adenylyl cyclase and the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels (Kalbe2016Olfactory). OR1D2 activation can also influence the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8 and GM-CSF, through the ERK MAPK pathway, suggesting a role in airway inflammation and remodeling (Kalbe2016Olfactory).

OR1D2 is also expressed in human spermatozoa, where its activation by the odorant bourgeonal influences the swimming direction and speed of spermatozoa, indicating a role in sperm function (Flegel2013Expression). This suggests that OR1D2 may have diverse functions in different tissues, contributing to both sensory and non-sensory physiological processes.

## Interactions
The OR1D2 receptor, a member of the olfactory receptor family, is involved in several interactions that are crucial for its function in human sperm chemotaxis and airway smooth muscle cell modulation. In human sperm, OR1D2 interacts with the CatSper calcium channel, mediating its activation in response to the synthetic ligand bourgeonal. This interaction is facilitated through a G-protein dependent pathway, specifically involving the Gαs subunit. The activation of OR1D2 by bourgeonal leads to an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, which is essential for sperm motility and chemotaxis (Cheng2019OR1D2).

In human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), OR1D2 activation by bourgeonal induces a transient increase in intracellular calcium levels through a cAMP-dependent signaling cascade. This process involves the activation of adenylyl cyclase, leading to cAMP generation and subsequent opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. The receptor's activation also results in the release of cytokines such as IL-8 and GM-CSF, mediated through the ERK MAPK pathway, which plays a role in airway inflammation and remodeling (Kalbe2016Olfactory). These interactions highlight OR1D2's role in both reproductive and respiratory physiological processes.
