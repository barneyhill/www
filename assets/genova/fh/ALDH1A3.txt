# ALDH1A3

## Overview
The ALDH1A3 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A3, which is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase superfamily. This enzyme plays a critical role in the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids, a process essential for various metabolic pathways and physiological functions, including the biosynthesis of retinoic acid from all-trans-retinal. ALDH1A3 is characterized by its tetrameric structure and is involved in several cellular processes, such as glycolysis and amino acid metabolism, and is active in multiple cellular compartments, including the cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria (Duan2016ALDH1A3). The protein's structure includes a non-canonical Rossmann-fold motif, and its activity can be regulated by ATP binding, which suggests a link to cellular energy status (Castellví2022Structural). ALDH1A3 is implicated in various developmental processes and diseases, including cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and therapy resistance, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Duan2016ALDH1A3; Chen2019USP9X).

## Structure
The ALDH1A3 protein is a member of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family and is characterized by a tetrameric assembly, with each monomer independently capable of converting one molecule of substrate to one molecule of product by reducing one NAD+ (Moretti2016Crystal). The monomer structure includes 13 α-helices, 19 β-strands, and connecting loops, arranged into three functional domains: the N-terminal NAD binding domain, the catalytic domain, and the oligomerization domain (Moretti2016Crystal). The NAD binding domain contains a five-stranded parallel β-sheet, while the catalytic domain features a six-stranded parallel β-sheet (Moretti2016Crystal). The oligomerization domain is characterized by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (Moretti2016Crystal).

ALDH1A3 shares high structural homology with other ALDHs, particularly within the 1A subfamily, and can be superimposed onto human ALDH1A1 with an r.m.s.d. of 0.84 Å (Moretti2016Crystal). The protein shows 71% amino acid identity with human isozymes 1A1 and 72% with 1A2 (Moretti2016Crystal). The catalytic pocket contains a crucial catalytic thiol, Cys314, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Moretti2016Crystal). The structure of ALDH1A3 also includes a non-canonical Rossmann-fold motif in its cofactor-binding domain (Castellví2022Structural). ATP binding to the cofactor-binding pocket inhibits ALDH1A3 activity, suggesting a regulatory mechanism linked to cellular energy status (Castellví2022Structural).

## Function
The human gene ALDH1A3 encodes an enzyme that is part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase family, which is crucial for the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. This enzyme is primarily responsible for converting all-trans-retinal to retinoic acid (RA), a process vital for various physiological functions, including cellular differentiation and development (Duan2016ALDH1A3). ALDH1A3 exhibits a catalytic activity that is significantly higher than that of ALDH1A1, emphasizing its importance in RA biosynthesis (Duan2016ALDH1A3).

In healthy human cells, ALDH1A3 is involved in several metabolic pathways, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism. It oxidizes intermediate aldehyde forms of histidine, phenylalanine, β-alanine, and tyrosine into their corresponding acids (Duan2016ALDH1A3). The enzyme is active in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria, indicating its widespread role in cellular metabolism (Duan2016ALDH1A3).

ALDH1A3 is also crucial for physiological processes such as visual, olfactory, facial, and renal development. Its expression is particularly high in the ventral region of the retina, salivary gland, and stomach, as well as in various other tissues, including the urinary and genital tract epithelium and the spinal cord (Duan2016ALDH1A3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the ALDH1A3 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. Loss-of-function mutations in ALDH1A3 have been linked to bilateral anophthalmia and microphthalmia, conditions characterized by the absence or severe underdevelopment of the eyes. These mutations lead to a reduction in retinoic acid synthesis, which is crucial for normal eye development. Specific nonsense mutations, such as p.Lys190* and p.Lys389*, have been identified in patients with these conditions, resulting in optic nerve hypoplasia and disrupted axonal projections (Yahyavi2013ALDH1A3).

In cancer, ALDH1A3 is implicated in tumor progression and therapy resistance. It is abnormally expressed in various cancers, including pancreatic, ovarian, and high-grade glioma, where high expression is linked to increased malignancy and drug resistance. Conversely, low expression due to promoter methylation is observed in non-small cell lung cancer, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and prostate cancer, serving as an early indicator for these tumors (Duan2016ALDH1A3). In glioblastoma, ALDH1A3 stabilization by USP9X is crucial for maintaining mesenchymal features and therapeutic resistance, highlighting its role in aggressive tumor phenotypes (Chen2019USP9X). These findings underscore ALDH1A3's potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer.

## Interactions
ALDH1A3 interacts with the small molecule inhibitor MCI-INI-3, which binds to the enzyme's active site, overlapping the retinaldehyde binding pocket. This interaction involves several specific contacts, including π-π stacking with F308, hydrogen bonding with T315, and interactions with a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues E135, R139, T140, W189, L471, and L489. The selectivity of MCI-INI-3 for ALDH1A3 over other aldehyde dehydrogenases is attributed to these specific interactions, particularly with T315 and the hydrophobic pockets near the substrate access tunnel (Li2021A).

ALDH1A3 is also regulated transcriptionally by the NF-κB pathway. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the NF-κB pathway can bind to the promoter region of the ALDH1A3 gene, influencing its expression. This interaction is part of a regulatory mechanism where NF-κB activation leads to increased ALDH1A3 expression, contributing to drug resistance and tumor progression (Shi2023EGFRvIII).

Additionally, ALDH1A3 is a target of microRNAs such as miR-125a/b and miR-187, which bind to the 3'UTR of its mRNA, regulating its expression. Overexpression of these microRNAs can decrease ALDH1A3 levels, indicating a post-transcriptional regulatory interaction (Duan2016ALDH1A3).
