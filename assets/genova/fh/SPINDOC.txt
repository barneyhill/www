# SPINDOC

## Overview
SPINDOC is a gene that encodes the protein known as spindlin interactor and repressor of chromatin binding, which plays a significant role in cellular processes related to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. The SPINDOC protein functions primarily as a scaffolding protein within the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, where it interacts with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to facilitate DNA repair mechanisms. Additionally, SPINDOC is involved in transcriptional repression by forming complexes with SPIN1, a histone code reader, thereby influencing chromatin dynamics and gene expression. This dual role in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation underscores SPINDOC's importance in maintaining genomic stability and its potential implications in diseases associated with impaired DNA repair mechanisms (Yang2021SPINDOC).

## Function
The SPINDOC gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by interacting with PARP1, a key protein involved in DNA repair processes. SPINDOC acts as a scaffolding protein, facilitating the interaction with PARP1 and promoting its PARylation activity, which is essential for efficient DNA repair. This interaction is critical for maintaining PARP1 stability and activity, as SPINDOC is necessary for the proper clearance of PARP1 from DNA damage sites, thereby ensuring effective DNA repair and genomic stability (Yang2021SPINDOC).

SPINDOC is also involved in transcriptional regulation by influencing the expression of genes associated with DDR, such as BRCA1 and RAD51. It is recruited to DNA lesions along with PARP1, and its expression is induced by DNA damage, suggesting a regulatory loop involving SPINDOC, PARP1, and the transcription factor KLF4 (Yang2021SPINDOC).

In addition to its role in DDR, SPINDOC forms independent complexes with SPIN1, a histone code reader, indicating its involvement in chromatin-associated processes and transcriptional repression (Yang2021SPINDOC).

## Clinical Significance
SPINDOC has been implicated in various conditions related to impaired DNA repair mechanisms. Alterations in SPINDOC expression or function can lead to increased sensitivity to DNA damage and compromised DNA repair, potentially contributing to genomic instability and associated diseases (Yang2021SPINDOC). SPINDOC interacts with PARP1, a key protein in DNA repair, and facilitates PARP1-mediated PARylation, which is crucial for DNA repair processes. The absence of SPINDOC results in reduced PARylation activity, leading to increased apoptosis and shorter survival rates following DNA damage, such as ionizing radiation exposure (Yang2021SPINDOC). 

SPINDOC's role in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway suggests its involvement in conditions where genome integrity is compromised. Knockout models show reduced proliferation rates and altered expression of genes associated with DDR, indicating potential implications in cancer and other diseases where DNA repair is impaired (Yang2021SPINDOC). SPINDOC expression is induced by DNA damage, linking it to cellular responses to genotoxic stress, and its deficiency can lead to impaired DNA repair and altered gene regulation, potentially contributing to disease states (Yang2021SPINDOC).

## Interactions
SPINDOC is involved in forming two distinct protein complexes, one with SPIN1 and another with PARP1. The interaction with SPIN1 is characterized by SPINDOC's role as a stable component of the SPIN1 protein complex, where it binds through the Tudor domains of SPIN1, particularly the Tudor-3 domain, which is critical for recognition (Yang2021SPINDOC). SPINDOC acts as a transcriptional corepressor, affecting the expression of Wnt target genes and regulating SPIN1's chromatin loading (Devi2019Spindlin).

SPINDOC also interacts directly with PARP1, forming a separate complex that does not involve SPIN1. This interaction is crucial for facilitating PARP1-mediated PARylation and the DNA damage response (DDR). SPINDOC is recruited to DNA lesions following DNA damage, aiding in the clearance of PARP1 from damaged DNA and affecting the expression of PARP1's transcriptional targets (Yang2021SPINDOC). The interaction between SPINDOC and PARP1 is influenced by DNA, with DNA potentially modulating this interaction (Yang2021SPINDOC). SPINDOC's binding to PARP1 requires the intact DNA-binding domain of PARP1, suggesting that SPINDOC may mimic structural changes induced by DNA binding to enhance PARP1's activity (Yang2021SPINDOC).
