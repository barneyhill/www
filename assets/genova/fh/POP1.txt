# POP1

## Overview
The POP1 gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes, which are essential for the processing of precursor tRNA and rRNA, respectively. The protein, known as POP1 homolog, ribonuclease P/MRP subunit, is characterized by a six-helical bundle fold typical of the death domain (DD) superfamily and functions primarily within the nucleolus. It plays a pivotal role in RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis by interacting with RNA components and other protein subunits within these complexes, thereby stabilizing their structure and function (Choi2015Crystal; Fagerlund2015Footprinting). Mutations in the POP1 gene are linked to various skeletal dysplasias, underscoring its importance in normal skeletal development and cellular function (Barraza‐García2017Broadening; Glazov2011WholeExome).

## Structure
The human POP1 protein is a component of the ribonuclease P and MRP complexes, playing a crucial role in RNA processing. Structurally, POP1 is characterized by a canonical six-helical bundle fold, typical of the death domain (DD) superfamily, which includes six helices (H1 to H6) and a long loop connecting some of these helices (Choi2015Crystal). Despite its low sequence identity with other PYD structures, POP1 exhibits high structural similarity, with notable differences in the H2-H3 loop, which is dynamic in solution (Choi2015Crystal).

In terms of quaternary structure, POP1 exists as a monomer in solution but forms an asymmetric dimer in the crystal, with no apparent interactions between chains A and B (Choi2015Crystal). The protein's theoretical monomeric molecular weight is 11,303 Da, while the experimental molecular weight is 12,840 KDa (Choi2015Crystal).

POP1 also interacts with RNA components of RNase P and MRP, forming RNA-protein complexes at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. These interactions are specific, as demonstrated by gel mobility shift assays, and are stabilized by the presence of the Pop6/Pop7 heterodimer (Fagerlund2015Footprinting). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and exist in multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its function and interactions.

## Function
The POP1 gene encodes a protein that is a crucial component of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes, which are involved in the processing of precursor tRNA and rRNA, respectively. In healthy human cells, POP1 plays a significant role in the assembly and stabilization of these RNA components, ensuring proper RNA processing and maturation. This function is essential for maintaining cell viability and proper protein synthesis (Fagerlund2015Footprinting; Lygerou1994The).

POP1 is the largest protein in the RNase P/MRP complex and interacts with various RNA components, including the CR-IV/mCR-IV regions, positioning itself near the RNA catalytic core. This interaction is crucial for the structural stabilization of the RNA, replacing auxiliary RNA elements found in bacterial and archaeal enzymes (Fagerlund2015Footprinting). The protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it contributes to RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis (Lygerou1994The).

Mutations in POP1 can lead to destabilization of the RNA component and defects in substrate processing, which are associated with severe skeletal dysplasia in humans (Fagerlund2015Footprinting). This highlights the importance of POP1 in maintaining the structural integrity and function of RNase P and RNase MRP complexes.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the POP1 gene are associated with a range of skeletal dysplasias, which are genetic disorders affecting bone development. These conditions can vary in severity, from mild to severe forms, and include phenotypes similar to anauxetic dysplasia (AD) and cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) (Barraza‐García2017Broadening). POP1 mutations impair the function of the RNase MRP complex, leading to defects in RNA processing and cell proliferation, which are crucial for normal skeletal development (Glazov2011WholeExome).

In some cases, POP1 mutations result in a distinct skeletal phenotype, suggesting that the RNase P and RNase MRP complexes may process other unidentified RNAs involved in developmental pathways like osteogenesis (Glazov2011WholeExome). The mutations can lead to a spectrum of clinical presentations, including severe short stature, limb deformities, and cognitive developmental delays (Barraza‐García2017Broadening).

A novel homozygous mutation, R211Q, in the POP1 gene has been identified, which causes a unique clinical phenotype with severe short stature and subtle skeletal changes, differing from previously reported cases of POP1-associated anauxetic dysplasia (Abdulhadi‐Atwan2020The). This highlights the genetic heterogeneity and complexity of conditions associated with POP1 mutations.

## Interactions
The human gene POP1 encodes a protein that is a component of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) and ribonuclease MRP (RNase MRP) complexes, which are involved in the processing of tRNA and rRNA, respectively. POP1 interacts with RNA components of these complexes, forming stable RNA-protein complexes. The binding of POP1 to RNase P and RNase MRP RNA components occurs at a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, and this interaction is stabilized by the presence of the Pop6/Pop7 heterodimer, which reduces the dissociation constants significantly (Fagerlund2015Footprinting).

POP1 also interacts with other protein subunits within these complexes, such as Pop6 and Pop7, enhancing the protection of RNA regions and stabilizing the global architecture of the RNA. This interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of the RNase P/MRP complexes, as it compensates for the lack of RNA-RNA tertiary interactions seen in bacterial RNase P (Fagerlund2015Footprinting).

In addition to its role in RNase P and MRP, POP1 is involved in the formation of the inflammasome, where it negatively regulates the inflammatory response by binding directly to ASC through a PYD:PYD interaction, preventing ASC from recruiting to Nod-like receptor NLRPs (Choi2015Crystal).
