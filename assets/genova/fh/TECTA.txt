# TECTA

## Overview
The TECTA gene encodes the protein tectorin alpha, a crucial component of the tectorial membrane (TM) in the cochlea, which plays a significant role in auditory transduction. Tectorin alpha is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored extracellular matrix protein that contributes to the structural integrity and functional organization of the TM by forming a dense matrix of tectorin and collagen fibers. This organization is essential for the mechanical transmission and amplification of sound waves to sensory hair cells. The protein is characterized by several domains, including the NIDO domain, von Willebrand factor (vWF) domains, and a zona pellucida (ZP) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other extracellular matrix components. Mutations in the TECTA gene can lead to various forms of non-syndromic hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory health (Niazi2024Microvilli; HashemzadehChaleshtori2017TECTA; Kim2019The).

## Structure
The TECTA protein, encoded by the TECTA gene, is a large glycoprotein with a predicted mass of 239 kDa. It contains 33 potential sites for N-glycosylation, which are important for its stability and function (Goodyear2018Structure). The protein is composed of several distinct domains: an N-terminal entactin G1-like (NIDO) domain, a central zonadhesin-like domain with von Willebrand factor type D repeats, cysteine-rich C8 regions, and trypsin inhibitor-like (TIL) domains, and a C-terminal zona pellucida (ZP) domain (Goodyear2018Structure; MorenoPelayo2008Characterization). 

TECTA is initially produced as a membrane-bound, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored precursor. It is released at or while in transit to the plasma membrane by a furin-like endoproteinase, which acts at a tetrabasic cleavage site upstream of the GPI-anchor addition signal (Goodyear2018Structure). The GPI anchorage is crucial for TECTA's surface expression, stability, and multimerization, as it prevents diffusion and facilitates the organization of collagen fibrils in the tectorial membrane (Kim2019The). 

Mutations in TECTA can lead to hearing loss, with missense mutations typically causing dominant hearing loss and truncating mutations causing recessive hearing loss (MorenoPelayo2008Characterization).

## Function
The TECTA gene encodes the protein α-tectorin, which is essential for the organization and function of the tectorial membrane (TM) in the cochlea, a critical component for auditory transduction. α-tectorin is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored extracellular matrix protein that plays a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity of the TM by organizing its domain-specific matrix architecture (Niazi2024Microvilli; Kim2019The). 

In healthy human cells, TECTA is involved in forming dense tectorin fibers and collagen-crosslinking fibers, which are crucial for the proper organization of the TM. This organization is necessary for the mechanical transmission and amplification of sound waves to the sensory hair cells (Niazi2024Microvilli; Kim2019The). The protein contains several domains, including the NIDO domain, von Willebrand factor (vWF) domains, and a zona pellucida (ZP) domain, which facilitate its interactions with other extracellular matrix components (Kim2019The).

TECTA's function is also dependent on its localization to the microvillus tip, where it regulates the attachment of collagen fibrils, maintaining the stability and organization of the TM. This process is mediated by proteolytic shedding, which is crucial for the multimerization of ZP domains and the recruitment of collagen fibrils (Niazi2024Microvilli; Kim2019The). Proper functioning of TECTA is vital for hearing, as mutations can lead to hearing impairments due to structural defects in the TM (HashemzadehChaleshtori2017TECTA).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TECTA gene are associated with various forms of non-syndromic hearing loss. Autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL), specifically the DFNA8/12 subtype, is often caused by missense mutations in the TECTA gene. These mutations can lead to different types of sensorineural hearing loss depending on the affected domain of the α-tectorin protein. For instance, missense mutations in the zona pellucida (ZP) domain are linked to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (MFSNHL), while those in the ZA region result in high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (HFSNHL) (Hildebrand2011DFNA812; Plantinga2006A).

Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB21) is associated with nonsense mutations in TECTA, which lead to truncated proteins and severe pre-lingual hearing loss (Asgharzade2017A; Mustapha1999An). These mutations disrupt the structure and function of the tectorial membrane, impairing auditory processing. The clinical significance of TECTA mutations is underscored by their prevalence in certain populations and their role in hereditary hearing loss (Asgharzade2017A; Yasukawa2019The). The pathogenicity of these mutations is often confirmed through genetic analysis and co-segregation studies (Asgharzade2017A).

## Interactions
TECTA, or tectorin alpha, is a key component of the tectorial membrane (TM) in the cochlea and interacts with several proteins to maintain the structural integrity and function of the TM. TECTA interacts with TECTB, another glycoprotein, to form the striated-sheet matrix of the TM. This matrix is composed of collagen fibrils embedded in a structure formed by the ZP domains of TECTA and TECTB, which may form filamentous structures through homo- or heteromeric interactions (Legan2013Three; Goodyear2018Structure).

CEACAM16 is another protein that interacts with TECTA, potentially providing cross-linking through its Ig variable-like domains. This interaction is crucial for the formation of the striated-sheet matrix, as evidenced by studies in mutant mice (Goodyear2018Structure). TECTA also interacts with collagen fibrils, which are recruited to the apical surface of cochlear supporting cells. This interaction is essential for the bundled organization of collagen fibrils and the growth of the TM (Kim2019The).

Mutations in TECTA can disrupt these interactions, leading to structural defects in the TM and associated hearing loss (MorenoPelayo2008Characterization).
