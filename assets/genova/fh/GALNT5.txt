# GALNT5

## Overview
GALNT5 is a gene that encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 5, which is a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is primarily involved in the initial step of O-linked glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification process that attaches N-acetylgalactosamine to serine or threonine residues on proteins. This modification is essential for various cellular functions, including protein stability, signaling, and cell-cell interactions (Chia2016Short). The GALNT5 enzyme is localized in the Golgi apparatus and is known for its tissue-specific expression, with significant roles in the sublingual gland, colon, stomach, and small intestine (Kato2021Polypeptide). As part of the GALNT family, GALNT5 is crucial for the synthesis of the Tn antigen, impacting biological processes such as hormonal regulation and growth factor signaling (Chia2016Short). Alterations in the GALNT5 gene have been associated with various diseases, including cancers and autism spectrum disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Homs2016Genetic; Stiegelbauer2017miR-196b-5p).

## Function
GALNT5, or polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 5, is an enzyme that plays a critical role in the initial step of O-linked glycosylation. This process involves the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to serine or threonine residues on proteins, a modification essential for protein stability, signaling, and cell-cell interactions (Chia2016Short). GALNT5 is localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it influences various cellular functions by modulating the O-glycoproteome (Chia2016Short).

The expression of GALNT5 is highly tissue-specific, with notable expression in the sublingual gland and colon, and moderate expression in the stomach and small intestine (Kato2021Polypeptide). This suggests that GALNT5 may have specialized roles in these tissues, although specific functions in healthy human cells are not well-documented (Chia2016Short).

GALNT5 is part of the GALNT family, which is responsible for the synthesis of the Tn antigen, a component of the O-GalNAc glycosylation process. This family of enzymes is crucial for the regulation of protein processing and secretion, impacting various biological processes such as hormonal regulation and growth factor signaling (Chia2016Short).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GALNT5 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly cancers. In colorectal cancer (CRC), GALNT5 is involved in cancer cell migration and metastasis through its interaction with miR-196b-5p and HOXB7. Low expression of miR-196b-5p, which regulates GALNT5, is associated with poor prognosis in CRC patients. This suggests that GALNT5 may play a role in cancer progression and could be a potential therapeutic target (Stiegelbauer2017miR-196b-5p).

In breast cancer, a missense mutation in GALNT5 has been linked to a loss of enzymatic activity, indicating a possible association between GALNT5 mutations and breast cancer development (Hussain2013Clinically). Additionally, low intra-tumoral expression of GALNT5 has been identified as a negative prognostic predictor in gastric cancer (Stiegelbauer2017miR-196b-5p).

In the context of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a rare methylation single-nucleotide variant (meSNV) causing hypomethylation within the GALNT5 gene has been observed, correlating with altered expression of the nearby ERMN gene. This suggests a potential link between GALNT5 hypomethylation and ASD (Homs2016Genetic).
