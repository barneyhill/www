# HSD17B14

## Overview
HSD17B14 is a gene that encodes the enzyme hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 14, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. This enzyme plays a critical role in the metabolism of sex steroids by catalyzing the oxidation of estradiol to estrone and testosterone to androstenedione, thereby modulating the activity of these potent hormones. The protein is characterized by a tetrameric quaternary structure and a catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic function. It is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, liver, and reproductive organs, suggesting its involvement in maintaining hormonal balance and contributing to broader physiological processes. The enzyme's activity is NAD(P)+-dependent, and its expression has been linked to hormone-dependent cancers and congenital conditions, highlighting its clinical significance in steroid metabolism (Sivik2012Expression; Bertoletti2016New).

## Structure
The human HSD17B14 protein, also known as 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 14, is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family. Its molecular structure has been elucidated through crystallization studies, revealing a tetrameric quaternary structure. The protein forms a homotetramer with A2B2 symmetry, consisting of two identical dimers, each composed of two monomers. These dimers differ in the conformation of a flexible loop, which is open in one dimer and closed in the other, affecting the active site size (Bertoletti2016New).

The tertiary structure includes a catalytic triad composed of Ser141, Tyr154, and Lys158, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. The cofactor NAD+ is buried within the binding pocket, coordinated by hydrogen bonds with amino acids and water molecules, inducing a shift in the flexible loop to reduce the active site size (Bertoletti2016New). The protein's structure also features a conical active site with a solvent-exposed opening, and the C-terminal part of the monomer is arranged around the surface of the bordering monomer (Bertoletti2016New).

The enzyme's structure is characterized by a large, lipophilic binding site, and it is expressed in various human tissues, including the brain, liver, and placenta (Bertoletti2016New).

## Function
HSD17B14, also known as 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 14, is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of sex steroids, specifically catalyzing the oxidation of estradiol to estrone and testosterone to androstenedione. This enzyme is part of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family and functions as an oxidative enzyme, favoring the inactivation of potent sex steroids, which is crucial for maintaining hormonal balance in various tissues (Sivik2012Expression).

HSD17B14 is expressed in several human tissues, including the uterus, testis, breast, and throughout the gastrointestinal tract, with prominent activity in the stomach, colon, and rectum. Its expression in these tissues suggests a role in intracrine sex steroid interconversion and a protective function against excess reduced steroidal agents (Sivik2012Expression). The enzyme is also found in the brain, liver, placenta, and kidney, indicating its involvement in broader physiological processes (Bertoletti2016New).

In reproductive tissues, HSD17B14 is strongly expressed in the uterus and testis, suggesting its potential role in regulating bioactive sex hormone levels crucial for tissue homeostasis (Sivik2012Expression). The enzyme's activity is NAD(P)+-dependent, contributing to the local synthesis of sex steroids from adrenal precursors, affecting hormonal profiles in target tissues (Sivik2012Expression).

## Clinical Significance
The HSD17B14 gene, encoding the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 14, has been implicated in various clinical contexts due to its role in steroid metabolism. Alterations in the expression of HSD17B14 have been associated with hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer. The enzyme's activity in converting potent sex steroids into less bioactive forms suggests its involvement in maintaining hormonal balance, which may influence cancer prognosis and treatment response (Sivik2012Expression).

In the context of congenital conditions, the dysregulated expression of HSD17B14 has been noted in hypospadias, a common congenital malformation of the male reproductive system. Although the specific clinical significance of HSD17B14 mutations or expression changes in hypospadias is not detailed, the gene is included among those analyzed for expression differences in this condition (Chen2020Dysregulated).

Despite these associations, the precise mechanisms by which HSD17B14 mutations or expression alterations contribute to these diseases remain unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate the clinical implications of HSD17B14 in these and potentially other conditions related to steroid metabolism (Sivik2012Expression).
