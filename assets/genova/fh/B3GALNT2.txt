# B3GALNT2

## Overview
B3GALNT2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2, a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase. This enzyme is integral to the glycosylation process, specifically in the synthesis of type-I LacdiNAc structures on glycoproteins. It plays a pivotal role in the modification of α-dystroglycan, a process essential for muscle integrity and brain function. The B3GALNT2 protein is localized primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, where it participates in early glycan processing. Mutations in the B3GALNT2 gene are linked to a range of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathies, highlighting its clinical significance in congenital disorders characterized by defective glycosylation (Praissman2014Mammalian; D’haenens2022Expanding; Nakane2019Identification).

## Structure
The B3GALNT2 protein is a type II transmembrane enzyme involved in glycosylation processes. It features a single transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (MATSUO2013Involvement). The protein is part of the GT31 family of glycosyltransferases and contains conserved motifs essential for its function, including a hydrophobic motif for sugar nucleotide binding and a DxD motif for metal ion coordination (Petit2020A).

B3GALNT2 is predicted to have two N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn-116 and Asn-174, which are conserved across species. These glycosylation sites are important for the secretion of the enzyme, although they do not affect its retention in the Golgi apparatus (MATSUO2013Involvement). The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues, forming type-I LacdiNAc structures on glycoproteins (Nakane2019Identification).

The B3GALNT2 gene is distributed across several exons, and the protein is part of the BGR subgroup within the GT31 family, indicating its evolutionary divergence and specialization (Petit2020A). The protein does not have an X domain, similar to other proteins in its subgroup (Petit2020A).

## Function
B3GALNT2 encodes the enzyme beta-1,3-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2, which plays a crucial role in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan (α-DG) in healthy human cells. This enzyme is responsible for transferring N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) in a β1,3 linkage to GlcNAc-β1,4-Man-α on α-DG, a modification essential for the formation of functional glycans that enable α-DG to bind to extracellular matrix proteins. This binding is vital for muscle integrity and function, as well as for proper brain function (Praissman2014Mammalian; Maroofian2017B3GALNT2).

B3GALNT2 is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and partly in the Golgi apparatus, indicating its involvement in the early stages of glycan processing (Nakane2019Identification). The enzyme's activity is significant in synthesizing type-I LacdiNAc (LDN) structures on N-glycans, which are important for cellular functions and are found on intracellular glycoproteins (Nakane2019Identification). B3GALNT2's role in glycosylation pathways highlights its importance in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis, impacting processes such as cellular adhesion and interaction (Praissman2014Mammalian).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the B3GALNT2 gene are associated with a spectrum of muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathies (MDDGs), which are congenital disorders characterized by defective glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. These conditions range from severe forms like Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS) and muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) to milder phenotypes such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (Maroofian2017B3GALNT2; D’haenens2022Expanding). Patients with B3GALNT2 mutations often exhibit intellectual disability, motor delay, and epilepsy, with some cases presenting without significant muscular or ocular involvement (Maroofian2017B3GALNT2; D’haenens2022Expanding).

The phenotypic outcomes of B3GALNT2 mutations can vary significantly, with some individuals showing severe neurological symptoms like cobblestone lissencephaly and hydrocephaly, while others have milder developmental disorders (Ducro2015A; D’haenens2022Expanding). The specific mutation type, such as missense or truncating variants, influences the severity of the clinical phenotype, although there is not always a direct correlation between genotype and phenotype (Maroofian2017B3GALNT2).

Alterations in B3GALNT2 expression have also been linked to intellectual disability, with increased expression in progenitor cells associated with lower IQ (Aygün2020Genetic). In addition, overexpression of B3GALNT2 has been implicated in breast cancer, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, where it promotes cell growth and survival (MATSUO2013Involvement).
