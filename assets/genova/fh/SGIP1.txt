# SGIP1

## Overview
The SGIP1 gene encodes the SH3GL interacting endocytic adaptor 1 protein, which is primarily involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a vital cellular process for internalizing molecules and particles. This protein is categorized as an endocytic adaptor and is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release, thereby influencing synaptic transmission and neuronal communication. SGIP1 interacts with proteins containing SH3 domains and is essential for maintaining the cell surface stability of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) in axonal compartments, impacting CB1R's signaling functions related to mood and stress handling. Additionally, SGIP1 is implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis, with genetic variations linked to obesity and diabetes, highlighting its significance in energy balance and metabolic disorders (Dergai2010Intersectin; Durydivka2023SGIP1).

## Structure
SGIP1 (SH3GL interacting endocytic adaptor 1) is a protein involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, characterized by its μ homology domain (μHD) that interacts with DPF motifs in the Eps15 protein. The SGIP1 μHD has a unique structural feature, including a long α-helix inserted between β6 and β7, which influences the conformation of adjacent regions and is critical for Eps15 interaction (Shimada2016Structural). The μHD of SGIP1 binds to a novel ligand-binding site, distinct from other μHDs, and recognizes two consecutive DPF motifs that adopt type-I β-turn conformations stabilized by intramotif interactions (Shimada2016Structural).

SGIP1 is predominantly expressed in the brain and is a brain-specific homolog of FCHo1 and FCHo2, which are also involved in endocytosis. SGIP1α, a variant of SGIP1, contains a membrane phospholipid-binding domain, indicating potential functional diversity among its isoforms (Shimada2016Structural). The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could affect its function and interactions. The presence of SGIP1 orthologs in various vertebrates suggests conserved physiological roles across species (Shimada2016Structural).

## Function
SGIP1 (SH3GL interacting endocytic adaptor 1) is a protein primarily involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a critical cellular process for internalizing molecules and particles. SGIP1 interacts with proteins containing SH3 domains and is active in the cytoplasm, particularly in neuronal tissues. It plays a significant role in synaptic vesicle recycling and neurotransmitter release, influencing synaptic transmission and neuronal communication (Dergai2010Intersectin; Lee2021SGIP1α).

In the central nervous system, SGIP1 is crucial for maintaining the cell surface stability of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) in axonal compartments. This stability is essential for CB1R's signaling functions, which include modulating synaptic transmission and affecting behaviors such as mood and stress handling (Durydivka2023SGIP1). SGIP1 hinders CB1R endocytosis, thereby augmenting its cell surface stability, which has functional consequences both in transfected cells and in vivo (Durydivka2023SGIP1).

SGIP1 is also involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. It has been associated with obesity and diabetes, and its expression is linked to energy balance in humans. Genetic variations in SGIP1 are associated with disturbed energy balance, and its expression overlaps with CB1R in brain regions involved in mood control and energy regulation (Durydivka2023SGIP1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SGIP1 gene have been implicated in several neurological and physiological conditions. SGIP1 is associated with early-onset Parkinsonism, as evidenced by a mutation identified in two sisters from an Arab family with a history of young-onset Parkinson's symptoms. This mutation affects synaptic vesicle recycling, leading to synaptic dysfunction and potentially contributing to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinsonism (Lehrer2024SNP).

SGIP1 also plays a role in modulating cannabinoid CB1 receptor signaling, which is crucial for emotionality, mood, and nociception. Alterations in SGIP1 expression can lead to changes in CB1 receptor-mediated behaviors, such as decreased anxiety-like behavior and enhanced antinociceptive effects. These changes suggest that SGIP1 could influence pain management strategies and mood regulation (Dvorakova2021SGIP1).

In the context of energy balance, increased SGIP1 expression in the hypothalamus has been linked to obesity in rodent models, indicating its potential role in regulating food intake and body weight. This suggests that SGIP1 may be involved in energy homeostasis and metabolic disorders (Trevaskis2005Src).

## Interactions
SGIP1 (SH3GL interacting endocytic adaptor 1) is involved in various protein interactions, primarily related to clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). It interacts with endophilin, a key protein in vesicle recycling, and is necessary for transferrin uptake, although not for EGF internalization (Dergai2010Intersectin). SGIP1 also binds to intersectin (ITSN1) through its proline-rich domain, interacting specifically with the SH3A and SH3E domains of ITSN1. This interaction is crucial for forming complexes in clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) (Dergai2010Intersectin).

SGIP1 is part of the muniscin family and shares functional similarities with FCHO1/2, assisting in the recruitment of the AP-2 complex to clathrin-coated pit formation sites (Durydivka2023SGIP1). It also interacts with Eps15, a scaffold protein in CME, through its μ homology domain (μHD), which binds to the DPF motif-rich region of Eps15, facilitating clathrin assembly (Shimada2016Structural).

SGIP1 modulates the function of the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) by binding to its α-helical H9 domain, promoting axonal surface expression and influencing CB1R signaling (Dvorakova2021SGIP1; FletcherJones2023SGIP1). This interaction affects CB1R-mediated β-arrestin2 signaling and ERK1/2 pathway activation, impacting emotionality, mood, and nociception (Dvorakova2021SGIP1).
