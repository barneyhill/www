# MCM7

## Overview
The MCM7 gene encodes the minichromosome maintenance complex component 7, a protein that plays a pivotal role in the initiation and elongation phases of eukaryotic DNA replication. As a part of the MCM2-7 complex, MCM7 functions as a replicative helicase, unwinding the DNA double helix to facilitate the synthesis of new DNA strands. This complex is essential for ensuring that DNA replication occurs accurately and only once per cell cycle, thereby maintaining genomic stability (Ishimi2018Regulation; Neves2017In). MCM7 is characterized by its ATPase activity, which is crucial for its helicase function, and it forms a hexameric structure with other MCM proteins to interact with DNA (Costa2009Structural). Beyond its role in DNA replication, MCM7 is involved in DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation, making it a significant focus in cancer research due to its overexpression in various malignancies (Neves2017In; Alshahrani2021Computational).

## Structure
The MCM7 protein is a component of the MCM2-7 complex, which plays a critical role in DNA replication. Structurally, MCM7 is part of a hexameric assembly that unwinds DNA during replication (Costa2009Structural). The MCM2-7 complex, including MCM7, is characterized by a central region belonging to the AAA+ superfamily of ATPases, which is highly conserved and essential for its function (Costa2009Structural). This region is involved in ATP hydrolysis, a key activity for the helicase function of the complex (Costa2009Structural).

The MCM7 protein, along with other MCM proteins, forms a toroidal structure with a central channel, allowing DNA to pass through during replication (Costa2009Structural). The complex exhibits conformational flexibility, which is crucial for its interaction with DNA and ATPase activity (Costa2009Structural). The MCM7 protein is also involved in forming a double hexamer on DNA, which is essential for the initiation of DNA replication (Noguchi2017Cryo-EM).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, influence the activity and interactions of MCM7, playing a role in regulating its function during the cell cycle (Costa2009Structural). These structural and functional characteristics make MCM7 a potential target for cancer therapy due to its overexpression in various cancer types (Alshahrani2021Computational).

## Function
MCM7 is a crucial component of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, specifically the MCM2-7 complex, which functions as a replicative helicase essential for DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. This complex is responsible for unwinding the DNA double helix, allowing the replication machinery to synthesize new DNA strands during the S-phase of the cell cycle (Ishimi2018Regulation; Neves2017In). MCM7, along with MCM4 and MCM6, directly contacts DNA, contributing to the helicase activity necessary for DNA unwinding and replication fork progression (Ishimi2018Regulation).

The MCM2-7 complex is tightly regulated to ensure that DNA replication occurs only once per cell cycle, preventing replication errors and maintaining genomic stability (Kearsey1998MCM; Neves2017In). MCM7 is involved in the regulation of DNA replication termination through polyubiquitylation, which prevents over-replication by evicting the complex from chromatin (Ishimi2018Regulation). It also plays a role in the regulation of cell growth under hypoxic conditions by interacting with HIF-1, a transcription factor, affecting its stability and activity (Ishimi2018Regulation).

In addition to its role in DNA replication, MCM7 is involved in DNA damage repair and the maintenance of DNA replication fidelity, which is crucial for preventing genomic instability and potential pathologies such as cancer (Tsao2004Interaction; Neves2017In).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the MCM7 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In prostate cancer, MCM7 amplification and overexpression are associated with cancer progression and aggressiveness. Studies have shown that increased MCM7 expression correlates with larger tumor volumes, local invasion, and higher Gleason scores, indicating poor differentiation. This overexpression is linked to a higher rate of prostate cancer relapse within five years post-surgery, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Ren2005MCM7).

In the context of neurodevelopmental disorders, a homozygous mutation in MCM7 has been identified as a cause of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) and intellectual disability. This mutation leads to impaired cell replication and brain development, resulting in severe microcephaly and intellectual disability. The mutation disrupts normal DNA replication and cell proliferation, particularly affecting neural progenitor cells during cortical neurogenesis (Ravindran2021Homozygous).

In cutaneous melanoma, MCM7 overexpression is linked to worse tumor grades and neoplastic relapse. Silencing MCM7 in melanoma cells has been shown to promote autophagy and apoptosis by inactivating the AKT1/mTOR signaling pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Yang2019MCM7).

## Interactions
MCM7, a component of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, is involved in various protein interactions essential for DNA replication. It interacts with other MCM proteins, specifically MCM3, MCM4, MCM5, and MCM6, with the strongest interaction observed with MCM3 (Numata2010Interaction). MCM7 also directly interacts with RAD17, a sensor protein involved in recognizing single-stranded DNA regions at arrested DNA replication forks (Numata2010Interaction).

MCM7 is part of the MCM2-7 complex, which interacts with MCM-BP, a protein that binds to MCM6 and MCM7. MCM-BP is suggested to replace MCM2 in the complex and is mainly associated with MCM7, indicating a significant interaction (Kon2011Binding). MCM7 also interacts with TIM and TIPIN, proteins involved in DNA replication fork progression, with varying affinities (Numata2010Interaction).

Additionally, MCM7 interacts with the Rb-N fragment, an amino-terminal fragment of the Retinoblastoma protein, which inhibits DNA replication by interacting with MCM7's carboxyl-terminal region (Numata2010Interaction). Prohibitin, another protein, binds to MCM7 during the G1 phase, inhibiting premature DNA replication (Rizwani2009Prohibitin). MCM7 also shows a close physical interaction with RPA70, a protein involved in DNA replication, particularly during the S phase (Kinoshita2007Colocalization).
