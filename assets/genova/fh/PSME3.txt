# PSME3

## Overview
PSME3, also known as proteasome activator subunit 3 or PA28γ, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the regulation of the proteasome, a complex responsible for protein degradation within cells. The protein encoded by PSME3 is a member of the proteasome activator family and plays a critical role in modulating the activity of the 20S proteasome, particularly in the degradation of ubiquitin-independent proteins. It forms a homoheptameric ring structure that enhances the proteasome's trypsin-like activity, influencing cell cycle regulation and chromosomal stability (Yan2014Dusp3; Kors2019Regulation). PSME3 is also implicated in various cellular processes, including the response to oxidative stress and the regulation of immune responses, particularly in the context of cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and immune evasion (Boulpicante2020Tumors; Huang2016Proteasome).

## Structure
PSME3, also known as proteasome activator subunit 3 or PA28γ, is a component of the 11S proteasome regulator complex. It typically forms a heptameric ring structure, contributing to its quaternary structure. This configuration is crucial for its role in regulating proteasome activity, particularly in the degradation of ubiquitin-independent proteins (Yan2014Dusp3). PSME3 contains an ATPase domain, which is essential for its function, although specific details about its primary, secondary, and tertiary structures are not provided in the available context.

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can influence the activity and interactions of PSME3. Additionally, O-GlcNAcylation at serine 111 is a significant modification that affects its function, particularly in the context of embryonic stem cell pluripotency and the degradation of specific proteins like Ddx6 (Pecori2021Sitespecific). This modification acts as a regulatory switch, impacting the stability of proteins and cellular processes (Pecori2021Sitespecific). The context does not provide information on splice variant isoforms or specific secondary and tertiary structural details.

## Function
PSME3, also known as proteasome activator subunit 3, is a crucial component of the proteasome system, primarily located in the nucleus where it forms a homoheptameric structure. It associates with the 20S proteasome, enhancing its trypsin-like activity while suppressing other proteolytic activities, which leads to a preference for cleavage after basic amino acids (Kors2019Regulation). PSME3 plays a significant role in cell cycle regulation by facilitating the degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins such as p21 and SRC-3, and it is involved in the MDM2-dependent turnover of p53 (Kors2019Regulation). It is also implicated in maintaining chromosomal stability during mitosis and is recruited to sites of DNA double-strand breaks (Kors2019Regulation).

In addition to its role in cell cycle regulation, PSME3 is involved in the degradation of oxidized proteins, particularly under oxidative stress conditions. It enhances the degradation of oxidized hemoglobin, although its effect is weaker compared to other proteasome regulators like PA28αβ (Pickering2012Differential). PSME3 is also important for protein homeostasis and antioxidant response, which are critical for healthy cellular function (Huang2016Proteasome).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PSME3 gene, also known as proteasome activator subunit 3, have been implicated in various cancers. PSME3 is overexpressed in several cancer types, including melanoma, colon, lung, liver, thyroid, and colorectal cancers, where it is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive clinical features (He2012REGγ; Song2019Silencing; Boulpicante2020Tumors). In colorectal cancer, high PSME3 expression correlates with lymph node involvement and reduced survival, and its silencing enhances radiosensitivity by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest (Song2019Silencing).

PSME3 overexpression negatively impacts antigen presentation, particularly MHC-I antigen presentation, which is crucial for immune recognition of cancer cells. This overexpression is linked to immune evasion in tumors, as it reduces the presentation of tumor-associated antigens, allowing cancer cells to escape immunosurveillance (Boulpicante2020Tumors). Knockdown or knockout of PSME3 enhances antigen presentation, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for improving immune responses against tumors (Boulpicante2020Tumors).

PSME3 is also associated with oncogenic pathways involving cMyc and p53, and its expression levels may serve as a prognostic marker for cancer progression (He2012REGγ). High PSME3 expression is linked to poorer overall survival in certain cancers, such as liver hepatocellular carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma (Dong2024Comprehensive).

## Interactions
PSME3, also known as PA28γ, is involved in various protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. It interacts with the 20S proteasome to form the 11S proteasome complex, which is crucial for the degradation of ubiquitin-independent substrates (Boulpicante2020Tumors). PSME3 also interacts with PIP30/FAM192A, a regulator that specifically binds to PA28γ, affecting its function in RNA processing. This interaction is stabilized by CK2 phosphorylation, which influences the dynamics of Cajal bodies and proteasome peptidase activities (JonikNowak2018PIP30FAM192A).

In cancer cells, PSME3 is overexpressed and interacts with proteins involved in immune evasion, such as those regulating MHC-I antigen presentation. This interaction leads to the degradation of regulatory proteins like p21, p16, and p14, and contributes to the MDM2-mediated degradation of p53, enhancing tumorigenicity (Boulpicante2020Tumors). PSME3 also forms part of a protein-protein interaction network with other proteasome subunits and immune-related proteins, including PSME1, PSME2, PSMA5, PSMD8, PSMD14, NCOA3, RXRA, TNF, and IFNG, as identified through the STRING database (Dong2024Comprehensive). These interactions highlight PSME3's multifaceted role in protein degradation and immune response regulation.
