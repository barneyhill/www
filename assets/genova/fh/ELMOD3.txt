# ELMOD3

## Overview
ELMOD3 is a gene that encodes the protein ELMO domain containing 3, which is a member of the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family. This protein is characterized by its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, particularly targeting small GTPases such as Arl2, although its activity is less pronounced compared to its paralogs ELMOD1 and ELMOD2 (Jaworek2013An). ELMOD3 plays a significant role in regulating actin dynamics, which is crucial for the structural integrity and function of stereocilia in the inner ear, thereby contributing to auditory function (Jaworek2013An). The protein is also involved in ciliogenesis and vesicle trafficking, interacting with proteins like Rab1A and Flotillin2, and is implicated in the trafficking of ciliary proteins such as INPP5E and IFT140 (Turn2021The; Liu2023Gene). Mutations in the ELMOD3 gene have been linked to various forms of hearing loss, highlighting its clinical significance in auditory health (Li2018ELMOD3).

## Function
The ELMOD3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the engulfment and cell motility (ELMO) family, which is involved in regulating GTPases within the Ras superfamily. ELMOD3 exhibits GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, particularly against Arl2, a small GTPase, although its activity is lower compared to its paralogs ELMOD1 and ELMOD2 (Jaworek2013An). This GAP activity is crucial for regulating actin dynamics, which is essential for maintaining the structure and function of stereocilia in the inner ear (Jaworek2013An).

In healthy human cells, ELMOD3 is expressed in the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells, where it co-localizes with the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a role in actin-based structures (Jaworek2013An). The protein is also detected along the kinocilium in developing cochlear hair cells, indicating a potential role in the assembly of kinocilium architecture and pathways regulating planar cell polarity (Jaworek2013An). ELMOD3's involvement in these cellular processes is critical for auditory function, as it contributes to the maintenance and function of hair cells, which are essential for hearing (Li2018ELMOD3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELMOD3 gene are associated with various forms of hearing loss. A specific mutation, c.794T.C, resulting in the p.Leu265Ser substitution, has been linked to autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in a large Pakistani family. This mutation impairs the gene's function in the inner ear, particularly affecting the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells, which are crucial for hearing (Jaworek2013An). The mutation disrupts the protein's GTPase-activating activity, which is essential for maintaining the actin cytoskeleton in these cells (Jaworek2013An).

Another mutation, c.512A>G, leading to the p.His171Arg substitution, is associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss. This mutation affects the stability and function of the ELMOD3 protein, altering its localization and disrupting its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton (Li2018ELMOD3; Liu2023Gene). The genetic heterogeneity of ELMOD3-related hearing loss is evident, as different mutations can result in varying inheritance patterns and clinical presentations (Li2018ELMOD3). These findings underscore the critical role of ELMOD3 in auditory function and its potential impact on hearing when mutated.

## Interactions
ELMOD3, a member of the ELMO family of proteins, is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. It interacts with Rab1A and Flotillin2, playing a role in regulating lumen formation via vesicle trafficking (Liu2023Gene). ELMOD3 is also implicated in ciliogenesis and ciliary protein traffic, where it acts at the Golgi and cilia. In this context, ELMOD3 is involved in the trafficking of proteins such as INPP5E and IFT140, with its knockout leading to their accumulation at the Golgi apparatus (Turn2021The). 

The protein is a target of the cilia-related RFX2 transcription factor and localizes to basal bodies, suggesting a role in ciliary function (Turn2021The). ELMOD3's interactions are not limited to ciliary processes; it also exhibits GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for Arl2, a member of the Arf family of regulatory GTPases, which are involved in energy metabolism and cytoskeleton dynamics (Li2018ELMOD3). Despite these insights, specific details on the direct physical interactions of ELMOD3 with other proteins or nucleic acids remain limited in the available literature.
