# LOXL4

## Overview
LOXL4, or lysyl oxidase-like 4, is a gene that encodes a member of the lysyl oxidase family of enzymes, which are crucial for the biogenesis of connective tissue. The protein product, lysyl oxidase-like 4, is an amine oxidase that plays a significant role in the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, thereby contributing to the structural integrity and elasticity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Greene2020Lysyl; Aumiller2017Comparative). This enzyme is characterized by a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal region containing scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions (Aumiller2017Comparative). LOXL4 is implicated in various physiological processes, including tissue repair and development, and has been associated with pathological conditions such as cancer, where it can function as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the cellular context (Komalasari2023Lysyl; Shao2019Derepression).

## Structure
LOXL4 is a member of the lysyl oxidase family, characterized by a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain includes a His-X-His-X-His copper-binding motif and a lysine-tyrosylquinone (LTQ) cofactor, which are crucial for the enzyme's function in cross-linking collagen and elastin (Greene2020Lysyl; Aumiller2017Comparative). The N-terminal region of LOXL4 contains four scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains, which are involved in cell adhesion and protein-protein interactions, although their precise function remains unclear (Greene2020Lysyl; Aumiller2017Comparative).

The interaction between LOXL4 and the p53 protein involves specific residues, with ionic bonds formed by LOXL4 D677/679 and p53 K381/382, stabilizing p53 and facilitating its nuclear entry and activation (Shao2019Derepression). This interaction highlights the potential role of LOXL4 in tumor suppression by regulating p53 activation in liver cancer with wild-type p53 (Shao2019Derepression).

LOXL4 may undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, which could influence its function or localization. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of LOXL4 may exist, potentially altering its structural and functional properties (Aumiller2017Comparative).

## Function
LOXL4 (lysyl oxidase-like 4) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by catalyzing the cross-linking of collagen and elastin fibers. This process is essential for maintaining the structural integrity and elasticity of tissues. LOXL4 functions by oxidatively deaminating lysine residues, which facilitates the cross-linking of collagen and elastin, transforming these components into a non-soluble state that is vital for ECM stability (Wei2020Role).

In healthy human cells, LOXL4 is primarily secreted by smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, where it contributes to ECM remodeling and repair, ensuring proper tissue tensile strength and stability (Wei2020Role). The enzyme is active in the extracellular space, where it supports the structural and mechanical properties of tissues, playing a role in processes such as tissue formation, mechanical rigidity, and stiffness during organ development (Wei2020Role).

LOXL4 is also involved in maintaining the structural integrity of lung tissues, where it is expressed in bronchial and alveolar epithelium, macrophages, and fibroblasts, suggesting its role in maintaining healthy lung function (Aumiller2017Comparative).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the LOXL4 gene have been implicated in various cancers. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), overexpression of miR-328-5p leads to the downregulation of LOXL4, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth. This suggests that LOXL4 downregulation may contribute to NSCLC progression, and its expression levels could have clinical significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of this cancer type (Ji2022Overexpression).

In bladder cancer, LOXL4 is frequently silenced due to promoter hypermethylation, which is a common epigenetic alteration. This silencing is associated with the inhibition of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, indicating a potential tumor suppressor role for LOXL4. The reintroduction of LOXL4 in bladder cancer cell lines has been shown to reduce ERK activation and colony formation, supporting its function as a tumor suppressor (Wu2007LOXL1).

In breast cancer, LOXL4 expression is regulated by the EZH2-miR-29b/miR-30d axis. EZH2-mediated silencing of these microRNAs leads to increased LOXL4 expression, which is associated with enhanced cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. This pathway highlights the dual role of LOXL4 in cancer, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context (Yin2020EZH2mediated).

## Interactions
LOXL4 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in various cancer types. In liver cancer, LOXL4 interacts with the p53 protein, particularly binding to its basic domain. This interaction is crucial for the reactivation of compromised p53, leading to increased apoptosis in liver cancer cells with wild-type p53 (Shao2019Derepression). The binding involves ionic bonds between specific residues, stabilizing p53 and allowing its accumulation and activation (Shao2019Derepression).

In breast cancer, LOXL4 interacts with annexin A2 on the cell surface. This interaction is specific to LOXL4 among the lysyl oxidase family members and is involved in the multimerization of annexin A2, which prevents the internalization of integrin β-1. This mechanism enhances cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion (Komalasari2023Lysyl).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, LOXL4 is involved in activating the FAK/Src signaling pathway, which promotes cell migration and invasion. This activation is dependent on LOXL4's amine oxidase activity and involves a hydrogen peroxide-mediated mechanism (Li2019Exosomemediated).
