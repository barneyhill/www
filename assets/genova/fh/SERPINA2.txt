# SERPINA2

## Overview
SERPINA2 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the serpin superfamily, specifically categorized as a serine protease inhibitor. Unlike its homolog SERPINA1, which is primarily expressed in the liver and secreted extracellularly, SERPINA2 is an intracellular glycoprotein localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is expressed in various tissues such as leukocytes, testes, brain, colon, and lung (Marques2013SERPINA2). The protein, serpin family A member 2, is characterized by its unique molecular structure, including specific amino acid substitutions that influence its function and interaction with ER chaperones (Marques2013SERPINA2). Although SERPINA2 shares structural similarities with SERPINA1, it has diverged evolutionarily, potentially acquiring a novel function as a chymotrypsin-like serpin with altered protease affinity (Marques2013SERPINA2). The exact physiological role of SERPINA2 remains to be fully elucidated, but it is hypothesized to be involved in ER-associated degradation and protein quality control processes (Marques2013SERPINA2).

## Structure
SERPINA2 is a member of the serpin superfamily, characterized by its unique molecular structure and evolutionary divergence from its close homologue, SERPINA1. The primary structure of SERPINA2 includes specific amino acid substitutions such as M358W, L241A, and M242Q, which impact its structure and function, particularly in protease-inhibitor complex formation and hydrophobicity (Marques2013SERPINA2). The secondary structure retains the typical serpin reactive center loop (RCL), crucial for inhibitory activity, although the sequences flanking the reactive site have diverged, with a tryptophan-serine motif instead of the methionine-serine motif found in SERPINA1 (Seixas2006Sequence).

The tertiary structure of SERPINA2 is modeled based on the crystal structure of SERPINA1, sharing 75-81% homology, suggesting it maintains a stable conformation that reduces susceptibility to polymerization (Marques2013SERPINA2). SERPINA2 is partially glycosylated, with N-linked glycosylation contributing to its molecular weight of approximately 52 kDa (Marques2013SERPINA2). It interacts with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones CANX and PDIA3, indicating its role in ER quality control (Marques2013SERPINA2). Unlike SERPINA1, SERPINA2 is not secreted extracellularly and does not form insoluble aggregates, suggesting it may be a non-polymerogenic serpin (Marques2013SERPINA2).

## Function
SERPINA2, a member of the serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs) superfamily, is expressed in various tissues, including leukocytes, testes, brain, colon, and lung, but not in the liver, where its homolog SERPINA1 is primarily expressed (Marques2013SERPINA2). Unlike SERPINA1, SERPINA2 is an intracellular glycoprotein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and does not form insoluble aggregates, indicating it is a non-polymerogenic protein (Marques2013SERPINA2). It interacts with ER chaperones such as calnexin (CANX) and protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3), suggesting a role in protein folding or quality control within the ER (Marques2013SERPINA2).

SERPINA2 has undergone evolutionary divergence from SERPINA1, potentially acquiring a new function as a chymotrypsin-like SERPIN with altered protease affinity (Marques2013SERPINA2). The gene may act as a substrate or adjuvant of ER-chaperones, indicating a role outside of traditional proteolysis regulation (Marques2013SERPINA2). Despite its divergence, SERPINA2 retains the typical structure of the SERPIN reactive center loop, suggesting potential protease inhibitory activity (Seixas2006Sequence). The exact function of SERPINA2 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated, but it may be involved in specific cellular processes in certain tissues or cell types (Marques2013SERPINA2).

## Interactions
SERPINA2, a member of the serpin superfamily, is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and interacts with several ER chaperones. It co-localizes with calnexin (CANX) and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 (PDIA3), both of which are involved in ER quality control processes. The interaction with CANX is minor, while PDIA3 shows a stronger association with SERPINA2, suggesting a significant role in the CANX cycle and protein folding (Marques2013SERPINA2). These interactions indicate that SERPINA2 is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, although it is not secreted into the extracellular space like some variants of SERPINA1 (Marques2013SERPINA2).

SERPINA2 is sensitive to Endo H, indicating partial glycosylation and ER localization, which supports its role in intracellular processes rather than extracellular secretion (Marques2013SERPINA2). The study hypothesizes that SERPINA2 may interact with other proteolytic pathways, such as autophagy, although this was not observed in the same way as with the Z variant of SERPINA1 (Marques2013SERPINA2). These interactions suggest that SERPINA2 may function as a non-polymerogenic SERPIN, residing in the ER without misfolding, and possibly participating in chaperone assembly (Marques2013SERPINA2).
