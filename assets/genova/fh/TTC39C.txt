# TTC39C

## Overview
TTC39C, or tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39C, is a gene that encodes a protein characterized by the presence of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes. The protein encoded by TTC39C plays a significant role in various cellular processes, particularly within skeletal muscle cells, where it is involved in the regulation of key signaling pathways such as the ERK1/2 MAP kinase and Hedgehog pathways, essential for muscle cell differentiation and development (Hayes2019Ttc39c). Additionally, TTC39C is associated with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) A complex, indicating its involvement in retrograde transport within primary cilia, which is crucial for coordinating cell signaling during tissue development and differentiation (Hayes2019Ttc39c). The gene's expression and regulation are critical, as imbalances can disrupt muscle cell differentiation and impair signaling pathways, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease contexts (Hayes2019Ttc39c).

## Structure


## Function
TTC39C, also known as tetratricopeptide repeat domain 39C, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in several cellular processes, particularly in skeletal muscle cells. The protein contains tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes. These interactions are crucial for various cellular functions, including cell cycle regulation, transcription, and protein transport (Hayes2019Ttc39c).

In muscle cells, TTC39C is implicated in the regulation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase and Hedgehog signaling pathways, both essential for muscle cell differentiation and development. The protein's expression peaks during early muscle cell differentiation, suggesting a role in promoting proper muscle cell development. It is involved in modulating signaling pathways necessary for myogenesis, potentially acting as a scaffolding protein to facilitate protein-protein interactions required for signal transduction (Hayes2019Ttc39c).

TTC39C is also associated with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) A complex, indicating a role in retrograde transport within primary cilia. This association is important for coordinating cell signaling during tissue development and cell differentiation (Hayes2019Ttc39c). The protein's precise regulation is crucial, as both overexpression and knockdown can disrupt muscle cell differentiation and impair signaling pathways (Hayes2019Ttc39c).

## Clinical Significance
The TTC39C gene has been implicated in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), a common subtype of lung cancer. Studies have shown that TTC39C is significantly overexpressed in LUAD tissues compared to normal tissues, and this overexpression is associated with lower survival rates in patients. High expression levels of TTC39C correlate with almost zero 10-year survival probability in LUAD patients (Rong2022TTC39C; Rong2022Ttc39c). Experimental studies have demonstrated that downregulation of TTC39C in lung cancer cell lines leads to inhibited cell proliferation, metastasis, and clonogenic ability, while increasing apoptosis. In vivo studies with mice have shown that tumors in TTC39C knockdown mice are significantly smaller and lighter than those in control mice (Rong2022TTC39C; Rong2022Ttc39c).

TTC39C is also associated with diabetic maculopathy, a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes. A genome-wide association study suggested a potential link between TTC39C and diabetic maculopathy with decreased visual acuity, contributing to the understanding of genetic factors in diabetic eye diseases (Meng2019A). These findings highlight the clinical significance of TTC39C in both cancer and metabolic disorders.
