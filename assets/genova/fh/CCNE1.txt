# CCNE1

## Overview
The CCNE1 gene encodes cyclin E1, a regulatory protein that plays a pivotal role in cell cycle control, particularly in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. Cyclin E1 is a member of the cyclin family, which is characterized by its ability to form complexes with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), specifically CDK2, to regulate cell cycle progression. This protein is integral to the phosphorylation of key substrates, such as the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), facilitating the release of E2F transcription factors and the initiation of DNA replication (Satyanarayana2009Mammalian; Caldon2010Distinct). Cyclin E1 is also involved in the formation of pre-replication complexes and centrosome duplication, underscoring its multifaceted role in cellular proliferation (Wood2018Structural). The expression and degradation of cyclin E1 are tightly regulated to ensure proper cell cycle progression, with dysregulation often linked to oncogenesis and poor clinical outcomes in various cancers (Etemadmoghadam2010AmpliconDependent; Caldon2010Distinct).

## Structure
The human CCNE1 gene encodes Cyclin E1, a protein composed of 410 amino acids, which includes several splice variants and isoforms. Cyclin E1 contains a Cyclin box domain that is essential for its interaction with CDK2, facilitating the formation of an active kinase complex crucial for cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase (Fagundes2021Cyclin). The protein also features specific domains such as MRAIL and VDCLE, which mediate interactions with substrates like RB, p27 KIP1, and CDC6 (Fagundes2021Cyclin).

Cyclin E1 is regulated by phosphorylation at CDC phosphodegrons located at its N- and C-terminus, which targets it for degradation via the SCF FBW7 ubiquitin ligase complex (Wood2018Structural). This degradation is facilitated by phosphorylation at specific residues, such as T395 by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and autophosphorylation at S399 when bound to CDK2 (Wood2018Structural).

Low-molecular-weight forms of Cyclin E1, which result from post-translational cleavage, lack the nuclear localization signal and accumulate in the cytoplasm. These forms have increased affinity for CDK2 and exhibit resistance to natural CDK inhibitors (Li2022Lowmolecularweight; Fagundes2021Cyclin).

## Function
The human gene CCNE1 encodes cyclin E1, a protein that plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation, particularly during the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. Cyclin E1 forms a complex with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), which is essential for the progression of the cell cycle. This complex phosphorylates various substrates, including the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), leading to the release of E2F transcription factors and the initiation of DNA synthesis (Satyanarayana2009Mammalian; Caldon2010Distinct).

Cyclin E1 is involved in the formation of pre-replication complexes on DNA, facilitating the loading of MCM proteins, which is crucial for DNA replication (Wood2018Structural; Caldon2010Distinct). It also plays a role in centrosome duplication, where it localizes independently of Cdk2, potentially influencing centrosome duplication processes (Wood2018Structural).

The expression of cyclin E1 is tightly regulated, peaking in late G1 and early S phase, and is rapidly degraded during the S phase through phosphorylation and ubiquitination processes (Wood2018Structural; Caldon2010Distinct). This regulation is critical for maintaining normal cell cycle progression and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation, which can lead to cancer (Caldon2010Distinct).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the CCNE1 gene, which encodes cyclin E1, are implicated in various cancers due to its role in cell cycle regulation. Overexpression of CCNE1 is associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor characteristics in several cancer types. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), CCNE1 overexpression is linked to chromosomal instability, invasion, and poor patient outcomes, independent of CDK2 levels. It is crucial for the survival and expansion of malignant hepatoma cells, influencing the tumor microenvironment and immune cell infiltration (Sonntag2021Cyclin).

In ovarian cancer, CCNE1 amplification at the 19q12 locus is associated with primary treatment failure and is a key driver of oncogenesis. Knockdown of CCNE1 in cell lines leads to reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis, highlighting its role in clonogenic survival (Etemadmoghadam2010AmpliconDependent).

In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CCNE1 amplification is more frequent and is associated with poor overall survival and advanced disease stages. It is mutually exclusive with BRCA1/2 mutations, indicating a distinct pathway of tumor progression (Zhao2019CCNE1; Huang2020Genomic).

CCNE1 overexpression also contributes to chromosome instability and tumor development in liver cells, particularly in the context of viral infections like hepatitis B virus (HBV) or adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) (Aziz2019Ccne1).

## Interactions
Cyclin E1, encoded by the CCNE1 gene, is a key regulator of the cell cycle, primarily interacting with CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2) to form a complex that facilitates the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the CDC2 kinase, as cyclin E binds to the p34 CDC2 protein, leading to its activation and subsequent phosphorylation of the cyclin E fusion protein (Koff1991Human). Cyclin E1 also forms complexes with CDK2 in mammalian cells, which are active as histone H1 kinases during late G1 and early S phase, playing a significant role in cell cycle regulation (Sherr1993Mammalian).

Cyclin E1 interacts with the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the E2F transcription factor, forming higher-order complexes that regulate gene expression during the G1 and S phases by phosphorylating E2F (Sherr1993Mammalian). Additionally, cyclin E1 is involved in the phosphorylation of pRb, which is essential for the progression from the G1 phase to the S phase (Sherr1993Mammalian). Cyclin E1's interactions with these proteins highlight its central role in cell cycle control and its potential impact on tumor growth when dysregulated.
