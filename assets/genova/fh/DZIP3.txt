# DZIP3

## Overview
DZIP3 is a human gene that encodes the DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 3, a multifunctional protein primarily recognized for its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of various cellular processes, including protein ubiquitination and degradation, which are crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis. DZIP3 is characterized by its RNA-binding capabilities, facilitated by a KR motif, and its RING domain, which is essential for its ubiquitin ligase activity. The protein is implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle, particularly through its interaction with Cyclin D1, and plays a significant role in cancer progression by modulating the stability of key proteins and RNAs. DZIP3's involvement in cellular proliferation and differentiation underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in oncology (Zhou2020Long; Kolapalli2021RNABinding).

## Structure
The DZIP3 protein is characterized by several domains that contribute to its function and interactions. It contains three coiled-coil domains (CCDs), a RING domain, and an RNA-binding KR motif. The KR motif is crucial for the RNA-binding and stabilizing potential of DZIP3, particularly in its interaction with Cyclin D1 mRNA (Kolapalli2021RNABinding). The RING domain is associated with its function as an E3-ubiquitin ligase, which is important for modulating the stability of cell-cycle proteins like Cyclin D1 (Kolapalli2021RNABinding). The CCD2/3 domain provides the primary interface for interaction with Cyclin D1, while the RING domain assists in enhancing these interactions (Kolapalli2021RNABinding).

DZIP3 is a large protein reported to be cytoplasmically located and involved in binding to hepatitis B viral RNA and DAZ, a protein regulating germ cell development. Its molecular structure includes a RING finger domain near its carboxy terminus, a predicted coiled-coil region, and several tetratricopeptide repeats, which are motifs that engage in protein-protein interactions (Plans2005The). The motif composition and architecture of DZIP3 is similar to another protein, TTC3, which also contains tetratricopeptide repeats, coiled-coil regions, and a carboxy terminal RING finger domain (Plans2005The).

## Function
DZIP3 (DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 3) is a human gene encoding a protein that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation. This protein is involved in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of target proteins, a process essential for maintaining protein homeostasis within the cell (Zhou2020Long). DZIP3 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it participates in RNA processing and cell cycle regulation, impacting cellular proliferation and differentiation (De2011Effect).

In the context of cancer, DZIP3 interacts with long non-coding RNA HOTAIR, facilitating the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of proteins such as Ataxin-1 and Snurportin-1. This interaction is part of a feedback loop that controls protein expression levels, which is crucial for processes like the removal of senescent cells (Zhou2020Long). Although the specific function of DZIP3 in healthy human cells is not detailed in the provided excerpts, its role in ubiquitination suggests it is integral to regulating protein turnover and cellular homeostasis, which are vital for normal cell function and organismal health.

## Clinical Significance
The DZIP3 gene has significant clinical implications in cancer, particularly in colorectal cancer (CRC) and other types. Alterations in the expression of DZIP3 are associated with cancer progression and prognosis. In colorectal cancer, the methylation status of the DZIP3 gene is linked to patient survival times, with a hazard ratio of 40.91, indicating a strong correlation with CRC prognosis. A prediction model using methylation data from DZIP3 demonstrated good performance in classifying CRC individuals from normal controls, suggesting its potential in early-stage CRC diagnosis (Quan2020Blood).

In various cancer models, including breast and bladder cancer, DZIP3 promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Knockdown of DZIP3 in these models results in reduced tumor growth and fewer metastatic nodules, highlighting its role in cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Kolapalli2021RNABinding). DZIP3 stabilizes Cyclin D1, a protein crucial for cell cycle progression, by enhancing its mRNA stability and K63-linked ubiquitination, which prevents its degradation. This stabilization is essential for the activation of E2F transcription factors, which regulate genes necessary for cell proliferation (Kolapalli2021RNABinding). These findings suggest that targeting DZIP3 could be a potential therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
DZIP3, also known as hRUL138, is an RNA-binding RING E3-ubiquitin ligase that interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in cellular processes. One of its primary interactions is with Cyclin D1, where DZIP3 stabilizes Cyclin D1 mRNA by binding to the AU-rich elements in its 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) through its KR motif. This interaction is crucial for the stabilization of Cyclin D1 mRNA and protein, particularly during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, facilitating cell-cycle progression and cancer progression (Kolapalli2021RNABinding).

DZIP3 also enhances K63-linked ubiquitination of Cyclin D1, which stabilizes the protein and prevents its degradation. This ubiquitination process is dependent on the RING domain of DZIP3 (Kolapalli2021RNABinding). In addition to Cyclin D1, DZIP3 interacts with HOTAIR, a long noncoding RNA, to mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of Ataxin 1, and with CARM1, acting as a transcriptional coactivator of estrogen receptor alpha-responsive genes (Saha2019Transcriptomic).

In mouse embryonic stem cells, DZIP3 interacts with Ring1B, another ubiquitin ligase, to repress differentiation-inducible genes by modulating histone modifications and reorganizing 3D chromatin conformation (Inoue2015Dzip3). These interactions highlight DZIP3's multifaceted role in regulating both RNA and protein metabolism.
