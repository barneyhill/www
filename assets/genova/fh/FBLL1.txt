# FBLL1

## Overview
FBLL1 (fibrillarin like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the critical processes of ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. The protein, also named fibrillarin like 1, is primarily localized in the nucleolus and plays a significant role in the assembly and modification of ribosomal subunits, which are essential for protein synthesis and cellular function. As a homologue of the core small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) protein Fibrillarin (FBL), FBLL1 shares substantial similarity with FBL, particularly in its enzymatic core, which is crucial for RNA methyltransferase activity. Notably, FBLL1 is brain-specific and may have originated from retro-transposition, a process that has resulted in its unique structural features, such as the absence of introns and a high G+C content, potentially enhancing its translation efficiency. These attributes, along with its differential expression during neuronal differentiation, suggest that FBLL1 may have specialized roles in the brain, particularly in stabilizing specific small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) during this process (Helwak2023Roles).

## Function
FBLL1 (fibrillarin like 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in ribosomal RNA processing and ribosome biogenesis. The protein is primarily active in the nucleolus, where it participates in the assembly and modification of ribosomal subunits, a function crucial for protein synthesis and overall cellular function (Helwak2023Roles). FBLL1 is a homologue of the core snoRNP protein Fibrillarin (FBL) and shares significant similarity with FBL, particularly in the enzymatic core, retaining key residues for RNA methyltransferase activity (Helwak2023Roles). 

During neuronal differentiation, FBLL1 expression increases while FBL expression decreases, suggesting a potential role in this process. FBLL1 is brain-specific and may have originated from retro-transposition, lacking introns and having a high G+C content, which could enhance translation efficiency (Helwak2023Roles). Differences in the unstructured domain between FBLL1 and FBL, particularly in the GAR/RGG domain, may affect RNA binding and phase separation properties, potentially influencing snoRNP maturation in phase-separated Cajal bodies (Helwak2023Roles). These characteristics suggest that FBLL1 may play a role in stabilizing specific snoRNAs, such as SNORD116, during neuronal differentiation (Helwak2023Roles).
