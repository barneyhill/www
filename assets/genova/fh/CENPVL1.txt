# CENPVL1

## Overview
CENPVL1 (centromere protein V like 1) is a pseudogene located on the X chromosome, specifically within the Xp11.22 region. It is related to the centromere protein V (CENPV) gene, which encodes a protein involved in critical cellular processes such as chromosome alignment and segregation during cell division. While CENPV is essential for proper kinetochore function and genomic stability, the role of CENPVL1 is less clear due to its classification as a pseudogene. Pseudogenes like CENPVL1 are often considered non-functional; however, they may have regulatory roles, potentially influencing the expression or function of their parent genes. The clinical significance of CENPVL1 is not fully understood, but deletions in the Xp11.22 region, which includes CENPVL1, have been associated with syndromic X-linked intellectual disability, suggesting a possible indirect role in human health (Grau2017Xp11.22).

## Structure


## Function
CENPVL1 (centromere protein V like 1) is a pseudogene related to the centromere protein V (CENPV) gene, which plays a crucial role in chromosome alignment, cytokinesis, and cell motility. Although the specific functions of CENPVL1 in healthy human cells are not well-defined, pseudogenes like CENPVL1 can potentially regulate their parent genes, suggesting a possible role in modulating the functions of CENPV (Grau2017Xp11.22). CENPV is involved in ensuring proper kinetochore assembly and function, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. This activity is typically localized to the nucleus, particularly at the centromere, where it contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability by facilitating correct chromosome alignment and segregation. The loss of function in related genes, such as GSPT2, which is highly expressed in the brain and involved in translation termination, has been associated with intellectual disability and developmental delays, indicating the importance of these genetic regions in normal cellular and organismal function (Grau2017Xp11.22). However, the direct impact of CENPVL1 on these processes remains to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
The clinical significance of the CENPVL1 gene, which is a pseudogene of the centromere protein V gene (CENPV), is not fully understood. However, studies have suggested that deletions in the Xp11.22 region, which includes CENPVL1, may contribute to syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. This condition is characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia, joint hypermobility, and abnormal growth patterns in affected individuals (Grau2017Xp11.22). The exact role of CENPVL1 in these phenotypes is unclear, as it is a pseudogene and its function is not well defined. It is hypothesized that pseudogenes like CENPVL1 might regulate their parent genes, potentially impacting the phenotypes observed in individuals with these deletions (Grau2017Xp11.22).

The study by Grau et al. identified two males with hemizygous deletions in the Xp11.22 region, inherited from their asymptomatic mothers, suggesting a potential genetic basis for the observed clinical features (Grau2017Xp11.22). Despite these findings, the clinical significance of CENPVL1 specifically remains uncertain, and it is not clear whether its deletion alone is sufficient to cause the observed phenotypes (Grau2017Xp11.22).
