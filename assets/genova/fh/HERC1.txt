# HERC1

## Overview
HERC1 is a gene that encodes the protein HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase family member 1, which is a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family. This protein is characterized by the presence of HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) and RCC1-like domains (RLDs), which are crucial for its function in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. HERC1 plays a significant role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis and is involved in various cellular processes, including intracellular vesicle trafficking and signal transduction. It interacts with several proteins, such as ARF1, clathrin, and C-RAF, influencing pathways like MAPK/ERK and mTOR, which are essential for cellular function and development (Ali2021The; Pedrazza2023HERC1; SánchezTena2016Functional). The protein's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in both normal physiology and disease states, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders (GarcíaCano2019HERCing:; Nguyen2015A).

## Function
The HERC1 gene encodes a large protein that is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family, characterized by the presence of HECT and RCC1-like domains (RLDs). This protein is involved in tagging proteins for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a crucial process for maintaining cellular protein homeostasis (Ali2021The). HERC1 is primarily localized in the cytoplasm and associated with the Golgi/vesicular-like membrane compartments, where it plays a significant role in intracellular vesicle trafficking. It interacts with ARF1 and clathrin through its RLD2 domain, functioning as a guanine release factor (GRF) for ARF proteins in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (GarcíaCano2019HERCing:; SánchezTena2016Functional).

HERC1 also regulates the stability of various proteins, including C-RAF, a kinase involved in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which is important for osteoblast differentiation and bone homeostasis (Pedrazza2023HERC1). It interacts with the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), potentially influencing the mTOR pathway, and is involved in the regulation of the degradation of the DNA mismatch repair enzyme MSH2 (SánchezTena2016Functional). These functions highlight HERC1's role in maintaining cellular processes essential for normal cellular function and organismal development.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HERC1 gene are associated with a variety of diseases and conditions. In cancer, HERC1 is recurrently mutated in metastatic triple-negative and invasive lobular breast cancer, and its deletions can affect MSH2 protein levels, promoting degradation of BAK in the presence of the E6 protein from HPV5β, which prevents cell death in response to UV exposure (GarcíaCano2019HERCing:). HERC1 is also implicated in leukemia, where somatic deletions are linked to DNA mismatch repair deficiency and drug resistance (SánchezTena2016Functional). In myeloid-related disorders, HERC1 is aberrantly expressed in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), where it interacts with the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase, suggesting a role in leukemogenesis (Ali2021The).

In neurodevelopment, mutations in HERC1 are linked to intellectual disability, macrocephaly, and cerebellar atrophy. A nonsense variant in HERC1 has been associated with a novel autosomal-recessive neurological condition characterized by megalencephaly and severe intellectual disability (Nguyen2015A). In mice, a missense mutation in HERC1 leads to progressive Purkinje cell degeneration, resulting in severe ataxia and reduced growth (Mashimo2009Progressive).

## Interactions
HERC1, a member of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family, is involved in various protein interactions and cellular processes. It contains two RCC1-like domains (RLD1 and RLD2) and a HECT domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins. The RLD1 domain acts as a guanine release factor (GRF) for ARF proteins, requiring phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate for activity, and interacts with small GTPases such as ARF and Rab family members (GarciaGonzalo2004Requirement; SánchezTena2016Functional). The RLD2 domain binds to myristoylated ARF1 and the heavy chain of clathrin, forming a complex with clathrin and HSP70, which is significant for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (MontesFernández2020The; SánchezTena2016Functional).

HERC1 also interacts with the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase, forming a complex where HERC1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated, suggesting it is a substrate of BCR-ABL1's kinase activity (Ali2021The). This interaction indicates a potential role for HERC1 in myeloid-related disorders, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context (Ali2021The). Additionally, HERC1 interacts with the glycolytic enzyme M2 pyruvate kinase and the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), influencing the mTOR pathway (SánchezTena2016Functional). These interactions highlight HERC1's involvement in diverse cellular functions, including membrane trafficking and signal transduction.
