# RNF24

## Overview
RNF24, or ring finger protein 24, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, characterized by the presence of a RING-H2 domain, a specialized type of zinc finger domain. This domain is integral to the protein's function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating protein-protein interactions and playing a crucial role in ubiquitination processes (Yu2021RNF24; Ardley2009Ring). The RNF24 protein is involved in various cellular functions, including calcium ion transport and calcium channel activity, and is implicated in the regulation of immune cell infiltration in cancerous tissues (Yu2021RNF24). The gene's expression and its interactions with other proteins, such as TRPC6, suggest its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Yu2021RNF24). Additionally, RNF24 has been studied for its role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, highlighting its broader significance in human health (Wu2023A).

## Structure
RNF24, or ring finger protein 24, is a protein encoded by the RNF24 gene in humans. It is a 148 amino-acid long protein that includes a RING-H2 domain, which is a type of zinc finger domain involved in protein-protein interactions and ubiquitin ligase activity (Yu2021RNF24). The RING domain is characterized by a Cys/His rich, zinc-chelating structure that promotes protein interactions, crucial for its function in ubiquitination (Ardley2009Ring). The 3D protein structure of RNF24 has been analyzed, revealing its involvement in calcium ion transport, protein polyubiquitination, and calcium channel activity (Yu2021RNF24).

The protein-protein interaction networks of RNF24 have been studied using databases like GeneMANIA and STRING, identifying interactions with proteins such as TRPC6 (Yu2021RNF24). These interactions suggest a role in various cellular processes, including immune cell infiltration in cancers. RNF24's expression is linked to immune cell infiltration, particularly in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and is associated with tumor-associated macrophages and regulatory T cells (Yu2021RNF24). The study of RNF24's structure and interactions highlights its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for antitumor strategies.

## Clinical Significance
The RNF24 gene has been identified as a significant biomarker in various cancers, with its expression levels and genetic alterations linked to clinical outcomes. In cancers such as ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, genetic alterations in RNF24, including amplifications and mutations, are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, such as reduced progression-free survival, overall survival, and disease-free survival (Yu2021RNF24). RNF24 is notably upregulated in several cancer types, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where its high expression correlates with advanced cancer grade, stage, and metastasis, indicating poor survival outcomes (Yu2021RNF24). 

The gene's expression is also linked to immune cell infiltration in tumors, affecting various immune cells such as CD8+ T cells, Tregs, and tumor-associated macrophages, which suggests its role in immune evasion and potential as a predictor of immunotherapy response (Yu2021RNF24). In Parkinson's disease, RNF24 has been identified as a potential diagnostic biomarker, although its mRNA expression levels do not significantly differ between patients and controls, indicating a need for further research to understand its role in this condition (Wu2023A).

## Interactions
RNF24 is involved in various protein-protein interactions, particularly through its RING-type zinc finger domain. This domain is known for mediating interactions with other proteins, often functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. RNF24 has been identified to interact with several proteins, including TRPC6, LGALS1, PSG9, and CD44, as part of its protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. These interactions are linked to biological processes such as calcium ion transport and protein polyubiquitination (Yu2021RNF24).

The study of RNF24's interactions has utilized databases like GeneMANIA and STRING to map these connections, highlighting its role in complex cellular pathways. RNF24's interactions suggest its involvement in cancer progression, particularly through pathways related to immune cell infiltration and tumor immune evasion. Its expression is correlated with various immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, Tregs, MDSCs, TAMs, and CAFs, indicating a potential role in modulating the tumor microenvironment (Yu2021RNF24).

These interactions and their implications in cancer biology suggest that RNF24 could serve as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and a target for immunotherapy, given its involvement in immune escape mechanisms and its association with poor overall survival in several cancer types (Yu2021RNF24).
