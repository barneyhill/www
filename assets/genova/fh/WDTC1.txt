# WDTC1

## Overview
WDTC1 is a gene that encodes the protein WD and tetratricopeptide repeats 1, which is involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of adipogenesis and cancer progression. The protein is characterized by its structural domains, including WD40 and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for its function (Tang2023TRiCCCT; Häder2003Control). WDTC1 acts as a substrate receptor within the DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (CRL4) E3 ligase complex, playing a critical role in transcriptional repression by promoting histone modifications that inhibit fat cell differentiation (Groh2016The). Additionally, WDTC1 interacts with the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex, which is vital for its proper folding and stability (Tang2023TRiCCCT). Beyond its role in adipogenesis, WDTC1 has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in renal cell carcinoma, where it functions as a tumor suppressor (Li2023ELF5). Through these mechanisms, WDTC1 contributes to the regulation of fat metabolism and cellular growth, with implications for conditions such as obesity and cancer.

## Structure
The WDTC1 protein is characterized by its structural composition, which includes six WD40 domains, one ADP domain, and three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains (Tang2023TRiCCCT). The WD40 domains are known for facilitating protein-protein interactions and typically form a beta-propeller structure, which is crucial for the protein's function in various cellular processes (Häder2003Control). The TPR domains, consisting of antiparallel α-helices, also play a significant role in protein-protein interactions, often serving as ligand-interacting surfaces (Häder2003Control).

WDTC1 interacts with the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex, which is essential for its proper folding and stability. This interaction primarily occurs through the CCT5 subunit of the TRiC/CCT complex, highlighting the importance of the ADP domain in this binding process (Tang2023TRiCCCT). The protein is also involved in the CRL4 E3 ligase complex, where it acts as a substrate receptor, interacting with DDB1 through its H-box and WDXR motifs (Groh2016The). These structural features are critical for WDTC1's role in transcriptional repression during adipogenesis (Groh2016The).

## Function
The WDTC1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a suppressor of adipogenesis, the process by which preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes, or fat cells. This protein is a component of the DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (CRL4) E3 ligase complex, where it acts as a substrate receptor, inhibiting fat accumulation by promoting histone H2AK119 monoubiquitylation, a mark associated with transcriptional repression (Groh2016The). WDTC1's interaction with the CRL4 complex is crucial for its function, as mutations that disrupt this interaction lead to increased adipogenesis (Groh2016The).

WDTC1 also plays a role in the regulation of transcription factors central to adipogenesis, such as C/EBPα and PPARγ, by targeting components like MED20 for degradation (Tang2023TRiCCCT). The protein is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, associating with histones and influencing transcriptional regulation (Groh2016The). Additionally, the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex is essential for the proper folding and stability of WDTC1, which is necessary for its inhibitory effect on adipogenesis (Tang2023TRiCCCT). Through these mechanisms, WDTC1 contributes to maintaining normal fat metabolism and preventing obesity (Groh2016The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the WDTC1 gene have been linked to several health conditions, primarily obesity and cancer. In the context of obesity, WDTC1 functions as an anti-obesity factor by suppressing adipogenesis through its role in the CRL4 WDTC1 E3 ligase complex. Disruption of the interaction between WDTC1 and DDB1, a component of this complex, leads to increased triglyceride accumulation and adipogenic gene expression, contributing to obesity (Groh2016The). Specific haplotypes of WDTC1, such as G-G and A-A, have been associated with varying risks of obesity, with the G-G haplotype linked to a lower likelihood of obesity (Lai2009WDTC1). 

In cancer, particularly renal cell carcinoma (RCC), WDTC1 is downregulated, and its overexpression has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, indicating its role as a tumor suppressor. The stability of WDTC1 in RCC is influenced by the USP3 gene, which inhibits its ubiquitination and degradation (Li2023ELF5). These findings suggest that alterations in WDTC1 expression or mutations could be linked to both obesity and cancer due to its role in suppressing fat accumulation and tumor progression.

## Interactions
WDTC1 is known to interact with several protein complexes and individual proteins, playing a significant role in various cellular processes. It is a component of the DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (CRL4) E3 ligase complex, where it functions as a substrate receptor. This interaction is crucial for its role in transcriptional repression during adipogenesis, as it mediates the binding with DDB1 through structural motifs such as the DWD boxes and the H-box (Groh2016The). WDTC1 also interacts with the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex, which is essential for its proper folding and function. This interaction primarily occurs through the CCT5 subunit, and disruption of this interaction leads to misfolding and degradation of WDTC1, affecting its inhibitory role in adipogenesis (Tang2023TRiCCCT).

In renal cell carcinoma, WDTC1 is stabilized by USP3, which inhibits its ubiquitination. This stabilization is part of a pathway involving ELF5, which transcriptionally activates USP3, thereby enhancing WDTC1's tumor suppressor functions (Li2023ELF5). These interactions highlight WDTC1's involvement in both adipogenesis and cancer progression.
