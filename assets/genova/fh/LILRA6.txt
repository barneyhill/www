# LILRA6

## Overview
LILRA6 is a gene that encodes the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A6, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This receptor is primarily expressed on myeloid cells and functions as an activating receptor within the immune system. LILRA6 is involved in modulating immune responses through its association with the ITAM-bearing FcRγ, which transmits activation signals, and is implicated in various signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT, NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and ERK1/2 MAPK (Lewis2020Leukocyte; Truong2018Leukocyte; Hirayasu2021Characterization). The receptor's interaction with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and β2-microglobulin in avian macrophages suggests a role in immune regulation and antigen presentation (Truong2018Leukocyte). LILRA6 exhibits significant polymorphism and copy number variation, which may influence its function and ligand interactions, contributing to its involvement in various diseases and conditions, such as atopic dermatitis and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (Lamaison2022Histological; Bashirova2022Distinct; LópezÁlvarez2016LILRA6). Despite its potential roles, the specific function of LILRA6 in healthy human cells remains to be fully elucidated (Lewis2020Leukocyte).

## Structure


## Function
LILRA6 is an activating receptor within the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family, primarily expressed on myeloid cells. It is involved in modulating immune responses by associating with the ITAM-bearing FcRγ, which transmits activation signals (Lewis2020Leukocyte; Hirayasu2021Characterization). LILRA6 exhibits significant polymorphism and copy number variation, which may influence its function and ligand interactions (Bashirova2022Distinct; Hirayasu2015Functional).

The specific ligands for LILRA6 remain uncertain, but it is suggested to interact with a cytokeratin eight-associated ligand on necrotic glandular epithelial cells (Lewis2020Leukocyte). LILRA6 is implicated in regulating cytokine production, potentially influencing immune responses by modulating pathways such as JAK-STAT, NF-κB, PI3K/AKT, and ERK1/2 MAPK (Truong2018Leukocyte). It is also associated with the regulation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and mediating immunological tolerance (LópezÁlvarez2016LILRA6).

Despite its potential roles, the specific function of LILRA6 in healthy human cells is not well characterized, and further research is needed to elucidate its precise biological activities and interactions (Lewis2020Leukocyte; Hirayasu2021Characterization).

## Clinical Significance
LILRA6 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to its genetic variations and expression alterations. Copy number variations of the LILRA6 gene have been associated with an increased susceptibility to atopic dermatitis (AD). Studies have shown that individuals with one copy of LILRA6 on each chromosome have a higher risk of developing AD, with an odds ratio of 1.45, suggesting that LILRA6 may influence immune response balance, contributing to AD pathogenesis (LópezÁlvarez2016LILRA6).

In classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), LILRA6 expression is upregulated in patients with relapsed or refractory disease, indicating its potential role in disease progression or immune response modulation in cHL (Lamaison2022Histological). In pancreatic cancer, LILRA6 expression is higher in patients with a regulatory-like immune response post-chemotherapy, which correlates with a trend of lower survival, suggesting its involvement in modulating immune responses during cancer treatment (Brugiapaglia2024In).

The gene also exhibits significant genetic diversity, with copy number variations ranging from one to six copies per individual, particularly in African populations. This diversity may have implications for disease associations, although specific conditions linked to LILRA6 mutations are not detailed (Hirayasu2015Functional).

## Interactions
LILRA6 is known to interact with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and β2-microglobulin (β2m) in avian macrophages, suggesting a role in immune regulation and antigen presentation. This interaction is significant as it is not observed with the closely related LILRA2 receptor (Truong2018Leukocyte). LILRA6's binding to MHC class I and β2m is associated with the upregulation of genes involved in antigen processing, such as TAP1 and TAP2, indicating its involvement in enhancing antigen presentation pathways (Truong2018Leukocyte).

LILRA6 also participates in signaling pathways by interacting with phosphorylated Src family kinases and SHP2, which are crucial for modulating immune responses. These interactions lead to the activation of signaling pathways like JAK-STAT and MAPK, which are important for cytokine production and immune response modulation (Truong2018Leukocyte). The receptor's involvement in these pathways highlights its role as an activating receptor in immune regulation.

In humans, LILRA6 is suggested to potentially interact with a cytokeratin eight-associated ligand on necrotic glandular epithelial cells, although specific ligands have not been fully characterized (Lewis2020Leukocyte).
