# LAX1

## Overview
LAX1, or lymphocyte transmembrane adaptor 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane adaptor protein involved in the regulation of immune responses. The LAX1 protein is integral to the transport and surface expression of CTLA-4 in T cells, a process crucial for modulating immune activity. By interacting with Rab8, a small GTPase, LAX1 facilitates the trafficking of CTLA-4-containing vesicles from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane, thereby enhancing CTLA-4 surface expression and inhibiting T-cell activation (Banton2014Rab8). This protein also plays a role in the polarization of the microtubule-organizing center and CTLA-4 to T-cell contact regions, which is vital for immune synapse formation and effective T-cell signaling (Banton2014Rab8). Through these mechanisms, LAX1 significantly influences immune cell signaling and function, impacting the overall immune response.

## Function
LAX1 (lymphocyte transmembrane adaptor 1) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the transport and surface expression of CTLA-4 in T cells, which is important for regulating immune responses. LAX1 functions as an adaptor protein, interacting with Rab8, a small GTPase involved in vesicle trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane. This interaction facilitates the formation of CTLA-4-containing vesicles, promoting their transport to the cell surface (Banton2014Rab8). LAX1 binds to the GTP-bound form of Rab8 and the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4, enhancing CTLA-4 surface expression and inhibiting T-cell activation by reducing IL-2 production (Banton2014Rab8).

LAX1 also influences the polarization of the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and CTLA-4 to T-cell contact regions, which is essential for immune synapse formation and T-cell signaling (Banton2014Rab8). The protein is primarily active at the plasma membrane, where it modulates T-cell receptor signaling, impacting immune responses and cellular communication (Banton2014Rab8). Through these processes, LAX1 plays a significant role in the regulation of immune cell signaling and function.
