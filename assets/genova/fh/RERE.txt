# RERE

## Overview
The RERE gene encodes the protein arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeats, also known as Atrophin-2, which functions as a nuclear receptor coregulator involved in transcriptional regulation. This protein is characterized by its arginine-glutamic acid (RE) dipeptide repeats and several conserved domains, including BAH, ELM2, SANT, and GATA, which facilitate its role in chromatin remodeling and DNA binding (Yanagisawa2000Protein; Kim2013An). RERE is expressed in various tissues and plays a critical role in embryonic development, particularly in the retina and central nervous system, by modulating gene expression through interactions with transcriptional machinery and histone deacetylases (Zoltewicz2004Atrophin; Kim2021RERE). The protein is also a component of the WHHERE complex, essential for retinoic acid signaling, which is vital for embryonic development and symmetry (VilhaisNeto2017The). Mutations in the RERE gene are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its significance in developmental processes and disease (Axenovich2011Linkage).

## Structure
The RERE protein is encoded by a cDNA sequence of 8035 base pairs, resulting in an open reading frame of 1566 amino acids (Yanagisawa2000Protein). It contains arginine-glutamic acid (RE) dipeptide repeats, which are crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly with the DRPLA protein (Yanagisawa2000Protein). The protein lacks a polyglutamine tract but includes putative nuclear localization signal sequences and an arginine-aspartic acid (RD) dipeptide repeat (Yanagisawa2000Protein).

RERE's structure features several conserved domains in its amino-terminal region, including BAH (Bromo adjacent homology), ELM2 (Egl-27 and MTA1 homology 2), SANT (SWI3/ADA2/N-CoR/TFIII-B), and GATA domains, which are involved in protein-protein interactions, chromatin remodeling, and DNA binding (Kim2013An; Plaster2007REREaAtrophin‐2). The protein's C-terminal portion shows 67% homology to the DRPLA protein (Yanagisawa2000Protein).

RERE is expressed in various tissues, with two transcripts of 7 and 9 kb, the latter being exclusive to the pancreas and testis (Yanagisawa2000Protein). The protein's apparent molecular weight is 212 kDa in SDS-PAGE, despite a predicted weight of 172 kDa, due to its high proline and serine content and dipeptide repeats (Yanagisawa2000Protein).

## Function
The RERE gene encodes a nuclear receptor coregulator involved in modulating gene expression by interacting with transcriptional machinery. It functions as both a coactivator and corepressor, influencing the transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors. RERE is involved in recruiting histone deacetylase 1/2 (HDAC1/2), which plays a role in altering chromatin structure to regulate transcription (Zoltewicz2004Atrophin; Kim2021RERE). 

In healthy human cells, RERE is crucial for the development and maintenance of various tissues, including the retina and central nervous system. It is expressed in embryonic tissues such as the optic cup and is essential for the proper development of the retina and optic nerve, preventing retinal and optic nerve atrophy (Kim2021RERE). RERE also plays a significant role in cerebellar development, influencing the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal cells, particularly in the cerebellum (Kim2014Mouse).

RERE is part of the WHHERE complex, which is essential for retinoic acid (RA) signaling, a critical pathway for embryonic development and symmetry. This complex helps regulate gene expression by promoting RNA polymerase II recruitment to RA target genes (VilhaisNeto2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the RERE gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorder with or without anomalies of the brain, eye, or heart (NEDBEH). These mutations can lead to developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and congenital anomalies. The RERE gene encodes a protein that co-localizes with a transcription factor in the nucleus, and its overexpression can trigger caspase-3 activation, leading to apoptosis. This process is significant in the context of glaucoma-related traits, where the RERE gene has been linked to parameters of the neuroretinal rim and shows stronger associations than previously reported in studies of the vertical cup-disc ratio (VCDR) (Axenovich2011Linkage).

In animal models, disruptions in the orthologous gene result in embryonic lethality with multiple abnormalities, including impaired optic vesicle formation, highlighting the gene's critical role in development (Axenovich2011Linkage). The study of RERE and its interactions with other genes involved in developmental pathways and TGFB signaling is crucial for understanding its role in disease and for identifying genetic predictors of intraocular pressure (IOP), which is important for therapeutic and preventive measures in glaucoma patients (Axenovich2011Linkage).

## Interactions
The RERE protein, also known as Atrophin-2, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function as a transcriptional regulator. RERE interacts with the DRPLA protein, with the interaction being mediated by the proximal RE repeats. This interaction is enhanced when DRPLA has an extended polyglutamine tract, leading to the recruitment of RERE into nuclear aggregates formed by DRPLA (Yanagisawa2000Protein).

RERE also forms part of the WHHERE complex, which includes Wdr5, Hdac1, and Hdac2. This complex is involved in retinoic acid signaling, crucial for embryonic development. RERE acts as a scaffold, facilitating the interaction between Wdr5 and Hdac1/Hdac2 (VilhaisNeto2017The).

In addition, RERE interacts with histone deacetylases (HDAC1/2) and the histone methyltransferase G9a. These interactions are mediated through its ELM2 and SANT domains, which are essential for its role in transcriptional repression and chromatin modification (Wang2008Atrophin; Plaster2007REREaAtrophin‐2). These interactions highlight RERE's role in regulating gene expression and developmental processes.
