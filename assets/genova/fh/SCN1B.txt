# SCN1B

## Overview
The SCN1B gene encodes the sodium voltage-gated channel beta subunit 1, a type 1 transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs). This protein is integral to the proper functioning of neurons and cardiac cells, influencing the gating, kinetics, and localization of VGSC alpha subunits on the cell surface (Bouza2020Sodium; Bouza2017VoltageGated). As a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the beta-1 subunit is involved in cell adhesion and intracellular signaling, contributing to neuronal pathfinding, neurite outgrowth, and cardiac intercalated disk formation (Bouza2020Sodium; Bouza2017VoltageGated). It also plays a role in axo-glial communication at nodes of Ranvier, which is essential for normal action potential conduction (Chen2004Mice). Mutations in SCN1B are linked to various cardiac and neurological disorders, underscoring its importance in maintaining normal physiological function (Wallace1998Febrile; Watanabe2008Sodium).

## Structure
The SCN1B gene encodes the beta-1 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels, which are type 1 transmembrane proteins. The primary structure of the SCN1B protein includes a signal peptide and an extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, which is part of the Ig superfamily of cell adhesion molecules (Williams2024Development; Bouza2021Sodium). The secondary structure features beta-sheets that contribute to the Ig-like fold, stabilized by disulfide bonds, forming a characteristic immunoglobulin fold in the tertiary structure (Bouza2020Sodium).

In terms of quaternary structure, the beta-1 subunit interacts with the pore-forming alpha subunits of sodium channels, modulating their cell-surface localization, gating, and kinetics (Bouza2021Sodium). The SCN1B protein undergoes several post-translational modifications, including S-palmitoylation at cysteine 162, which is crucial for its localization to the plasma membrane and regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) (Bouza2020Sodium). Tyrosine phosphorylation is another modification, although it does not regulate RIP (Bouza2020Sodium).

The SCN1B gene also produces an alternatively spliced variant, β1B, which lacks the transmembrane domain and is thought to be secreted, although it can be retained in the membrane when co-expressed with Nav1.5 (Williams2024Development).

## Function
The SCN1B gene encodes the beta-1 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), which are essential for the proper functioning of neurons and cardiac cells. In healthy human cells, the beta-1 subunit modulates the gating, kinetics, and plasma membrane localization of VGSC alpha subunits, influencing their expression and function on the cell surface (Bouza2020Sodium; Bouza2017VoltageGated). This subunit acts as a molecular chaperone, facilitating the expression of VGSC alpha subunits on the plasma membrane, which is critical for proper sodium channel function (Bouza2020Sodium).

The beta-1 subunit is involved in cell adhesion and intracellular signaling, playing roles in neuronal pathfinding, neurite outgrowth, and cardiac intercalated disk formation (Bouza2020Sodium; Bouza2017VoltageGated). It participates in axo-glial communication at nodes of Ranvier, crucial for normal action potential conduction and control of excitability (Chen2004Mice). The beta-1 subunit also modulates voltage-gated potassium channels and intracellular calcium signaling, contributing to the regulation of neuronal firing and cardiac excitability (MartinezMoreno2020An; Aeby2019SCN1B‐linked). These functions are vital for maintaining normal neurological and cardiac function.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SCN1B gene, which encodes the sodium channel β1 subunit, are associated with several cardiac and neurological disorders. In the cardiac context, SCN1B mutations have been linked to Brugada syndrome and cardiac conduction disease. These mutations can lead to a reduction in sodium current, particularly affecting the Na V 1.5 channel, which is crucial for cardiac function. This reduction can result in arrhythmias and conduction delays, contributing to the clinical manifestations of Brugada syndrome and conduction disease (MartinezMoreno2020An; Watanabe2008Sodium).

In the neurological domain, SCN1B mutations are implicated in conditions such as generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+). The C121W mutation, for example, is associated with febrile seizures and epilepsy, likely due to altered sodium channel function leading to neuronal hyperexcitability (Wallace1998Febrile). The D103V mutation affects both cardiac and brain sodium currents, contributing to complex disorders involving both cardiac arrhythmias and neurological impairments, such as developmental delays and cognitive deficits (MartinezMoreno2020An).

These findings highlight the critical role of SCN1B in maintaining normal cardiac and neuronal function, with mutations leading to significant clinical consequences.

## Interactions
The SCN1B gene encodes the β1 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels, which plays a crucial role in modulating the function and expression of these channels. The β1 subunit interacts with the α subunits of sodium channels, influencing their gating properties and cell surface expression (Brackenbury2011Na+; Chen2004Mice). It forms complexes with cell adhesion molecules such as contactin and neurofascin-186, which are essential for the proper localization of sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier and the axon initial segment (Brackenbury2011Na+; Chen2004Mice). 

The β1 subunit also interacts with extracellular matrix proteins like tenascin-R and tenascin-C, contributing to the modulation of sodium channel function (Chen2004Mice). It is involved in cell-cell adhesion through interactions with other proteins, including connexin-43, N-cadherin, and receptor tyrosine phosphatase β (Brackenbury2011Na+). Additionally, the β1 subunit has been shown to interact with voltage-gated potassium channel subunits, such as Kv4.2, enhancing their stability and expression, which affects neuronal excitability (Kearney2013VoltageGated). These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of the β1 subunit in cellular excitability and adhesion.
