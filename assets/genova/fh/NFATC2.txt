# NFATC2

## Overview
NFATC2, or nuclear factor of activated T cells 2, is a gene that encodes a transcription factor belonging to the NFAT family, which is primarily involved in calcium signaling pathways. The protein product of NFATC2, also referred to as NFAT1, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to calcium influx, impacting various cellular processes such as immune response, muscle development, and cell proliferation. As a transcription factor, NFATC2 is characterized by its ability to bind DNA and modulate the transcription of target genes, often in conjunction with other transcription factors. It is particularly significant in the immune system, where it regulates the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes. Additionally, NFATC2 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its importance in both normal physiology and disease states (Greenblatt2013NFATc1; Caetano2002NFATC2; Simonett2021Identification).

## Structure
NFATC2, also known as NFAT1, NFAT1a, or NFATP, is a transcription factor that belongs to the NFAT family, which is responsive to calcium signaling. The protein contains two primary functional domains: the NFAT-homology region (NHR) and the REL-homology region (RHR). The NHR is involved in calcium binding and subcellular localization, while the RHR is responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding. The RHR is composed of two immunoglobulin-like folds: RHR-N, which facilitates DNA binding, and RHR-C, which mediates homo- or heterodimerization (Ray2021REL).

NFATc2 binds DNA as a monomer to the core NFAT DNA binding motif G1G2A3A4A5A6. Structural studies have shown that specific amino acids, such as arginines R421 and R430, form bidentate hydrogen bonds with the DNA motif, while Q571 and Y424 interact with the DNA backbone (Ray2021REL).

Post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating NFATc2's activity. Phosphorylation sites have been identified in the N-terminal regulatory region, with several sites being phosphorylated by JNK kinase in vitro and in vivo (Villar2006Systematic). These modifications influence the protein's localization and transcriptional activity.

## Function
NFATC2 is a transcription factor that plays a significant role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It is part of the NFAT family, which is activated by calcium signals and is involved in regulating gene expression. In skeletal muscle cells, NFATC2 is crucial for the second phase of myoblast fusion, where it regulates the fusion of additional myoblasts with nascent myotubes. This process is essential for increasing myonuclear number and muscle cell size, contributing to muscle growth (Pavlath2003Cell).

In the context of β cell proliferation, NFATC2 influences the expression of numerous genes in human islets. It promotes β cell proliferation by inducing genes like ASF1B and suppressing genes such as CDKN1A, which are involved in cell cycle regulation. NFATC2's binding sites often overlap with other transcription factors, indicating its role in a complex regulatory network that is crucial for maintaining β cell function and insulin regulation (Simonett2021Identification).

NFATC2 also plays a role in lymphocyte activation, where it regulates cell cycle progression. In NFATC2-deficient mice, lymphocytes exhibit hyperproliferation, suggesting that NFATC2 acts as a negative regulator of cell proliferation in normal cells (Caetano2002NFATC2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NFATC2 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In cancer, NFATC2-rearranged sarcomas are driven by translocations involving the NFATC2 gene, often coupled with EWSR1 rearrangements. These sarcomas are aggressive and exhibit complex genomic profiles, including recurrent deletions of tumor suppressor genes like CDKN2A/B, which are linked to poor prognosis and tumor progression (Perret2020NFATc2rearranged). In lung adenocarcinoma, NFATC2 is upregulated and associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes, poor survival outcomes, and advanced pathological stages (Xiao2017NFATc2).

In the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), NFATC2 regulates genes associated with the disease, influencing β-cell proliferation and insulin secretion. Genetic variations in NFATC2, such as specific SNPs, have been linked to altered expression and function, impacting diabetes-related traits (Keller2016The; Simonett2021Identification).

NFATC2 is also implicated in asparaginase hypersensitivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. The rs6021191 variant in NFATC2 is associated with increased risk of hypersensitivity, highlighting its role in immune-mediated conditions (Fernandez2015Genomewide).

In osteoarthritis, NFATC2, along with NFATC1, acts as a suppressor of the disease. Alterations in NFATC2 expression lead to dysregulated cartilage matrix metabolism and osteoarthritogenic pathways (Greenblatt2013NFATc1).

## Interactions
NFATC2 interacts with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. It forms a complex with cJun, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, to synergistically activate interleukin-2 (IL-2) transcription. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal region of NFATC2, which binds to the bZip domain of cJun, facilitating the recruitment of cJun homodimers to the NFAT site in the IL-2 promoter (Walters2013NFATc2; Nguyen2010The).

In pancreatic carcinoma cells, NFATC2 interacts with the transcription factor Sp1. This interaction is enhanced by Ionomycin stimulation, which increases NFATC2's DNA-binding affinity and facilitates its nuclear translocation. NFATC2 and Sp1 co-localize in the nucleus and physically interact at NFAT target sequences, enhancing NFATC2's transcriptional activity (Malsy2017Interaction).

In human islets, NFATC2 interacts with FOXP proteins, which are essential for its role in promoting β cell proliferation. FOXP1, in particular, is a key partner, with its binding sites frequently co-occurring with NFATC2 sites, suggesting potential heterodimer formation (Simonett2021Identification).
