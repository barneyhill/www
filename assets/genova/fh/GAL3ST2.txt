# GAL3ST2

## Overview
The GAL3ST2 gene encodes the enzyme galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 2, which is a sulfotransferase involved in the modification of galactose residues in glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a significant role in the biosynthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, crucial for various cellular processes such as cell-cell communication and signal transduction (Croix2011Inflammatory). The protein encoded by GAL3ST2 is particularly important in maintaining the mucosal barrier function in intestinal goblet cells and is implicated in the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes (Guerra2014GAL3ST2; Croix2011Inflammatory). Clinically, GAL3ST2 is associated with cancer biology, influencing tumor progression and serving as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target (Li20213’SulfoTF; Sun2022Chimeric).

## Structure


## Function
GAL3ST2 encodes the enzyme galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase 2, which is involved in the sulfation of galactose residues in glycoproteins and glycolipids. This enzyme is active in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans. These modifications are important for cell-cell communication, signal transduction, and molecular recognition processes, impacting tissue development and function (Croix2011Inflammatory).

In the context of intestinal goblet cells, GAL3ST2 is responsible for adding sulfate groups to the C-3 position of galactose in human colonic mucins. This sulfation process is essential for maintaining the mucosal barrier function and responding to microbial and host factors. The expression of GAL3ST2 is modulated by inflammatory cues such as bacterial flagellin, interleukin-13 (IL-13), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), which can increase its expression and subsequently enhance sulfomucin production (Croix2011Inflammatory).

GAL3ST2 also plays a role in the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes. It has been shown to inhibit triglyceride accumulation during adipocyte differentiation by interfering with the expression of key adipogenic transcription factors, such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPb) (Guerra2014GAL3ST2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GAL3ST2 gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer. GAL3ST2 is involved in the synthesis of the 3'-sulfo-TF antigen, which plays a crucial role in the antitumor activity of fungal galectin AAL/AAGL. Overexpression of GAL3ST2 enhances the expression of this antigen, increasing the binding and antitumor efficacy of AAL/AAGL, suggesting its potential as a target for cancer diagnosis and therapy (Li20213’SulfoTF). The GAL3ST2 gene is also associated with the sulfation of glycans, contributing to the generation of oncofetal epitopes like 3′-Sulfo-Lewis A/C, which are linked to cancer progression in the gastrointestinal tract (Das20233′sulfated).

In prostate cancer, a chimeric RNA involving GAL3ST2, known as D2HGDH-GAL3ST2, is enriched in advanced stages and its silencing reduces cancer cell proliferation and motility (Sun2022Chimeric). Additionally, sequence variants in GAL3ST2 have been associated with variations in tumor biomarker levels, such as CA-125, potentially affecting cancer diagnostics (Olafsson2020Common). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GAL3ST2 in cancer biology and its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.
