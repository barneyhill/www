# CCSAP

## Overview
The CCSAP gene encodes the centriole, cilia, and spindle-associated protein, which is integral to the stabilization of microtubules, particularly during mitosis. This protein is categorized as a microtubule-associated protein due to its role in targeting polyglutamylated tubulin and stabilizing mitotic microtubules, thereby ensuring proper spindle formation and function (Ohta2015Polyglutamylated). Beyond its mitotic functions, CCSAP is also crucial in ciliogenesis, localizing to centrioles and the mitotic spindle, and interacting with tubulin tyrosine ligase-like enzymes to regulate microtubule dynamics (Bompard2018CSAP; Backer2012CSAP). The protein's involvement in these cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and function, with implications for organismal development and disease states, such as cancer, where its expression levels can influence clinical outcomes (Lai2019LIN9; Li2022Identification).

## Function
The CCSAP (centriole, cilia, and spindle-associated protein) gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in microtubule stabilization during mitosis, which is essential for proper cell division and chromosome segregation. CCSAP targets polyglutamylated tubulin in mitotic microtubules, stabilizing them by associating with microtubules around centrosomes to ensure proper spindle formation (Ohta2015Polyglutamylated). This stabilization is crucial for maintaining the normal shape and structure of the mitotic spindle, preventing defects in brain development and other cellular processes (Ohta2015Polyglutamylated).

CCSAP is also involved in ciliogenesis, as it is up-regulated in cells undergoing this process. It localizes to centrioles throughout the cell cycle and to the mitotic spindle during mitosis, indicating its role in both cilia formation and function (Backer2012CSAP). The protein interacts with tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) enzymes, particularly TTLL5, to regulate microtubule glutamylation, which is important for microtubule dynamics and stability (Bompard2018CSAP). This regulation is vital for various cellular functions, including cell division, intracellular transport, and cell motility (Bompard2018CSAP). In zebrafish, CCSAP is necessary for normal brain development and proper ciliary function, highlighting its importance in organismal development (Backer2012CSAP).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CCSAP gene have been implicated in various cancers. In multiple myeloma (MM), CCSAP is part of a 10-gene prognostic model that predicts patient outcomes. High-risk scores associated with this model correlate with poorer overall survival, suggesting that CCSAP may influence cancer cell behavior by regulating the tumor cell cycle and impacting MM outcomes (Li2022Identification). In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), CCSAP is upregulated in paclitaxel-resistant cells. This upregulation is linked to LIN9, a gene that confers paclitaxel resistance by directly regulating CCSAP. The increased expression of CCSAP contributes to microtubule stabilization and spindle formation during mitosis, which is crucial for the development of drug resistance. Higher CCSAP expression is associated with decreased overall survival in breast cancer patients, indicating its role in poor clinical outcomes (Lai2019LIN9). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CCSAP in cancer, where its altered expression and interactions can contribute to disease progression and treatment resistance. Understanding these mechanisms may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for improving cancer treatment outcomes.
