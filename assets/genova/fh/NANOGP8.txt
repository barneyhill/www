# NANOGP8

## Overview
NANOGP8 is a retrogene derived from the NANOG gene, which is known for its role in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. Unlike its parent gene, NANOGP8 is primarily expressed in various cancer types and is implicated in the regulation of cancer stem cell properties and tumor progression. The protein encoded by NANOGP8, Nanog homeobox retrogene P8, functions as a transcription factor, influencing key signaling pathways such as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is crucial for cell proliferation and migration (Ma2018NANOGP8). NANOGP8's interactions with cancer stem cell markers and its transcriptional regulation by factors like Fli-1 underscore its significant role in cancer biology, particularly in enhancing malignant phenotypes and contributing to chemoresistance (Ma2018NANOGP8; Park2020Fli1). As such, NANOGP8 is a potential target for therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating cancer progression and improving treatment outcomes.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the NANOGP8 gene have been implicated in the progression and aggressiveness of various cancers, including gastric and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. In gastric cancer, overexpression of NANOGP8 enhances malignant phenotypes such as increased cell migration, invasion, proliferation, and chemoresistance. This gene is associated with the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell characteristics, contributing to tumor progression and metastasis (Ma2018NANOGP8). 

In GI cancers, NANOGP8 is expressed in cancer stem cells and is linked to increased tumorigenicity and proliferation. It is particularly expressed in the infiltrative parts of tumors, which are associated with high proliferation activity (Uchino2012Human). The gene's expression in side population cells, which have high tumorigenic potential, suggests its role in supporting cancer stem cell proliferation and tumor growth (Uchino2012Human).

NANOGP8 is also overexpressed in colorectal cancer, where it contributes to chemoresistance and metastatic potential. Endothelial cells can activate the NANOGP8 pathway in colorectal cancer cells, enhancing cancer stem cell characteristics and resistance to chemotherapy (Wang2017Endothelial). These findings highlight NANOGP8 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these cancers.

## Interactions
NANOGP8, a retrogene related to the NANOG gene, is involved in various interactions that influence cancer cell behavior. It has been shown to enhance the Wnt signaling pathway by promoting the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a key component in cell proliferation and migration (Ma2018NANOGP8). NANOGP8 also interacts with cancer stem cell markers such as LGR5, CD44, CD133, CD54, MSI1, and ABCG2, which are associated with stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric cancer cells (Ma2018NANOGP8).

In T-lymphocyte leukemia cells, the transcription factor Fli-1 acts as a transcriptional activator of NANOGP8. Fli-1 binds to a specific ETS binding site within the NANOGP8 promoter, enhancing its transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial for the upregulation of NANOGP8 expression, which in turn promotes cell proliferation (Park2020Fli1). The regulatory relationship between Fli-1 and NANOGP8 highlights the role of transcriptional interactions in the expression of NANOGP8 in cancer cells. These interactions suggest that NANOGP8 may play a significant role in cancer progression by modulating key signaling pathways and cellular processes.
