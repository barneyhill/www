# ADH1B

## Overview
The ADH1B gene encodes the beta subunit of the class I alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, a key player in the metabolic pathway responsible for the oxidation of alcohols in the human body. This enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (class I), beta polypeptide, is primarily expressed in the liver and catalyzes the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, a critical step in alcohol metabolism (Lee2004Functionality). The enzyme is a member of the oxidoreductase family, characterized by its ability to facilitate redox reactions involving alcohol substrates. Genetic polymorphisms in ADH1B, such as the allelic variants ADH1B*1, ADH1B*2, and ADH1B*3, result in differences in enzymatic activity and are associated with varying rates of alcohol metabolism across different populations (Edenberg2018Alcohol; Lee2004Functionality). These variations have significant implications for individual susceptibility to alcohol-related disorders, including alcohol dependence and alcohol-induced medical conditions (Edenberg2018Alcohol).

## Structure
The human ADH1B protein is a variant of alcohol dehydrogenase with several structural features that influence its function. The primary structure of ADH1B includes a sequence of amino acids forming the polypeptide chain, with specific residues such as Thr48 near the active site zinc ion, which restricts the substrate-binding site (Eklund2008Medium). The secondary structure comprises alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of the Rossmann fold found in the coenzyme binding domain (Eklund2008Medium). 

The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding of the polypeptide, with the catalytic domain undergoing a small rigid-body rotation towards the coenzyme domain upon certain mutations, such as the substitution of Arg47 with Gly (Eklund2008Medium). This structural rearrangement affects the enzyme's affinity for its coenzyme. 

In terms of quaternary structure, ADH1B is a dimeric enzyme, with each subunit containing two zinc ions, one structural and one catalytic, which are crucial for its enzymatic activity (Eklund2008Medium). The dimer is stabilized by a large hydrophobic surface formed from the C-terminal residues of the coenzyme binding domain (Eklund2008Medium). Common post-translational modifications include phosphorylation and glycosylation, which can affect the enzyme's activity and stability.

## Function
The ADH1B gene encodes a subunit of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the metabolism of alcohol in the liver. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, a rate-limiting step in alcohol metabolism (Lee2004Functionality). The ADH1B enzyme is primarily active in the cytosol of liver cells, where it facilitates alcohol detoxification and contributes to energy production (Edenberg2018Alcohol).

ADH1B exhibits genetic polymorphisms, with different allelic variants such as ADH1B*1, ADH1B*2, and ADH1B*3, which are distributed among various racial populations (Lee2004Functionality). These variants influence the enzyme's kinetic properties, affecting the rate of ethanol metabolism. For instance, ADH1B*2 oxidizes ethanol much faster than ADH1B*1, leading to increased acetaldehyde accumulation, which can deter excessive alcohol consumption (Edenberg2018Alcohol; Lee2004Functionality).

The enzyme's activity is modulated by the availability of coenzymes and substrates, with ADH1B2 and ADH1B3 showing higher catalytic efficiencies compared to other allozymes (Lee2004Functionality). These functional variations in ADH1B contribute to differences in alcohol metabolism rates among individuals, influencing susceptibility to alcohol-related diseases (Edenberg2018Alcohol).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and variations in the ADH1B gene are significantly associated with alcohol dependence (AD) and alcohol-induced medical conditions. The ADH1B*2 allele, which results in a more active enzyme, is linked to a reduced risk of alcoholism, particularly in Asian populations where it is more prevalent (Edenberg2006Association; Edenberg2018Alcohol). This allele leads to faster alcohol metabolism, causing increased acetaldehyde accumulation, which can result in unpleasant reactions such as flushing, thereby deterring excessive alcohol consumption (Edenberg2018Alcohol).

The ADH1B*3 allele, common among individuals of African ancestry, also provides a protective effect against alcoholism by enhancing ethanol metabolism (Edenberg2018Alcohol). Variants like rs1229984 in ADH1B are associated with reduced alcohol consumption and a lower risk of alcohol dependence (Way2014Genetic; Li2011Strong). These genetic variations can influence drinking behavior and the risk of developing alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS) (Way2014Genetic).

Alterations in ADH1B expression levels, such as those influenced by regulatory variants like rs10516440, are also linked to reduced AD risk, although their effects are generally more modest compared to coding variants (Edenberg2018Alcohol).
