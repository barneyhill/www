# CDHR5

## Overview
CDHR5, or cadherin related family member 5, is a gene that encodes a protocadherin protein involved in cellular adhesion and the organization of the brush border in epithelial cells. The CDHR5 protein is a transmembrane protein characterized by its extracellular cadherin domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. It exists in multiple splice isoforms, notably CDHR5-S and CDHR5-L, which differ in their structural components and functional roles. CDHR5 plays a critical role in the apical delivery and assembly of microvilli, contributing to the structural integrity and function of epithelial cells, particularly in the gut and kidney. The protein is part of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), facilitating adhesion between microvilli to optimize the apical surface area for nutrient absorption and cellular signaling (Matoo2023Isoformspecific).

## Structure
CDHR5, a member of the cadherin superfamily, is characterized by its extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail. The protein exists in multiple splice isoforms, primarily CDHR5-S and CDHR5-L. CDHR5-S has a theoretical molecular weight of 69.6 kDa, while CDHR5-L is 88.2 kDa. The primary structure of CDHR5-L includes an additional membrane proximal mucin-like repeat (MLR) domain in its extracellular region, which is absent in CDHR5-S. This MLR domain consists of a 4X tandem repeat sequence of 31 amino acids rich in threonine, serine, and proline residues, similar to mucins found in the gut (Matoo2023Isoformspecific).

The cytoplasmic tail of CDHR5 ends with a canonical PDZ-binding motif (PBM), which is crucial for its interaction with PDZ-based scaffolding proteins like EBP50 and E3KARP. These interactions are important for the protein's role in apical delivery and brush border assembly (Matoo2023Isoformspecific). The CDHR5 protein is heavily glycosylated, particularly in its MLR domain, contributing to the glycocalyx barrier (Matoo2023Isoformspecific).

CDHR5 can form cis-heterooligomers, particularly between its isoforms, which is significant for its cellular targeting and function in microvillar growth (Matoo2023Isoformspecific).

## Function
CDHR5, also known as cadherin related family member 5, is a protocadherin that plays a crucial role in the assembly and organization of the brush border in epithelial cells, particularly in the gut and kidney. This protein is involved in the apical delivery of its isoforms, which is essential for promoting brush border assembly and maintaining the structure and function of microvilli (Matoo2023Isoformspecific). CDHR5 is part of the intermicrovillar adhesion complex (IMAC), which mediates adhesion between neighboring microvilli, promoting their organized packing and maximizing the apical surface area for solute transport (Matoo2023Isoformspecific).

The gene encodes two dominant splice isoforms, CDHR5-S and CDHR5-L, which have distinct apical targeting properties. CDHR5-S efficiently targets apical microvilli and promotes microvillar elongation, while CDHR5-L is less efficient due to its membrane proximal mucin-like repeat domain (Matoo2023Isoformspecific). CDHR5 interacts with cytoplasmic binding partners such as EBP50 and E3KARP, linking it to the actin cytoskeleton, which is crucial for maintaining cell structure and proper brush border assembly (Matoo2023Isoformspecific). This interaction is essential for the structural integrity and function of epithelial cell microvilli, which are critical for nutrient absorption and cellular signaling (Matoo2023Isoformspecific).

## Clinical Significance
CDHR5 (cadherin related family member 5) has been implicated in various diseases due to alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), high CDHR5 expression is associated with longer overall survival, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Loss of CDHR5 expression in RCC is linked to disease progression (Bläsius2017Loss). In contrast, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), high CDHR5 expression correlates with a shorter overall survival and is associated with a malignant phenotype, indicating its role in promoting cancer progression (Gao2020Up‐regulation).

CDHR5 is also downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where its lower expression is associated with larger tumor size and advanced stages, suggesting a tumor-suppressing role (Ding2019CDHR5). In colorectal cancer, CDHR5 downregulation is linked to increased tumor proliferation, and its expression is negatively regulated by CTNNB1 (losi2020cadherins). Additionally, CDHR5 is involved in gallstone disease and systemic sclerosis, and its promoter methylation is a potential biomarker for cyst growth in polycystic kidney disease (Bläsius2017Loss). These findings highlight the diverse roles of CDHR5 in different cancers and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
CDHR5 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular adhesion and brush border assembly. The cytoplasmic tail of CDHR5 interacts with the Ezrin-associated scaffolds E3KARP (NHERF-2) and EBP50 (NHERF-1). These interactions are mediated through the PDZ domains of EBP50 and E3KARP, specifically involving PDZ1 in EBP50 and PDZ2 in E3KARP. The interaction is enhanced when both PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains are present together. The full-length scaffolds are typically in an autoinhibited 'closed' conformation, which requires interaction with activated Ezrin to relieve this inhibition. CDHR5 interacts robustly with the open, active versions of these scaffolds (Matoo2023Isoformspecific).

CDHR5 also forms a complex with Ezrin via EBP50/E3KARP, which is crucial for microvilli formation by linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is dependent on the open conformation of EBP50/E3KARP and an intact C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (PBM) of CDHR5. The interaction facilitates the proper assembly and function of the brush border in enterocytes, with EBP50 being essential for apical polarization and IMAC assembly (Matoo2023Isoformspecific).

CDHR5 is also involved in heterophilic interactions with protocadherin-24 (PCDH24), which are crucial for forming intermicrovillar links in the brush border of enterocytes. These interactions are species-dependent, with human CDHR5 not mediating homophilic adhesion, unlike its mouse counterpart (Gray2020SpeciesDependent; Gray2021Heterophilic).
