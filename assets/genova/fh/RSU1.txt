# RSU1

## Overview
RSU1 (Ras suppressor protein 1) is a gene that encodes a leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and cytoskeletal organization. The RSU1 protein is a key component of the ILK/PINCH/Parvin (IPP) complex, which plays a critical role in linking the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby influencing cell adhesion, migration, and apoptosis (Yang2021Complex). RSU1 is known for its interaction with the PINCH1 protein, which is essential for focal adhesion assembly and actin dynamics (Fukuda2021Molecular). The protein's ability to modulate the Ras signaling pathway further highlights its significance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential role in cancer progression (Masuelli1996Increased). RSU1's involvement in these pathways underscores its importance in both normal cellular functions and pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Louca2020Ras).

## Structure
RSU1 (Ras suppressor protein 1) is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing protein that plays a significant role in cell signaling and adhesion. The protein adopts an arc-shaped solenoid structure, characterized by a canonical LRR domain, which includes an N-terminal cap region, eight tandem LRRs, and a C-terminal cap region. The N-cap consists of an α-helix and a loop, while the C-cap includes a β-strand followed by a helix-turn-helix motif, stabilizing the LRR domain by shielding hydrophobic core residues (Fukuda2021Molecular; Yang2021Complex).

RSU1 interacts with the LIM4-5 domains of the PINCH-1 protein, forming a high-affinity complex crucial for focal adhesion assembly. This interaction is facilitated by a large PINCH1-binding surface on the concave part of the LRR-solenoid in RSU1, with water molecules playing a crucial role in the interaction (Fukuda2021Molecular; Yang2021Complex). The RSU1 protein is involved in the ILK/PINCH/Parvin (IPP) complex, influencing actin dynamics and cell motility (Yang2021Complex).

RSU1 has two isoforms: RSU-1L and RSU-1-X1. RSU-1L is a 33KDa protein, while RSU-1-X1 is a truncated 29KDa isoform. RSU-1-X1 lacks a portion of the RSU-1L sequence and does not bind to PINCH-1, which affects its role in cell migration (Gkretsi2019Depletion).

## Function
RSU1 (Ras suppressor protein 1) is a key regulator of actin dynamics and focal adhesion in cells. It interacts with the PINCH1 protein, a component of the ILK/PINCH/Parvin (IPP) complex, which is essential for linking the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton. This interaction is crucial for regulating cell adhesion, migration, and apoptosis (Yang2021Complex). RSU1 binds to the C-terminal region of PINCH1, inhibiting the IPP complex's ability to bundle F-actin by overlapping with the actin-binding motif of PINCH1. This results in impaired stress fiber formation and cell spreading, as observed in HeLa cells (Yang2021Complex).

RSU1 also plays a role in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in modulating the Ras signaling pathway. It enhances Erk-2 activation while inhibiting Jun kinase activation, suggesting a shift in signal transduction pathways that may contribute to its role in maintaining the nontransformed state of cells (Masuelli1996Increased). RSU1 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is involved in maintaining normal cellular functions and tissue homeostasis by influencing cytoskeletal organization and cell adhesion (Louca2020Ras).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or interactions of the RSU1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer progression. In breast cancer, RSU1 overexpression in MCF-7 cells activates p21 and reduces cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. However, RSU1 is upregulated in more aggressive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, indicating a complex role in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Louca2020Ras). In glioblastoma, RSU1 expression varies with cell aggressiveness, promoting invasion in aggressive cells through STAT6 and MMP-13 activation, while inhibiting invasion in less aggressive cells (Louca2020Ras).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, RSU1 acts as a negative growth regulator, with deletions in the gene observed in 10% of patients, suggesting its role in inhibiting hepatocyte proliferation and migration (Donthamsetty2013Role). RSU1's interaction with the PINCH1 protein within the IPP complex is crucial for cell adhesion and migration, and disruptions in this interaction can lead to abnormal focal adhesion formation, impacting cancer metastasis (Fukuda2021Molecular; Gonzalez‐Nieves2013Rsu1). These findings underscore the potential of RSU1 as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
RSU1 (Ras suppressor protein 1) is known for its interactions with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. A key interaction is with PINCH1, a component of the ILK/PINCH/Parvin (IPP) complex, which is crucial for focal adhesion formation and cell motility. RSU1 binds to the C-terminal region of PINCH1, inhibiting the IPP complex's ability to bundle F-actin, thereby affecting stress fiber formation and cell spreading (Yang2021Complex). This interaction is characterized by a large binding surface and involves hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, which are essential for the specific recognition between RSU1 and PINCH1 (Yang2021Complex).

RSU1 also interacts with the LIM5 domain of PINCH1, forming a complex with distinct charge distributions and binding architecture. Key residues involved in this interaction include Arg165 and Asp166 from RSU1, which form salt-bridges with Asp295 and Arg314 of the PINCH1 LIM5 domain (Fukuda2021Molecular). This interaction is crucial for focal adhesion assembly and is maintained through specific electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Fukuda2021Molecular).

In addition to its interaction with PINCH1, RSU1 influences the Ras signaling pathway by modulating the levels and activity of RasGAP and associated proteins, affecting ERK-2 activation and inhibiting Jun kinase activation (Masuelli1996Increased).
