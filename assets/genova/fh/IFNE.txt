# IFNE

## Overview
The IFNE gene encodes interferon epsilon (IFN-ε), a member of the type I interferon family, which is primarily involved in immune regulation within the human female reproductive tract (hFRT). Unlike other type I interferons, IFN-ε is constitutively expressed and hormonally regulated, rather than being induced by pathogen recognition pathways. This protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining mucosal immunity and offers protection against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by modulating immune responses and inducing the expression of antiviral genes and chemokines (Bourke2022Spatiotemporal). Structurally, IFN-ε is characterized by an α-helical fold and features unique glycosylation sites and disulfide bonds that contribute to its stability and function (Zhao2022The; Marks2019PROPERTIES). Through its interaction with the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) complex, IFN-ε activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, albeit with distinct binding affinities and signaling capacities compared to other type I interferons (Marks2019PROPERTIES).

## Structure
The human IFNE gene encodes interferon epsilon, a type I interferon with unique structural features. The primary structure of the mature human IFN-ε protein consists of 185 amino acids, following the cleavage of a 21-residue signal peptide from the initial 208 amino acid sequence (Zhao2022The; Marks2019PROPERTIES). The secondary structure of IFN-ε includes five putative α helices, with a notable helix, Helix F, located on its C-terminal extension, which is absent in the mouse version (Zhao2022The). 

A critical disulfide bond is predicted to form between cysteine residues at positions 32 and 142, a common feature in type I interferons, contributing to the protein's stability and function (Zhao2022The; Marks2019PROPERTIES). IFN-ε also features glycosylation sites on asparagine residues 74 and 83, which are located on the connection loop between the B and C helices, potentially influencing protein folding and stability (Peng2007Purification).

The tertiary structure of IFN-ε is likely similar to other type I interferons, characterized by an α-helical fold, although specific details on the quaternary structure are not provided (Marks2019PROPERTIES). These structural characteristics suggest that IFN-ε is phylogenetically and structurally related to IFN-κ (Peng2007Purification).

## Function
Interferon epsilon (IFN-ε), encoded by the IFNE gene, is a type I interferon that plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly within the human female reproductive tract (hFRT). It is constitutively expressed in the epithelial cells of the hFRT, including the vagina, ectocervix, and endometrium, where it regulates protective immunoregulatory pathways (Bourke2022Spatiotemporal). IFN-ε modulates immune responses by inducing the expression of immune effector and signaling proteins, such as antiviral interferon-regulated genes (IRGs) like MX1, OAS2, and IRF7, as well as chemokines like CXCL10 (Bourke2022Spatiotemporal).

Unlike other type I interferons, IFN-ε is not induced by pattern recognition receptor pathways but is hormonally regulated, with its expression being negatively regulated by progesterone (Bourke2022Spatiotemporal). It is involved in maintaining mucosal immunity and is crucial for protection against viral and bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (Bourke2022Spatiotemporal). IFN-ε also plays a role in broader immune functions, such as inducing an antiviral state in macrophages and exhibiting antiproliferative and antitumor effects (Zhao2022The). Its expression in the hFRT is suggested to regulate homeostatic signals to fine-tune the innate immune system in mucosal surfaces (Bourke2022Spatiotemporal).

## Interactions
Interferon epsilon (IFNε) interacts with the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) complex, specifically binding to the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits. This interaction is crucial for its signaling pathway, which activates the JAK-STAT pathway. IFNε induces the phosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine 701 in human monocyte-derived macrophages and CD4+ T cells, although this occurs at a lower activity level compared to IFNα (Marks2019PROPERTIES). In mouse macrophage cell lines, IFNε also induces phosphorylation of STAT1, albeit with a delayed and weaker response than IFNβ (Marks2019PROPERTIES).

The binding affinities of IFNε for IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are significantly weaker than those of conventional IFNs α or β, with a preference for IFNAR1 binding. This suggests potential differences in signaling capacities, although these have not been experimentally validated (Marks2019PROPERTIES). IFNε can activate canonical IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) promoters, such as Isg15, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Marks2019PROPERTIES). There is no mention of direct interactions of IFNε with nucleic acids in the provided context (Marks2019PROPERTIES).
