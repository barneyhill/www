# STRBP

## Overview
The STRBP gene encodes the spermatid perinuclear RNA binding protein, which is primarily involved in RNA processing and regulation. This protein is categorized as an RNA-binding protein and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including antiviral innate immunity and RNA editing. STRBP interacts with proteins such as ADAR1 and ADAR2, indicating its involvement in RNA-dependent mechanisms (Freund2019Unbiased). Additionally, it has been implicated in the host response to viral infections, such as those caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus and Sindbis virus, by binding to viral RNA elements (Girardi2021Proteomicsbased; Muto2018Identification). Clinically, STRBP has been associated with cancer, notably as a fusion partner in Philadelphia chromosome-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia, and is a candidate for further research in tumorigenicity and other genetic traits (Won2012A; Liu2018Genomic; Zhang2021Identification).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
The STRBP gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, although its full significance is still under investigation. In the context of cancer, STRBP has been identified as a novel fusion partner with JAK2 in Philadelphia chromosome-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL), a subtype of leukemia associated with poor prognosis due to high relapse rates and resistance to standard treatments. The STRBP-JAK2 fusion was detected in a young adult patient whose leukemia was resistant to traditional therapies but responded to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (Zhang2021Identification).

In breast cancer research, STRBP has been highlighted as a gene with predicted damaging mutations, suggesting potential associations with breast cancer or other cancers. The gene was identified with a high CAM score, indicating it may be a candidate for further functional studies to explore its role in tumorigenicity (Won2012A).

Additionally, STRBP has been mentioned in genomic studies related to traits such as height and BMI, although specific clinical implications of STRBP mutations in these contexts are not detailed (Liu2018Genomic). Overall, while STRBP is associated with certain genetic alterations in cancer, its broader clinical significance requires further research.

## Interactions
STRBP, or spermatid perinuclear RNA binding protein, is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in RNA processing and regulation. STRBP interacts with ADAR1 and ADAR2 proteins, primarily in an RNA-dependent manner, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. These interactions are reduced upon RNase A treatment, indicating their RNA-dependence. However, an RNA-independent interaction between STRBP and ADAR2 has also been observed, suggesting a different mode of interaction when STRBP is used as the bait protein (Freund2019Unbiased).

In the context of viral infections, STRBP has been identified as a host protein that binds specifically to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) genomic RNA. This interaction was confirmed using RNA immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays, highlighting STRBP's role in the virus's natural transmission cycle and potential involvement in neurologic pathogenicity (Muto2018Identification).

STRBP is also part of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) interactome during Sindbis virus infection, suggesting its involvement in antiviral innate immunity. It is among several proteins with dsRNA binding domains that are enriched in infected samples (Girardi2021Proteomicsbased).
