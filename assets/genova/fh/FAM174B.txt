# FAM174B

## Overview
FAM174B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 174 member B. This protein is characterized by its transmembrane domain and is primarily involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle in cellular transport and protein processing. FAM174B is up-regulated in response to Golgi stress, indicating its role in the Golgi-specific unfolded protein response. The protein localizes to the Golgi, plasma membrane, and other cytoplasmic structures, suggesting its involvement in vesicular transport. Clinically, FAM174B has been associated with various diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and prostate cancer, where its expression levels correlate with disease progression and patient outcomes. Additionally, genetic variants of FAM174B have been linked to conditions such as idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and obesity, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Zhang2024IPFrelated; PaniaguaHerranz2024Genomic; Ma2023WholeExome; Serebrenik2018Targeted).

## Structure


## Function
FAM174B is a gene implicated in maintaining Golgi structural integrity and is involved in vesicular transport within healthy human cells. It is up-regulated in response to Golgi stress, such as that induced by treatments like HyT36 and nigericin, suggesting a role in the Golgi-specific unfolded protein response (Serebrenik2018Targeted). Knockdown experiments in HEK293 and HeLa cells have shown that reducing FAM174B expression leads to significant changes in Golgi structure, including fragmentation and altered morphology, which affects protein transport along the secretory pathway (Serebrenik2018Targeted). 

In silico analysis predicts that FAM174B contains a transmembrane domain and an N-terminal signal sequence for cotranslational import into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Localization studies using RFP fusion constructs have demonstrated that FAM174B-RFP is present at the Golgi, plasma membrane, and punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm, indicating its involvement in vesicular transport (Serebrenik2018Targeted). These findings suggest that FAM174B plays a crucial role in Golgi organization and possibly in the broader context of cellular transport mechanisms.

## Clinical Significance
FAM174B has been implicated in several diseases due to mutations, alterations in expression levels, or changes in its interactions. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), FAM174B is identified as a key gene associated with macrophages and fibrosis progression. It shows a significant negative correlation with most immune cells, suggesting a role in the immune response and disease progression. High expression of FAM174B is linked to poorer lung function and a more activated immune state in IPF patients, making it a potential biomarker for diagnosing and predicting IPF progression (Zhang2024IPFrelated).

In prostate cancer, high expression of FAM174B is associated with poor survival outcomes in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is part of a gene set that predicts detrimental survival, indicating its role in creating an inert immune microenvironment (PaniaguaHerranz2024Genomic).

FAM174B has also been studied in the context of obesity, where a nonsynonymous SNP in the gene was identified, though its clinical significance remains uncertain (Sarahan2011Four). In idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, variants in FAM174B were found in over 50% of patients, suggesting a possible association with the condition (Ma2023WholeExome).
