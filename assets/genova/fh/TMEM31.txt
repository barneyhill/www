# TMEM31

## Overview
TMEM31 is a gene that encodes the transmembrane protein 31, which is categorized as a transmembrane protein. This protein is involved in various cellular processes and has been identified as a cancer/testis antigen (CTA), making it a significant focus in cancer research and immunotherapy. The expression of TMEM31 is notably elevated in several types of cancer, including melanoma, where it plays a role in tumor progression and metastasis. Its overexpression in a wide range of cancers highlights its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. Additionally, TMEM31 has been studied in the context of genetic disorders, such as infertility, where certain variants have been linked to conditions like azoospermia and severe oligospermia, although the precise implications of these findings are still under investigation (Chen2020Wholeexome; Safavi2019In).

## Clinical Significance
TMEM31 has been identified as a cancer/testis antigen (CTA) with significant implications in cancer immunotherapy, particularly for melanoma. Its expression is notably increased during the progression of metastatic melanoma, making it a potential target for multiepitope cancer vaccines designed to activate the immune system against both primary and metastatic melanoma tumors (Safavi2019In). TMEM31 is also overexpressed in various other cancers, including glioma, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, urothelial, prostate, testis, breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancers, suggesting its broader relevance in oncology (Safavi2019In).

In breast cancer, TMEM31 has been associated with treatment outcomes, particularly in relation to the STING pathway. It is considered a key risk factor in prognostic models, with its expression correlating with immunosuppressive markers and influencing immune cell infiltration. High expression levels of TMEM31 are linked to enhanced migratory and proliferative capabilities in breast cancer cell lines, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhong2024Investigating).

Additionally, TMEM31 has been implicated in genetic studies related to infertility, with variants identified in patients with azoospermia and severe oligospermia, although the specific clinical significance of these mutations remains unclear (Chen2020Wholeexome).
