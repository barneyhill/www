# TUBA1A

## Overview
TUBA1A is a gene that encodes the tubulin alpha-1A protein, a crucial component of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubules are dynamic structures composed of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, playing essential roles in maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division. The tubulin alpha-1A protein, categorized as a structural protein, is particularly significant in the developing brain, where it is involved in neuronal migration, axon extension, and synapse formation. TUBA1A's unique function is underscored by its predominant expression in neurons, contributing to the formation and function of the neuronal cytoskeleton (Buscaglia2022Bridging; Aiken2019Tubulin). Mutations in TUBA1A are linked to various neurological disorders, including lissencephaly and other cortical malformations, highlighting its critical role in neurodevelopment (BahiBuisson2014The; Kumar2010TUBA1A).

## Structure
The TUBA1A gene encodes the tubulin alpha-1A protein, a critical component of microtubules. The primary structure of TUBA1A consists of a sequence of amino acids forming a polypeptide chain. The secondary structure is composed of approximately 39% alpha-helices, 12% beta-sheets, and 49% loops (Hoff2022The). The tertiary structure involves the 3D folding of the protein, which includes a core of two beta-sheets surrounded by alpha-helices (Poirier2012Expanding). 

TUBA1A is divided into three functional domains: the N-terminal domain (residues 1-205) contains the guanine nucleotide-binding region, the intermediate domain (residues 206-381) includes the Taxol drug-binding site, and the C-terminal domain (residues 382-451) serves as the binding surface for microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and molecular motors like kinesins and dyneins (Poirier2012Expanding; Kumar2010TUBA1A). 

In terms of quaternary structure, TUBA1A forms a heterodimer with beta-tubulin, which is essential for microtubule assembly and function (Hebebrand2019The). Post-translational modifications such as acetylation and phosphorylation can affect the function of the tubulin alpha-1A protein, although specific modifications are not detailed in the provided context.

## Function
The TUBA1A gene encodes the α-tubulin isotype, a critical component of microtubules, which are essential for various cellular functions in healthy human cells. Microtubules, composed of α- and β-tubulin subunits, are dynamic structures that play a vital role in maintaining cell shape, enabling intracellular transport, and facilitating cell division (Zocchi2023Novel; Xie2020LossofFunction). TUBA1A is particularly important in the developing brain, where it represents approximately 95% of α-tubulin mRNA in neurons, contributing significantly to the formation and function of the neuronal cytoskeleton (Aiken2019Tubulin).

In the context of neurodevelopment, TUBA1A is involved in processes such as neuronal migration, axon extension, and synapse formation. It supports the formation of midline commissures, which are crucial for connecting the two hemispheres of the brain (Buscaglia2022Bridging). The protein remains active in the microtubules after initial brain development phases, maintaining neuronal connectivity and stability (Aiken2019Tubulin). TUBA1A's role is not easily compensated by other α-tubulin isotypes, underscoring its unique and essential function in brain development and microtubule dynamics (Hoff2022The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TUBA1A gene are associated with a range of neurological disorders, primarily affecting neuronal migration and brain development. These mutations can lead to lissencephaly, a condition characterized by a smooth brain surface due to abnormal neuronal migration, and are found in approximately 7% of unexplained classic lissencephaly cases and 32% of lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH) cases (Kumar2010TUBA1A). TUBA1A mutations are also linked to other cortical malformations such as pachygyria, polymicrogyria-like cortical dysplasia, and microlissencephaly (BahiBuisson2014The).

The mutations are typically de novo heterozygous missense mutations, which can disrupt microtubule function by affecting protein interactions and GTP binding, leading to diverse phenotypic outcomes (Schröter2022Complementing; Xie2020LossofFunction). Specific mutations, such as p.R402H, are associated with classic lissencephaly, while others like p.R264C are linked to central pachygyria (BahiBuisson2014The). These mutations can result in severe neurological disorders, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy (BahiBuisson2014The).

The clinical spectrum of TUBA1A-related disorders includes anomalies of cortical gyration, basal ganglia, corpus callosum, and cerebellar vermis, often accompanied by global developmental delay and spasticity (Hebebrand2019The).

## Interactions
TUBA1A, a member of the tubulin family, is involved in several critical interactions essential for its function in microtubule dynamics. It forms heterodimers with beta-tubulin proteins, such as TUBB4A, which are crucial for microtubule assembly. The long non-coding RNA TubAR facilitates the formation of TUBA1A/TUBB4A heterodimers, promoting their incorporation into microtubules. TubAR interacts with TUBA1A and TUBB4A, forming a ternary complex that enhances their interaction, which is vital for microtubule assembly and myelination in the cerebellum (Liang2024LncRNA).

TUBA1A also interacts with motor proteins and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Variants of TUBA1A, such as p.(Arg402His) and p.(Arg422Ser), are located in regions that interact with motor proteins and MAPs, affecting their function and contributing to the pathophysiology of tubulinopathies (Schröter2022Complementing). The R402H mutation in TUBA1A disrupts the binding of MAPs, affecting neuronal migration and microtubule dynamics, which is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like lissencephaly (Leca2020A). These interactions highlight the importance of TUBA1A in maintaining the structural integrity and function of microtubules.
