# ATP6V1F

## Overview
ATP6V1F is a gene that encodes the ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit F, a crucial component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex. This protein is part of the V1 domain, which plays a significant role in the acidification of intracellular compartments, a process essential for various cellular functions such as protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release (Hu2023ATP6V1F). The ATP6V1F protein is predominantly active in organelles like lysosomes and endosomes, where it helps maintain cellular homeostasis by regulating pH levels (Hu2023ATP6V1F). As a component of the V-ATPase complex, ATP6V1F is involved in generating proton gradients across organelle membranes, which are vital for synaptic vesicle function and protein sorting (Hu2023ATP6V1F). The gene's expression and regulation have significant implications in cancer biology, where it is identified as an oncogene involved in tumor cell proliferation, particularly in gastrointestinal cancers (Huang2022Genomewide).

## Function
The ATP6V1F gene encodes a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, specifically part of the V1 domain. This complex is essential for acidifying intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, a process crucial for various cellular functions. The acidification facilitated by V-ATPase is necessary for protein degradation, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and neurotransmitter release, among other processes (Hu2023ATP6V1F). The ATP6V1F protein is active in organelles such as lysosomes and endosomes, where it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolism by regulating the pH within these compartments (Hu2023ATP6V1F).

In healthy human cells, the ATP6V1F subunit plays a role in generating proton gradients across organelle membranes, which is vital for synaptic vesicle function, zymogen activation, and protein sorting. These processes are integral to normal cellular operations and maintenance (Hu2023ATP6V1F). The protein's involvement in these molecular activities underscores its importance in the broader context of cell biology, influencing various intracellular pathways and ensuring the proper functioning of cellular systems.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the ATP6V1F gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of cancer, ATP6V1F is identified as an oncogene required for tumor cell proliferation in stomach, liver, and colorectal cancers. It is targeted by miR-194, a microRNA that acts as a tumor suppressor by downregulating ATP6V1F and other oncogenes, thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation (Huang2022Genomewide). This interaction suggests that ATP6V1F plays a significant role in the progression of gastrointestinal cancers and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target.

In renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), low mRNA and protein expression levels of ATP6V1F are significantly associated with advanced clinical cancer stages, nodal metastasis, and shorter overall survival in patients. This suggests that ATP6V1F expression levels could serve as prognostic markers in KIRC (Li2020Comprehensive). The gene's expression is also correlated with immune infiltration levels, particularly with CD8+ T cell infiltration, indicating its involvement in the tumor microenvironment (Li2020Comprehensive).

These findings underscore the clinical significance of ATP6V1F in cancer, both as a potential biomarker for prognosis and as a target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
ATP6V1F is a component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) complex, specifically part of the V1 domain, which is involved in proton transport across intracellular membranes. It interacts with other V-ATPase subunits, such as ATP6V1A, ATP6V1D, ATP6V0D1, ATP6V1E1, ATP6V1H, ATP6V1B2, ATP6V0C, ATP6V0B, and ATP6V1G1, forming a functional proton pump essential for acidifying intracellular compartments (Hu2023ATP6V1F). The F subunit, encoded by ATP6V1F, is crucial for the assembly of the Vo domain and forms part of the central stalk structure with the D subunit, which rotates driven by ATP hydrolysis and interacts with the c-ring in the Vo domain (Du2012Cloning).

In the context of cancer, ATP6V1F is downregulated by miR-194, a microRNA that binds to its mRNA, affecting its stability and expression. This interaction has been confirmed through RNA-seq and Ago-HITS-CLIP-seq data, indicating a direct binding of miR-194 to the mRNA of ATP6V1F (Huang2022Genomewide). This regulation by miR-194 suggests a role for ATP6V1F in tumor cell proliferation, as it is identified as an oncogene required for proliferation in stomach, liver, and colorectal cancers (Huang2022Genomewide).
