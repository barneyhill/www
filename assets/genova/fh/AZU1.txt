# AZU1

## Overview
Azurocidin 1 (AZU1) is a gene that encodes the protein azurocidin 1, a member of the serine protease family, although it lacks proteolytic activity. This protein is primarily located in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils and plays a crucial role in the immune response. Azurocidin 1 is involved in various biological processes, including antimicrobial activity, modulation of inflammation, and regulation of platelet function and hemostasis. It acts as a chemoattractant for immune cells and enhances cytokine release and bacterial phagocytosis. The protein's interactions with other molecules, such as neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, form complexes that contribute to immune defense mechanisms like the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Additionally, azurocidin 1 is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia, where its expression levels and interactions can influence disease progression and therapeutic resistance (Akgun2020Proteins; MoralesPrimo2021Neutrophil; Chen2000AZU1:).

## Structure
Azurocidin 1 (AZU1) is a protein encoded by the AZU1 gene in humans. It is a member of the serine protease family but notably lacks proteolytic activity. Structurally, AZU1 shares similarities with other serine proteases, featuring a typical serine protease fold. The protein is primarily found in neutrophil granules and plays a role in immune response.

AZU1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, which is crucial for its function and loading into small extracellular vesicles (SEVs). This glycosylation occurs at three potential sites: Asn 126, Asn 140, and Asn 171, leading to different molecular weights ranging from 29 to 37 kDa (Naito2021Azurocidin). The glycosylation of AZU1 is essential for its role in promoting transendothelial migration of renal cell carcinoma cells (Naito2021Azurocidin).

AZU1 can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may contribute to its functional diversity. The protein can form complexes with other proteins, indicating potential quaternary structures. In human neutrophils, AZU1 is associated with paucimannosidic N-glycans, which are linked to its secretion into pathogen-infected environments (ThaysenAndersen2015Human).

## Function
Azurocidin 1 (AZU1) is a multifunctional protein primarily found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils, where it plays a significant role in the immune response. It is known for its antimicrobial properties, acting as a chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages, and enhancing cytokine release and bacterial phagocytosis, which facilitates efficient bacterial clearance (Akgun2020Proteins). AZU1 also contributes to the modulation of inflammation by activating endothelial cells, leading to increased vascular permeability and edema formation, which are crucial during the immune response (Akgun2020Proteins).

In healthy human cells, AZU1 is involved in the regulation of platelet function and hemostasis. It is present in the α-granules of platelets and is secreted in response to stimuli such as thrombin, ADP, and lipopolysaccharide (AquinoDomínguez2022Human). AZU1 inhibits platelet aggregation and reduces the expression of activation markers CD62P and PAC-1, indicating a regulatory role in hemostasis (AquinoDomínguez2022Human). The protein's effects on vascular permeability are attributed to its cationic surface rather than receptor recognition, suggesting a unique mechanism of action in modulating platelet activity and blood coagulation processes (AquinoDomínguez2022Human).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the AZU1 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In breast cancer, AZU1 is identified as a potential tumor suppressor. Its expression is significantly reduced in breast carcinoma cell lines and primary tumors, suggesting a role in tumorigenic conversion and progression. Reexpression of AZU1 in tumorigenic cells has been shown to reduce their malignant phenotype, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in breast cancer (Chen2000AZU1:).

In thyroid carcinoma, AZU1 is associated with immune infiltration, particularly with myeloid dendritic cells, suggesting its involvement in the immune response to tumors. It is one of the differentially expressed immune-associated genes in thyroid cancer, indicating a role in tumor progression and immune response (Xue2020A).

AZU1 expression is also altered in prostate cancer, where it is downregulated in tumor tissues and urine samples from patients, highlighting its potential as a urinary biomarker for distinguishing prostate cancer from benign conditions (Lima2021Bioinformatic).

In chronic myeloid leukemia, AZU1 is linked to resistance mechanisms against tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, interacting with key signaling pathways involved in drug resistance (Cha2016Discovering).

## Interactions
Azurocidin 1 (AZU1) is involved in several protein interactions that play a role in immune response and inflammation. AZU1 is part of a complex with neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CatG), known as the azurosome, which is released from azurophilic granules during NOX-dependent NETosis. This complex binds to the actin network, facilitating the translocation of enzymes to the nucleus, where they cleave core histones and promote chromatin relaxation, leading to the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (MoralesPrimo2021Neutrophil).

AZU1 also interacts with endothelial cells, where it accumulates on proteoglycans, acting as a primary binding site for monocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This interaction promotes the expression of cellular adhesion molecules, facilitating the adhesion and extravasation of immune cells (MoralesPrimo2021Neutrophil). In the context of sepsis, AZU1 forms stable circulating complexes with pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), as identified through immunoprecipitation and proteomics analysis (Daigo2012Hostprotective).

In renal cell carcinoma, AZU1 is loaded into small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) via N-linked glycosylation, enhancing endothelial permeability and promoting cancer cell migration (Naito2021Azurocidin).
