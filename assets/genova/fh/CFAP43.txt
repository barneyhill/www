# CFAP43

## Overview
The CFAP43 gene encodes the cilia and flagella associated protein 43, a crucial component involved in the structural and functional integrity of cilia and flagella. This protein is characterized by its WD repeat and coiled-coil domains, which facilitate protein-protein interactions and the assembly of protein complexes, respectively. CFAP43 plays a significant role in the formation and maintenance of the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, and is essential for ciliary motility and signaling. It is particularly important in tissues with motile cilia, such as the respiratory and reproductive systems, where it contributes to processes like mucociliary clearance and sperm motility. Mutations in CFAP43 are linked to clinical conditions such as multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF) and normal-pressure hydrocephalus, highlighting its critical role in human health (Rachev2020CFAP43; Yu2020CFAP43mediated; Morimoto2019Nonsense).

## Structure
The CFAP43 protein is encoded by the CFAP43 gene and consists of 1665 to 1682 amino acids, depending on the source (Rachev2020CFAP43; Wu2019NovelCFAP43). It features six WD repeat domains in its N-terminal region, which are known for forming beta-propeller structures that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Rachev2020CFAP43; Wu2019NovelCFAP43). The C-terminal region contains six coiled-coil domains, which are typically involved in forming stable, rod-like structures that mediate the assembly of protein complexes (Rachev2020CFAP43).

The secondary structure of CFAP43 includes a region from amino acids 1019 to 1449 that predominantly forms helices. A specific deletion, p.E1221_K1256del, affects this helical region, leading to shorter or reorganized helices and a tighter mutant protein structure compared to the wild-type (Li2020Mutational).

CFAP43 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, such as sperm cells and tracheal epithelial cells, and is involved in ciliary function. Its expression is regulated by the transcription factor FOXJ1 (Rachev2020CFAP43). The protein's role in ciliary motility is crucial for processes like mucociliary clearance and brain development (Rachev2020CFAP43).

## Function
The CFAP43 gene encodes a protein that plays a critical role in the structure and function of cilia and flagella, which are essential for cell motility and signaling. In healthy human cells, CFAP43 is involved in the formation and maintenance of the axoneme, the core structural component of cilia and flagella. This protein is part of the tether/tether head complex, linking the inner dynein arm motor head to the A-tubule of the outer microtubule doublet, which is crucial for ciliary bending and motility (Rachev2020CFAP43).

CFAP43 is expressed in tissues with motile cilia, such as the respiratory tract and reproductive system, where it modulates ciliary beating and is essential for mucociliary clearance and sperm motility (Rachev2020CFAP43). In the context of spermatogenesis, CFAP43 is crucial for sperm head shaping and flagella formation, facilitating intra-manchette transport, which is necessary for the proper assembly and elongation of the sperm tail (Yu2020CFAP43mediated). Mutations in CFAP43 can lead to multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), resulting in male infertility (Yu2020CFAP43mediated).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the CFAP43 gene are linked to several clinical conditions, primarily affecting ciliary and flagellar function. In humans, CFAP43 mutations are associated with multiple morphological abnormalities of the sperm flagella (MMAF), a condition that leads to male infertility. This is characterized by various defects in sperm flagella, such as coiled, bent, or absent flagella, resulting in sperm immobility (Sha2019Novel; Li2020Mutational). 

CFAP43 mutations are also implicated in normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition characterized by excess cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to symptoms like gait impairment and cognitive decline. This condition is linked to ciliary dysfunction, as CFAP43 is crucial for proper ciliary movement (Morimoto2019Nonsense). 

In mice, CFAP43 mutations result in early-onset hydrocephalus, likely due to defects in ciliary structures within the brain (Rachev2020CFAP43). Although CFAP43 is involved in ciliary function, it does not qualify as a primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) gene, as mutations do not lead to immobile cilia, a hallmark of PCD (Rachev2020CFAP43).

## Interactions
CFAP43 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for ciliary and flagellar function. It forms a complex with FAP44, and their localization to cilia is interdependent. The absence of one protein results in the absence of the other, indicating a close functional relationship (Urbanska2018Ciliary). This complex is positioned near the inner dynein arm I1, suggesting a role in regulating its motor activity (Urbanska2018Ciliary). 

CFAP43 also interacts with FAP57, although FAP57 does not require CFAP43 for its ciliary localization (Urbanska2018Ciliary). The interactions between CFAP43, FAP44, and FAP57 are essential for proper cilia and flagella beating, as these proteins likely form a minor ciliary complex (Urbanska2018Ciliary).

In addition to these interactions, CFAP43 has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with nucleoporins and dynein heavy chains when overexpressed, although these are not considered true interactors at native expression levels (Urbanska2018Ciliary). The C-terminal fragment of CFAP43 is crucial for its ciliary transport and localization, potentially mediating interactions with intraflagellar transport subunits or adaptor proteins (Urbanska2018Ciliary).
