# MTMR4

## Overview
MTMR4, or myotubularin-related protein 4, is a gene that encodes a phosphoinositide-specific 3'-phosphatase, which is part of the myotubularin family. The protein product of MTMR4 is involved in crucial cellular processes, including endocytic and autophagic pathways, by regulating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) levels. This regulation is essential for vesicular trafficking and maturation within these pathways. MTMR4 is characterized by several domains, including a PH-GRAM domain, a myotubularin homology region, and a FYVE domain, which contribute to its structural integrity and functional specificity. The protein is primarily localized in late endosomes and autophagosomes, where it influences the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors like TFEB, thereby maintaining lysosomal and autophagic integrity. MTMR4 also plays a role in endosomal trafficking, phagocytosis, and cytokinesis through interactions with various proteins, including ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and Rab11. Clinically, mutations in MTMR4 have been linked to cardiovascular conditions such as congenital long QT syndrome and may also be involved in muscle atrophy and aortic aneurysms (Pham2018MTMR4; Plant2009The; Lee2014Crystallization; Naughtin2010The; Wang2024Recent).

## Structure
MTMR4 is a member of the myotubularin family of phosphatases, characterized by several distinct domains that contribute to its function and localization. The protein contains an N-terminal PH-GRAM domain, which is involved in protein-protein or lipid-protein interactions and is crucial for the localization and functional specificity of MTMR4 (Lee2014Crystallization). The central region of MTMR4 includes a myotubularin homology region (MTMHR) and a coiled-coil motif, which are important for its structural integrity and interaction with other proteins (Naughtin2010The). At the C-terminus, MTMR4 features a FYVE domain, typically involved in binding phosphoinositides, although in MTMR3, a related protein, this domain does not drive localization to internal membranes, suggesting a similar function in MTMR4 (Tronch�re2003Implication).

MTMR4 undergoes post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which may account for its observed molecular mass of approximately 170 kDa, despite a predicted mass of 130 kDa (Naughtin2010The). The protein is also subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms, although specific details on these variants are not provided in the context. The structural studies of MTMR4 aim to elucidate the role of its domains in its phosphatase activity and endosomal localization (Lee2014Crystallization).

## Function
MTMR4 (myotubularin related protein 4) is a phosphoinositide-specific 3'-phosphatase that plays a crucial role in regulating endocytic and autophagic pathways in human cells. It is primarily localized in late endosomes and autophagosomes, where it regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) levels, which are essential for vesicular trafficking and maturation within these pathways (Pham2018MTMR4). MTMR4 influences the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB, a transcription factor that controls lysosomal and autophagic gene expression, thereby maintaining lysosomal and autophagic integrity (Pham2018MTMR4).

In endosomal trafficking, MTMR4 is involved in the regulation of sorting from early endosomes and recycling pathways. It localizes to early and recycling endosomes and affects the distribution of Rab11 and VAMP3-decorated endosomes, suggesting its role in regulating the intracellular distribution of the recycling compartment (Naughtin2010The). MTMR4 also regulates the number of PtdIns(3)P-decorated endosomes, influencing the exit of transferrin from early endosomes into recycling pathways (Naughtin2010The).

MTMR4 is also involved in phagocytosis, where it regulates phagosomal phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate turnover and phagocytosis. It dephosphorylates PtdIns(3)P and PtdInsP2, impacting the duration of PtdIns(3)P signaling on phagosomes and influencing phagosomal maturation (Sheffield2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the MTMR4 gene have been implicated in several cardiovascular conditions. MTMR4 is associated with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), particularly LQT1, where specific single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within its phosphatase region can mitigate the severity of the condition. These SNVs, rs2302189 (V297G) and rs3744108 (L170V), reduce the activity of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4L, leading to decreased degradation of ion channels such as KCNQ1 and hERG. This results in increased ion channel density on the plasma membrane, which compensates for deficits caused by mutations like Y111C in KCNQ1, thereby reducing the clinical severity of LQTS (Lee2020MTMR4).

MTMR4 is also involved in the regulation of the TGFβ signaling pathway, which is linked to the development of aortic aneurysms. Although MTMR4 is identified as a predictive target of microRNAs serving as diagnostic biomarkers for aortic aneurysm, there is no direct evidence of its curative effects (Wang2024Recent). Additionally, MTMR4's interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 suggests a role in muscle atrophy, as MTMR4 is a target for Nedd4-mediated degradation, particularly in conditions of muscle atrophy induced by denervation (Plant2009The).

## Interactions
MTMR4 interacts with several proteins, playing significant roles in various cellular processes. It interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 through a WW domain-PY motif interaction. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of MTMR4, particularly in the context of muscle atrophy, where Nedd4 expression increases and MTMR4 levels decrease (Plant2009The).

MTMR4 also interacts with proteins involved in cytokinesis. It forms a heterodimer with MTMR3 through their coiled coil domains, facilitating interactions with polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and centrosomal protein of 55 kDa (CEP55). MTMR4 interacts with CEP55 via a GPPXXXY motif, which is crucial for proper abscission during cell division (StDenis2015Myotubularinrelated).

In the context of endosomal sorting, MTMR4 interacts with Rab11 and VAMP3, influencing the distribution of endosomes and regulating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) levels. These interactions are important for the recycling of transferrin and the regulation of endosomal sorting pathways (Naughtin2010The).
