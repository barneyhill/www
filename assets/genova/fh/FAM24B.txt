# FAM24B

## Overview
FAM24B is a gene that encodes a member of the protein family with sequence similarity 24, member B. This gene is involved in various biological processes, although its precise functions remain to be fully elucidated. The protein encoded by FAM24B is not categorized into a specific class such as kinases or receptors, but it is implicated in cellular mechanisms that may influence gene expression and chromosomal stability. Research has highlighted its potential role in disease contexts, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and pancreatic cancer, where alterations in its expression and structural integrity have been observed (Jing2020Identification; Milani2008Allelespecific). The gene's involvement in complex chromosomal rearrangements further underscores its significance in genetic studies and potential implications for genetic counseling (Tan2020Wholegenome).

## Function


## Clinical Significance
The FAM24B gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in relation to its expression and structural alterations. In the study of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children, FAM24B was identified as one of the genes exhibiting allele-specific expression (ASE) influenced by CpG site methylation. A significant correlation was observed between ASE levels and methylation, suggesting that methylation may regulate FAM24B expression in leukemic cells (Milani2008Allelespecific).

In another study, complex chromosomal rearrangements involving FAM24B were identified through whole-genome sequencing. These rearrangements, which included disruptions of FAM24B, were found in a family with no apparent phenotype in the carrier, highlighting the potential for cryptic structural variations that may not manifest clinically but could have implications for genetic counseling and reproductive risks (Tan2020Wholegenome).

Additionally, FAM24B was noted as a down-regulated gene in pancreatic cancer, although its specific clinical significance in this context was not detailed (Jing2020Identification). These findings suggest that FAM24B may play a role in various diseases, influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors.
