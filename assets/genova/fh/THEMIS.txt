# THEMIS

## Overview
THEMIS is a gene that encodes the protein thymocyte selection-associated, which plays a pivotal role in the development and maturation of T cells within the immune system. The protein is characterized as an adapter or linker protein, lacking classical catalytic domains, and is primarily expressed in the thymus and secondary lymphoid tissues (Lesourne2009Themis). THEMIS is integral to T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, where it participates in the positive selection of thymocytes, a critical process ensuring the survival of T cells that can recognize self-MHC molecules (Lesourne2009Themis). Structurally, the protein contains unique CABIT domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions, and a proline-rich region that binds to the adaptor protein Grb2, influencing MAP kinase signaling (Beyett2024Structure; Lesourne2009Themis). THEMIS is also involved in modulating the activity of phosphatases like Shp1, thereby regulating the threshold for TCR signaling and ensuring proper immune responses (Mehta2018Themisassociated). Understanding the function and interactions of THEMIS is crucial for elucidating its role in immune-related diseases and potential therapeutic interventions.

## Structure
THEMIS is a protein crucial for T cell development, characterized by its unique structural features. The primary structure of THEMIS includes a sequence of 636 amino acids in mice, with the human ortholog sharing 80% identity (Lesourne2009Themis). THEMIS contains two uncharacterized CABIT (Cysteine-containing All-Beta In THEMIS) domains, which are important for protein-protein interactions (Beyett2024Structure). The CABIT2 domain, in particular, reveals a novel protein fold composed mainly of β-sheets and includes an SH3-like subdomain (Beyett2024Structure). This domain is nearly all beta, consisting of 16 β-sheets and four short helices, and is divided into two subdomains: the 'core' and the 'head' (Beyett2024Structure).

THEMIS also features a proline-rich region that allows it to bind to the adaptor protein Grb2, which is involved in MAP kinase signaling (Lesourne2009Themis). Post-translational modifications include tyrosine phosphorylation, which occurs after TCR stimulation and is crucial for its function in TCR signaling (Mehta2018Themisassociated). THEMIS lacks classical catalytic domains, resembling an adapter or linker protein (Lesourne2009Themis). The protein is expressed in the thymus and secondary lymphoid tissues, and its nuclear importation is facilitated by a bipartite nuclear localization signal (Lesourne2009Themis).

## Function
THEMIS is a critical component in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, primarily involved in the development and maturation of T cells. It is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon TCR engagement, indicating its role in early TCR signaling events (Brockmeyer2011T). THEMIS interacts with key signaling molecules such as LAT and Grb2, and is essential for the activation of the ERK pathway, which is crucial for IL-2 production and T cell proliferation (Brockmeyer2011T). 

In thymocytes, THEMIS is vital for positive selection, a process that ensures the survival and maturation of T cells that can adequately recognize self-MHC molecules. The absence of THEMIS results in a block in the development of single-positive thymocytes, highlighting its importance in T cell maturation (Lesourne2009Themis). THEMIS also regulates the threshold for positive versus negative selection by modulating the activity of the phosphatase Shp1, which is a negative regulator of TCR signaling (Mehta2018Themisassociated). 

Overall, THEMIS functions as a selective amplifier in the Ras pathway, influencing T cell development and ensuring proper immune responses (Brockmeyer2011T).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the THEMIS gene have been implicated in several immune-related diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been linked to impaired regulatory T cell function due to mutations in THEMIS, as observed in rat models. These mutations lead to increased Th17-Th2 cytokine production and reduced IFN-γ production, contributing to the development of IBD (Chabod2012A).

In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), genome-wide association studies have identified a variant at the THEMIS/PTPRK locus associated with MS susceptibility. This variant affects the expression of THEMIS in CD4+ T cells, potentially altering immune responses and increasing disease risk (Davies2016Increased). Themis also interacts with Vav1, and combined mutations in these genes have been shown to reduce the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for MS, by decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and T cell infiltration in the central nervous system (Marrocco2024Positive).

Themis deficiency has also been associated with increased susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis and protection from cerebral malaria, indicating its role in modulating immune responses to infections (Gautam2023Themis). Understanding the clinical significance of THEMIS mutations and expression alterations is crucial for developing targeted therapies for these conditions.

## Interactions
THEMIS is involved in several key interactions that are crucial for T-cell development and signaling. It interacts with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1, a negative regulator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. THEMIS enhances SHP1 phosphatase activity by increasing its phosphorylation, which is essential for proper T-cell development and response to TCR stimulation (Mehta2018Themisassociated). In the absence of SHP1, THEMIS can interact with SHP2, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that allows for relatively normal thymocyte development (Mehta2018Themisassociated).

THEMIS also interacts with the adaptor protein GRB2. This interaction involves the proline-rich segment (PRS) of THEMIS binding to the C-terminal SH3 domain of GRB2, while SHP1 binds to the N-terminal SH3 domain of GRB2 (Beyett2024Structure; Mehta2018Themisassociated). These interactions are part of a complex that modulates TCR signaling pathways, influencing the selection thresholds during T-cell development (Fu2013Themis).

THEMIS is also associated with the LAT signalosome, influencing the phosphorylation of signaling molecules like LAT and PLCγ1, which are part of the proximal TCR signaling pathway (Fu2013Themis). These interactions highlight the role of THEMIS in fine-tuning TCR signaling and ensuring proper T-cell maturation.
