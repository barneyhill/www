# FAM156A

## Overview
FAM156A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 156 member A. This protein is characterized as a cell-membrane protein with low tissue specificity, suggesting a broad but not highly specialized role in cellular functions (Downie2021Identification). While the precise biological functions of the FAM156A protein remain to be fully elucidated, it has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including X-linked mental retardation and familial membranous nephropathy, due to its location on the X chromosome and potential involvement in disease mechanisms (Lombard2011A). Additionally, FAM156A is part of the genomic region affected in Xp11.2 microduplications, which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (Moey2015Xp11.2). The gene's expression is also noted to be downregulated in Kawasaki Disease, linking it to apoptotic pathways (Ni2022CircRNA3302). Further research is necessary to clarify the specific roles and interactions of FAM156A in these and other biological contexts.

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
FAM156A has been implicated in several conditions due to its potential role in disease mechanisms. It has been identified as a strong candidate gene for X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) through computational approaches that prioritize candidate genes based on annotation and sequence motif analysis. FAM156A was highlighted as a highly-ranked candidate for XLMR, although its specific function remains unknown (Lombard2011A). 

In the context of familial membranous nephropathy (MN), FAM156A is located within a region on the X chromosome linked to the disease, although its specific role in MN is not well understood. It is identified as a cell-membrane protein with low tissue specificity, suggesting a need for further research to explore its involvement in MN (Downie2021Identification).

Additionally, FAM156A has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in the context of Xp11.2 microduplications. While the clinical significance of FAM156A itself is not directly addressed, it is part of the duplicated region in some patients with intellectual and developmental disturbances (Moey2015Xp11.2). 

Research also indicates that FAM156A is downregulated in Kawasaki Disease, where it is associated with apoptotic cell death during caspase 3 activation (Ni2022CircRNA3302).
