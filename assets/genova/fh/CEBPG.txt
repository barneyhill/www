# CEBPG

## Overview
CEBPG, or CCAAT enhancer binding protein gamma, is a gene that encodes the C/EBPγ protein, a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of gene expression related to cellular stress responses, redox homeostasis, and DNA repair. C/EBPγ functions as a transcription factor by forming heterodimers with other proteins, such as ATF4 and C/EBPβ, to modulate the expression of genes involved in stress response and cell proliferation. It acts as a transdominant negative inhibitor of other C/EBP family members, influencing various cellular processes. The gene's expression and activity have significant implications in diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with tumor progression and cellular proliferation (Huggins2016CEBPγ; Jiang2021CEBPG; Hartl2023CEBPFamily).

## Function
The CEBPG gene encodes the C/EBPγ protein, a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular stress response networks. It primarily functions through heterodimerization with the transcription factor ATF4, which is essential for the regulation of integrated stress response (ISR) genes. These genes are upregulated in response to various cellular stresses, such as oxidative stress and nutrient deprivation (Huggins2016CEBPγ).

C/EBPγ is involved in maintaining redox homeostasis by regulating genes associated with glutathione synthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. In C/EBPγ-deficient cells, there is impaired glutathione synthesis, leading to oxidative stress and poor cell proliferation (Huggins2016CEBPγ). The protein also plays a role in DNA repair, as it is correlated with the expression of several DNA repair genes, such as ERCC5, in healthy cells (Crawford2007CEBPG; Mullins2005CEBPG).

C/EBPγ is active in the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. It is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes related to antioxidant defense and DNA repair, contributing to cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative damage (Huggins2016CEBPγ; Mullins2005CEBPG).

## Clinical Significance
CEBPG (CCAAT enhancer binding protein gamma) plays a significant role in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is overexpressed in AML cell lines compared to non-AML hematopoietic cells, as evidenced by ChIP-Seq data and transcriptomic datasets. This overexpression is linked to the activation of CEBPG through its distal enhancer, contributing to the disease's progression by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (Jiang2021CEBPG). Knockdown experiments in AML cell lines have shown that reducing CEBPG levels significantly inhibits cell proliferation and increases apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jiang2021CEBPG).

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), CEBPG is upregulated in tumor samples and may promote tumor progression by increasing the risk of lymph node involvement, especially when C/EBPδ is low. However, its expression does not independently correlate with patient survival, suggesting a complex role in PDAC pathogenesis (Hartl2023CEBPFamily). The redundancy among C/EBP family members, including CEBPG, indicates that its expression levels, along with other family members, could be clinically relevant for predicting patient outcomes in PDAC (Hartl2023CEBPFamily).

## Interactions
CEBPG, also known as C/EBPγ, is a transcription factor that primarily functions through interactions with other proteins. It forms heterodimers with ATF4, a critical interaction for regulating cellular stress response networks. This interaction is essential for the transcriptional activation of stress response genes, as C/EBPγ:ATF4 heterodimers bind to CARE/AARE sites, specific DNA sequences involved in stress response (Huggins2016CEBPγ). The interaction between C/EBPγ and ATF4 is confirmed through coimmunoprecipitation assays, indicating that these proteins can interact independently of stress signals (Huggins2016CEBPγ).

CEBPG also interacts with C/EBPβ, forming heterodimers that suppress senescence and inflammatory gene expression. This interaction is crucial for cell proliferation, as demonstrated by the increased expression of senescence-associated genes in Cebpg-deficient cells (Huggins2013CEBPγ). C/EBPγ acts as a transdominant negative inhibitor of other C/EBP family members, such as NF-IL6 (C/EBPβ) and C/EBPα, by inhibiting their transcriptional activity through heterodimerization (Cooper1995IgEBP). These interactions highlight C/EBPγ's role in modulating gene expression and cellular processes related to stress response and proliferation.
