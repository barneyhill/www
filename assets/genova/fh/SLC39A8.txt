# SLC39A8

## Overview
The SLC39A8 gene encodes the protein solute carrier family 39 member 8 (ZIP8), which is a critical component of the ZIP family of metal ion transporters. ZIP8 is an eight-transmembrane protein that facilitates the transport of divalent metal ions, including manganese (Mn²⁺), zinc (Zn²⁺), and iron (Fe²⁺), across cellular membranes (Samuelson2022Divalent). This protein is predominantly located on the cell surface and within intracellular organelles, playing a vital role in maintaining metal ion homeostasis and supporting various cellular functions, such as mitochondrial activity and oxidative stress management (Choi2018Functional). Mutations in the SLC39A8 gene can lead to significant health issues, including congenital disorders of glycosylation and neurodegenerative diseases, due to disrupted metal ion transport and subsequent cellular dysfunction (Choi2018Functional; Bonaventura2021Clinical).

## Structure
The SLC39A8 gene encodes the ZIP8 protein, which is involved in the transport of multiple metal ions, including Zn²⁺, Mn²⁺, Fe²⁺, Se²⁺, Co²⁺, and Cd²⁺. ZIP8 is predicted to be an eight-transmembrane protein, heavily glycosylated, and primarily located on the cell-surface membrane, as well as in the membranes of intracellular organelles such as the Golgi body, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria (Samuelson2022Divalent). The protein's structure includes highly conserved transmembrane domains IV and V, which are proposed to form part of an ion channel (Samuelson2022Divalent).

ZIP8 has a classic SLC39 structure with eight transmembrane domains, with both N- and C-termini facing the extracytoplasmic space (Choi2018Functional). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is significant for its function and localization (Samuelson2022Divalent). Variants such as the Ala391Thr substitution, located within the transmembrane domain, can affect the protein's structure and function, influencing metal ion transport and associated physiological processes (Bonaventura2021Clinical; Zhang2016A). The protein's structural integrity is crucial for its role in metal ion transport and cellular homeostasis.

## Function
The SLC39A8 gene encodes a protein that functions as a manganese (Mn) transporter, playing a critical role in maintaining Mn homeostasis in human cells. This protein, part of the ZIP family of metal transporters, is primarily involved in the uptake of Mn, which is essential for various cellular processes, including mitochondrial function and oxidative stress management (Choi2018Functional). In healthy cells, SLC39A8 is localized on the cell surface, facilitating Mn transport into the cell, which supports the activity of Mn-dependent enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in mitochondria (Choi2018Functional).

SLC39A8 also influences the expression of mitochondrial DNA-encoded genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP production, and mitochondrial redox activity (Choi2018Functional). This function is vital for preventing oxidative stress and ensuring efficient energy production. The protein's role extends to the regulation of other metal ions, such as zinc, although it has a higher affinity for Mn under physiological conditions (Choi2018Functional). Proper functioning of SLC39A8 is crucial for cellular health, as mutations in this gene can lead to severe Mn deficiency and associated mitochondrial dysfunction (Choi2018Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC39A8 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions due to its role in manganese transport. Notably, mutations in SLC39A8 can lead to severe manganese deficiency, which is linked to congenital disorder of glycosylation type II (CDG type II) and Leigh syndrome. CDG type II is characterized by delayed psychomotor development and defects in protein glycosylation, potentially due to insufficient manganese supply for manganese-dependent enzymes (Choi2018Functional). Leigh syndrome, a neurodegenerative disorder, is also associated with SLC39A8 mutations, which disrupt manganese homeostasis and contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress (Choi2018Functional).

The SLC39A8 gene has also been implicated in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). A missense variant, rs13107325, results in reduced manganese transport and is associated with severe AIS, characterized by greater spinal curvature, decreased height, and increased BMI (Haller2018A). Additionally, SLC39A8 mutations are linked to a condition known as SLC39A8-CDG, which presents with symptoms such as hypotonia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. This condition is marked by impaired manganese-dependent enzyme activity, leading to glycosylation defects (Bonaventura2021Clinical).

## Interactions
The SLC39A8 gene encodes the ZIP8 protein, which is involved in the transport of essential micronutrients such as zinc, manganese, selenium, and cadmium. ZIP8 participates in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In a study using a ZIP8 knockout model, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified 819 interactions among 243 proteins, with ZIP8 directly interacting with the transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) (Tan2022Singlegene). This interaction suggests a role in iron homeostasis, as TFRC is crucial for iron uptake.

ZIP8 also affects the expression of uncharacterized proteins such as C9orf85 and CXorf38, which were significantly downregulated in ZIP8 knockout cells. C9orf85 was found to interact with TMEM30A, indicating potential involvement in cellular transport processes (Tan2022Singlegene). The absence of ZIP8 leads to dysregulated intracellular levels of micronutrients, impacting cellular homeostasis and protein expression (Tan2022Singlegene).

ZIP8's role in zinc transport is particularly significant in the context of glutamate receptor function and immune signaling. The A391T variant of ZIP8 results in decreased zinc import, affecting the surface localization of glutamate receptor subunits and leading to altered synaptic activity and immune responses (Tseng2021Schizophreniaassociated). These interactions highlight ZIP8's critical role in maintaining cellular metal ion balance and its broader implications in health and disease.
