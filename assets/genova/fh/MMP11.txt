# MMP11

## Overview
Matrix metallopeptidase 11 (MMP11) is a gene that encodes the protein matrix metallopeptidase 11, also known as stromelysin-3, which is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. This family of proteins is characterized by their ability to degrade components of the extracellular matrix, playing crucial roles in tissue remodeling, wound healing, and embryonic development (Khasigov2001Matrixmetalloproteinasesofnormalhumantissues; MURPHY2008Progress). Unlike most MMPs, MMP11 is unique in that it is activated intracellularly by the enzyme furin, allowing it to be secreted in an active form (MURPHY2008Progress). The protein is involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including the regulation of adipose tissue integrity and mammary gland development, as well as cancer progression, where it interacts with several signaling pathways and other proteins (ZHANG2016Insights; Motrescu2008Matrix; Tan2013Stromal). MMP11's expression and activity are tightly regulated, and its dysregulation is associated with several types of cancer, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention (Chen2020&lt).

## Structure
Matrix metallopeptidase 11 (MMP-11), also known as stromelysin-3, is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family characterized by a unique structural composition. The protein consists of several domains, including a signal peptide, a prodomain, a catalytic domain, and a hemopexin-like C-terminal domain (Matziari2006Matrix). Unlike most MMPs, MMP-11 is activated intracellularly by a furin recognition motif, allowing it to be secreted in an active form (MURPHY2008Progress).

The catalytic domain of MMP-11 features a zinc-binding motif, essential for its enzymatic activity. This domain is composed of a five-stranded beta-sheet and three alpha-helices, a topology common among MMPs (Matziari2006Matrix). The active site contains a zinc atom coordinated by three histidine residues, and the S1' cavity is notable for accommodating long side chains, which influences substrate specificity (Matziari2006Matrix).

A unique structural feature of human MMP-11 is the presence of an alanine residue in the Met-turn motif, replacing the conserved proline found in other MMPs. This substitution affects the enzyme's activity and substrate interaction (Noël1995Identification; Matziari2006Matrix). MMP-11 also undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may influence its function and stability (MURPHY2008Progress).

## Function
Matrix metallopeptidase 11 (MMP11) is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase involved in various physiological processes, including tissue remodeling, wound healing, and embryonic development. Unlike most other matrix metalloproteinases, MMP11 is secreted in an active form and primarily functions within the Golgi apparatus, where it is activated by the subtilisin-like proteinase furin (Khasigov2001Matrixmetalloproteinasesofnormalhumantissues; Jackson2010Update).

MMP11 plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of adipose tissue by regulating collagen VI, an extracellular matrix component associated with adipocytes. It specifically cleaves the a3 chain of collagen VI, which is essential for proper collagen folding and fat tissue cohesion (Motrescu2008Matrix). This activity is significant in both normal and malignant conditions, as MMP11's collagenolytic function helps maintain extracellular matrix stability and influences adipocyte differentiation (Motrescu2008Matrix).

In the context of mammary gland development, MMP11 is expressed in the stroma and is necessary for optimal ductal morphogenesis and alveolar function. Its absence leads to impaired mammary gland development, reduced milk production, and altered collagen homeostasis, highlighting its role in epithelial-stromal interactions (Tan2013Stromal).

## Clinical Significance
Matrix metallopeptidase 11 (MMP11) is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels. In bladder cancer, MMP11 is overexpressed, particularly in advanced stages, and is associated with poor patient survival. Its expression correlates with advanced tumor stage, recurrence, metastasis, high disease grade, and non-papillary subtype. The upregulation of MMP11 in bladder cancer is linked to promoter hypomethylation rather than mutations or amplifications, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (p&gt; Chen2020&lt; Matrix).

In breast cancer, MMP11 is overexpressed in various subtypes, including invasive ductal carcinoma, HER2 enriched, and ER positive tumors. This overexpression is associated with poor overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival, particularly in ER positive and Grade III breast cancer patients. The aberrant expression is attributed to copy number variations, mutations, and hypomethylation (Sathyanarayanan2020Comprehensive).

In lung adenocarcinoma, MMP11 is highly upregulated and promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. It is suggested as a potential therapeutic target, with studies showing that silencing MMP11 or using an anti-MMP11 antibody can significantly reduce tumor growth (Yang2019Matrix).

## Interactions
Matrix metallopeptidase 11 (MMP11) is involved in various protein interactions that influence its function in tissue remodeling and cancer progression. MMP11 interacts with tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), particularly TIMP-4, which modulates its activity. In zebrafish, TIMP-4 interacts with MMP11 paralogues, suggesting a regulatory role in maintaining the integrity of the myotendinous junction (MTJ) by inhibiting MMP11b but not MMP11a (Matchett2019Paralogues).

MMP11 is also a substrate for matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14), which cleaves MMP11 at specific sites, leading to its inactivation. This interaction highlights a regulatory mechanism where MMP-14 controls the bioavailability and activity of MMP11, particularly in the context of cancer (Buache2014Functional).

In cancer biology, MMP11 interacts with various signaling pathways, including the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway, where it cleaves IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), thereby influencing cell proliferation and migration (ZHANG2016Insights). These interactions underscore MMP11's complex role in both promoting and inhibiting tumor progression.
