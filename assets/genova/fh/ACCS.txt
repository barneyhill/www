# ACCS

## Overview
The ACCS gene in humans encodes the protein known as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase homolog (inactive), or PHACS. This protein is homologous to the plant enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS), which is involved in ethylene biosynthesis. However, PHACS lacks the enzymatic activity characteristic of ACS due to differences in its active site, rendering it inactive in the conversion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) (Koch2001The). Despite its inactivity in this pathway, PHACS is expressed in a variety of human tissues, including the liver, brain, and lung, indicating a potential, yet undefined, role in human physiology (Koch2001The). The protein's structural resemblance to pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes suggests it may participate in amino acid metabolism or related biochemical pathways (Koch2001The).

## Function
The human gene ACCS encodes a protein homologous to the plant enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS), but it lacks the enzymatic activity typically associated with ACS, which is the conversion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) (Koch2001The). Despite its structural similarity to plant ACSs, the human ACCS protein, referred to as PHACS, does not perform the same catalytic function due to key differences in its active site. Specifically, critical residues necessary for ACS activity in plants are not conserved in PHACS, leading to its inability to synthesize ACC (Koch2001The).

PHACS is expressed in various human tissues, including the liver, stomach, breast, brain, uterus, prostate, colon, lung, and B-cell germinal centers, suggesting a potential role in these tissues (Koch2001The). While PHACS does not catalyze the conversion of SAM to ACC, it can catalyze the deamination of L-vinylglycine, albeit with lower efficiency compared to plant ACSs (Koch2001The). The exact physiological role of PHACS in humans remains unclear, but its structural similarity to other pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes suggests potential involvement in amino acid metabolism or related pathways (Koch2001The).
