# AATK

## Overview
AATK, or apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase, is a gene that encodes a protein of the same name, which plays a significant role in cellular processes such as neuronal differentiation and apoptosis. The AATK protein is categorized as a kinase due to its tyrosine kinase domain, which facilitates its involvement in signaling pathways by phosphorylating target proteins. Predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions like the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, AATK is crucial for brain development and function (Baker2001Characterization). The protein's ability to autophosphorylate and promote neurite outgrowth underscores its importance in neuronal growth (Raghunath2000A). Additionally, AATK is implicated in apoptotic processes, especially in myeloid cells, where its expression is upregulated (Baker2001Characterization). The gene's expression is subject to regulation by microRNAs, such as miR-338-3p, which can modulate its levels and influence its roles in apoptosis and neuronal differentiation (Kos2012A).

## Structure


## Function
AATK, also known as apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase, is a protein-coding gene involved in several critical cellular processes, particularly in neuronal differentiation and apoptosis. The AATK protein contains a tyrosine kinase domain and several SH3 binding motifs, which suggest its role in forming signaling complexes with other proteins (Baker2001Characterization). It is expressed predominantly in the brain, with high levels in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, indicating its importance in brain function and development (Baker2001Characterization).

AATK is an active kinase, capable of autophosphorylation, and is involved in promoting neuronal differentiation. It has been shown to induce neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting its role in neuronal growth and development (Raghunath2000A). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm, with some perinuclear distribution, which is crucial for its function in signaling pathways related to neuronal differentiation (Raghunath2000A).

In addition to its role in neuronal differentiation, AATK is involved in apoptosis, particularly in myeloid cells, where its expression is upregulated during apoptotic processes (Baker2001Characterization). The gene's expression is also modulated by miR-338-3p, which can influence AATK levels and potentially impact neuronal differentiation and apoptosis (Kos2012A).

## Clinical Significance
The AATK gene, also known as apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase, is frequently hypermethylated in various human cancers, including lung, breast, pancreatic, and head and neck cancers. This hypermethylation leads to the epigenetic silencing of AATK, which functions as a tumor suppressor gene. In normal tissues, the AATK promoter is typically unmethylated, allowing for its expression, whereas in cancerous tissues, hypermethylation results in decreased expression (Woods2022Epigenetically; Haag2014The). 

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), low AATK expression is associated with poor prognosis and is linked to the quasi-mesenchymal subtype of PDA, which is characterized by aggressive behavior and poor survival outcomes (Ding2020Epigenetic). AATK silencing in PDA is associated with the loss of acinar cell identity and the progression of ductal lesions, contributing to cancer progression (Ding2020Epigenetic).

In breast and lung cancers, AATK hypermethylation is observed in a significant proportion of cases, correlating with decreased expression and impaired prognosis. The re-expression of AATK through demethylation treatments has been shown to suppress colony formation and proliferation in cancer cell lines, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Woods2022Epigenetically; Haag2014The).

## Interactions
AATK (apoptosis-associated tyrosine kinase) is involved in several protein interactions that influence its role in cellular processes. AATK phosphorylates TP53 at Ser366, a key interaction that affects TP53's activity and stability, thereby impacting cell proliferation and apoptosis (Woods2022Epigenetically). The kinase activity of AATK is crucial for its function, as demonstrated by peptide-based assays that show distinct phosphorylation patterns in wild-type versus kinase-dead AATK (Woods2022Epigenetically).

AATK also interacts with proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as Cyclin D1 and WEE1, leading to their decreased expression. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, where AATK's epigenetic silencing is associated with poor survival outcomes (Woods2022Epigenetically). Additionally, AATK has been shown to bind with STK39 and PPP1CB, indicating its involvement in vesicle-mediated transport and regulation of cell proliferation (Woods2022Epigenetically).

The study of AATK's interactome through pulldown assays and mass spectrometry has identified various binding partners, suggesting its participation in complex protein networks that regulate cellular functions (Woods2022Epigenetically). These interactions highlight AATK's multifaceted role in cellular signaling pathways.
