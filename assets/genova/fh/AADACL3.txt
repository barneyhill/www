# AADACL3

## Overview
AADACL3 (arylacetamide deacetylase-like 3) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the serine hydrolase family, which is implicated in lipid metabolism. The protein is thought to facilitate the hydrolysis of specific lipid substrates, thereby influencing cellular lipid homeostasis and potentially affecting membrane composition and intracellular signaling pathways. AADACL3 is expressed at low levels in adult tissues, with higher expression observed in the placenta, skin, and breast. Its expression pattern suggests a role in placental development, particularly in the extravillous trophoblast, although its precise function remains to be fully elucidated. Genetic studies have linked AADACL3 to various clinical conditions, including sarcoidosis and epidermolysis bullosa simplex, highlighting its potential significance in disease progression and molecular pathways (Lahtela2019Exome; Bchetnia2011Expression; Suntharalingham2024The).

## Structure


## Function
AADACL3 (arylacetamide deacetylase-like 3) is a gene that encodes a protein believed to be involved in lipid metabolism. The protein is part of the serine hydrolase family and is thought to play a role in the hydrolysis of specific lipid substrates, which may influence cellular lipid homeostasis. This activity can impact processes such as membrane composition and signaling pathways within the cell. AADACL3 is primarily expressed at low levels in adult tissues, with notable expression in the placenta, skin, and breast (Suntharalingham2024The).

In the context of placental development, AADACL3 is expressed in the extravillous trophoblast, although its precise functional role in the placenta remains unclear. It has been observed that AADACL3 expression is higher in 46,XY preterm and term placental tissue compared to 46,XX, suggesting a potential involvement in placental function or development (Suntharalingham2024The).

Additionally, AADACL3 has been identified in studies of genetic anomalies, such as a case involving a 1p36 duplication, where its altered expression was associated with immunodeficiency and recurrent infections, although the specific function of AADACL3 in healthy human cells was not detailed (Soler2016Case).

## Clinical Significance
The AADACL3 gene has been implicated in the prognosis of sarcoidosis, a disease characterized by the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells in different parts of the body. Research has identified genetic variations in the AADACL3 gene that are associated with different outcomes in sarcoidosis patients, particularly within Finnish populations. These variations are located in the chromosomal region 1p36.21 and have shown different minor allele frequencies between persistent and resolved cases of sarcoidosis, suggesting a potential role in disease progression (Lahtela2019Exome). However, the variations in AADACL3 are predicted to be benign, and their direct involvement in sarcoidosis pathogenesis remains unclear (Lahtela2019Exome).

In the context of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a skin disorder, AADACL3 was identified among genes with significant expression differences in patients compared to controls. This suggests a possible involvement in the disease's molecular pathways, although the specific clinical significance of AADACL3 mutations or expression changes in EBS is not detailed (Bchetnia2011Expression). Further research is needed to confirm the clinical implications of AADACL3 in these and potentially other conditions.
