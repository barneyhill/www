# GRAMD1C

## Overview
GRAMD1C is a gene that encodes the protein GRAM domain containing 1C, which is a member of the GRAMD1 family involved in cholesterol transport and homeostasis. The protein is characterized by the presence of a GRAM domain and a StAR-related lipid transfer (StART) domain, which are essential for its role in lipid binding and membrane-associated processes. GRAMD1C is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways. The protein's structural domains facilitate its function in cholesterol transport, particularly at ER-plasma membrane contact sites, and its interactions with mitochondrial structures suggest a role in regulating mitochondrial cholesterol levels and bioenergetics (Naito2021GRAMD1mediated; Wui2021GRAMD1C; Laraia2019The).

## Structure
GRAMD1C is a protein that contains several key structural domains, including an N-terminal GRAM domain and a StART-like domain, followed by a C-terminal transmembrane domain. The GRAM domain is structurally similar to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, featuring a β-sandwich fold with seven antiparallel β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix. This domain is involved in sensing accessible cholesterol and anionic lipids in the plasma membrane (Naito2021GRAMD1mediated; Naito2019Movement).

The StART-like domain of GRAMD1C is involved in the transport of cholesterol and is capable of binding sterol ligands. It consists of a highly curved seven-stranded β-sheet forming a hydrophobic groove for sterol accommodation, two short N-terminal α-helices, and a long C-terminal α-helix. This domain is crucial for sterol transport between membranes (Naito2021GRAMD1mediated).

GRAMD1C can form homo- and heteromeric complexes through interactions involving its transmembrane domains and luminal amphipathic helices. These complexes are recruited to ER-PM contact sites upon an increase in accessible cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane, facilitating cholesterol transport to the ER (Naito2021GRAMD1mediated; Naito2019Movement).

## Function
GRAMD1C is a protein that plays a significant role in cholesterol transport and homeostasis within human cells. It is part of the GRAMD1 family, which includes GRAMD1A and GRAMD1B, and is characterized by the presence of a GRAM domain and a StAR-related lipid transfer (StART) domain. These domains are crucial for its function in lipid binding and membrane-associated processes (Laraia2019The).

The GRAMD1C protein is primarily active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane, where it contributes to lipid metabolism and cellular signaling pathways. The StART domain of GRAMD1C is structurally similar to yeast homologues Lam2 and Lam4, indicating a conserved mechanism for sterol binding, particularly cholesterol (Laraia2019The). This domain features a hydrophobic tunnel capable of accommodating a cholesterol molecule, suggesting its role in cholesterol transport (Laraia2019The).

While specific functions of GRAMD1C in healthy cells are not extensively detailed, its structural similarity to other GRAMD1 proteins implies a role in cholesterol binding and possibly in autophagosome biogenesis, as observed in GRAMD1A (Laraia2019The). The protein's activity at ER-PM contact sites suggests its involvement in interorganellar communication and lipid transfer processes.

## Clinical Significance
GRAMD1C has been implicated in several clinical contexts, particularly in relation to cancer and metabolic disorders. In clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC), high expression levels of GRAMD1C are associated with improved patient survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker. The gene's expression correlates positively with immune cell infiltration, which may influence cancer progression and patient outcomes (Wui2021GRAMD1C). 

GRAMD1C is also involved in the regulation of cholesterol transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, impacting mitochondrial bioenergetics and autophagy. Its depletion leads to increased mitochondrial cholesterol levels and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation, which could affect cellular metabolism and energy balance (Wui2021GRAMD1C). 

Alterations in GRAMD1C expression or function may be linked to conditions involving cholesterol metabolism, similar to those observed in Niemann-Pick disease type C1, where cholesterol accumulation is a key feature (Wui2021GRAMD1C). While specific diseases directly caused by GRAMD1C mutations are not detailed, its role in cholesterol regulation and cancer suggests it may be significant in related pathologies.

## Interactions
GRAMD1C is involved in several protein interactions, primarily through its GRAM domain. This domain facilitates transient interactions with mitochondrial structures, allowing GRAMD1C to interact with proteins of mitochondrial origin such as NDUFAF2, SHDB, and ATAD3A. It also interacts with ER-mitochondria contact site proteins like VDAC1 and ACSL4. These interactions are crucial for GRAMD1C's role in regulating mitochondrial cholesterol levels and bioenergetics (Wui2021GRAMD1C).

GRAMD1C is part of the GRAMD1 family, which includes GRAMD1a, GRAMD1b, and GRAMD1c. These proteins can form homo- and heteromeric complexes, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays that confirmed interactions between GRAMD1s and GRAMD1b, as well as between GRAMD1s and GRAMD3. These interactions are facilitated by the luminal helices and transmembrane domains of the proteins, which are essential for complex formation (Naito2019Movement).

The GRAM domain of GRAMD1C also acts as a coincidence detector for accessible cholesterol and anionic lipids in the plasma membrane, which is crucial for its recruitment to ER-PM contact sites and its role in cholesterol transport (Naito2019Movement).
