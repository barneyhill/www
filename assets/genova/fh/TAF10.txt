# TAF10

## Overview
TAF10 is a gene that encodes the TATA-box binding protein associated factor 10, a protein integral to the transcriptional machinery in eukaryotic cells. This protein is a component of the TFIID complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. TAF10 is characterized by its histone fold domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins, notably forming heterodimers with TAF8 and TAF3. These interactions are crucial for the structural integrity and function of the TFIID complex, as well as for the nuclear import of TAF10, which lacks its own nuclear localization signal (Kolesnikova2018Molecular; Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). TAF10 also plays a significant role in developmental processes, such as erythropoiesis and embryonic development, and its dysfunction can lead to severe developmental disorders (Bardot2016The; Papadopoulos2015TAF10).

## Structure
TAF10 is a component of the TFIID complex, essential for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II. The protein contains a histone fold domain (HFD), which facilitates its interaction with other proteins, particularly forming heterodimers with TAF8 and TAF3 (Kolesnikova2018Molecular; Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). The TAF8-10 complex exhibits atypical histone fold domains with three central alpha helices, flanked by additional N- and C-terminal alpha helices. TAF8 wraps around the alpha2 helix of TAF10, forming a complex primarily through hydrophobic interactions, including hydrophobic stacking between aromatic residues Y68 of TAF8 and F162 of TAF10 (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

The TAF8-10 interaction is crucial for the structural integrity of the TFIID complex, with TAF8 playing a central role in nucleating the complex (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). TAF10 lacks a nuclear localization signal and relies on TAF8 for nuclear import, suggesting a chaperone-like function for the TAF8-10 complex in facilitating the nuclear import and integration of TAF2 into core-TFIID (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). The human TAF10 HFD is functional in complementation assays, indicating its critical role in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the TFIID complex (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

## Function
TAF10 is a critical component of the TFIID complex, which is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. It forms a heterodimer with TAF8, which is crucial for the assembly and integrity of the holo-TFIID complex. This heterodimer is also necessary for the nuclear import of TAF10, as it relies on the nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminal end of TAF8 for transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

TAF10 is involved in the modular assembly of TFIID from preformed submodules, playing a role in the stabilization and formation of the TAF2-TAF8-TAF10 complex, a heterotrimer that is crucial for transcription initiation (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). It also interacts with the GATA1 transcription factor, which is essential for erythroid cell differentiation, indicating its role in regulating gene expression during erythropoiesis (Papadopoulos2015TAF10).

In the context of development, TAF10 is indispensable for early embryonic transcription and development, as its absence leads to early embryonic lethality. It is also involved in tissue-specific processes, such as skin barrier formation and liver development (Papadopoulos2015TAF10).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the TAF10 gene can have significant clinical implications. TAF10 is a critical component of the TFIID and SAGA transcriptional complexes, which are essential for proper gene transcription. Disruption in TAF10 function can lead to developmental disorders and potentially contribute to disease pathogenesis. In mouse models, the deletion of TAF10 results in embryonic lethality, indicating its crucial role in development (Bardot2016The). The absence of TAF10 affects the assembly of TFIID and SAGA complexes, leading to impaired transcriptional regulation, which can result in growth arrest and developmental defects (Bardot2016The).

TAF10's interaction with other TAFs, such as TAF8, is vital for the stability and function of these transcriptional complexes. The loss of TAF10 disrupts these interactions, leading to a decrease in the formation of functional TFIID complexes (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). Although specific diseases directly linked to TAF10 mutations are not detailed in the provided context, the gene's role in transcriptional regulation suggests that its dysregulation could contribute to conditions such as cancer, where altered gene expression is a hallmark (Bardot2016The).

## Interactions
TAF10 is a component of the TFIID and SAGA transcriptional complexes, playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. It forms a heterodimer with TAF8, which is essential for the integrity and assembly of the holo-TFIID complex. This interaction is mediated through their histone fold domains (HFDs), which stabilize the heterodimer and facilitate the recruitment of other TAFs and TBP to complete the holo-TFIID assembly (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic). TAF10 lacks a nuclear localization signal and relies on TAF8 for nuclear translocation, highlighting the importance of their interaction for nuclear import (Trowitzsch2015Cytoplasmic).

TAF10 also interacts with the GATA1 transcription factor, which is crucial for erythropoiesis. This interaction is significant for the regulation of GATA1 target genes and is involved in the differentiation of erythroid cells. TAF10 is enriched on the GATA1 locus in human fetal erythroid cells, suggesting a role in facilitating the recruitment of TFIID and/or SAGA to GATA1-responsive promoters (Papadopoulos2015TAF10). These interactions underscore TAF10's role as a scaffold for assembling protein modules involved in transcriptional regulation and developmental processes (Papadopoulos2015TAF10).
