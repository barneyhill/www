# ZFP57

## Overview
ZFP57 is a gene that encodes the ZFP57 zinc finger protein, a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein family, which plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of DNA methylation imprints. This protein is characterized by its six Cys2His2 zinc finger domains, which enable it to bind specifically to methylated CpG dinucleotides within DNA sequences, particularly at imprinting control regions (ICRs) (Baglivo2013Genetic; Liu2012An). The ZFP57 protein functions as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with the KAP1 co-repressor complex, recruiting DNA methyltransferases to maintain allelic methylation patterns essential for genomic imprinting (Zuo2012Zinc; MonteagudoSánchez2020The). This epigenetic regulation is crucial during early embryogenesis, and mutations in the ZFP57 gene can lead to imprinting disorders such as transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (Takikawa2013Human; MonteagudoSánchez2020The).

## Structure
The human ZFP57 protein is characterized by its molecular structure, which includes six Cys2His2 zinc finger (ZF) domains. These domains are crucial for the protein's DNA binding capabilities, particularly the third and fourth zinc fingers, which are essential for high-affinity binding to methylated DNA target sites (Baglivo2013Genetic). The primary structure of ZFP57 consists of 516 amino acids, featuring a predicted Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, which is a common motif in zinc finger proteins and plays a role in transcriptional repression (Baglivo2013Genetic).

The secondary structure of ZFP57 includes alpha helices and beta strands within each zinc finger, which coordinate a zinc ion through two cysteines and two histidines, allowing the protein to bind DNA in the major groove (Liu2012An). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these zinc finger domains to facilitate specific interactions with DNA, particularly recognizing methylated CpG dinucleotides (Liu2012An).

In terms of quaternary structure, ZFP57 interacts with cofactors such as KAP1/TRIM28/TIF1β, which is mediated by the KRAB domain, to recruit DNA methyltransferases and maintain DNA methylation imprints (Zuo2012Zinc). This interaction is crucial for the protein's role in epigenetic regulation.

## Function
ZFP57 is a KRAB zinc finger protein that plays a critical role in maintaining DNA methylation imprints in human cells. It is involved in the regulation of genomic imprinting, an epigenetic process that results in the parent-of-origin-specific expression of certain genes. ZFP57 recognizes and binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides within specific DNA sequences, particularly at imprinting control regions (ICRs), which are crucial for the regulation of imprinted genes (Liu2012An; Shi2019ZFP57).

In the nucleus, ZFP57 interacts with the KAP1 co-repressor complex, which includes DNA methyltransferases such as DNMT3A and DNMT3B, but not DNMT1. This interaction is essential for recruiting these enzymes to maintain allelic methylation at imprinted loci (Zuo2012Zinc; MonteagudoSánchez2020The). The KRAB domain of ZFP57 is crucial for these interactions, facilitating the recruitment of the KAP1 complex to protect methylation patterns during early development (MonteagudoSánchez2020The).

ZFP57's function is vital for maintaining genomic stability and proper gene expression during early embryogenesis. Mutations in ZFP57 can lead to hypomethylation at imprinted regions, resulting in imprinting disorders such as transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (Takikawa2013Human; MonteagudoSánchez2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ZFP57 gene are associated with several imprinting disorders, most notably transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) and multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID). TNDM is characterized by hyperglycemia within the first six months of life and is often linked to hypomethylation at the 6q24 locus. Approximately 50% of TNDM cases with MLID have mutations in ZFP57, which is crucial for maintaining DNA methylation at imprinted loci (Boonen2013Transient; Touati2018Transient). These mutations can include missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations, affecting the gene's ability to bind DNA and maintain methylation patterns, leading to hypomethylation and activation of normally repressed genes like PLAGL1 (Baglivo2013Genetic).

The clinical presentation of ZFP57-related TNDM is highly variable, ranging from severe outcomes to normal health in adulthood. This variability is not well understood and does not correlate clearly with the type of mutation (Boonen2013Transient; Touati2018Transient). In addition to TNDM, ZFP57 mutations have been implicated in other conditions related to methylation defects, such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Silver-Russell syndrome, although these associations are less well-defined (Boonen2013Transient).

## Interactions
ZFP57 is a zinc finger protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining DNA methylation imprints, primarily through its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It interacts with the co-repressor KAP1 (also known as TRIM28 or TIF1β) via its KRAB box domain, which is essential for its function in DNA methylation maintenance (Zuo2012Zinc). This interaction is necessary for recruiting DNA methyltransferases and maintaining DNA methylation imprints in embryonic stem cells (Zuo2012Zinc).

ZFP57 also interacts with the MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer of the DNA mismatch repair complex, suggesting a role in CpG conservation at imprinting control regions (ICRs). This interaction is likely mediated by KAP1, as demonstrated by co-precipitation and Western blotting experiments (Acurzio2022The).

In addition to protein interactions, ZFP57 binds to specific DNA motifs, such as the canonical TGCCGC and its variant GGCCGC, when the CpG is methylated. This binding is crucial for maintaining repressive epigenetic marks, including H3K9me3 and CpG methylation, at ICRs (Anvar2015ZFP57). These interactions underscore ZFP57's role in genomic imprinting and epigenetic regulation.
