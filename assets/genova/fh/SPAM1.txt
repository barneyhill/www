# SPAM1

## Overview
SPAM1, or sperm adhesion molecule 1, is a gene that encodes a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mammalian reproduction. The protein product of SPAM1, also referred to as PH-20, is a hyaluronidase enzyme that facilitates sperm penetration through the cumulus oophorus by degrading hyaluronic acid, a critical step in fertilization (Sade2011SPAM1; Evans2003SPAM1). This enzyme is uniquely expressed on the surface of human sperm and within the acrosome, where it is involved in binding to the zona pellucida and mediating acrosomal exocytosis, processes essential for successful fertilization (Evans2003SPAM1; Dunn2005Transcription). Beyond its reproductive functions, SPAM1 is also implicated in sperm maturation within the epididymis and has been associated with various health conditions, including certain cancers and fertility issues related to environmental factors such as fluoride exposure (Evans2003SPAM1; Liu2019Fluoride).

## Structure
SPAM1, also known as sperm adhesion molecule 1, is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored enzyme found in mammalian spermatozoa. It is a 68 kDa protein with a hyaluronidase domain at the N-terminus, which includes a hyaluronic acid (HA) binding site crucial for acrosomal exocytosis signaling pathways (Sade2011SPAM1). The protein also features a zona binding domain at the C-terminal end. SPAM1 is active at both neutral and acidic pH levels due to different active sites within the hyaluronidase domain (Sade2011SPAM1).

SPAM1 mRNA has two isoforms, with transcript variant 1 being 2395 bp and variant 2 being 2009 bp. The variant 2 isoform uses an alternate in-frame splice site in the 3' coding region, resulting in a shorter C-terminus (Sade2011SPAM1). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, which is typical for GPI-anchored proteins (Evans2003SPAM1).

In terms of quaternary structure, SPAM1 may form dimers, as indicated by the presence of a higher molecular weight band (>114 kDa) in certain tissues, suggesting dimerization (Evans2003SPAM1). The protein's structure and modifications are essential for its role in sperm-egg adhesion and fertilization processes.

## Function
The SPAM1 gene encodes a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored enzyme that is crucial for several processes in human sperm function. It exhibits hyaluronidase activity, which is essential for the degradation of hyaluronic acid in the cumulus oophorus, facilitating sperm penetration to reach the oocyte (Sade2011SPAM1; Evans2003SPAM1). SPAM1 is also involved in binding to the zona pellucida, a glycoprotein layer surrounding the oocyte, and plays a role in calcium signaling associated with acrosomal exocytosis, a process necessary for fertilization (Sade2011SPAM1; Dunn2005Transcription).

The protein is located on the sperm surface and within the lysosome-derived acrosome, where it is bound to the inner acrosomal membrane (Sade2011SPAM1). In humans, SPAM1 is the only hyaluronidase present on sperm, highlighting its critical role in fertilization (Evans2003SPAM1). Beyond its role in reproduction, SPAM1 is expressed in the epididymis, where it contributes to sperm maturation and may be involved in fluid reabsorption and urine concentration in the kidney (Sade2011SPAM1). The gene's expression is primarily in the testis and epididymis, with lower levels in other tissues such as the prostate and placenta (Dunn2005Transcription).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SPAM1 gene, also known as PH-20, have been linked to various reproductive and health issues. In mice, overexpression of SPAM1 is associated with transmission ratio distortion (TRD), where sperm bearing the transgene are less favored, leading to fertility issues. This overexpression results in defects such as the retention of cytoplasmic droplets in sperm, which are linked to decreased sperm motility and reduced ability to penetrate cumulus cells, ultimately contributing to infertility (MartinDeLeon2005Spam1associated).

In humans and other primates, SPAM1 is expressed in the epididymis and plays a crucial role in sperm maturation and fertilization. Its expression is regulated by androgens, and it is the only hyaluronidase present in humans, suggesting a critical role in reproductive biology (Evans2003SPAM1). Additionally, SPAM1 expression has been detected in various cancers, including breast and pharyngeal cancers, indicating a potential role in cancer progression (Evans2003SPAM1).

Fluoride exposure has been shown to downregulate SPAM1 expression in rats, affecting sperm acrosome reaction and maturation, which could lead to decreased fertility (Liu2019Fluoride).

## Interactions
SPAM1, also known as sperm adhesion molecule 1, participates in several interactions with other proteins that are crucial for its function in sperm-egg recognition and neuroprotection. In human spermatozoa, SPAM1 forms a stable complex with HSPA2 and ARSA, which is essential for sperm-oocyte recognition. This complex is localized in the periacrosomal region of the sperm head, and its presence is critical for sperm binding to the zona pellucida of oocytes. The interaction of SPAM1 with ARSA is particularly important, as antibodies against these proteins significantly reduce sperm binding to the zona pellucida, indicating their direct role in sperm-ZP adhesion (Redgrove2012Investigation).

SPAM1 also interacts with the PAC1-R receptor as a positive allosteric modulator. It binds to the extracellular N-terminus of PAC1-R, forming hydrogen bonds with specific residues such as ASP116, GLY114, and ASP124, and π-π interactions with PHE27 and PHE115. These interactions enhance the affinity of SPAM1 for PAC1-R, contributing to its neuroprotective effects by promoting the nuclear translocation of PAC1-R and upregulating neuroprotective genes (Fan2022Novel). These interactions highlight the multifaceted role of SPAM1 in both reproductive and neuroprotective processes.
