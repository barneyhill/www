# PRSS57

## Overview
PRSS57 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 57, also known as Neutrophil Serine Protease 4 (NSP4), which is a member of the neutrophil serine protease family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system, particularly in inflammatory processes. NSP4 is synthesized in the bone marrow by myeloid precursors and stored in the azurophil granules of neutrophils, where it becomes an active protease. It is involved in breaking down the extracellular matrix at sites of inflammation and in the activation of leukocyte chemotaxis, platelet activation, and inflammatory cytokines (AhYoung2019An; Ahmad2020Physicsdriven). The gene's expression and regulation are influenced by interactions with microRNA-134-3p, which modulates its role in cell proliferation and apoptosis, particularly in the context of diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic myeloid leukemia (Bozdağ2024PRSS57; Song2020Protective). The clinical significance of PRSS57 is underscored by its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in various pathological conditions, including inflammatory-driven carcinogenesis (Lucidi2023Tumors).

## Function
PRSS57 encodes Neutrophil Serine Protease 4 (NSP4), a member of the neutrophil serine protease family, which plays a crucial role in the immune system. NSP4 is synthesized by myeloid precursors in the bone marrow and stored as an active protease in the azurophil granules of neutrophils. It is involved in regulating inflammatory processes, breaking down the extracellular matrix at inflammation sites, and inducing leukocyte chemotaxis, platelet activation, and inflammatory cytokine activation (AhYoung2019An; Ahmad2020Physicsdriven).

NSP4 has a unique mechanism for cleaving peptide substrates with an arginine residue at the P1 position, which is different from other neutrophil serine proteases. This specificity is due to a surface-exposed 'up' conformation of the arginine side chain, stabilized by specific residues in NSP4 (AhYoung2019An). NSP4 is highly conserved among vertebrates, indicating its essential role in physiological processes, particularly in immune-related functions (AhYoung2019An).

In mast cells, NSP4 is crucial for the storage of histamine and serotonin, which are important for a robust inflammatory response. NSP4-deficient mice exhibit reduced levels of these amines, leading to decreased vascular leakage in models of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and acute arthritis (AhYoung2020Neutrophil).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PRSS57 gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), the PRSS57 gene is highly expressed in the brain tissues of MS rats, and its expression is associated with increased inflammation, demyelination, and cell apoptosis. The study suggests that miR-134-3p, which targets PRSS57, can reduce these pathological processes, indicating that PRSS57 expression may contribute to MS progression (Song2020Protective).

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), high PRSS57 expression is linked to early molecular response (EMR) failure in patients. This suggests that PRSS57 could serve as a biomarker for predicting treatment response and identifying patients at higher risk of disease progression (Bozdağ2024PRSS57).

PRSS57 is also mentioned in the context of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC), where it is suggested to contribute to inflammatory-driven carcinogenesis. The presence of inflammatory cells and their secreted proteases, including those encoded by PRSS57, may play a role in the progression of this cancer (Lucidi2023Tumors).

These findings highlight the clinical significance of PRSS57 in various pathological conditions, emphasizing its potential as a therapeutic target or biomarker.

## Interactions
PRSS57, also known as serine protease 57, is involved in interactions with microRNA-134-3p (miR-134-3p). This interaction occurs at the nucleic acid level, where miR-134-3p binds to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of PRSS57 mRNA. This binding results in the regulation of PRSS57 expression, as demonstrated by reduced luciferase activity in the presence of a miR-134-3p mimic. The interaction suggests that miR-134-3p can modulate the expression of PRSS57, influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis in CD34+ cells, as well as reducing inflammation in the context of multiple sclerosis (Song2020Protective).

While PRSS57 is known to share structural and biochemical features with other neutrophil proteases, such as cathepsin G, neutrophil elastase, and proteinase 3, specific protein-protein interactions involving PRSS57 are not well-documented in the provided context (Song2020Protective). The gene is implicated in regulatory roles within neutrophil responses and innate immune reactions, but detailed interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids beyond miR-134-3p are not specified in the available literature (Amini2021Evaluation).
