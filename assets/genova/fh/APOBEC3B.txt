# APOBEC3B

## Overview
APOBEC3B is a gene that encodes the protein apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B, a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. This protein is primarily involved in the innate immune response, where it functions as a cytidine deaminase, converting cytidine to uridine in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This activity is crucial for restricting the replication of retroviruses and endogenous retroelements by inducing hypermutation in viral genomes (Zou2017APOBEC3B; Shinohara2012APOBEC3B). Structurally, APOBEC3B is characterized by a zinc-dependent deaminase domain and exists mainly as a monomer, although it can form oligomers (Byeon2016Nuclear; Siriwardena2015Characterization). While its primary role is protective, APOBEC3B's activity can also lead to genomic instability, contributing to somatic mutations and cancer progression (Shinohara2012APOBEC3B; Butler2023APOBEC3mediated). As such, APOBEC3B is a significant focus of research in cancer biology, with implications for therapeutic targeting (Butler2023APOBEC3mediated).

## Structure
The APOBEC3B protein is a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, characterized by its zinc-dependent deaminase domain. Structurally, APOBEC3B consists of two domains: a non-catalytic N-terminal domain (CD1) and a catalytically active C-terminal domain (CTD) (Xiao2017Structural; Hou2018Structural). The CTD features a central five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by six α-helices, a common structural motif among APOBEC proteins (Byeon2016Nuclear). The active site of the CTD includes a zinc ion coordinated by two cysteines and a histidine, essential for its deaminase activity (Shi2017Conformational).

The non-catalytic domain, CD1, plays a role in molecular assembly and catalytic regulation. It contains several surface hydrophobic residues that mediate the assembly of high-molecular-weight complexes, affecting the protein's catalytic activity (Xiao2017Structural). The CD1 domain also features a zinc-coordinated center with a typical APOBEC fold, composed of five core β-sheets and six α-helices (Xiao2017Structural).

APOBEC3B exists primarily as a monomer in solution, although the CTD can dimerize, suggesting potential oligomerization in the full-length protein (Byeon2016Nuclear; Siriwardena2015Characterization). The protein's structure and function are influenced by specific residues, such as a conserved methionine that stabilizes the protein by holding together key structural elements (Siriwardena2015Characterization).

## Function
APOBEC3B (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B) is a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, which play a crucial role in the innate immune system by protecting human cells against retroviruses and endogenous mobile retroelements. The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it deaminates cytidine to uridine in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Zou2017APOBEC3B; Shinohara2012APOBEC3B). This activity can lead to hypermutation of viral genomes, thereby inhibiting viral replication and spread (Zou2017APOBEC3B).

APOBEC3B contains two zinc-dependent cytidine deaminase domains, which are involved in the deamination process. The carboxyl-terminal cytidine deaminase domain is particularly important for blocking the replication of certain viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Zou2017APOBEC3B). In healthy cells, APOBEC3B acts as a mutator of viral DNA, contributing to the restriction of retroviruses and retrotransposons (Shinohara2012APOBEC3B).

The protein is expressed almost exclusively in the nucleus, where it can also deaminate nuclear DNA and 5-methyl-deoxycytidine residues in ssDNA. This nuclear localization and activity suggest a role in DNA editing, which can lead to double-stranded DNA breaks and apoptosis (Zou2017APOBEC3B). While its primary function is protective, APOBEC3B's activity can also influence genomic stability, potentially leading to somatic mutations (Shinohara2012APOBEC3B).

## Clinical Significance
APOBEC3B is implicated in various cancers due to its role in mutagenesis. Overexpression of APOBEC3B is associated with increased mutation burdens in tumors, contributing to cancer progression and therapeutic resistance (Zou2017APOBEC3B; Butler2023APOBEC3mediated). In breast cancer, APOBEC3B is linked to higher mutation loads and aggressive tumor characteristics, such as high histological grade and lack of estrogen expression (Harris2015Molecular; Sieuwerts2019APOBEC3B). It is also associated with poor outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients (Swanton2015APOBEC).

In bladder cancer, APOBEC3B expression correlates with somatic mutations in the TP53 gene and is influenced by environmental exposures, which can induce its expression (Middlebrooks2016Association). High levels of APOBEC3B mutations are linked to poor prognosis in multiple myeloma but better survival in urothelial carcinoma when treated with cisplatin (Jakobsdottir2022APOBEC3).

APOBEC3B's role in cancer is not limited to mutagenic pathways; it also influences cancer progression through non-mutagenic mechanisms, such as cell proliferation and migration, and affects the tumor immune microenvironment (Butler2023APOBEC3mediated). These findings highlight the potential of APOBEC3B as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.

## Interactions
APOBEC3B (A3B) is known to interact with various proteins and nucleic acids, forming complexes that influence its activity. In multiple myeloma cells, A3B interacts with proteins involved in RNA metabolism, such as RNA-binding proteins and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), forming high molecular mass (HMM) complexes. These interactions are primarily RNA-dependent, with the exception of SAFB, which interacts with A3B in an RNA-independent manner (Kazuma2022ILF2). ILF2 enhances A3B's deaminase activity by 30%, while SAFB does not affect this activity (Kazuma2022ILF2).

A3B also interacts with the PRC2 complex in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, affecting PRC2's histone methyltransferase activity and target occupancy (Wang2019APOBEC3B). In the context of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, A3B interacts with DHX9, which suppresses A3B's antiviral effect by inhibiting its binding to HBV pregenomic RNA (Chen2020DHX9).

Structurally, A3B's non-catalytic domain (CD1) is involved in forming high molecular weight complexes and interacts with hnRNPs. These interactions are modulated by RNA, which can attenuate A3B's catalytic activity (Xiao2017Structural).
