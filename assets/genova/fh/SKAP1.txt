# SKAP1

## Overview
SKAP1, or Src kinase associated phosphoprotein 1, is a gene that encodes an adaptor protein primarily involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. The protein, also referred to as SKAP-55, plays a pivotal role in immune cell function by facilitating signal transduction pathways crucial for T-cell activation and adhesion. It is characterized by distinct domains, including a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and an SH3 domain, which enable it to interact with various proteins and phosphoinositides, thereby influencing T-cell motility and immune responses (Raab2010T; Raab2018Immune). SKAP1 is integral to the formation of protein complexes that regulate integrin-mediated adhesion, particularly through interactions with proteins such as ADAP, RapL, and PLK1, underscoring its importance in T-cell signaling and immune function (Raab2019Immune; Raab2010T). Additionally, SKAP1 has been implicated in various cancers, where its expression levels and genetic variants may serve as prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets (Dupont2021Prostate; Zhu2023SKAP1).

## Structure
SKAP1, also known as SKAP-55, is a protein involved in T-cell activation and signaling. It contains several distinct domains that contribute to its function. The N-terminal region of SKAP1, specifically residues A17 to L21, is responsible for mediating the formation of SKAP1 homodimers, although this dimerization is not necessary for its interaction with RapL (Raab2018Immune). SKAP1 also features a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is involved in binding phosphoinositides, and a C-terminal SH3 domain, which facilitates protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich sequences in other proteins, such as ADAP (Raab2018Immune).

SKAP1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which may regulate its activity and interactions. The protein can exist in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which may affect its functional properties and interactions within the cell. SKAP1 plays a crucial role in stabilizing SLP-76 micro-clusters and facilitating LFA-1 adhesion, which are important for effective T-cell receptor signaling (Raab2018Immune). The ability of SKAP1 to form homodimers and interact with other proteins highlights its role in signal transduction pathways in T-cells.

## Function
SKAP1 (Src kinase associated phosphoprotein 1) is a critical adaptor protein involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, playing a significant role in immune responses. It functions as a scaffold for Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), facilitating its optimal activity during cell cycling, particularly in T-cells. The interaction between SKAP1 and PLK1 is crucial for the activation of PLK1's kinase activity, which is essential for cell cycle progression during mitosis (Raab2019Immune). SKAP1 is also involved in the 'inside-out' signaling pathway that regulates integrin-mediated adhesion, specifically LFA-1 adhesion, which is vital for T-cell motility and interactions within lymph nodes (Raab2010T).

SKAP1 forms a complex with RapL and Rap1, which is necessary for binding to LFA-1, a key integrin involved in T-cell adhesion. This complex enhances the binding of T cells to ICAM-1 and promotes T cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) conjugate formation, which is crucial for effective immune responses (Raab2010T). SKAP1 also interacts with other proteins like ADAP and RIAM, influencing T-cell adhesion and motility by regulating the clustering and avidity of LFA-1 integrins (Liu2023Multifunctional). SKAP1's role in these processes highlights its importance in T-cell activation, migration, and overall immune function.

## Clinical Significance
The SKAP1 gene has been implicated in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC), where it is highly expressed and associated with poor prognosis. In GC, SKAP1 promotes cell proliferation, invasion, and migration through the JAK1/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. High SKAP1 expression correlates with advanced tumor stage and grade, making it a potential adverse prognostic factor and therapeutic target (Zhu2023SKAP1). SKAP1 is also linked to immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression, suggesting its role in immune responses and as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy outcomes in GC (Zhu2023SKAP1).

In prostate cancer, a variant of SKAP1, rs559612720, is associated with a 3.6-fold increased risk, even in the absence of the HOXB13 variant. This variant may contribute to early onset and aggressive forms of prostate cancer, highlighting the importance of considering SKAP1 in genetic risk assessments (Dupont2021Prostate).

SKAP1 mutations have been linked to other cancers, such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene (Cindric2016Characterization). These findings underscore the clinical significance of SKAP1 in cancer progression and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
SKAP1, also known as SKAP-55, is an adaptor protein involved in T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and interacts with various proteins to facilitate immune cell functions. It forms homodimers through its DM domain, which is crucial for stabilizing SLP-76 micro-clusters and facilitating adhesion (Raab2018Immune). SKAP1 interacts with ADAP via its SH3 domain, forming a functional unit essential for T-cell signaling and stability (Dadwal2021The). This interaction is critical for the recruitment of the ADAP/SKAP1 module into SLP-76 microclusters, which are important for T-cell adhesion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (Dadwal2021The).

SKAP1 also binds to RapL, an interaction that is not dependent on its dimerization, and is involved in the regulation of RapL-Rap1 binding induced by antigen-receptor ligation (Raab2010T; Raab2018Immune). The N-terminal domain of SKAP1 interacts directly with the C-terminal SARAH domain of RapL, a binding that is crucial for the formation of the Rap1-RapL complex in T cells (Raab2010T).

Additionally, SKAP1 interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which is essential for T-cell cycling and proliferation. This interaction involves the N-terminal region of SKAP1 binding to the kinase domain of PLK1, and is necessary for PLK1's kinase activity (Raab2019Immune). SKAP1 also forms complexes with Grb2 and LAT, which are involved in TCR/CD3-induced calcium release and LFA-1 activation (Dadwal2021The).
