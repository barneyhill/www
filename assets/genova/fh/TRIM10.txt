# TRIM10

## Overview
TRIM10 is a gene that encodes the protein tripartite motif containing 10, which is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins. This family is characterized by the presence of a RING finger domain, B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region, which collectively contribute to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (Hatakeyama2017TRIM; Yang2020Tripartite). The TRIM10 protein plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of immune signaling pathways such as the type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway, where it acts as a negative regulator (Guo2021TRIM10). Beyond its role in immune regulation, TRIM10 is involved in other cellular pathways, including the PTEN/AKT and NF-κB pathways, influencing conditions such as cardiac hypertrophy and cancer (Yang2020Tripartite; Li2023TRIM10). Alterations in TRIM10 expression have been linked to various diseases, including acute myeloid leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, Parkinson's disease, and osteosarcoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Xi2020Oncogenic; Guo2021TRIM10; Li2023TRIM10; Huang2019Silencing).

## Structure
TRIM10 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family of proteins, characterized by the presence of an N-terminal RING finger domain, one or two B-box domains, and a coiled-coil region. These domains are integral to its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, facilitating the ubiquitination process, which is crucial for protein degradation and regulation of protein-protein interactions (Hatakeyama2017TRIM; Yang2020Tripartite; Watanabe2017TRIM).

The RING finger domain is a zinc-coordinating structure that plays a pivotal role in the catalytic activity of TRIM10, enabling the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 conjugating enzymes to substrate proteins. The B-box domains, also zinc-binding, contribute to protein-protein interactions and structural stability. The coiled-coil region facilitates the formation of homodimers or heterodimers, which can influence substrate specificity and functional diversity (Kawai2011Regulation; Hatakeyama2017TRIM).

TRIM10, like other TRIM proteins, may undergo post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination, which can affect its activity and interactions. However, specific details about the tertiary and quaternary structures, as well as any splice variant isoforms of TRIM10, are not provided in the available context (Hatakeyama2017TRIM; Watanabe2017TRIM).

## Function
TRIM10 is a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, which plays a significant role in various cellular processes, including the regulation of the type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway. In healthy human cells, TRIM10 acts as a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is crucial for the cellular response to type I interferons (IFN-α/β) (Guo2021TRIM10). It achieves this by interacting with the intracellular domain of the IFN-α/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1), thereby inhibiting the association between IFNAR1 and TYK2, a kinase essential for downstream signaling (Guo2021TRIM10). This interaction impairs the activation of STAT1 and STAT2, key transcription factors in the IFN/JAK/STAT signaling pathway, thus modulating the intensity and duration of the immune response (Guo2021TRIM10).

TRIM10's regulatory function is independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is typically associated with the RING domain of TRIM family proteins. Instead, the PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM10 is essential for its interaction with IFNAR1 (Guo2021TRIM10). This modulation of protein-protein interactions rather than altering expression levels suggests that TRIM10 serves as a negative feedback signal to maintain immune homeostasis and prevent excessive immune activation (Guo2021TRIM10).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the TRIM10 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), TRIM10 is significantly downregulated, suggesting a tumor suppressive role. This downregulation is associated with increased cell growth and reduced apoptosis in AML cells, mediated through the NF-κB signaling pathway. TRIM10's expression is also linked to DNA hypermethylation in AML patients, and its restoration through hypomethylating agents can enhance apoptosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2023TRIM10).

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), TRIM10 levels are low, which may contribute to the overactivation of the IFN/JAK/STAT signaling pathway, a hallmark of the disease. TRIM10 inhibits this pathway by preventing the binding of TYK2 to IFNAR1, suggesting its role as a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling (Guo2021TRIM10).

TRIM10 is also implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), where its upregulation in a cellular model leads to increased apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This effect is mediated through the suppression of DUSP6, indicating that TRIM10 may exacerbate PD pathology (Huang2019Silencing).

In osteosarcoma, TRIM10 is overexpressed in cisplatin-resistant tissues, activating the NF-κB pathway and contributing to chemoresistance. Targeting the TRIM10/NF-κB axis could potentially improve treatment outcomes (Xi2020Oncogenic).

## Interactions
TRIM10 interacts with the IFN-α/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1) through its PRY-SPRY domain. This interaction is crucial for TRIM10's role in negatively regulating the type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway. By binding to IFNAR1, TRIM10 blocks the association of TYK2 with IFNAR1, which in turn attenuates the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, key components of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This interaction is independent of TRIM10's E3 ligase activity, as demonstrated by experiments showing that TRIM10 can inhibit IFNAR1-mediated signaling even when its RING domain is deleted (Guo2021TRIM10).

In the context of cardiac hypertrophy, TRIM10 interacts with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), promoting its ubiquitination and leading to the activation of the AKT signaling pathway. This interaction suggests a regulatory role for TRIM10 in the PTEN/AKT pathway, contributing to cardiac hypertrophy (Yang2020Tripartite).

TRIM10 also plays a role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by interacting with the NF-κB pathway. It regulates NF-κB activity, with overexpression of TRIM10 leading to decreased NF-κB p65 protein expression and transcriptional activity, while knockdown increases it (Li2023TRIM10). In osteosarcoma, TRIM10 upregulates nuclear levels of p65, activating the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is associated with cisplatin resistance (Xi2020Oncogenic).
