# DCBLD2

## Overview
DCBLD2, or discoidin, CUB and LCCL domain containing 2, is a gene that encodes a type-I transmembrane protein known as endothelial and smooth muscle cell-derived neuropilin-like protein (ESDN). This protein is highly conserved across vertebrates and plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. As a transmembrane protein, DCBLD2 is involved in the modulation of signaling pathways, particularly those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, VEGFR, and PDGFR, which are essential for vascular development and repair (Schmoker2019The). The protein's structure includes domains that facilitate protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications, which are vital for its function in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Schmoker2019The; Alhamoudi2021A). DCBLD2 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer, where it is associated with tumor progression and resistance to certain therapies, as well as developmental disorders linked to mutations in the gene (Xie2022Pancancer; Alhamoudi2021A).

## Structure
The DCBLD2 protein, also known as endothelial and smooth muscle cell-derived neuropilin-like protein (ESDN), is a type-I transmembrane protein that is highly conserved across vertebrates. It consists of 775 amino acids and features a notably long signal peptide of 66 amino acids, the longest in the human proteome, which is not cleaved in the mature protein (Schmoker2019The; Ghim2024Regulation). This signal peptide includes an N-terminal domain, a transition region, and a C-terminal domain, each with distinct functionalities (Schmoker2019The).

The protein structure includes several domains: the CUB domain, which is involved in protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions; the LCCL domain, associated with structural integrity and immune function; and the Coagulation Factor V/VIII type-C (Discoidin) domain, which plays a role in focal adhesion dynamics and extracellular matrix degradation (Schmoker2019The; Alhamoudi2021A). The intracellular region contains phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitylation sites, as well as SH2 domain-binding motifs, which are crucial for the protein's function (Schmoker2019The).

DCBLD2 undergoes post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and acetylation, with Tyr750 being a well-characterized phosphorylation site (Schmoker2019The). The protein's effective molecular mass is approximately 130 kDa due to glycosylation, despite a predicted mass of 80 kDa (Schmoker2019The).

## Function
The DCBLD2 gene encodes a type-I transmembrane protein that is primarily localized to the plasma membrane, with some presence in the Golgi apparatus and cytosol (Xie2022Pancancer). It is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. DCBLD2 plays a significant role in vascular development and repair, as it is involved in neovascularization and developmental angiogenesis (Schmoker2019The). The protein acts as a scaffold for signaling complexes at the plasma membrane, influencing signaling pathways such as those involving receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like EGFR, VEGFR, and PDGFR (Schmoker2019The).

DCBLD2 modulates the effects of growth factors and hormones, impacting processes like insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. It negatively affects insulin signaling, as knockout mice show improved insulin sensitivity and lower blood glucose levels, suggesting a role as a negative regulator of glucose uptake (Schmoker2019The). The protein is also involved in the regulation of thrombus formation, acting as an inhibitory factor (Schmoker2019The). DCBLD2's interactions with proteins such as SEMA4B and its involvement in phosphorylation and activation of kinases like Fyn and Abl further highlight its role in cellular signaling and homeostasis (Schmoker2019The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the DCBLD2 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. A homozygous nonsense mutation in DCBLD2 has been identified as a potential cause of developmental delay, dysmorphic features, and restrictive cardiomyopathy. This mutation leads to reduced cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and dysregulation of reactive oxygen species and calcium homeostasis, contributing to the clinical phenotype observed in patients (Alhamoudi2021A).

In cancer, DCBLD2 is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. It is overexpressed in several cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme, lung adenocarcinoma, and colon adenocarcinoma, where it correlates with increased cancer cell invasiveness and poor outcomes. High DCBLD2 expression is linked to tumor immunosuppression and resistance to certain cancer therapies, such as PD1, CTLA4, and PDL1 inhibitors (Xie2022Pancancer).

DCBLD2 also plays a role in vascular development and insulin signaling. Knockout studies in mice have shown impaired neovascularization and improved insulin sensitivity, suggesting its involvement in angiogenesis and glucose metabolism (Schmoker2019The). These findings highlight the gene's clinical significance in both developmental disorders and cancer.

## Interactions
DCBLD2, also known as ESDN, is a type-I transmembrane protein that participates in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. It interacts with several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, and INSR, modulating downstream signaling pathways (Schmoker2019The). DCBLD2 is phosphorylated by EGFR, which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, leading to Akt activation (Schmoker2019The). It also acts as a scaffold for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of the adaptor protein CRKL, which is involved in cytoskeletal and focal adhesion dynamics (Schmoker2019The).

DCBLD2 interacts with SEMA4B, which may act as a ligand, leading to its clustering and activation. This interaction results in the phosphorylation of DCBLD2 tyrosine residues and the recruitment of proteins such as CRK/CRKL and ubiquitin ligases (Schmoker2019The). DCBLD2 also interacts with neuropilins and VEGFR2, playing a role in angiogenesis and neovascularization (Schmoker2019The).

In the context of cancer, DCBLD2 is involved in immune regulation and therapeutic responses. It interacts with proteins like ITGB1, influencing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway and focal adhesion processes (Xie2021DCBLD2). These interactions highlight DCBLD2's role in modulating cell migration, proliferation, and cancer metastasis.
