# ZIM3

## Overview
ZIM3 is a human gene that encodes the zinc finger imprinted 3 protein, a transcriptional regulator characterized by its zinc finger domains and KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) motifs. The protein is primarily involved in transcriptional repression, functioning within the nucleus to influence gene expression by binding to specific DNA motifs. ZIM3 is maternally expressed and plays a role in genomic imprinting, a process that modulates gene expression based on parental origin. The gene exhibits testis-specific expression, suggesting its involvement in reproductive biology and potential roles in cell differentiation and development (Zuo2023On; Kim2001Imprinting).

## Structure
The human ZIM3 gene encodes a protein with a length of 472 amino acids, characterized by the presence of KRAB A and B motifs at the amino-terminal regions, which are known for their role in transcriptional repression (Kim2001Imprinting). The protein also includes an 11-unit zinc-finger domain, which is a common structural motif that facilitates binding to DNA, RNA, or proteins (Kim2001Imprinting). These zinc-finger domains contribute to the protein's secondary and tertiary structures, although specific details on these structures are not provided in the available context.

The genomic organization of ZIM3 in humans consists of five exons spanning a 10-kb region, with the 5' end located adjacent to a CpG island, which may play a role in the regulation of gene expression (Kim2001Imprinting). The presence of KRAB domains suggests potential post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are common in proteins with regulatory functions, although specific modifications for ZIM3 are not detailed in the context.

There is no information provided on the quaternary structure or splice variant isoforms of the ZIM3 protein. The context does not mention any prominent folds or additional structural details beyond the zinc-finger and KRAB domains.

## Function
The ZIM3 gene encodes a long zinc finger protein involved in transcriptional regulation, primarily active in the nucleus where it influences gene expression by binding to DNA. ZIM3 is characterized by its KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) domains at the N-terminal region, which are known to mediate transcriptional repression (Kim2001Imprinting). The protein is involved in recognizing specific DNA motifs, with studies identifying a 10-nucleotide motif (AACAGAAANCT) that ZIM3 binds using its zinc finger domains. This binding is crucial for forming a specific complex, with at least eight fingers engaged in recognition, which is essential for its function in transcriptional regulation (Zuo2023On).

In humans, ZIM3 shows testis-specific expression, suggesting a role in reproductive tissues (Kim2001Imprinting). The gene is maternally expressed, indicating its involvement in genomic imprinting, a process that affects gene expression based on parental origin (Kim2001Imprinting). Although the exact function of ZIM3 in healthy human cells is not fully detailed, its expression pattern and molecular characteristics suggest it plays a role in cell differentiation and development, particularly in the context of reproductive biology (Kim2001Imprinting).
