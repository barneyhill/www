# MS4A14

## Overview
MS4A14 is a gene that encodes the protein membrane spanning 4-domains A14, which is part of the MS4A family of proteins. These proteins are characterized by their four transmembrane domains, which suggest a role in cellular signaling or transport processes. The MS4A14 protein is implicated in various biological functions, although its specific roles remain to be fully elucidated. Research has indicated potential involvement in immune response modulation and cellular communication, given its structural features typical of transmembrane proteins (Qiu2020aarFDC). Understanding the precise function of MS4A14 and its interactions with other cellular components is an ongoing area of study, with implications for understanding its role in health and disease.
