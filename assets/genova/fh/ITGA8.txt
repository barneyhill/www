# ITGA8

## Overview
The ITGA8 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 8, a component of the integrin family of cell surface receptors, which are integral to cell adhesion and signaling processes. The integrin subunit alpha 8, when paired with the beta 1 subunit, forms the integrin α8β1 heterodimer, a receptor that binds to extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and tenascin through RGD sequences (Schnapp1995The; Denda1998Identification). This transmembrane protein plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, including kidney development and tissue repair, by mediating cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation (Schnapp1995The; Marek2020A). The ITGA8 gene's expression and function are critical in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and its dysregulation is implicated in several pathological conditions, including renal agenesis and certain cancers (Humbert2014Integrin; Li2023LINC01798miR175p).

## Structure
The ITGA8 gene encodes the integrin subunit alpha 8, which is part of the integrin family of cell surface receptors. The protein structure includes a transmembrane domain encoded by exon 29 and a cytoplasmic domain in exon 30 (EkwaEkoka2004Genomic). The mature protein shares 91% identity between human and mouse, indicating conserved regions (EkwaEkoka2004Genomic). The predicted structure of the alpha 8 subunit includes a h-propeller domain, a bthighQ domain, and two bcalfQ domains (EkwaEkoka2004Genomic). 

The ITGA8 protein forms a heterodimer with the beta 1 subunit, creating an RGD-binding integrin crucial for various cellular functions (EkwaEkoka2004Genomic). This heterodimerization represents the quaternary structure of the protein. The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which may affect its function and interactions (Goodman2017Integrin). Alternative splicing of the ITGA8 subunit may result in different forms with distinct ligand affinities and signaling capacities (EkwaEkoka2004Genomic). These structural features and modifications are essential for the protein's role in cell adhesion and signaling.

## Function
The ITGA8 gene encodes the integrin alpha 8 subunit, which forms a heterodimer with the beta 1 subunit to create the integrin α8β1. This integrin functions as a receptor for several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including fibronectin, vitronectin, tenascin, and osteopontin, through interactions with RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) sequences in these ligands (Schnapp1995The; Denda1998Identification). The α8β1 integrin is involved in cell adhesion processes, localizing to focal contacts in cells plated on fibronectin and vitronectin, but not on collagen, indicating its specificity for certain ECM proteins (Schnapp1995The).

In healthy human cells, α8β1 plays a crucial role in mediating cell adhesion and spreading, particularly in tissues such as the kidney, where it is expressed in mesangial cells and contributes to glomerular homeostasis (Marek2020A). The integrin is also implicated in kidney development, facilitating interactions between the ureteric bud epithelium and the surrounding mesenchyme, which are essential for nephron differentiation (Denda1998Identification). Additionally, α8β1 is involved in cellular processes such as migration, differentiation, and survival, influencing tissue development and repair (Schnapp1995The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ITGA8 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In humans, recessive mutations in ITGA8 are linked to bilateral renal agenesis, a severe form of renal hypodysplasia. These mutations disrupt kidney development, leading to the absence of both kidneys at birth. Specific mutations include a homozygous splice mutation causing exon skipping and an in-frame deletion, as well as compound heterozygous mutations resulting in a frameshift and a missense change (Humbert2014Integrin).

In cancer, ITGA8 expression is significantly downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma, where higher expression levels are associated with better prognosis and increased immune infiltration. This suggests ITGA8's role as a tumor suppressor and its potential as a biomarker for immunotherapy efficacy (Li2023LINC01798miR175p). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, low ITGA8 expression correlates with poor overall and disease-free survival, indicating its prognostic significance (Lu2015ITGA2B).

Additionally, a missense mutation in ITGA8 has been associated with schizophrenia in Japanese female patients, potentially offering a protective role against the disorder (Supriyanto2013A).

## Interactions
Integrin α8 (ITGA8) is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cell adhesion and signaling. ITGA8 forms a heterodimer with the β1 subunit, creating the integrin α8β1 complex, which acts as a receptor for several extracellular matrix proteins, including tenascin, fibronectin, and vitronectin. The binding to these proteins is mediated by the RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid) sequence, which is a common motif in many extracellular matrix proteins (Schnapp1995The).

In sensory cells, ITGA8 interacts with Protocadherin 15a (Pcdh15a) to form a complex that is essential for cilia biogenesis. This interaction is crucial for the proper localization and function of both proteins in hair cells, affecting kinocilium elongation and maintenance. The ITGA8/Pcdh15a complex also plays a role in regulating the endocytic pathway and ciliary protein transport, specifically influencing the distribution of Rab8a, a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (Goodman2017Integrin).

In the context of craniofacial development, ITGA8 interacts with the Fras1 gene, which is part of the Fraser protein complex. This interaction is important for epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during pharyngeal morphogenesis in zebrafish, highlighting ITGA8's role in developmental processes (Talbot2016Pharyngeal).
