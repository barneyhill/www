# ACYP2

## Overview
ACYP2 is a gene that encodes the enzyme acylphosphatase 2, which is a crucial component in cellular energy metabolism. This enzyme is categorized as a hydrolase due to its role in catalyzing the hydrolysis of acylphosphate bonds, thereby influencing key metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Acylphosphatase 2 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it helps maintain cellular energy balance by modulating the levels of phosphorylated intermediates. This regulation is essential for normal cellular function and overall organismal health. Beyond its metabolic functions, ACYP2 is involved in cellular signaling pathways, particularly through its interaction with PMCA4, which affects calcium homeostasis and oncogenic signaling. The gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including ischemic stroke, renal cell cancer, and chemotherapy-induced toxicities, highlighting its significance in human health and disease (Huang2020Single; Li2020ACYP2; Liang2016Association).

## Function
ACYP2 (acylphosphatase 2) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism and the regulation of cellular processes. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of acylphosphate bonds, which is essential for the dephosphorylation of key metabolic intermediates. This activity influences important metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cellular energy balance and metabolic homeostasis. ACYP2 is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it exerts its effects on cellular energy dynamics. By modulating the levels of phosphorylated intermediates, ACYP2 helps regulate the flow of metabolites through these pathways, ensuring that energy production and consumption are balanced according to the cell's needs. This regulation is vital for normal cellular function and organismal health, as it supports efficient energy utilization and prevents the accumulation of potentially harmful metabolic byproducts. The enzyme's activity is integral to maintaining the stability of cellular processes, highlighting its importance in the broader context of human physiology.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ACYP2 gene have been associated with various diseases and conditions. In the context of ischemic stroke, specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as rs11125529, rs12615793, rs843711, rs11896604, rs843706, and rs17045754 are linked to increased susceptibility in the Han Chinese population (Liang2016Association). ACYP2 polymorphisms are also implicated in the risk of renal cell cancer, with alleles like rs6713088 and rs843711 associated with increased risk (Wang2019Association).

In liver cancer, certain polymorphisms such as rs1682111 and rs843720 are considered protective against progression from cirrhosis, while rs843645 increases risk (Zhao2019Associations). The gene is also linked to chemotherapy-induced toxicities; for instance, rs1872328 is associated with cisplatin-induced hearing loss in cancer patients (Huang2020Single). Additionally, ACYP2 polymorphisms are associated with high-altitude pulmonary edema, with specific genotypes like the 'A/A' of rs12615793 linked to decreased risk (He2016Telomere).

These associations highlight the gene's role in various pathologies, potentially through mechanisms involving telomere length regulation and cellular stress responses.

## Interactions
ACYP2 (acylphosphatase 2) is known to interact with PMCA4, a plasma membrane calcium ATPase, to regulate intracellular calcium homeostasis. This interaction is crucial for promoting calcium efflux from cells, which subsequently influences oncogenic signaling pathways, including the activation of c-Myc and STAT3 in glioma cells (Li2020ACYP2). The interaction between ACYP2 and PMCA4 was confirmed through a co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay, demonstrating a physical association between these proteins (Li2020ACYP2).

ACYP2's role in modulating calcium signaling is linked to its ability to affect calpain activity, a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteinases. By influencing calpain activity, ACYP2 indirectly affects the transcriptional activities of c-Myc and STAT3, which are critical for glioma progression (Li2020ACYP2). The study suggests that ACYP2 may promote STAT3 activity through a Ca2+/calpain/PTP1B signaling axis, indicating a complex network of interactions that contribute to its oncogenic function (Li2020ACYP2). These interactions highlight the importance of ACYP2 in cellular signaling pathways related to cancer progression.
