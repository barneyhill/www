# FCF1

## Overview
The FCF1 gene encodes the FCF1 rRNA-processing protein, which is integral to ribosome biogenesis. This protein is involved in the early stages of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing, a critical step in the assembly of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis within the cell. As a component of the ribosome biogenesis pathway, FCF1 plays a crucial role in cellular growth and proliferation. Dysregulation of FCF1 expression or function has been linked to various pathological conditions, particularly in the context of cancer, where it has been implicated in the prognosis of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) and identified as a fusion partner in serous ovarian carcinoma (Chen2024Identification; Smebye2017Involvement). Further research is necessary to explore the full spectrum of FCF1's biological roles and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
The FCF1 gene has been implicated in the prognosis of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). Research has identified significant RNA editing changes in FCF1, suggesting its potential role in the disease's prognosis. Patients with high expression of FCF1, among other genes, have been associated with higher survival rates in ccRCC. The study utilized a multifactorial COX regression analysis to identify significant RNA editing sites and constructed prognostic models using these sites, indicating that higher risk scores were associated with worse survival outcomes (Chen2024Identification).

In the context of serous ovarian carcinoma, FCF1 has been identified as a fusion partner in gene fusion events, such as the LYNX1-FCF1 fusion. However, the specific diseases or conditions associated with mutations or alterations in the FCF1 gene outside the context of ccRCC are not detailed in the available studies (Smebye2017Involvement).

Overall, while FCF1 is involved in ribosome biogenesis, its dysregulation or altered expression may contribute to pathological conditions, particularly in cancer, as evidenced by its role in ccRCC prognosis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate its clinical significance in other diseases.
