# ABCA9

## Overview
The ABCA9 gene encodes the ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 9 protein, which is a member of the ABC transporter family, specifically within the ABCA subfamily. This protein functions as a transmembrane transporter, facilitating the movement of various substrates across cellular membranes through ATP hydrolysis. Structurally, ABCA9 is characterized by two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding folds, which are typical features of full-size ABC transporters. The gene is located on chromosome 17q24 and is expressed in various tissues, with notable expression in the heart, brain, and fetal tissues, indicating its potential role in lipid homeostasis and cholesterol-responsive pathways. The expression of ABCA9 is modulated during monocyte differentiation into macrophages and is influenced by cholesterol levels, suggesting its involvement in maintaining cellular cholesterol balance. Despite its established role in lipid transport, the precise biological functions of ABCA9 in human health and disease remain to be fully elucidated (Piehler2002Molecular; Albrecht2006The).

## Structure
The ABCA9 protein is encoded by a 4872-bp open reading frame, resulting in a polypeptide of 1624 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 160 kDa (Piehler2002Molecular). The protein structure includes two transmembrane domains, each consisting of seven membrane-spanning segments, and two nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs) with characteristic Walker A and B motifs. However, a genuine signature sequence is only present in the N-terminal NBF (Piehler2002Molecular). The ABCA9 protein is part of the ABC A subfamily of transporters and shows high sequence homology with ABCA8 (72%) and ABCA6 (60%), suggesting it belongs to a distinct subclass known as 'ABCA6-like transporters' (Piehler2002Molecular).

Alternative splicing of ABCA9 mRNA results in variants that induce frameshifts, leading to truncated polypeptides of 266, 1440, and 1435 amino acids. These variants may contain only one transmembrane domain and the N-terminal NBF, but their functional significance remains unclear (Piehler2002Molecular). The ABCA9 gene is located on chromosome 17q24, along with ABCA6 and ABCA8, indicating possible evolutionary relationships through gene duplication (Piehler2002Molecular). The protein is involved in cholesterol-responsive processes, with expression regulated during monocyte differentiation into macrophages and suppressed by cholesterol import (Piehler2002Molecular).

## Function
The ABCA9 gene encodes a protein that is part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically within the ABCA subfamily. This protein is involved in the translocation of various substrates across cellular membranes, a process powered by ATP hydrolysis (Piehler2002Molecular). ABCA9 is a full-size ABC transporter, featuring two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding folds, which are characteristic of this family of transporters (Piehler2002Molecular).

ABCA9 is expressed ubiquitously, with the highest levels in the heart, brain, and fetal tissues, suggesting its significant role in these organs (Piehler2002Molecular). The gene is particularly active during the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, where its expression is upregulated, indicating a role in lipid homeostasis and cholesterol-responsive pathways (Piehler2002Molecular; Albrecht2006The). The expression of ABCA9 is suppressed by cholesterol import, which suggests its involvement in maintaining cholesterol balance within cells (Piehler2002Molecular).

The ABCA9 protein is also associated with lipid transport processes, potentially contributing to the regulation of lipid levels in macrophages and other tissues (Kaminski2006ABC). However, the specific biological functions of ABCA9 in healthy human cells remain not fully understood (Kaminski2006ABC).

## Clinical Significance
The ABCA9 gene, part of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, is implicated in lipid homeostasis and has potential clinical significance in various diseases. Alterations in the expression of ABCA9 have been associated with lower survival rates in serous ovarian cancer when the gene is highly expressed (Arkova2016Prediction). The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs367781716, which involves a substitution of T with C at position -37 before the transcription initiation site of the ABCA9 gene, affects the binding affinity of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the promoter. This results in a reduced level of the ABCA9 gene product, potentially impacting lipid metabolism disorders (Arkova2016Prediction). The minor allele (-37C) of this SNP is associated with a significant decrease in TBP binding affinity, which may lead to deficiencies in ABCA9 expression and contribute to lipid metabolism disorders (Arkova2016Prediction). While the clinical significance of ABCA9 mutations is not fully understood, its role in lipid transport suggests potential implications in cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, due to its involvement in lipid homeostasis (Albrecht2006The). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical implications of ABCA9 gene mutations and expression alterations.
