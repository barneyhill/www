# CCDC112

## Overview
CCDC112 is a gene that encodes the coiled-coil domain containing 112 protein, which is a member of the coiled-coil domain containing (CCDC) protein superfamily. This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis and centrosome function, playing a significant role in male reproductive biology. CCDC112 is categorized as a centriolar satellite protein, which is crucial for the dynamic assembly and maintenance of protein complexes associated with cilia and flagella. These structures are essential for cell movement and signaling, particularly in the context of sperm flagellum formation and function. The protein's interactions, notably with TEX9, suggest a collaborative role in the assembly and remodeling of the centrosome/cilium complex, which is vital for male fertility. Mutations in the CCDC112 gene have been linked to various medical conditions, including neurological disorders and cancer, highlighting its clinical significance (Gupta2015A; Dawidziuk2021Exome; Luo2023Comprehensive; Vandenbrouck2020The).

## Function
CCDC112 is a protein involved in the regulation of ciliogenesis and centrosome function, playing a crucial role in male reproductive biology. It is part of the coiled-coil domain containing (CCDC) protein superfamily, which is known for mediating protein-protein interactions essential for the dynamic assembly of protein complexes. These proteins are integral to the biology of cilia and flagella, structures critical for cell movement and signaling (Vandenbrouck2020The).

CCDC112 is expressed in male tissues and other examined tissues, where it co-localizes in centriolar satellites. These are membraneless granules that move around centrosomes and cilia, playing a key role in regulating cilia, flagella, and centrosome biogenesis. During spermatid maturation, centrioles are crucial for forming the sperm flagellum and facilitating sperm movement. Proper regulation of centrosome function is essential, as its failure could be linked to male infertility (Vandenbrouck2020The).

The protein is predicted to interact with TEX9, another uncharacterized protein, with a high interaction score, suggesting a collaborative role in the assembly, maintenance, and remodeling of the centrosome/cilium complex, which could provide insights into male infertility (Vandenbrouck2020The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the CCDC112 gene have been implicated in several medical conditions. A de novo missense variant in CCDC112 was identified in a patient with secondary microcephaly, delayed myelination, asymmetric cerebral hemispheres, epileptic encephalopathy, hypotonia, sensorineural hearing loss, myopia, and astigmatism. This variant, NM_152549.2: c.59A>G: p.(His20Arg), is not reported in the gnomAD v3 population database and is classified as damaging by one in silico algorithm, although a direct association with specific diseases beyond the observed symptoms has not been established (Dawidziuk2021Exome).

CCDC112 has also been identified as a hub gene with differential expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), suggesting its potential role in cancer prognosis. The gene's expression is higher in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its involvement in the progression of HCC (Luo2023Comprehensive). Additionally, CCDC112 is part of the centriolar satellite proteins involved in ciliogenesis, which is crucial for sperm movement and male fertility. Dysfunction in these proteins could be linked to male infertility due to their role in centrosome-cilium interactions (Vandenbrouck2020The).

## Interactions
CCDC112 is involved in protein-protein interactions, particularly within the context of male reproductive biology. It is a centriolar satellite protein that plays a role in ciliogenesis, which is crucial for sperm flagellum formation and movement. CCDC112 is predicted to interact with TEX9, another uPE1 protein, with a high interaction score of 0.95, indicating a strong likelihood of interaction. Both proteins co-localize in centriolar satellites, which are membraneless granules that move around centrosomes and cilia, playing a key role in the biogenesis of cilia, flagella, and centrosomes (Vandenbrouck2020The).

CCDC112 has been identified as a candidate protein that co-localizes with PCM1, a marker of centriolar satellites, suggesting its involvement in a satellite subnetwork. This network was generated by extracting satellite bait proteins such as PCM1, SSX2IP, KIAA0753, OFD1, and CEP290 from a primary map, indicating a high degree of connectivity with the core module of the protein interaction network (Gupta2015A). Knockdown of CCDC112 affects the intensity and distribution of satellite markers PCM1 and CEP290, suggesting its role in the centrosome-cilium interface (Gupta2015A). However, specific physical interactions of CCDC112 with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available excerpts.
