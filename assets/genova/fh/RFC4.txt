# RFC4

## Overview
Replication factor C subunit 4 (RFC4) is a gene that encodes a protein component of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, which is essential for DNA replication and repair processes. The RFC4 protein functions as a clamp loader, facilitating the attachment of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA, a critical step for the activity of DNA polymerases during DNA synthesis and repair (Chen2021Replication; Xiang2014Levels). As a part of the RFC complex, RFC4 plays a significant role in maintaining genomic stability and is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, including mismatch and excision repair (Deng2021Exploration). The protein is categorized as a DNA replication factor and is crucial for cell cycle progression and DNA integrity. Alterations in RFC4 expression have been linked to various cancers, where it contributes to tumorigenicity and resistance to therapy, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Alaa2024Oncogenic; Liu2021An).

## Structure
The RFC4 protein, a subunit of the replication factor C complex, is composed of 323 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 36.2 kDa (Li1994Cloning; Cullmann1995Characterization). Its primary structure shows high sequence similarity to other small subunits of yeast RF-C and human RF-C, with 35-40% identity and 66-78% similarity (Li1994Cloning). The protein contains several conserved motifs, including the A motif of the nucleotide binding site, the RF-C box, and the DEAD box, which are common in NTP binding proteins (Li1994Cloning).

The secondary structure of RFC4 includes regions that are likely to form alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of proteins involved in DNA replication and repair. The tertiary structure, while not detailed in the context, is expected to facilitate its interaction with other subunits in the RFC complex. In terms of quaternary structure, RFC4 forms a tight complex with the product of the RFC3 gene, which encodes the ATPase of RF-C, indicating its role in the assembly and function of the RFC complex (Li1994Cloning).

RFC4 is essential for yeast viability, and its expression is crucial for cell growth, with no significant changes during the mitotic cell cycle or meiosis (Li1994Cloning).

## Function
RFC4 (replication factor C subunit 4) is a component of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, which plays a critical role in DNA replication and repair. In healthy human cells, RFC4 functions as a clamp loader, facilitating the loading of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) onto DNA. This process is essential for the activity of DNA polymerases during DNA synthesis and repair, ensuring genomic stability (Chen2021Replication; Xiang2014Levels).

RFC4 is active in the nucleus, where it is involved in cell cycle progression and maintaining DNA integrity. It interacts with other subunits of the RFC complex to perform its functions, which are crucial for the elongation of primed DNA templates by DNA polymerases delta and epsilon (Li1994Cloning; Alaa2024Oncogenic). The RFC complex, including RFC4, is also involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, participating in processes such as mismatch repair and excision repair of damaged DNA (Deng2021Exploration).

The activity of RFC4 is vital for the proper functioning of the DNA replication checkpoint pathway, and its deregulation can lead to defects in DNA replication and genomic instability, which are critical for cell viability and organismal development (Chen2021Replication).

## Clinical Significance
RFC4 (replication factor C subunit 4) is implicated in various cancers due to its role in DNA repair and replication. Alterations in RFC4 expression are associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy in several cancer types. In colorectal cancer (CRC), high RFC4 levels are linked to radioresistance by facilitating nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double-strand breaks, contributing to poor survival outcomes (Wang2019Genomewide). RFC4 overexpression in CRC is associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin and etoposide, but not to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (Wang2019Genomewide).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RFC4 is amplified in over 40% of cases and interacts with the Notch1 signaling pathway, promoting tumorigenicity and metastasis (Alaa2024Oncogenic). High RFC4 expression correlates with shorter survival times and increased metastasis in NSCLC (Liu2021An). RFC4's role in stabilizing NICD1, a component of the Notch signaling pathway, contributes to NSCLC aggressiveness and resistance to γ-secretase inhibitors (Liu2021An).

RFC4 is also upregulated in other cancers, including bladder, breast, cervical, and liver cancers, where its expression is linked to higher tumor stages and grades (Alaa2024Oncogenic). Its genetic alterations, such as amplification and hypomethylation, are associated with poor prognosis and could serve as potential therapeutic targets (Alaa2024Oncogenic).

## Interactions
RFC4, a subunit of the replication factor C (RFC) complex, participates in several critical interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids. It is part of a heteropentameric complex that includes RFC1, RFC2, RFC3, and RFC5, which functions as a clamp loader for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) during DNA replication and repair (Sisakova2017Role). RFC4 interacts with PCNA, enhancing the nuclease activity of the Mus81 complex, which is crucial for DNA repair processes (Sisakova2017Role).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), RFC4 directly interacts with the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1), preventing its degradation and stabilizing it in the nucleus. This interaction leads to the overactivation of Notch signaling, contributing to cancer metastasis and stemness (Liu2021An). RFC4 competes with CDK8 and other kinases for binding to NICD1, reducing its phosphorylation and polyubiquitination, which further stabilizes NICD1 (Liu2021An).

RFC4 also forms part of the Rad24 complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, interacting with other RFC subunits like Rfc2, Rfc3, and Rfc5, but not with Rfc1. This complex is involved in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway (Green2000A).
