# ZNF790

## Overview
ZNF790 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein 790, which is categorized as a transcription factor. This protein is characterized by its zinc finger domains, which enable it to bind to DNA and regulate gene expression. ZNF790 is implicated in various biological processes, particularly in brain development and function, through its interaction with gene promoters such as MN1 and DLEU7 (PerdomoSabogal2022DNA). Additionally, ZNF790 is located on chromosome 19, a region associated with chromosomal gains in certain cancers, suggesting its potential role in oncogenesis (Micci2010Array‐CGH). The gene's involvement in cancer is further supported by its association with differential methylation patterns in several cancer types, indicating its significance in disease progression (Chen2020The; Kaz2016Global).

## Clinical Significance
ZNF790 has been implicated in various cancers due to its role in gene expression regulation. In ovarian carcinoma, gains in chromosome 19, where ZNF790 is located, suggest that overexpression or rearrangement of this gene could be significant in cancer development (Micci2010Array‐CGH). The presence of ZNF790 in these chromosomal gains indicates its potential involvement in oncogenic processes.

In cervical cancer, the related gene ZNF790-As1 is noted to be hypermethylated in cancer patients, which correlates with altered gene expression. This methylation pattern suggests a role in the disease's progression, although ZNF790 itself is not directly mentioned in this context (Liu2022Monitoring).

In esophageal adenocarcinoma, ZNF790 is identified among differentially methylated regions, indicating its potential involvement in the disease, although specific pathways or mechanisms are not detailed (Kaz2016Global).

In colorectal cancer, ZNF790 is associated with high CD14 expression, which is linked to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and worse patient outcomes. However, the specific role of ZNF790 in colorectal cancer remains unclear (Chen2020The). These findings suggest that alterations in ZNF790 expression or methylation may contribute to cancer pathogenesis.

## Interactions
ZNF790 is a zinc finger protein that functions as a transcription factor, potentially interacting with DNA and other proteins to regulate gene expression. In pig brain tissues, ZNF790 is suggested to bind to the promoters of several genes, including MN1 and DLEU7. MN1 is a transcriptional co-regulator important for brain development and cognitive functioning, while DLEU7 is involved in synaptic plasticity and memory processes. This indicates that ZNF790 may play a role in regulating genes critical for brain development and function through its interactions with specific gene promoters (PerdomoSabogal2022DNA).

In the context of cancer, ZNF790 is located in regions of chromosome 19 that show gains in ovarian carcinomas. The overexpression or rearrangement of zinc finger genes like ZNF790 could contribute to cancer pathogenesis, suggesting a potential role in oncogenic processes (Micci2010Array‐CGH).

ZNF790-AS1, a long non-coding RNA associated with ZNF790, has been identified in pancreatic cells. It shows a strong correlation with FOXA2, a key gene in pancreatic development, indicating that ZNF790-AS1 may influence the expression of genes involved in pancreatic development, although specific protein interactions involving ZNF790 are not detailed (Elsayed2023Genomewide).
