# DNAH11

## Overview
DNAH11, or dynein axonemal heavy chain 11, is a gene that encodes a protein integral to the axonemal dynein complex, a motor protein complex crucial for the motility of cilia and flagella. The protein encoded by DNAH11 is categorized as a motor protein and plays a pivotal role in converting chemical energy from ATP into mechanical work, facilitating the movement of cilia and flagella. This movement is essential for various physiological processes, including the clearance of mucus in the respiratory tract and sperm motility, thereby contributing to respiratory health and fertility (Maiti2000Identification). DNAH11 is predominantly expressed in the cilia of epithelial and sperm cells, where it ensures proper cellular and organismal function. Mutations in this gene are linked to primary ciliary dyskinesia and other developmental disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining normal ciliary function and organ positioning (Liu2019DNAH11; Pifferi2010New).

## Function
DNAH11 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 11) is a gene that encodes a protein component of the axonemal dynein complex, which is essential for the motility of cilia and flagella. This protein plays a critical role in generating the force required for the beating of cilia and flagella, which is vital for various physiological processes, including respiratory tract clearance and sperm motility (Maiti2000Identification). DNAH11 is primarily active in the cilia of epithelial cells and sperm cells, contributing to proper cellular and organismal function (Maiti2000Identification).

In healthy human cells, DNAH11 is involved in the motility of cilia, which are hair-like structures on the surface of certain cells. These cilia are responsible for moving fluids across cell surfaces, such as mucus in the respiratory tract, and are crucial for normal respiratory function (Maiti2000Identification). The protein encoded by DNAH11 is part of the axonemal dynein complex, which is a motor protein complex that converts chemical energy from ATP into mechanical work, enabling the movement of cilia and flagella (Maiti2000Identification). This function is essential for maintaining the health and function of ciliated tissues in the human body.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the DNAH11 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily due to their impact on ciliary function. DNAH11 mutations are a known cause of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disorder characterized by chronic respiratory tract infections, abnormal organ positioning such as situs inversus, and infertility due to impaired ciliary movement (Dong2022A; Pifferi2010New). These mutations can lead to immotile cilia despite normal axonemal ultrastructure, as seen in cases of PCD with normal axonemal structure (Pifferi2010New).

DNAH11 mutations are also significantly associated with congenital heart disease (CHD) and heterotaxy syndrome, conditions involving abnormal left-right body-axis determination during embryonic development. Studies have identified compound heterozygous variants in DNAH11 in patients with these conditions, suggesting that these mutations may be a common genetic cause of familial CHD and heterotaxy syndrome (Xia2021DNAH11; Liu2019DNAH11). The presence of DNAH11 mutations in these patients often correlates with abnormal ciliary function, further linking the gene to these developmental disorders (Liu2019DNAH11). The pathogenicity of these mutations underscores the importance of DNAH11 in maintaining normal ciliary function and organ positioning.

## Interactions
DNAH11 is a component of the axonemal dynein complex, specifically involved in the structure and function of outer dynein arms (ODAs) in cilia. In the proximal type 1 ODAs, DNAH11 pairs with DNAH5, while in the distal type 2 ODAs, it is replaced by DNAH9. The ODAs also include two dynein intermediate chains, DNAI1 and DNAI2, and several dynein light chains such as DNAL1, DNAL4, DYNLL1, DYNLL2, DYNLRB1, DYNLRB2, DYNLT1/TCTEX1, DYNLT2, and NME8/DNAI8/TXNDC3. These components form a complex that requires the ODA docking complex for attachment to microtubule doublets, which consists of five protein subunits: ODAD1 (CCDC114), ODAD2 (ARMC4), ODAD3 (CCDC151), ODAD4 (TTC25), and ODAD5 (CLXN) (Smith2022The).

DNAH11's interactions are primarily with other dynein components and the docking complex, rather than with nucleic acids. The assembly of axonemal dyneins, including DNAH11, involves dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs) that assist in folding and stabilizing the dynein heavy chains and associating them with the dynein intermediate chain/light chain complex (Smith2022The).
