# SLC35A2

## Overview
SLC35A2 is a gene that encodes the protein solute carrier family 35 member A2, a crucial component of the nucleotide-sugar transporter family. This protein functions as a UDP-galactose transporter, facilitating the movement of UDP-galactose from the cytosol into the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a vital role in glycosylation processes. The SLC35A2 protein is characterized by its 10 transmembrane domains, which are essential for its function in transporting nucleotide sugars across cellular membranes (Miyamoto2019A; Kodera2013De). It is involved in the synthesis of various glycans, which are critical for protein folding, stability, and cell signaling (Hadley2019Nucleotide; Witters2020Clinical). Mutations in the SLC35A2 gene are linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular and physiological homeostasis (Ng2019SLC35A2‐CDG:).

## Structure
The SLC35A2 gene encodes a UDP-galactose transporter protein that is part of the nucleotide-sugar transporter family. This protein is characterized by a structure that includes 10 transmembrane domains, which facilitate the transport of UDP-galactose from the cytosol into the Golgi lumen (Miyamoto2019A; Kodera2013De). The protein's topology is such that the N- and C-termini face the cytoplasm (Wiktor2021Identification).

There are two splice variants of the SLC35A2 protein, known as UGT1 and UGT2, which differ at the carboxyl-terminal end by five or eight amino acid residues (Kodera2013De). These variants are predicted to maintain the 10-transmembrane domain structure, indicating a conserved role in UDP-galactose transport.

The protein may undergo post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are crucial for its function in glycosylation pathways within the Golgi apparatus (Sim2018Brain). The SLC35A2 protein can also form complexes with other proteins, such as the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter (SLC35A3), indicating its role in efficient substrate supply for glycosylation processes (Wiktor2021Identification).

## Function
The SLC35A2 gene encodes a UDP-galactose transporter, which is essential for the glycosylation processes in human cells. This transporter is responsible for importing UDP-galactose from the cytosol into the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it serves as a substrate for glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of glycans, including N- and O-linked glycans, glycosaminoglycans, and glycosphingolipids (Hadley2019Nucleotide; Witters2020Clinical). These glycans are crucial for various cellular functions such as protein folding, stability, and cell signaling (Witters2020Clinical).

SLC35A2 operates as part of the solute carrier family 35 (SLC35) of nucleotide sugar transporters and is involved in forming complexes with other transporters like SLC35A3, which may influence its regulation and function (Hadley2019Nucleotide; MaszczakSeneczko2022Delivery). The transporter has two splice variants, UGT1 and UGT2, which localize to the Golgi and both the ER and Golgi, respectively, and can restore the wild-type glycophenotype in cells with impaired UDP-galactose transport (MaszczakSeneczko2022Delivery). Proper functioning of SLC35A2 is vital for maintaining normal glycosylation processes, which are essential for cellular and physiological homeostasis (Ng2019SLC35A2‐CDG:).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the SLC35A2 gene, which encodes a UDP-galactose transporter, are associated with a range of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), specifically SLC35A2-CDG. These disorders are characterized by developmental delays, neurological impairments, and various systemic symptoms. Patients with SLC35A2-CDG often present with severe epilepsy, developmental disabilities, and muscular hypotonia. Brain imaging may reveal cerebellar atrophy and other abnormalities (Vals2019Clinical; Witters2020Clinical).

SLC35A2 mutations can also lead to early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE), a severe neurological disorder marked by frequent seizures and developmental regression. These mutations are often de novo and include frameshift and missense variants (Kodera2013De). Additionally, somatic variants in SLC35A2 have been linked to intractable neocortical epilepsy and mild malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy (MOGHE), conditions characterized by refractory focal epilepsy and specific neuropathological features (Bonduelle2021Frequent; Winawer2018Somatic).

The clinical presentation of SLC35A2-related disorders can vary significantly, influenced by factors such as mosaicism and skewed X-inactivation, particularly in females (Witters2020Clinical; Westenfield2018Mosaicism).

## Interactions
SLC35A2, a UDP-galactose transporter, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its function in glycosylation processes. It has been shown to interact with several proteins, including ATP2A2 and basigin (BSG), which associate with all tested nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) in the SLC35A subfamily, including SLC35A2. These interactions were confirmed using a split luciferase-based assay, indicating a strong luminescent signal (Wiktor2021Identification). SLC35A2 also interacts with GPR89B, but this interaction is specific to certain variants of SLC35A2, such as SLC35A2GA, and does not occur with SLC35A2ER (Wiktor2021Identification).

The transporter forms glycosylation-related complexes with mannoside acetylglucosaminyltransferases (Mgats) in HEK293T cells. Mgat1 is in close proximity to SLC35A2, while Mgat4B directly interacts with it, suggesting a role in the N-glycan branching pathway (MaszczakSeneczko2015UDPgalactose). SLC35A2 also forms heterologous complexes with SLC35A3 in the Golgi membrane, which may couple their roles in glycosylation (MaszczakSeneczko2012UDP‐N‐acetylglucosamine). These interactions highlight the importance of SLC35A2 in maintaining proper Golgi structure and function, as well as its involvement in glycosylation pathways.
