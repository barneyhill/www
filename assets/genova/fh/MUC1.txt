# MUC1

## Overview
MUC1 is a gene that encodes the protein mucin 1, cell surface associated, which is a transmembrane glycoprotein prominently expressed on the apical surface of epithelial cells. This protein plays a crucial role in protecting and lubricating epithelial surfaces, such as those in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts, by forming a protective mucin layer. Mucin 1 is characterized by its extensive O-glycosylation and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), which contribute to its function as a barrier against pathogens. The protein is involved in cell signaling, immune regulation, and maintaining epithelial integrity. It interacts with various signaling molecules and receptors, influencing processes such as cell growth, apoptosis, and immune responses. MUC1 is also implicated in cancer progression, where its overexpression and altered localization are associated with poor prognosis and aggressive disease features (Kufe2009Mucins; Apostolopoulos2015MUC1).

## Structure
MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a complex molecular structure. Its primary structure includes a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) rich in serine, threonine, and proline, contributing to its extensive O-glycosylation (Gendler1991Structure; Apostolopoulos2015MUC1). The VNTR region forms a rod-like structure that extends above the plasma membrane, characterized by hydrophilic beta-turns and a beta helix dominated by proline in the trans form (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1). 

The protein is composed of two subunits: the larger extracellular alpha subunit and the smaller transmembrane beta subunit. The alpha subunit contains the VNTR region, while the beta subunit includes a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail with phosphorylation sites involved in signal transduction (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1). The cytoplasmic tail is 72 amino acids long and contains conserved tyrosine residues crucial for signaling pathways (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1).

MUC1 undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage within the SEA module, resulting in two non-covalently associated polypeptides: MUC1-N and MUC1-C. MUC1-C, often referred to as the MUC1 oncoprotein, interacts with key signaling molecules and is involved in various cellular processes, including tumorigenesis (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1). The protein also exhibits several splice variant isoforms, such as MUC1/Y and MUC1/X, which lack the VNTR region and are expressed in various cancer types (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1).

## Function
MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and function of epithelial surfaces in healthy human cells. It is heavily glycosylated, which contributes to its protective functions by forming a viscoelastic gel that acts as a barrier on epithelial surfaces, such as those in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1). MUC1's extracellular domain acts as a decoy ligand for bacterial adhesins, limiting pathogen attachment and invasion, and can be released through proteolytic cleavage following bacterial adherence (McAuley2007MUC1).

The protein is involved in cell signaling, with its cytoplasmic domain modulating activation, growth, and apoptosis of mucosal epithelial cells in response to bacterial pathogens and toxins (McAuley2007MUC1). MUC1 interacts with growth factor receptors and inhibits apoptosis, helping maintain a balance between cell growth and death in mucosal tissues (McAuley2007MUC1). It also plays a role in immune regulation by interacting with Toll-like receptors to suppress excessive inflammation during infections (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1).

MUC1 is expressed on the apical surface of epithelial cells and is involved in hydrating, protecting, and lubricating these surfaces. It prevents pathogen binding and inhibits cell adhesion, contributing to the protective mucin layer in the gastric epithelium (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1).

## Clinical Significance
MUC1 is significantly implicated in various cancers due to its overexpression and altered localization. In breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid cancers, the MUC1-C subunit is involved in intracellular signaling and is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of recurrence (Kufe2009Mucins). MUC1 overexpression is linked to aggressive and metastatic cancers, including breast, colorectal, gall bladder, non-small cell lung, gastric, pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate cancers. It serves as a marker for therapy response and prognosis, with high levels correlating with more aggressive disease features (Horm2013MUC1).

In hematological malignancies, MUC1 is associated with gene amplification in multiple myeloma and is activated by chromosomal translocation in B cell lymphomas. It contributes to chronic myelogenous leukemia pathogenesis by stabilizing BCR–ABL, promoting self-renewal, and inhibiting differentiation and apoptosis (Kufe2009Mucins).

MUC1 also plays a role in inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, by providing resistance to apoptosis and activating the NF-κB pathway, which is significant in cancer development (Kufe2009Mucins). In reproductive health, altered MUC1 expression is linked to conditions like recurrent pregnancy loss and infertility (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1).

## Interactions
MUC1 interacts with a variety of proteins, playing significant roles in cell signaling and cancer progression. It forms complexes with receptor tyrosine kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), where it inhibits EGFR downregulation and enhances its transforming ability. This interaction involves the phosphorylation of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail by EGFR, and galectin-3 may facilitate this interaction (Schroeder2001Transgenic; Senapati2010Mucininteracting). MUC1 also interacts with other receptor tyrosine kinases, including Met, PDGFRβ, and FGFR3, influencing cell motility and invasion (Senapati2010Mucininteracting).

MUC1 binds to β-catenin, affecting cell adhesion and migration. This interaction is modulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which phosphorylates MUC1, reducing its binding to β-catenin and restoring the β-catenin-E-cadherin complex (Schroeder2003MUC1; Li1998Interaction). MUC1 also interacts with c-Src, which phosphorylates MUC1 and influences its association with β-catenin (Li2001The).

In the context of immune response, MUC1 binds to C-type lectin receptors on macrophages and dendritic cells, affecting antigen presentation (Apostolopoulos2015MUC1). It also interacts with calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML), which may influence intracellular calcium levels (Guang2009MUC1).
