# PPIAL4E

## Overview
PPIAL4E is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase A like 4E, which belongs to the cyclophilin family of proteins. These proteins are known for their role as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, which facilitate protein folding by catalyzing the isomerization of peptide bonds at proline residues. The PPIAL4E protein is involved in various cellular processes, including protein folding and trafficking, and may play a role in immune response regulation. While the specific functions and interactions of PPIAL4E are still under investigation, its involvement in critical cellular pathways suggests potential implications in health and disease (Qiu2020aarFDC).
