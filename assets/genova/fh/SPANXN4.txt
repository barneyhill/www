# SPANXN4

## Overview
SPANXN4 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the SPANX family, specifically the SPANX-N subfamily, which plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. The SPANX family proteins, including SPANXN4, are primarily expressed in the testis and are involved in the later stages of sperm maturation, particularly in the acrosome of spermatozoa, which is essential for sperm motility and fertilization capacity (Kouprina2007Evolutionary). As a cancer-testis antigen, SPANXN4 is also noted for its overexpression in certain tumor tissues, suggesting a potential role in chromatin remodeling and nuclear architecture (Schmidt2023Autoimmunoproteomics). The evolutionary significance of SPANXN4 is highlighted by its ancestral link to the SPANX-A/D subfamily, with distinct expression patterns in post-meiotic spermatids (Kouprina2007Evolutionary).

## Function
SPANXN4 is a member of the SPANX family, which is involved in spermatogenesis, the process of sperm cell development. These proteins are expressed throughout spermatogenesis, indicating their role in sperm development and maturation (Schmidt2023Autoimmunoproteomics). SPANXN4, along with other SPANX-N proteins, localizes to the acrosome in spermatozoa, suggesting its involvement in the later stages of sperm development, particularly in the motility and fertilization capacity of spermatozoa (Kouprina2007Evolutionary). 

SPANXN4 is expressed postmeiotically, specifically in late spermatids and spermatozoa, highlighting its role in the final stages of sperm maturation (Kouprina2007Evolutionary). The SPANX-N subfamily, including SPANXN4, is considered the ancestral precursor to the SPANX-A/D subfamily and is expressed in post-meiotic spermatids, unlike SPANX-A/D, which are found in a subpopulation and localized in the nuclear envelope (Kouprina2007Evolutionary). 

SPANXN4 is also known as a cancer-testis antigen due to its overexpression in tumor tissues and its normal physiological role in the testis and spermatozoa of healthy males (Schmidt2023Autoimmunoproteomics). This dual expression pattern suggests a potential role in chromatin remodeling and nuclear architecture during sperm formation.
