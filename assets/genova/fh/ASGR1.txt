# ASGR1

## Overview
The ASGR1 gene encodes the asialoglycoprotein receptor 1, a type II transmembrane protein primarily expressed in hepatocytes. This receptor is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily and plays a pivotal role in the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of glycoproteins with terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. ASGR1 is crucial for maintaining serum glycoprotein homeostasis by clearing desialylated glycoproteins from the bloodstream (Stockert1995The; Zhao2023ASGR1:). Beyond its role in glycoprotein clearance, ASGR1 is involved in cholesterol metabolism and has been implicated in the regulation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), influencing cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk (SusanResiga2021Asialoglycoprotein; Zhao2023ASGR1:). The gene produces two alternatively spliced transcripts, resulting in both a membrane-bound and a soluble isoform, the latter of which can circulate in plasma (Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2). ASGR1's interactions extend to its potential role as an alternative receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, highlighting its broader biological significance (Gu2021Receptome).

## Structure
The ASGR1 protein, also known as the asialoglycoprotein receptor 1, is a type II transmembrane protein composed of 291 amino acids (Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2; Hoober2020ASGR1). It features a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that is calcium-dependent and part of the C-type lectin superfamily (SusanResiga2021Asialoglycoprotein; Das2019Asialoglycoprotein). The CRD is responsible for binding glycoprotein ligands with terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues, and it includes critical residues such as Gln240, Trp244, and Glu253 (SusanResiga2021Asialoglycoprotein).

ASGR1 can form various quaternary structures, including homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers with ASGR2, which is necessary for its function in ligand binding and internalization (Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2; Das2019Asialoglycoprotein). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, which are essential for its function (Das2019Asialoglycoprotein).

ASGR1 is encoded by a gene that produces two alternatively spliced transcripts. The longer transcript encodes the full-length ASGR1, while the shorter transcript results in a soluble isoform lacking the transmembrane domain (Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2). This soluble form can circulate in plasma and potentially bind to non-hepatic targets (SusanResiga2021Asialoglycoprotein).

## Function
ASGR1, or asialoglycoprotein receptor 1, is primarily expressed on the surface of hepatocytes in the liver, where it plays a crucial role in the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of glycoproteins that have terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues. This receptor is involved in the clearance of desialylated glycoproteins from the bloodstream, maintaining serum glycoprotein homeostasis (Stockert1995The; Zhao2023ASGR1:). ASGR1 functions by binding to these glycoproteins, facilitating their uptake and degradation in liver cells, which is essential for preventing the accumulation of potentially harmful glycoconjugates in the blood (Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2).

In addition to its role in glycoprotein clearance, ASGR1 is involved in cholesterol metabolism. Its inhibition has been linked to increased cholesterol efflux and reduced blood cholesterol levels, which can lower the risk of atherosclerosis (Zhao2023ASGR1:). ASGR1 also regulates the degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in liver cells, influencing cholesterol metabolism independently of PCSK9, another protein known to regulate LDLR (SusanResiga2021Asialoglycoprotein).

ASGR1's activity is not limited to the liver; it is also expressed at low levels in other cell types, such as human peripheral blood monocytes, indicating a broader role in maintaining hemostatic balance (Harris2012ASGR1andASGR2).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the ASGR1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in relation to liver and cardiovascular health. ASGR1 deficiency is associated with increased liver injury due to the activation of the GP73-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. This deficiency exacerbates liver damage induced by toxins such as acetaminophen (APAP) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), and may also play a role in virus-induced liver injury (Zhang2024Deficiency). In ASGR1-deficient mice, elevated liver enzymes and increased expression of proinflammatory and proapoptotic markers indicate liver inflammation and damage, suggesting that ASGR1 plays a protective role in liver health (Zhang2024Deficiency).

Conversely, ASGR1 mutations, particularly loss-of-function mutations, are linked to reduced levels of non-HDL cholesterol and a decreased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Heterozygous carriers of such mutations, like the del12 mutation, exhibit a 34% lower risk of CVD, which is greater than expected from the modest decrease in LDL cholesterol levels alone (SusanResiga2021Asialoglycoprotein). This suggests that ASGR1 mutations confer cardiovascular protection beyond lipid level reduction, potentially through mechanisms involving the regulation of the LDL receptor and PCSK9 (Xu2021Hypomorphic).

## Interactions
ASGR1, or asialoglycoprotein receptor 1, is involved in several protein interactions that influence its function in the liver. ASGR1 forms oligomeric structures, including homo-oligomers and heterotetramers with ASGR2, which has a lower affinity for GalNAc residues. These interactions enhance the receptor's ability to bind ligands with multiple GalNAc residues, facilitating endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of glycoproteins (Hoober2020ASGR1).

ASGR1 also interacts with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), forming complexes that enhance LDLR degradation through carbohydrate-dependent and independent mechanisms. This interaction is mediated by the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of ASGR1, with specific residues such as Gln240, Trp244, and Glu253 playing critical roles (SusanResiga2021Asialoglycoprotein).

Additionally, ASGR1 has been identified as an alternative receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, capable of binding the spike glycoprotein and facilitating virus entry into cells independently of the ACE2 receptor. This interaction suggests a potential role for ASGR1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection pathways (Gu2021Receptome).

ASGR1 also interacts with GP73, a potential ligand, promoting its endocytosis and lysosomal degradation in a clathrin-dependent manner, which may influence liver injury through increased hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress (Zhang2024Deficiency).
