# ADCY10

## Overview
ADCY10 is a gene that encodes the protein adenylate cyclase 10, also known as soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), which is a unique form of adenylyl cyclase distinct from the transmembrane variants. This enzyme plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by catalyzing the conversion of ATP to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a critical second messenger involved in various physiological processes. Unlike its transmembrane counterparts, sAC is distributed throughout the cytoplasm and within cellular organelles, such as mitochondria, where it forms specialized cAMP microdomains (Pozdniakova2018Functional; Tresguerres2011Intracellular). sAC is activated by bicarbonate ions, allowing it to function as a sensor for bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and pH, thereby regulating processes such as ion transport, insulin release, neuronal growth, and sperm motility (Chen2000Soluble; Kleinboelting2014Crystal). The gene's clinical significance is underscored by its association with conditions like absorptive hypercalciuria and asthenozoospermia, as well as its potential role in cancer progression (Akbari2019ADCY10; Ge2024Two; Zhang2021Endogenous).

## Structure


## Function
The ADCY10 gene encodes the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a crucial second messenger in cellular signaling pathways. Unlike transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, sAC is distributed throughout the cytoplasm and cellular organelles, including the mitochondria, where it forms unique intracellular cAMP microdomains (Pozdniakova2018Functional; Tresguerres2011Intracellular). sAC is directly activated by bicarbonate ions, making it a sensor for bicarbonate, carbon dioxide, and pH, which allows it to regulate various physiological processes (Chen2000Soluble; Kleinboelting2014Crystal).

In healthy human cells, sAC-generated cAMP plays a significant role in regulating ion and fluid transport, particularly in the kidney, where it influences NaCl absorption and acid/base-related ion transport (Tresguerres2011Intracellular). It is also involved in glucose-induced cAMP production in pancreatic beta-cells, essential for insulin release (Tresguerres2011Intracellular). In the nervous system, sAC contributes to axonal growth and neuronal responses to nerve growth factor (Devasani2022Expression; Tresguerres2011Intracellular). Additionally, sAC is crucial for sperm motility and fertilization, as evidenced by defects in these processes in sAC knockout models (Tresguerres2011Intracellular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADCY10 gene are associated with several clinical conditions, primarily absorptive hypercalciuria (AH) and asthenozoospermia. AH is characterized by increased intestinal calcium absorption, leading to hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and sometimes nephrocalcinosis or chronic kidney disease. Novel heterozygous variants of ADCY10, such as c.3304T>C and c.1726C>T, have been identified in Chinese pediatric patients with AH, suggesting a significant role in the disease's pathogenesis (Ge2024Two). These mutations can disrupt protein folding or stability, contributing to the condition (Ge2024Two).

In the context of male infertility, ADCY10 mutations are linked to severe recessive asthenozoospermia, a condition marked by reduced sperm motility. A specific frameshift variant, c.1205_1206del, p.(His402Argfs*41), has been identified as pathogenic, affecting sperm motility and leading to infertility (Akbari2019ADCY10). Treatment with a cAMP analogue has shown potential in restoring sperm motility, highlighting the variant's impact on the cAMP/PKA pathway (Akbari2019ADCY10).

Additionally, ADCY10 expression is implicated in lung adenocarcinoma, where it is associated with increased sensitivity to ferroptosis and tumor progression. High ADCY10 expression correlates with poorer overall survival in patients, making it a potential target for ferroptosis-based therapies (Zhang2021Endogenous).

## Interactions
ADCY10, also known as soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), is involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with different molecules. It is distinct from transmembrane adenylyl cyclases as it is not regulated by G proteins and is insensitive to forskolin. Instead, ADCY10 is activated by calcium ions (Ca2+) and bicarbonate ions, which play a crucial role in its function as an intracellular pH sensor (Li2024The; Devasani2022Expression).

In the context of sperm function, ADCY10 is involved in the regulation of sperm motility and fertilizing ability through cAMP signaling cascades. It is activated by bicarbonate and calcium, leading to the conversion of ATP to cAMP, which then activates protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) signaling pathways. These pathways are essential for sperm maturation, motility, and the acrosome reaction (TATE2010Evidence).

ADCY10 also interacts with components of the cAMP signaling cascade, including A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which scaffold protein kinase A and other components of the signaling cascade. This interaction is influenced by its compartmentalization and interaction with phosphodiesterases, affecting cAMP signaling (Li2024The).
