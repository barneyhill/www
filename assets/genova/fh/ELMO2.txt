# ELMO2

## Overview
ELMO2 (Engulfment and Cell Motility 2) is a gene that encodes a scaffold protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell motility, polarity, and microtubule dynamics. The ELMO2 protein is characterized by its elongated superhelical structure, comprising domains such as the Ras-binding domain, armadillo repeats domain, and ELMO domain, which facilitate its interactions with other proteins. As a scaffold protein, ELMO2 plays a pivotal role in the ELMO/DOCK/Rac signaling pathway, influencing cell migration and polarity by forming complexes with proteins like Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and RhoG. These interactions are crucial for the activation of Rac1, a small GTPase essential for lamellipodia formation and directional cell migration. ELMO2's involvement in cellular signaling pathways extends to its interaction with brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1), impacting processes such as phagocytosis and myoblast fusion. Mutations in the ELMO2 gene have been linked to clinical conditions such as vascular malformation of the osseous system and Ramon syndrome, highlighting its significance in maintaining vascular and skeletal integrity (Ho2009Integrinlinked; Weng2019Structure; Cetinkaya2016LossofFunction).

## Structure
The ELMO2 protein is characterized by an elongated superhelical architecture composed of three primary domains: the N-terminal Ras-binding domain (RBD), the armadillo repeats domain (ARR), and the ELMO domain. The RBD, spanning amino acids 1-80, adopts a ubiquitin-like superfold, similar to the RBD of FHOD1 (Weng2019Structure). The ARR domain, covering amino acids 81-301, contains five armadillo repeats, although the first repeat is incomplete (Weng2019Structure). The ELMO domain, from amino acids 306-513, features an all α-helical topology with 11 α-helices (Weng2019Structure).

The ELMO2 protein forms a supramodule with the RBD, ARR, and ELMO domains, creating a conserved concave groove that binds specifically to the brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) fragment (Weng2019Structure). This interaction is crucial for cellular processes such as phagocytosis and myoblast fusion (Weng2019Structure). The ELMO2-RAE supramodule binds to a 36-residue fragment of BAI1 with a dissociation constant of approximately 3.36 µM, indicating a 1:1 molar binding ratio (Weng2019Structure).

ELMO2 also interacts with other proteins, such as Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), through its N-terminal region, which includes the armadillo repeats (Ho2009Integrinlinked). The protein's structure and interactions are essential for its role in the ELMO/DOCK/Rac signaling pathway, influencing cell motility and polarity (Weng2019Structure).

## Function
ELMO2 (Engulfment and Cell Motility 2) is a scaffold protein that plays a significant role in cell motility and microtubule dynamics. It is involved in the formation of complexes with integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and RhoG, which are crucial for cell polarization and migration, particularly in epithelial, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells (Ho2009Integrinlinked). ELMO2 acts as a bridge between ILK and RhoG, facilitating the activation of Rac1, a small GTPase that is essential for lamellipodia formation and directional cell migration (Ho2012Emerging; Ho2012Epidermal).

In keratinocytes, ELMO2 is involved in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced cell polarization and migration. It forms complexes with ILK and RhoG that localize to the leading edge of cells, promoting front-rear polarity and cell movement (Ho2012Epidermal). These complexes are recruited to the plasma membrane upon EGF stimulation, enhancing Rac1 activation and facilitating actin cytoskeleton remodeling (Ho2012Epidermal).

ELMO2 also contributes to microtubule stability by forming ERI complexes with ILK and RhoG, which are important for maintaining microtubule dynamics and stability, crucial for cellular functions such as intracellular transport and cell division (Jackson2015An).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ELMO2 gene are associated with intraosseous vascular malformation, specifically a condition known as vascular malformation of the osseous system (VMOS). This condition is characterized by painless swelling of facial bones, gingival bleeding, and severe facial asymmetry. It is linked to homozygous mutations in ELMO2, which disrupt normal RAC1 signaling, crucial for cellular processes like cell migration and cytoskeletal dynamics (Cetinkaya2016LossofFunction). These mutations lead to aberrant splicing and reduced expression of ELMO2, resulting in non-functional proteins and impaired vascular development within bones (Cetinkaya2016LossofFunction).

In addition to VMOS, a novel homozygous mutation in ELMO2 has been identified in a patient with Ramon syndrome, a rare condition characterized by cherubism, gingival fibromatosis, epilepsy, intellectual disability, hypertrichosis, and short stature. This mutation affects the atypical Pleckstrin homology domain of ELMO2, potentially disrupting its interaction with DOCK proteins and affecting RAC1 signaling, which may contribute to the syndrome's complex phenotype (Mehawej2018Homozygous). These findings underscore the critical role of ELMO2 in maintaining vascular and skeletal integrity.

## Interactions
ELMO2 interacts with several proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular processes such as cell polarity and migration. It specifically interacts with Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) through its N-terminus, forming a complex that is essential for cell polarization and migration. This interaction is unique to ELMO2 and does not occur with ELMO1, despite their high homology (Ho2009Integrinlinked). ELMO2 acts as a bridge between ILK and RhoG, facilitating the formation of a ternary complex that is necessary for Rac1 activation, which is important for cell polarization and directional migration (Ho2009Integrinlinked).

ELMO2 also forms a complex with BAI1, an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor, through hydrophobic and polar interactions. This interaction is crucial for processes like myoblast fusion, and mutations in the binding interface can lead to diseases such as cancers and vascular malformations (Weng2019Structure). ELMO2's interaction with BAI1 involves a conserved binding mode, allowing it to interact with multiple proteins, which is significant for its role in cellular signaling pathways (Weng2019Structure).
