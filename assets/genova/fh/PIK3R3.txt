# PIK3R3

## Overview
PIK3R3 is a gene that encodes the phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 3, also known as p55γ, which is a component of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex. This protein functions as a regulatory subunit, playing a pivotal role in modulating the activity of the PI3K enzyme, which is integral to various cellular signaling pathways. The PI3K complex is involved in critical cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival, primarily through its influence on the AKT signaling pathway (Fruman2017The). PIK3R3 is categorized as a regulatory protein and is predominantly active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to metabolic regulation and immune responses. Its interactions with other proteins and involvement in signaling pathways underscore its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological changes (Sohn2022PIK3R3; Fruman2017The).

## Function
PIK3R3 encodes the regulatory subunit p55γ of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which plays a crucial role in cellular signaling pathways. In healthy human cells, PIK3R3 is involved in modulating the activity and localization of the PI3K complex. It interacts with catalytic subunits to influence pathways such as the AKT signaling pathway, which is essential for cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival (Fruman2017The).

PIK3R3, as part of the regulatory subunit complex, helps maintain the PI3K enzyme in a low activity state under basal conditions. Its interaction with phosphotyrosyl residues on growth factor receptors relieves inhibitory contacts, allowing activation of the PI3K complex (Fruman2017The). This regulatory mechanism is crucial for the precise control of PI3K signaling, ensuring appropriate cellular responses to external stimuli.

The protein is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it plays a role in metabolic regulation and immune responses. Although the specific function of PIK3R3 in healthy cells is not fully detailed, its involvement in these fundamental processes suggests it contributes to maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to physiological changes (Fruman2017The).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PIK3R3 gene have been implicated in several cancers and inflammatory conditions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), PIK3R3 is overexpressed and associated with enhanced sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy. This is due to its role in regulating thymidine phosphorylase (TP) expression via the NF-kB pathway, which is crucial for converting 5-FU to its active form. Higher PIK3R3 expression correlates with better disease-free survival in CRC patients, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for chemotherapeutic response (Ibrahim2018PIK3R3).

In epithelial ovarian cancer, PIK3R3 is identified as having significant DNA copy number gains and upregulated mRNA expression, contributing to tumor progression. Knockdown of PIK3R3 in ovarian cancer cell lines increases apoptosis, indicating its role in cell survival and its potential as a therapeutic target (Zhang2007Integrative).

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), PIK3R3 expression is significantly increased, negatively affecting the expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1. This alteration is linked to the activation of the NF-kB pathway, suggesting that PIK3R3 may play a role in the pathophysiology of IBD and could be a target for therapeutic intervention (Ibrahim2020PIK3R3).

## Interactions
PIK3R3, a regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is involved in various protein interactions that play significant roles in cellular processes. In ovarian cancer, PIK3R3 interacts with 157 genes, including GRB2, EGFR, ERBB3, PTK2, HCK, IGF1R, YES1, and PIK3CA. These interactions are enriched in pathways such as the ErbB signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, and insulin signaling pathways (Sohn2022PIK3R3). 

In the context of the Ras-MAPK/PI3K signaling pathways, PIK3R3 has been shown to interact with ABCB6 and RING1, with interaction scores of 18.5 and 10.6, respectively (Wang2008Protein). 

PIK3R3 also plays a role in cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis through its interaction with proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is crucial for DNA synthesis. This interaction modulates the binding of DNA polymerase delta to PCNA, influencing DNA replication (Wang2013PI3K). 

In colorectal cancer, PIK3R3 interacts with the p53 protein, inhibiting its ability to bind to the p21 gene promoter, thereby affecting the transcriptional activity of the p21 gene and regulating cell senescence and proliferation (Chen2020PIK3R3).
