# BAMBI

## Overview
BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor) is a gene that encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein functioning as a pseudoreceptor. This protein is primarily involved in the negative regulation of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, a critical pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes. By inhibiting the interaction between type I and type II TGF-β receptors, BAMBI prevents the phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), thereby modulating transcriptional responses (Yan2009Human). Additionally, BAMBI plays a role in the Wnt signaling pathway, influencing cell cycle progression and proliferation (Van2015Investigation). The protein's expression is subject to regulation through lysosomal and autolysosomal degradation, particularly in endothelial cells, implicating its involvement in vascular remodeling (Xavier2010BAMBI). BAMBI's expression and function have significant implications in various pathological conditions, including cancer, where it can act as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context (Fritzmann2009A; Marwitz2016Downregulation).

## Structure


## Function
The BAMBI gene encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein that functions as a pseudoreceptor, primarily acting as a negative regulator of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway in healthy human cells. BAMBI inhibits TGF-β signaling by blocking the interaction between type I and type II receptors, thereby preventing the phosphorylation of receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) and subsequent transcriptional responses. This inhibition is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive cellular responses to TGF-β, which can lead to pathological conditions such as tumors and tissue fibrosis (Yan2009Human).

BAMBI also interacts with Smad7 to form a ternary complex with the TGF-β type I receptor ALK5, further inhibiting the activation of Smad3 and TGF-β signaling (Yan2009Human). In addition to its role in TGF-β signaling, BAMBI is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, where it enhances interactions between the Wnt receptor Frizzled5 and the downstream mediator Dishevelled2, promoting Wnt-induced cell cycle progression and proliferation (Yan2009Human; Van2015Investigation). BAMBI's expression is regulated by lysosomal and autolysosomal degradation, particularly in endothelial cells, suggesting its involvement in vascular remodeling and endothelial function (Xavier2010BAMBI).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in BAMBI expression are implicated in various cancers. In colorectal cancer, BAMBI is overexpressed in metastatic tumors, correlating with shorter patient survival and increased metastatic potential. This overexpression is regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting BAMBI as a prognostic marker for metastasis (Fritzmann2009A). In gastric cancer, BAMBI is typically downregulated, and its overexpression inhibits cell growth and migration, indicating a potential role in suppressing cancer progression (Yuan2018Bone).

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BAMBI is often downregulated, enhancing TGF-β signaling and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion. Reconstitution of BAMBI reduces these effects, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor (Marwitz2016Downregulation). In bladder cancer, BAMBI is epigenetically silenced in high-grade tumors, with its expression restored by demethylation treatments, indicating its potential involvement in tumor progression (Khin2009BAMBI).

In osteosarcoma, BAMBI downregulation is associated with disease progression, and its reconstitution suppresses tumor growth and invasion, highlighting its potential therapeutic implications (Liu2018Bone). These findings underscore BAMBI's complex role in cancer, acting as both a promoter and suppressor depending on the cancer type.

## Interactions
BAMBI, a pseudoreceptor, interacts with several proteins to modulate signaling pathways. It forms a ternary complex with Smad7 and the TGF-β type I receptor ALK5, which is enhanced by TGF-β. This complex inhibits the interaction between ALK5 and Smad3, blocking R-Smad activation and thereby inhibiting TGF-β signaling (Yan2009Human). BAMBI also interacts with Smad6 and Smad7, with TGF-β promoting the interaction with Smad7 (Yan2009Human).

In ovarian cancer cells, BAMBI co-translocates with Smad proteins into the nucleus upon TGF-β treatment, suggesting a physical interaction with Smads (Pils2010BAMBI). Despite its role as a pseudoreceptor, BAMBI does not inhibit the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated Smad2/3 but instead co-translocates with them (Pils2010BAMBI).

BAMBI also interacts with components of the Wnt signaling pathway, such as Frizzled and Dishevelled, facilitating Wnt signaling (Luo2011Identification). These interactions highlight BAMBI's role in modulating multiple signaling pathways, impacting processes like adipogenesis and cancer progression.
