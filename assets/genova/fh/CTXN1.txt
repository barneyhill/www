# CTXN1

## Overview
The CTXN1 gene encodes the protein cortexin 1, which is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly within the cerebral cortex. Cortexin 1 is implicated in neuronal development and function, suggesting its involvement in maintaining neurological health. Although the precise molecular function of cortexin 1 remains to be fully elucidated, its expression pattern indicates a role in neural signaling pathways. Research has linked CTXN1 to various neurological disorders, highlighting its potential significance in neurodevelopmental processes (Carpanini2017Analysis). Additionally, CTXN1 has been associated with immune responses in the context of low-grade glioma, where its expression influences immune cell infiltration and tumor microenvironment dynamics (Zhuang2022Identification).

## Structure


## Function


## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the CTXN1 gene have been associated with various neurological disorders. In the context of low-grade glioma (LGG), low expression of CTXN1 is linked to better survival outcomes. This is due to its association with higher infiltration of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells, which are crucial for an effective immune response against tumors (Zhuang2022Identification). The RP11-770J1.4-CTXN1 axis has been identified as an immunomodulatory pathway in LGG, suggesting that CTXN1 plays a role in immune cell infiltration and the immune response within the tumor microenvironment (Zhuang2022Identification).

In addition to its role in glioma, CTXN1 is expressed specifically in the brain and enriched in the cortex, with expression observed in neurons of the cerebral cortex (Carpanini2017Analysis). While the Carpanini study does not directly link CTXN1 to specific diseases, it highlights the gene's expression in the nervous system, suggesting its potential involvement in neurological health and disease (Carpanini2017Analysis). The gene's role in neuronal development and function implies that alterations in CTXN1 could disrupt neural signaling pathways, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental abnormalities.
