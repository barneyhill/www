# TBC1D28

## Overview
TBC1D28 is a gene that encodes the protein TBC1 domain family member 28, which is part of the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain-containing protein family. These proteins are known to function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Rab GTPases, which are critical regulators of intracellular vesicle trafficking. The TBC1 domain family member 28 protein is involved in the regulation of membrane trafficking processes, although its specific biological roles and mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Understanding the function and interactions of TBC1D28 is important for elucidating its potential implications in various cellular processes and diseases.
