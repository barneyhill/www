# OR1L6

## Overview
The OR1L6 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 1 subfamily L member 6, which is part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are integral membrane proteins involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. The OR1L6 protein is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains, a common feature of GPCRs, which allows it to transduce extracellular signals through interaction with G proteins. This gene is part of a large family of olfactory receptors, which are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals, contributing to the diversity and specificity of olfactory perception (Qiu2020aarFDC).
