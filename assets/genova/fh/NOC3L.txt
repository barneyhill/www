# NOC3L

## Overview
NOC3L, or nucleolar-complex-associated-3 homolog, is a gene that encodes the NOC3-like DNA replication regulator protein, which plays a pivotal role in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. This protein is primarily localized in the nucleus and is essential for the initiation of DNA replication, interacting with other replication factors to ensure proper cell division and genomic stability. NOC3L is also involved in adipocyte differentiation, where it is known as factor for adipocyte differentiation 24 (fad24), and it regulates adiposity by controlling DNA replication during mitotic clonal expansion. Additionally, NOC3L has been implicated in cancer biology, particularly in conferring resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer and influencing the risk of gastric and colorectal cancers through specific genetic polymorphisms. These diverse roles underscore the gene's significance in both normal cellular processes and disease states, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions (Duan2013Genetic; Yuan2012Polymorphisms).

## Function
The NOC3L gene, also known as nucleolar-complex-associated-3 homolog, plays a significant role in DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. It encodes a protein that is crucial for the initiation of DNA replication by interacting with other replication factors, ensuring proper cell division and maintaining genomic stability. This protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it supports normal cellular proliferation (Yuan2012Polymorphisms).

NOC3L is involved in adipocyte differentiation, where it is referred to as factor for adipocyte differentiation 24 (fad24). It regulates adiposity by controlling DNA replication during mitotic clonal expansion, a critical phase in cell growth and differentiation (Yuan2012Polymorphisms). The gene also plays a role in inhibiting H-RAS-mediated transformation by repressing NF-kB activity, suggesting its involvement in regulating cell growth and differentiation processes (Yuan2012Polymorphisms).

In the context of cancer, NOC3L has been identified as a gene that may confer resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer patients, indicating its potential role in cancer resistance mechanisms (Yuan2012Polymorphisms). These functions highlight the gene's importance in both normal cellular processes and disease states.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NOC3L gene have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, particularly gastric and colorectal cancers, in the Chinese Han population. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NOC3L, such as rs11187877 and rs11187893, have been linked to a heightened risk of gastric cancer. The allele 'G' of rs17109928 in NOC3L is notably associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer in both additive and dominant genetic models (Yuan2012Polymorphisms). This suggests that genetic variations in NOC3L may contribute to gastric cancer susceptibility by potentially affecting DNA replication or altering the NF-kB pathway, which could influence carcinogenesis (Yuan2012Polymorphisms).

In colorectal cancer, the genotype 'GT' of rs17109928 in NOC3L may decrease CRC risk in the overdominant model, while a haplotype involving NOC3L and PLCE1 may increase CRC risk (Duan2013Genetic). These findings highlight the role of NOC3L in modulating cancer risk, suggesting that its dysregulation could contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The complex interplay of genetic factors and their interactions with environmental influences underscores the need for further research to fully understand the clinical significance of NOC3L in cancer (Yuan2012Polymorphisms).
