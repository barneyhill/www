# ULBP2

## Overview
ULBP2 is a gene that encodes the protein UL16 binding protein 2, which is a member of the NKG2D ligand family. This protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by interacting with the NKG2D receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells, thereby facilitating immune surveillance and the elimination of stressed, infected, or transformed cells. ULBP2 is unique among its family members due to its ability to be expressed on the cell surface with or without a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, which may influence its function in immune cell activation (FernándezMessina2011The). The protein is characterized by a conserved WW-like motif that is essential for its transport to the cell surface (Uhlenbrock2015A). ULBP2's interactions with other proteins, such as the HCMV UL16 glycoprotein and the RNA-binding protein IMP3, underscore its involvement in immune modulation and potential immune evasion mechanisms (Wittenbrink2009Differential; Schmiedel2016The). The clinical significance of ULBP2 is highlighted by its altered expression in various cancers, where it serves as a prognostic marker and is implicated in tumor immune escape (Paschen2009Differential; Liang2020MiR873).

## Structure
ULBP2 is a protein with a molecular weight of 23,655.29 Da, composed of all 20 amino acids, with leucine being the most abundant. It is an acidic protein with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 6.52 (Aruleba2020Insights). The protein's three-dimensional structure consists of four α-helices, one 3_10 helix, and seven antiparallel β-sheets, modeled with a high sequence identity of 96% to its template (Aruleba2020Insights). The structure is supported by an ERRAT quality factor of 84.8% and a QMEAN score of -0.88, indicating a reliable model (Aruleba2020Insights).

ULBP2 contains a conserved WW-like motif with tryptophan residues at positions 139, 158, and 172, crucial for its cell-surface transport (Uhlenbrock2015A). These tryptophan residues are part of a domain that regulates invariant chain-dependent transport to the cell surface (Uhlenbrock2015A). ULBP2 can be expressed on the cell surface with or without a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, a unique feature among its family members (FernándezMessina2011The). The presence of a transmembrane sequence in its C-terminal region allows ULBP2 to localize to the plasma membrane without a GPI anchor (FernándezMessina2011The). The protein does not form a quaternary structure, functioning as a monomer.

## Function
ULBP2 (UL16 binding protein 2) is a ligand for the NKG2D receptor, which is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and certain T cells. This interaction plays a crucial role in immune surveillance by activating NK cells to target and eliminate stressed, infected, or transformed cells. ULBP2 can be expressed on the cell surface with or without a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, and both forms are capable of activating NK cells by stimulating their degranulation and cytotoxicity (FernándezMessina2011The).

In healthy human cells, ULBP2 expression is associated with a mature functional phenotype of NK cells, particularly those expressing the CD57 marker, which are known for their higher cytotoxic capacity and sensitivity to stimulation. This expression is upregulated in response to IL-2 stimulation, indicating a role in NK cell proliferation and maturation rather than direct modulation of cytotoxic functions (Brennan2016Human).

ULBP2's ability to be expressed without a GPI anchor suggests a unique mechanism of membrane localization, which could influence its function in immune cell activation, particularly under conditions that affect GPI anchor synthesis (FernándezMessina2011The).

## Clinical Significance
ULBP2, a member of the NKG2D ligand family, plays a significant role in immune surveillance and has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In melanoma, elevated levels of soluble ULBP2 (sULBP2) in the serum are associated with poor prognosis, particularly in early-stage patients, and are considered a superior prognostic marker compared to the traditional serum marker S100B (Paschen2009Differential). The shedding of ULBP2, which makes it detectable in serum, is a mechanism by which tumors may evade immune detection (Paschen2009Differential).

In cervical cancer, ULBP2 expression is significantly higher in cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues, correlating with poorer survival outcomes. The study suggests that miR-873 negatively regulates ULBP2, affecting cancer cell proliferation and migration (Liang2020MiR873). In colorectal cancer, high expression of ULBP2 is associated with improved survival, whereas in ovarian cancer, it correlates inversely with survival, highlighting the complexity of its role in different cancer types (FernándezMessina2011The).

ULBP2 is also part of a prognostic immune gene signature linked to reduced overall survival in various cancers, including colon cancer, where it is considered a biomarker related to prognosis and immunity (Yang2023ULBP2; D’Angelo2023Immunerelated).

## Interactions
ULBP2 interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing a significant role in immune surveillance. It is a ligand for the NKG2D receptor, a critical interaction that activates natural killer (NK) cells to target stressed or transformed cells. ULBP2 binds strongly to soluble human NKG2D (sNKG2D), unlike the related RAET1G, which shows weak binding (Wittenbrink2009Differential). This interaction is crucial for NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as ULBP2 has the highest binding affinity to NKG2D among ULBP proteins (Song2006Soluble).

ULBP2 also interacts with the HCMV UL16 glycoprotein, which binds strongly to ULBP2 but not to RAET1G, indicating functional distinctions despite structural similarities (Wittenbrink2009Differential). The protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the regulation of ULBP2 surface expression, with sustained PKC activity being crucial for its induction (Uhlenbrock2014The).

Additionally, the RNA-binding protein IMP3 interacts with ULBP2 mRNA, binding to its 3'UTR and decreasing its stability. This interaction facilitates tumor immune escape by downregulating ULBP2, thereby diminishing the immune response mediated by NK cells (Schmiedel2016The). These interactions highlight ULBP2's role in modulating immune responses and its potential involvement in immune evasion mechanisms.
