# CEACAM21

## Overview
Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 21 (CEACAM21) is a gene that encodes the CEA cell adhesion molecule 21 protein, which is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This protein is involved in cell adhesion processes, playing a crucial role in mediating intercellular interactions. CEACAM21 is expressed in various tissues and is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including immune response modulation and tumorigenesis. As a cell adhesion molecule, it contributes to the structural integrity and communication between cells, which is essential for maintaining tissue architecture and function. The study of CEACAM21 and its encoded protein is significant for understanding its potential roles in disease mechanisms and therapeutic applications.
