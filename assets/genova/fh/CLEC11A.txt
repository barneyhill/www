# CLEC11A

## Overview
CLEC11A is a gene that encodes the protein C-type lectin domain containing 11A, also known as Osteolectin. This protein is a member of the C-type lectin superfamily and is characterized as a secreted glycoprotein with a significant role in various physiological processes. The protein structure includes distinct domains such as an N-terminal RGD triplet, a leucine zipper dimerization domain, and a C-terminal C-type lectin domain, which contribute to its functional diversity (Xu2024The). CLEC11A is involved in critical biological functions, including hematopoietic differentiation, bone formation, and tumor progression. It interacts with integrin receptors, particularly integrin α11, to activate signaling pathways like the Wnt pathway, which are essential for bone metabolism and cellular proliferation (Xu2024The; Shi2023CLEC11A). The gene's expression and methylation status have clinical significance in various cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia and lung adenocarcinoma, as well as in bone-related diseases, making it a potential therapeutic target (Lin2022EGFR; Yin2021High).

## Structure
CLEC11A, a member of the C-type lectin protein superfamily, is characterized as a secreted glycoprotein. The protein structure includes an N-terminal RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) triplet region, an alpha-helical leucine zipper dimerization domain consisting of six heptamers in the middle, and a C-terminal C-type lectin structural domain (Xu2024The). The human CLEC11A gene encodes two isoforms: SCGFa, a full-length isoform with a molecular weight of 47 kDa, and SCGFb, a shortened isoform with a molecular weight of 40 kDa that lacks the 78 amino acid lectin structural domain at the C-terminus (Xu2024The). 

CLEC11A contains potential integrin-binding motifs, such as RGD and TDF motifs, although the RGD motif is not present in the mouse CLEC11A protein (Lin2022EGFR). The protein is involved in promoting endothelial cell differentiation and has endothelial trophic and tumor-promoting activities (Lin2022EGFR). CLEC11A is also known to undergo post-translational modifications like glycosylation, which is common for proteins in the C-type lectin family (Shi2023CLEC11A). The presence of these structural features and modifications suggests a complex role in various physiological processes, including bone formation and tumor progression.

## Function
CLEC11A, also known as C-type lectin domain containing 11A, is a secreted glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in various cellular and molecular processes. It is involved in the regulation of hematopoietic differentiation and homeostasis, contributing to the protection against severe malarial anemia and lipotoxicity (Wang2020Molecular). In the skeletal system, CLEC11A is essential for the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into mature osteoblasts, which is vital for maintaining adult skeletal health, preventing age-related bone loss, and aiding in fracture repair (Wang2020Molecular). It promotes osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and osteoblasts, and stimulates chondrocyte proliferation, supporting bone growth and remodeling (Xu2024The).

CLEC11A is also involved in the stress/adaptive response of bone to exercise through mechanical stimulation of the cation channel Piezo1 (Xu2024The). It interacts with integrin receptors, particularly integrin α11, to activate the Wnt signaling pathway, which is crucial for bone metabolism and structural integrity (Xu2024The; Wang2020Molecular). In human beta-cells, CLEC11A enhances insulin secretion and promotes cell proliferation, likely through its interaction with the osteolectin receptor ITGA11 and activation of intracellular signaling pathways such as the Wnt pathway (Shi2023CLEC11A).

## Clinical Significance
CLEC11A has significant clinical implications in various diseases, particularly in cancer and bone-related conditions. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), high expression of CLEC11A is associated with a favorable prognosis, correlating with better overall survival and event-free survival rates. Conversely, high methylation levels of CLEC11A are linked to poorer prognosis, suggesting that CLEC11A hypermethylation is associated with a poor induction remission rate in AML (Yin2021High). In lung adenocarcinoma, particularly with EGFR mutations, CLEC11A expression is elevated and promotes cancer progression through angiogenesis (Lin2022EGFR). In gastric cancer, high CLEC11A expression correlates with advanced clinical stages and poor survival outcomes, and its knockdown reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells (Fang2023CLEC11A).

CLEC11A also plays a role in bone diseases. It is implicated in osteosarcoma and multiple myeloma, where it is considered a potential therapeutic target. In osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, CLEC11A promotes bone formation and prevents bone loss, showing potential in reversing symptoms of these conditions (Xu2024The).

## Interactions
CLEC11A, also known as Osteolectin, interacts with integrins, particularly integrin alpha11 (a11). It contains integrin-binding motifs, RGD and LDT, which are conserved across bony vertebrates. These motifs suggest potential interactions with integrins, and indeed, integrin a11b1 has been identified as a receptor for Osteolectin, with a high binding affinity (dissociation constant of 0.3 nM). This interaction is significant for osteogenesis, as it is expressed by osteogenic cells in the bone marrow (Shen2018Integrin). 

In endothelial cells, CLEC11A does not significantly induce conventional integrin signaling, as it does not cause significant Tyr phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and p130 Cas. However, mutations in potential integrin-binding motifs on CLEC11A abolished its chemo-attractant ability, suggesting a biological function for these motifs. An increase in active integrin β1 signal was detected upon CLEC11A treatment, indicating that CLEC11A acts on endothelial cells through integrins (Lin2022EGFR).

CLEC11A also interacts with the osteolectin receptor ITGA11 in human beta-cells, activating intracellular signaling pathways such as the Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in pancreas development and beta-cell function (Shi2023CLEC11A).
