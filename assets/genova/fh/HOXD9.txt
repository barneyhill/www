# HOXD9

## Overview
HOXD9 is a gene that encodes the homeobox D9 protein, a transcription factor belonging to the homeobox gene family. This family is characterized by the presence of a homeo domain, which facilitates DNA binding and regulation of gene expression during embryonic development. The homeobox D9 protein plays a pivotal role in the development of body structures, particularly in limb and organ formation, by influencing the transcription of target genes along the anterior-posterior axis (Svingen2003Altered). HOXD9 is part of the HOXD cluster, one of four HOX gene clusters in humans, and is expressed in various tissues, including the colon, spleen, and kidney, but is minimally expressed in the brain (Takahashi2007Dysregulated; Tabuse2011Functional). The gene's involvement in cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as its interactions with other proteins and nucleic acids, underscores its significance in both normal development and disease contexts, such as cancer (Zappavigna1994Specificity; Zha2012Functional).

## Function
HOXD9 is a member of the homeobox gene family, which encodes transcription factors that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during embryonic development. These proteins are involved in the development of body structures, particularly in limb and organ formation. HOXD9 is active in the nucleus, where it influences the transcription of target genes, contributing to patterning along the anterior-posterior axis (Svingen2003Altered).

In healthy human cells, HOXD9 is expressed in various tissues, including the colon, spleen, kidney, testis, placenta, and bladder, but it is poorly expressed in the brain (Tabuse2011Functional). The gene is part of a larger cluster of HOX genes that are organized into four clusters (A-D) on different chromosomes, with HOXD9 being part of the HOXD cluster (Takahashi2007Dysregulated).

HOXD9, along with other HOXD genes, is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. In neuroblastoma cells, HOXD9 can downregulate cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases necessary for cell cycle progression, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting neuronal differentiation (Zha2012Functional). This suggests that HOXD9 plays a role in both inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting differentiation in specific cellular contexts.

## Clinical Significance
HOXD9 is implicated in various cancers through alterations in its methylation status. Hypermethylation of HOXD9 is a common epigenetic alteration in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), where it serves as a potential biomarker for differentiating CCA from other biliary diseases. This hypermethylation is associated with higher methylation levels in CCA patients compared to those with other biliary diseases, suggesting its role in cancer development and progression (Wasenang2019Serum). In melanoma, hypermethylated HOXD9 is linked to poor prognosis in patients with lymph node metastasis, indicating its potential impact on survival outcomes (Wasenang2019Serum).

In hepatocellular carcinoma, HOXD9 may function as an oncogene, promoting cell migration, invasion, and metastasis (Wasenang2019Serum). Conversely, in melanoma brain metastasis, low expression of HOXD9 due to promoter hypermethylation is associated with poorer survival outcomes, highlighting the gene's complex role in cancer biology (Wasenang2019Serum).

Additionally, a repeat polymorphism in HOXD9 has been identified, although its clinical significance in acute lymphoid malignancies remains unclear (van2005Mutation). Overall, HOXD9's methylation status and expression levels are significant in cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

## Interactions
HOXD9 is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence its function as a transcription factor. It activates transcription of its own promoter by binding to a specific DNA sequence known as the HOX cross-talk region (HCR). This interaction is mediated by the homeo domain, particularly the amino terminus and helix 1, which are essential for recognizing and activating transcription from the HCR target in vivo (Zappavigna1994Specificity).

HOXD9's function is antagonized by the HOXD8 protein, which can inhibit HOXD9's trans-activation of the HCR target. This inhibition does not require DNA binding and is mediated by the amino terminus/helix 1 region of the HOXD8 homeo domain, suggesting that the inhibitory function is likely mediated by protein-protein interactions (Zappavigna1994Specificity). The amino terminus/helix 1 region of the HOXD9 homeo domain can also mediate direct interactions between HOX proteins in solution, indicating its role in both DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions (Zappavigna1994Specificity).

In gastric cancer, HOXD9 represses the transcription of the long non-coding RNA PAXIP1-AS1 by binding to its promoter region. This interaction is crucial for the regulation of PAXIP1-AS1, which functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer progression (Li2023The).
