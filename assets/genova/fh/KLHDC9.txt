# KLHDC9

## Overview
KLHDC9 is a gene that encodes the protein kelch domain containing 9, which is characterized by the presence of kelch motifs. These motifs are typically involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that KLHDC9 may play a role in various cellular processes through its interactions with other proteins. While the specific biological functions of the KLHDC9 protein remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential regulatory roles in cancer biology have been highlighted in recent studies. The gene's expression and alterations have been associated with significant clinical outcomes in various cancers, including breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, indicating its potential as a biomarker for prognosis and therapeutic targeting (Amgalan2018An; Gao2018Exploration).

## Structure


## Clinical Significance
KLHDC9 has been implicated in various cancers, with alterations in its expression and copy number associated with significant clinical outcomes. In breast cancer, KLHDC9 has been identified as a key regulator gene, despite not being previously recognized as an oncogene. Its amplification and changes in copy number status have been linked to the expression of target genes, suggesting a role in cancer-related pathways such as NOTCH, ERBB, and PPAR signaling. Higher amplification of KLHDC9 is associated with shorter survival times in breast cancer patients, indicating its potential clinical significance in prognosis (Amgalan2018An).

In lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), KLHDC9 is one of the five key methylation-driven genes used in a prognostic risk assessment model. The model effectively stratifies patients into high-risk and low-risk groups based on survival rates, with certain methylated sites of KLHDC9 significantly associated with prognosis. This suggests that KLHDC9 could serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis in LUAD (Gao2018Exploration).

Additionally, KLHDC9 has been identified in the context of Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (EBV+ DLBCL) and urothelial carcinoma, although its specific clinical significance in these conditions requires further investigation (Hong2019MCL1; Yoon2015Integrated).
