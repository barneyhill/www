# SPAG16

## Overview
The SPAG16 gene encodes the sperm-associated antigen 16, a protein that plays a critical role in the motility and structural integrity of sperm flagella. This gene is responsible for producing two main protein isoforms, SPAG16L and SPAG16S, which are integral to the function of cilia and flagella in human cells. SPAG16L, a 71-kDa protein, is essential for the stability of the axoneme, the core structure of cilia and flagella, and interacts with other proteins such as SPAG6 and SPAG17 to facilitate sperm motility (Zhang2007A). SPAG16S, a 35-kDa protein, is involved in the regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis, potentially acting as a transcription factor (NagarkattiGude2011Spag16). Beyond its role in sperm, SPAG16 is expressed in other tissues with motile cilia, indicating its broader significance in cellular processes (Alciaturi2019Distribution).

## Structure
The SPAG16 gene encodes two main protein isoforms, SPAG16L and SPAG16S, which are crucial for sperm motility and spermatogenesis. SPAG16L is a 71-kDa protein, while SPAG16S is a 35-kDa protein (Zhang2007A). Both isoforms contain seven WD-repeat domains, which are semi-conserved 40 amino acid regions ending with tryptophan-aspartate (W-D). These domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions by forming a ß-propeller tertiary structure (NagarkattiGude2011Spag16). 

SPAG16L is expressed in tissues with motile cilia and is essential for the structural integrity of the axoneme in sperm, interacting with proteins such as SPAG6 and SPAG17 (Zhang2008Phosphorylation; Zhang2007A). It undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation by the testis-specific kinase TSSK2, which interacts with the C-terminal WD repeats (Zhang2008Phosphorylation). 

SPAG16S, on the other hand, is testis-specific and localizes to nuclear speckles in male germ cells, suggesting a role in regulating SPAG16L mRNA expression (NagarkattiGude2011Spag16). The presence of splice variants of SPAG16, with molecular masses between 50 kDa and 67 kDa, has been detected in human sperm (Zhang2007A).

## Function
The SPAG16 gene encodes two major protein isoforms, SPAG16L and SPAG16S, which play crucial roles in the structure and function of cilia and flagella in human cells. SPAG16L is a 71-kDa protein that is essential for sperm flagellar motility. It is incorporated into the central apparatus of the sperm tail, interacting with other proteins such as SPAG6 and SPAG17 to form a complex necessary for the stability and function of the axoneme, the structural core of cilia and flagella (Zhang2007A). SPAG16S, a 35-kDa protein, is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm of male germ cells and is involved in regulating gene expression during spermatogenesis. It is hypothesized to function as a transcription factor, influencing the expression of SPAG16L and other testis-specific genes (NagarkattiGude2011Spag16; Zhang2007A).

In healthy human cells, SPAG16 is critical for maintaining the structural integrity of the sperm axoneme, which is vital for sperm motility and male fertility. The gene's products are involved in the assembly and stability of the axonemal central apparatus, ensuring proper sperm movement and function (NagarkattiGude2012Genetic; Zhang2007A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the SPAG16 gene have been linked to several clinical conditions, primarily affecting sperm motility and male fertility. In mice, mutations in SPAG16 can lead to severe sperm motility defects and infertility, despite normal axoneme ultrastructure. These defects are associated with limited activation of dyneins and reduced flagellar response to calcium (Teves2016Mammalian). In humans, a heterozygous mutation in SPAG16 can cause biochemical instability of central apparatus proteins under thermal stress, leading to structural abnormalities in sperm, although fertility may not be directly impaired (Zhang2007A).

SPAG16 mutations have also been implicated in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) or Kartagener Syndrome, although the clinical significance remains inconclusive due to the lack of two mutant alleles in affected individuals (Zhang2007A). Additionally, SPAG16 gene variants, particularly the rs7607479 SNP, have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility, potentially influencing disease progression through the regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) expression (Lin2022Genetic).

In multiple sclerosis (MS), elevated levels of anti-SPAG16 antibodies have been observed, particularly in primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients, suggesting a potential pathological role and association with disease progression (de2015Anti‐SPAG16). These findings highlight the diverse clinical implications of SPAG16 gene alterations.

## Interactions
SPAG16, a protein crucial for sperm motility and flagellar function, interacts with several other proteins, forming part of a complex network essential for axoneme stability and function. SPAG16L, one of the isoforms of SPAG16, interacts with the testis-specific kinase TSSK2. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal WD repeats of SPAG16L, which are crucial for its association with TSSK2, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Zhang2008Phosphorylation).

SPAG16 also interacts with SPAG6 and SPAG17, forming part of the central apparatus of the '9+2' axoneme structure in sperm. These interactions are vital for maintaining the stability and function of the axoneme, impacting sperm motility (Zhang2007Accelerated; Zhang2007A). The interaction between SPAG16 and SPAG6 has been confirmed through yeast two-hybrid screens and co-localization studies, indicating a specific relationship in the axonemal structure (Zhang2002A).

In addition to its role in sperm, SPAG16 is expressed in other tissues with motile cilia, such as the brain and lung, suggesting broader roles in ciliary function and cellular processes (Alciaturi2019Distribution).
