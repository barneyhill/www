# CDV3

## Overview
The CDV3 gene encodes the CDV3 homolog protein, which is involved in various cellular processes, although its precise biological functions are still being elucidated. The CDV3 homolog is not categorized as a kinase, receptor, or transmembrane protein, but it plays a significant role in cellular metabolism and tumor progression. Recent studies have highlighted its involvement in the regulation of the Warburg effect, a metabolic reprogramming observed in cancer cells, particularly in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) (Zhaorigetu2024CircRNA). The CDV3 gene is part of a regulatory network involving circRNA amyloid precursor protein (circAPP) and microRNA-6838-5p, which modulates its expression and impacts tumor growth and metastasis (Zhaorigetu2024CircRNA). Understanding the function and regulation of CDV3 could provide insights into novel therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the CDV3 gene have been implicated in the progression of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The study highlights that CDV3 is overexpressed in GIST tissues compared to normal tissues, contributing to the malignant behavior of these tumors (Zhaorigetu2024CircRNA). This overexpression is part of a regulatory axis involving circRNA amyloid precursor protein (circAPP) and microRNA-6838-5p, where circAPP acts as a miRNA sponge, sequestering miR-6838-5p and thereby modulating CDV3 expression (Zhaorigetu2024CircRNA). The dysregulation of this axis enhances the Warburg effect, a metabolic shift favoring glycolysis, which is a hallmark of cancer metabolism (Zhaorigetu2024CircRNA).

The study also demonstrates that knockdown of circAPP, which leads to decreased CDV3 expression, results in reduced tumor proliferation, increased apoptosis, and decreased markers of the Warburg effect, such as glucose consumption and lactate production (Zhaorigetu2024CircRNA). In vivo experiments further show that reducing CDV3 expression through circAPP knockdown diminishes tumor growth and liver metastasis, indicating its significant role in the clinical progression of GISTs (Zhaorigetu2024CircRNA). These findings suggest that targeting the circAPP-miR-6838-5p-CDV3 axis could offer new therapeutic strategies for managing GISTs.
