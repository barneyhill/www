# FAM124B

## Overview
FAM124B is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 124 member B, which is part of the FAM124-type VOC superfamily. This protein is characterized by a domain structure that includes a conserved extension with a predicted caspase site, suggesting regulation through proteolytic cleavage. FAM124B is primarily localized in the nucleus and is implicated in chromatin remodeling processes through its interactions with chromatin remodelers CHD7 and CHD8. These interactions suggest a role in gene expression regulation and developmental processes, particularly in tissues affected by CHARGE syndrome and neurodevelopmental disorders. The gene is expressed in various tissues, including the brain, heart, and lung, with expression patterns overlapping those of CHD7 and CHD8, indicating its potential involvement in similar molecular pathways (Batsukh2012Identification; Batsukh2024Novel; Kaur2021Bacterial).

## Structure
The FAM124B protein is characterized by a domain approximately 500 amino acids in length, which is part of the FAM124-type VOC superfamily. This domain is coupled with the TRADD-N domain in metazoans and includes a conserved extension with a predicted caspase site, suggesting regulation through proteolytic cleavage (Kaur2021Bacterial). The FAM124 domain is composed of two subdomains with similar secondary structures, specifically a β-α-β-β-β configuration. The C-terminal subdomain aligns with the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily, which typically features two homologous tandem β-α-β-β-β structural units that dimerize to form an incomplete barrel-like structure, coordinating divalent metal ions through conserved residues (Kaur2021Bacterial).

FAM124B has two transcript variants in humans. Transcript variant 1 consists of two exons, resulting in a protein with 455 amino acids, while transcript variant 2 includes an alternate exon with an in-frame stop codon, producing a shorter protein of 272 amino acids (Batsukh2012Identification; Batsukh2024Novel). The specific activity of FAM124B remains unclear, but its association with chromatin-remodeling complexes CHD7 and CHD8 suggests a potential role in modifying chromatin proteins (Kaur2021Bacterial). The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, as shown by subcellular localization studies (Batsukh2024Novel).

## Function
FAM124B is a protein that interacts with CHD7 and CHD8, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation. The protein is primarily localized in the nucleus, suggesting its role in nuclear processes (Batsukh2012Identification). FAM124B interacts directly with CHD8 and indirectly with CHD7, indicating its potential involvement in the same molecular pathways as these proteins (Batsukh2012Identification). The interaction with CHD8 is hypothesized to occur within exon 1 of FAM124B, as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid experiments (Batsukh2012Identification).

FAM124B is expressed in various adult mouse tissues, with notable expression in the lung, heart, and several brain areas, including the cortex and hippocampus. This expression pattern overlaps with that of CHD7 and CHD8, particularly in organs affected by CHARGE syndrome, suggesting a potential role in similar developmental processes (Batsukh2012Identification). During embryonic development, FAM124B is expressed in tissues such as the heart, lung, cochlea, and neural cells, indicating its involvement in developmental and tissue-specific functions (Batsukh2012Identification). While the specific function of FAM124B in healthy human cells is not fully determined, its interactions and expression patterns suggest a role in chromatin remodeling and gene expression regulation (Batsukh2012Identification).

## Clinical Significance
FAM124B has been identified as a novel interaction partner of the chromatin remodelers CHD7 and CHD8, which are implicated in various genetic disorders. Mutations in CHD7 are a major cause of CHARGE syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by multiple malformations, while CHD8 mutations are associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) (Batsukh2012Identification; Batsukh2024Novel). The interaction of FAM124B with these proteins suggests its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of these conditions. 

FAM124B is expressed in several tissues, including the brain, heart, and lung, with its expression pattern overlapping with CHD7 during mouse embryogenesis. This overlap suggests a role in the development of tissues affected by CHARGE syndrome (Batsukh2012Identification; Batsukh2024Novel). The study of FAM124B's interactions and expression patterns provides a basis for understanding its potential clinical significance in these disorders, although its precise biological role remains to be fully elucidated (Batsukh2012Identification). Further research is needed to explore the functional implications of FAM124B in the context of CHARGE syndrome and NDD/ASD (Batsukh2024Novel).

## Interactions
FAM124B is identified as a novel interaction partner of the chromatin remodelers CHD7 and CHD8, which are involved in chromatin remodeling and associated with CHARGE syndrome. The interaction of FAM124B with these proteins was discovered using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) combined with mass spectrometry, and further confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments (Batsukh2012Identification; Batsukh2024Novel). 

FAM124B interacts directly with CHD8, specifically with the CHD8 part containing amino acids 1789-2302, while its interaction with CHD7 is either indirect or occurs outside the tested CHD7 region (Batsukh2012Identification). The interaction with CHD8 is hypothesized to occur within exon 1 of FAM124B, as both transcript variants share this exon (Batsukh2024Novel). 

FAM124B is localized in the nucleus, suggesting that its interaction with CHD7 and CHD8 occurs in this subcellular compartment (Batsukh2012Identification). The expression of FAM124B overlaps with CHD7 and CHD8 in various tissues, both in adult and embryonic stages, which may be relevant to understanding its role in CHARGE syndrome and neurodevelopmental disorders (Batsukh2012Identification).
