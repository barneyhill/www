# ADAMTS2

## Overview
ADAMTS2 is a gene that encodes the protein ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 2, a member of the ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) family. This protein is categorized as a metalloproteinase and plays a critical role in the extracellular matrix by processing procollagen to mature collagen, which is essential for the structural integrity of connective tissues (Hofer2007Tissuespecific; Dubail2010ADAMTS2). Beyond its enzymatic function, ADAMTS2 exhibits anti-angiogenic and anti-tumoral properties, contributing to its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including tissue development, repair, and cancer progression (Bekhouche2015The; Dubail2010ADAMTS2). Mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene are linked to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, highlighting its clinical significance in connective tissue disorders (De2007Abnormal). Additionally, alterations in ADAMTS2 expression have been associated with certain cancers, making it a potential prognostic marker (Jiang2019Overexpression).

## Structure
The ADAMTS2 protein is a member of the ADAMTS family, characterized by a complex multi-domain structure. It includes a signal peptide, a pro-domain, a metalloproteinase catalytic domain, a disintegrin-like domain, and thrombospondin type 1 motifs (TSRs) (Kelwick2015The; PORTER2005The). The metalloproteinase domain features a reprolysin-type zinc-binding motif, HEXXHXXG/N/SXXHD, and a methionine residue within the sequence V/IMA/S, known as the 'Met-turn' (PORTER2005The). The catalytic domain adopts a metzincin architecture with a globular structure, including a five-stranded β-sheet and α-helices forming a hydrophobic pillow under the catalytic Zn2+ (Kelwick2015The).

ADAMTS2 undergoes several post-translational modifications, including glycosylation, C-mannosylation, and O-fucosylation, which affect its secretion, localization, and function (Kelwick2015The). The protein is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme and activated by cleavage, primarily by furin, at specific sites (Bekhouche2015The; Colige2005Domains). The C-terminal domain negatively regulates enzyme activity, while the TSRs act as enhancer regulators (Colige2005Domains). The presence of multiple molecular weight forms, such as 104 kDa and 150 kDa, indicates complex processing and maturation (Colige2005Domains). The protein can also undergo alternative splicing, resulting in isoforms with varying activity (Bekhouche2015The).

## Function
ADAMTS2 is a crucial enzyme involved in the maturation of collagen, specifically by cleaving the N-propeptides of type I, II, and III procollagens. This enzymatic activity is essential for the formation of mature collagen fibrils, which are vital for maintaining the structural integrity of connective tissues (Hofer2007Tissuespecific; Dubail2010ADAMTS2). The enzyme is primarily active in the extracellular matrix, where it contributes to tissue development and repair by facilitating the proper assembly of collagen fibrils (Bekhouche2015The; Leduc2021In).

In addition to its role in collagen processing, ADAMTS2 exhibits anti-angiogenic and anti-tumoral properties. These functions are independent of its catalytic activity and involve interactions with endothelial cells, leading to apoptosis and reduced tumor vascularization (Dubail2010ADAMTS2). The enzyme's anti-angiogenic effects are mediated through mechanisms such as the dephosphorylation of Erk1/2 and MLC, and interactions with nucleolin, a potential receptor (Dubail2010ADAMTS2).

ADAMTS2 is also expressed in monocytes and macrophages, where its expression is induced by glucocorticoids, suggesting a role in inflammation resolution and wound repair (Hofer2007Tissuespecific).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene can lead to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIIC, also known as dermatosparaxis. This condition is characterized by extreme tissue fragility due to the accumulation of abnormal collagen fibers. Patients with this syndrome exhibit symptoms such as skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility, resulting from the impaired processing of procollagen to collagen (Bekhouche2015The; De2007Abnormal).

Alterations in the expression of ADAMTS2 have been implicated in various cancers. In gastric cancer, overexpression of ADAMTS2 is associated with poor clinical outcomes and is considered a potential independent prognostic marker. The gene is overexpressed in both tumor and fibroblast cells within gastric carcinoma tissues, with higher expression levels linked to diffuse-type gastric cancer, which correlates with lower survival rates (Jiang2019Overexpression).

In T/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia (T/My MPAL), dysregulation of ADAMTS2 due to chromosomal rearrangements has been observed. This overexpression is considered a potential molecular marker for monitoring minimal residual disease in this type of leukemia (Tota2014ADAMTS2).

## Interactions
ADAMTS2 interacts with various proteins, primarily in the context of extracellular matrix remodeling. It is known to interact with α2-macroglobulin, which can entrap ADAMTS2 after cleavage, and TIMP3, which can inhibit its activity in the presence of heparin (Bekhouche2015The). Papilin is also reported to inhibit ADAMTS2 by binding both the enzyme and the substrate, potentially due to similar domains in papilin and ADAMTS2 (Bekhouche2015The). 

ADAMTS2 has been identified to interact with several other proteins, including ALB, HPX, DCN, CTSB, DKK3, A2M, CST3, COL6A3, and PRELP (Dennler2023Phylogenetic). These interactions suggest a role in various biological processes beyond collagen processing, potentially involving complex networks of protein-protein interactions. 

The protein also exhibits anti-angiogenic activity, inducing apoptosis in endothelial cells through interactions that are independent of its catalytic activity. Nucleolin has been identified as a potential endothelial cell surface receptor for ADAMTS2, indicating a physical interaction that may contribute to its anti-angiogenic effects (Bekhouche2015The). These interactions highlight the multifaceted roles of ADAMTS2 in cellular processes and its potential involvement in disease mechanisms.
