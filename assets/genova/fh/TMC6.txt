# TMC6

## Overview
TMC6, or transmembrane channel-like 6, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the transmembrane channel-like family, which is characterized by its involvement in various cellular processes, particularly in sensory neurons and immune cells. The TMC6 protein is a transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in modulating neuronal excitability and thermal sensation, primarily through its interaction with M channels in dorsal root ganglion neurons. It is also involved in immune function, forming a heterodimeric complex with TMC8, which is crucial for protein stability and function in lymphocytes. Mutations in the TMC6 gene have been linked to epidermodysplasia verruciformis, a condition that increases susceptibility to certain viral infections and skin cancers, as well as influencing the risk of chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients and potentially affecting cervical cancer susceptibility (Wu2020Expression; Wang2021Identification; Castro2011Contribution; An2024The).

## Structure
The TMC6 protein is characterized by a complex structure that includes a large extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) and an intracellular C-terminal domain (CTD), connected by ten transmembrane helices. The NTD spans from Met 1 to Arg 203 and contains disordered regions, while the CTD spans from Gly 740 to Pro 810 (Zhang2024TMC6). Notably, the eighth transmembrane helix (TM8) exhibits a 180-degree bend across the lipid bilayer, positioning the NTD and CTD on opposite sides of the biomembrane (Zhang2024TMC6). 

The interaction between TMC6 and Gαq is crucial for its function, with the Ser 780 - Pro 810 region of TMC6 identified as the anchoring interface for Gαq. This interaction is essential for the protein's role in sensing noxious heat via Gαq signaling (Zhang2024TMC6). TMC6 is also part of a heterotrimeric complex with TMC8 and CIB1, which is important for protein stability and function, particularly in lymphocytes (Wu2020Expression). 

The protein is associated with post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, and has splice variant isoforms, which may influence its function and interactions (An2024The).

## Function
The TMC6 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is part of a family of homologous proteins involved in various cellular processes. In primary sensory neurons, particularly in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), TMC6 plays a crucial role in modulating M channels, which are composed of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits. These channels are essential for regulating neuronal excitability and membrane potential. TMC6 is thought to inhibit M currents, as its deletion leads to increased M current amplitude and elevated levels of free cytoplasmic zinc, which activates these channels (An2024The).

TMC6 is also involved in thermal sensation and pain perception. It is predominantly expressed in small to medium-sized DRG neurons, which are responsible for nociception, including heat transmission. The deletion of TMC6 results in a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and reduced neuronal excitability, leading to decreased thermal sensitivity (An2024The).

In lymphocytes, TMC6 forms a heterodimeric complex with TMC8, which is crucial for the stability and function of these proteins. This complex is involved in immune function, potentially preventing conditions like epidermodysplasia verruciformis by regulating protein stability and function (Wu2020Expression).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the TMC6 gene are associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), a rare genetic disorder that increases susceptibility to human beta papillomavirus infections and predisposes individuals to non-melanoma skin cancers. The majority of EV cases are linked to biallelic null variants in TMC6, TMC8, and CIB1. In particular, novel homozygous variants in TMC6 have been identified, which lead to exon skipping and premature termination, contributing to the pathogenesis of EV (Wang2021Identification).

TMC6 is also implicated in chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis patients. Variants in TMC6, such as the derived allele at rs34712518, are associated with an earlier age of onset for chronic P. aeruginosa infection and a decrease in lung function, suggesting that TMC6 may modify the risk and progression of this infection (Emond2015Correction:; Emond2015Exome).

Additionally, TMC6 variants have been studied in the context of cervical cancer susceptibility. Research involving Swedish cohorts has investigated the contribution of TMC6 and TMC8 gene variants to cervical cancer risk, highlighting the potential role of these genes in cancer susceptibility (Castro2011Contribution).

## Interactions
TMC6, also known as transmembrane channel-like 6, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function. TMC6 forms a heterodimeric complex with TMC8, and together they interact with calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1) to form a heterotrimeric complex. This interaction is important for the stability and function of each component, as TMC6 and TMC8 protect CIB1 from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, while CIB1 stabilizes TMC6 and TMC8 (Wu2020Expression).

In the context of sensory neurons, TMC6 interacts with Gαq, a protein involved in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. This interaction is mediated through the C-terminal region of TMC6, specifically the Ser780-Pro810 region, which serves as the anchoring interface for Gαq. This interaction is crucial for TMC6's role in sensing noxious heat and mediating intracellular calcium release via the Gαq-PLC-IP3R-Ca2+ signaling pathway (Zhang2024TMC6).

TMC6 also interacts with M channels, composed of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits, in dorsal root ganglion neurons. This interaction modulates neuronal excitability and thermal sensation by influencing zinc ion concentrations, which can activate M channels (An2024The).
