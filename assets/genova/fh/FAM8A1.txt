# FAM8A1

## Overview
FAM8A1 is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 8 member A1. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane protein, which suggests its involvement in cellular processes that require membrane localization. The FAM8A1 gene is expressed in various tissues, indicating a potentially broad functional role in human physiology. Although the precise biological functions of the FAM8A1 protein are not fully elucidated, it is implicated in several cellular pathways and may play a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Further research is needed to fully understand the interactions and clinical significance of this gene and its encoded protein.
