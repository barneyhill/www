# GATAD2B

## Overview
GATAD2B is a gene that encodes the GATA zinc finger domain containing 2B protein, also known as p66β, which is a critical component of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Histone Deacetylase (NuRD) complex. This protein plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation, processes essential for regulating gene expression, maintaining genome stability, and facilitating DNA repair (Liu2024GATAD2B; Abad2024Gatad2b). GATAD2B is particularly significant in neurodevelopment, influencing transcriptional programs necessary for brain development and cognitive function (Abad2024Gatad2b). Mutations in the GATAD2B gene are associated with GATAD2B-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (GAND), characterized by intellectual disability and developmental delay, highlighting the gene's crucial role in normal neurodevelopmental processes (Vera2020Clinical; Abad2024Gatad2b).

## Function
The GATAD2B gene encodes a protein that is a critical component of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Histone Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which is essential for chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation. These processes are crucial for regulating gene expression, maintaining genome stability, and facilitating DNA repair (Liu2024GATAD2B; Abad2024Gatad2b). The GATAD2B protein, also known as p66β, is involved in forming chromatin boundaries at double-strand breaks, which is important for the DNA damage response. This function helps prevent excessive chromatin relaxation and ensures proper DNA repair through homologous recombination (Liu2024GATAD2B).

In healthy human cells, GATAD2B plays a significant role in neurodevelopment, particularly in cortical patterning and neuron development. It is involved in regulating transcriptional programs necessary for organizing neuronal and non-neuronal cell types during brain development (Abad2024Gatad2b). The protein is primarily active in the nucleus, where it influences transcriptional repression and chromatin structure (Abad2024Gatad2b). GATAD2B's activity is crucial for normal cognitive function and neurodevelopmental processes, as evidenced by its high expression during embryonic brain development (Abad2024Gatad2b).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the GATAD2B gene are associated with GATAD2B-associated neurodevelopmental disorder (GAND), a condition characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, and distinct facial features. This disorder is linked to loss-of-function mutations, which often result in haploinsufficiency of the gene. Patients with GAND typically exhibit severe intellectual disability, childhood hypotonia, impaired speech, and dysmorphic features such as a broad forehead, deeply set eyes, and a pointed chin (Vera2020Clinical; Abad2024Gatad2b).

The GATAD2B gene encodes a subunit of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Histone Deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which is crucial for transcriptional regulation during neurodevelopment. Mutations in GATAD2B can disrupt chromatin remodeling, leading to abnormal gene expression and cortical development, as evidenced by studies in both human patients and animal models (Willemsen2013GATAD2Blossoffunction; Abad2024Gatad2b).

In addition to GAND, GATAD2B mutations have been implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders, including intellectual disability autosomal dominant type 18 (MRD18), which is characterized by similar cognitive and physical symptoms (Trubnykova2019GATAD2B). The gene's role in chromatin modification and transcriptional repression underscores its importance in maintaining normal neurodevelopmental processes (Nikam2021Tissuespecific).

## Interactions
GATAD2B is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, where it plays a crucial role in mediating interactions with other proteins. It interacts with CHD4, a core component of the NuRD complex, through its C-terminal region, specifically residues 276-473, which includes a GATA-type zinc finger and a predicted coiled coil (Torrado2017Refinement; Sharifi2021Unique). This interaction is essential for connecting CHD4 to the HDAC-MTA-RBBP unit within the complex (Torrado2017Refinement).

GATAD2B also interacts with MBD3 through a short coiled-coil structure, similar to the interaction between MBD2 and GATAD2A (Torrado2017Refinement). The stoichiometry of the NuRD complex suggests a 2:1:1 ratio for HDAC:MBD:GATAD2, supported by high-resolution NMR structure data (Torrado2017Refinement).

In the context of DNA damage response, GATAD2B, along with MBD3, binds to R-loops in a PARP1-dependent manner, facilitating the recruitment of the NuRD complex to double-strand breaks (DSBs) (Liu2024GATAD2B). This interaction is crucial for chromatin boundary formation at DSBs, preventing chromatin hyper-relaxation and aiding in DNA repair processes (Liu2024GATAD2B). GATAD2B's interactions with CHD4 and CDK2AP1 are mediated by an aggregation-prone region within its C-terminal segment, which is critical for maintaining protein solubility and complex stability (Sharifi2021Unique).
