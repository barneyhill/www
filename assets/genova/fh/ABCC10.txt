# ABCC10

## Overview
The ABCC10 gene encodes the ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 10 protein, also known as multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7), which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. This protein is categorized as a transmembrane transporter and plays a crucial role in the cellular efflux of various substrates, including drugs and endogenous compounds. MRP7 is characterized by its structural composition, which includes three membrane-spanning domains and two nucleotide-binding domains, facilitating its function as a lipophilic anion transporter (Hopper2001Analysis; Kruh2006ABCC10). The protein is involved in phase III detoxification processes and is expressed in multiple tissues, contributing to its role in drug resistance and cellular homeostasis (Chen2003Characterization; Iqbal2022ATPBinding). ABCC10's clinical significance is underscored by its involvement in drug resistance mechanisms in cancer and its association with kidney tubular dysfunction in patients treated with specific medications (Pushpakom2011Genetic; Domanitskaya2014Abcc10).

## Structure
The ABCC10 gene encodes the multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7), a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. MRP7 is characterized by a structural architecture similar to other MRP subfamily members, such as MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP6, with three membrane-spanning domains and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) (Hopper2001Analysis; Kruh2006ABCC10). The primary structure of MRP7 consists of 1492 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 158 kDa (Hopper2001Analysis). 

The secondary structure includes several transmembrane helices arranged in a 5-1-6-1-6 configuration (Hopper2001Analysis). The tertiary structure involves the folding of these helices and NBDs into a functional transporter, with the transmembrane domains forming the substrate binding pocket responsible for drug transport (Wang2021Insights). 

MRP7 lacks a conserved N-linked glycosylation site at the N-terminus, which is a notable difference from other MRP transporters (Hopper2001Analysis). A splice variant of MRP7 has been identified, which is truncated at its N terminus and includes a 15-amino acid deletion between the second membrane-spanning domain and the second nucleotide-binding domain (Kruh2006ABCC10).

## Function
ABCC10, also known as multidrug resistance protein 7 (MRP7), is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, specifically the C subfamily. It functions primarily as a lipophilic anion transporter involved in phase III detoxification processes, facilitating the cellular extrusion of compounds that have been metabolized by the addition of bulky anionic moieties (Chen2003Characterization). ABCC10 is capable of transporting specific glucuronate and glutathione conjugates, such as 17β-estradiol-(17-β-D-glucuronide) (E2 17βG), in a MgATP-dependent manner, indicating its role as a lipophilic anion pump (Chen2003Characterization).

In liver cells, ABCC10 is involved in the synthesis and efflux of hexosylceramides (HexCer), which are major circulating sphingolipids and precursors for complex glycosphingolipids. The protein modulates HexCer synthesis and their transport to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), suggesting a role in maintaining normal levels of HexCer in cells (Iqbal2022ATPBinding). ABCC10 is expressed in various tissues and is found in both plasma membranes and intracellular compartments, contributing to its multifunctional role in cellular processes (Iqbal2022ATPBinding).

## Clinical Significance
The ABCC10 gene, also known as ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 10, is implicated in various clinical conditions due to its role in drug transport and resistance. Genetic variants of ABCC10 have been associated with kidney tubular dysfunction (KTD) in patients treated with the antiretroviral drug tenofovir (TFV). Specifically, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs9349256 and rs2125739, are linked to an increased risk of KTD, characterized by urine phosphorus wasting and b2-microglobulinuria, markers of tubular dysfunction (Pushpakom2011Genetic).

In cancer, ABCC10 is involved in drug resistance mechanisms. In breast cancer, ABCC10 expression is higher in certain subtypes, such as HER2-positive and ER-positive tumors, and its absence in knockout models leads to increased sensitivity to the chemotherapy drug docetaxel, suggesting a role in chemotherapeutic resistance (Domanitskaya2014Abcc10). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ABCC10 contributes to acquired resistance to gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, by actively effluxing the drug, thereby reducing its intracellular accumulation and effectiveness (Zhao2018ABCC10). These findings highlight ABCC10's potential as a therapeutic target in managing drug resistance.
