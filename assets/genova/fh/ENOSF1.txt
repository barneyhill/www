# ENOSF1

## Overview
ENOSF1 (enolase superfamily member 1) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the enolase superfamily, which is involved in various metabolic pathways, including glycolysis. The protein encoded by ENOSF1 plays a significant role in cellular metabolism, particularly in the regulation of folate metabolism and the expression of thymidylate synthase (TYMS), an enzyme critical for DNA synthesis. ENOSF1 is known for producing an antisense transcript that modulates TYMS mRNA levels, thereby influencing DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation (Kelemen2018rs495139). This regulatory function is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and has implications in cancer progression and treatment response. Variants of the ENOSF1 gene have been associated with chemotherapy response and toxicity, particularly in treatments involving fluoropyrimidines, underscoring its importance in pharmacogenomics and as a potential biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes (Meulendijks2016Pharmacogenetic; Arjmandi2023Clinical).

## Function
ENOSF1 (enolase superfamily member 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular metabolism, particularly in the regulation of folate metabolism and thymidylate synthase (TYMS) expression. The protein is part of the enolase superfamily, which includes enzymes that catalyze reactions in glycolysis and other metabolic pathways. ENOSF1 is known to produce an antisense transcript that downregulates TYMS, a key enzyme in DNA synthesis, by influencing its mRNA expression levels (Kelemen2018rs495139). This regulation is crucial for maintaining balanced DNA synthesis, which is important for both normal cellular function and tumor suppression (Kelemen2018rs495139).

ENOSF1 is active in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, where it contributes to energy production and metabolic homeostasis. It is implicated in cell proliferation and survival, potentially influencing cancer progression due to its role in regulating TYMS (Hamzic2020Evaluating). The gene's expression and its variants have been associated with chemotherapy response and toxicity, particularly in treatments involving 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), highlighting its significance in pharmacogenomics (Arjmandi2023Clinical). The ENOSF1 c.742-227G>A variant, for instance, is linked to capecitabine-induced toxicity, affecting overall survival and gastrointestinal toxicities (Hamzic2020Evaluating).

## Clinical Significance
The ENOSF1 gene has been implicated in various clinical conditions, particularly in the context of cancer treatment and prognosis. Variants in ENOSF1, such as rs2612091, have been associated with chemotherapy response and toxicity in gastric cancer patients. The rs2612091 G/G genotype is linked to shorter overall survival and increased toxicity, including hand-foot syndrome, when treated with fluoropyrimidines like 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Meulendijks2016Pharmacogenetic; Arjmandi2023Clinical). This variant is also associated with gastrointestinal toxicity, suggesting a role in the pharmacodynamics of fluoropyrimidines (Meulendijks2016Pharmacogenetic).

ENOSF1 is thought to regulate thymidylate synthase (TYMS) expression, which is crucial for DNA replication and repair. This regulation may influence the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs, impacting treatment response and survival outcomes (Meulendijks2016Pharmacogenetic). The gene's expression has been linked to cancer prognosis, with increased expression associated with decreased survival in certain cancers, such as colon cancer (Finckbeiner2011Transient). These findings highlight the potential of ENOSF1 variants as biomarkers for predicting chemotherapy response and survival in cancer patients.
