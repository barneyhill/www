# CA4

## Overview
The CA4 gene encodes carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA IV), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane-associated enzyme that plays a pivotal role in maintaining acid-base homeostasis and facilitating carbon dioxide transport across various tissues. As a member of the carbonic anhydrase family, CA IV catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, a reaction critical for physiological processes such as respiration, renal bicarbonate reabsorption, and pH regulation (Schneider2013GPIanchored; Waheed2015Carbonic). The enzyme is characterized by its conserved histidine residues and zinc co-factor, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Imtaiyaz2013Structure). CA IV is expressed in several tissues, including the kidneys, lungs, brain, and gastrointestinal tract, where it contributes to bicarbonate transport and extracellular buffering (Parkkila2000An; Waheed2015Carbonic). The interaction of CA IV with the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBC1 highlights its role in enhancing bicarbonate transport efficiency, underscoring its importance in cellular and systemic homeostasis (Alvarez2003Direct).

## Structure
Carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4) is a membrane-bound isozyme anchored to plasma membrane surfaces by a phosphatidylinositol glycan linkage. The primary structure of CA4 consists of a sequence length ranging from 260 to 459 amino acid residues, with a highly conserved sequence and three-dimensional structure (Imtaiyaz2013Structure). The secondary structure of CA4 includes approximately 15% alpha-helices and 29% beta-sheets, similar to other carbonic anhydrases (Imtaiyaz2013Structure).

The active site of CA4 contains conserved histidine residues (His94, His96, and His119) that coordinate with a Zn2+ co-factor, essential for its catalytic activity (Imtaiyaz2013Structure). CA4 is stabilized by disulfide linkages, specifically between Cys23 and Cys203, and an additional disulfide linkage (Cys6-Cys11) that stabilizes the conformation of the N-terminal domain and active site loop (Supuran2002Carbonic; Imtaiyaz2013Structure).

CA4's structure includes a topological extracellular domain, a helical transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The deletion of C-terminal residues in engineered CA4 makes it soluble, retaining the same catalytic properties as the membrane-associated enzyme, except for the absence of the GPI tail, which anchors CA4 to the membrane (Imtaiyaz2013Structure).

## Function
Carbonic anhydrase IV (CA IV), encoded by the CA4 gene, is a membrane-associated enzyme that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in healthy human cells. It catalyzes the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, a reaction essential for maintaining acid-base balance and facilitating CO2 transport (Waheed2015Carbonic). CA IV is anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage, allowing it to function at the cell surface (Schneider2013GPIanchored).

In the kidneys, CA IV is involved in bicarbonate transport and pH regulation, working in conjunction with the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBC1 to enhance transport efficiency (Waheed2015Carbonic). It is expressed on the apical brush border membrane of proximal tubular cells, facilitating bicarbonate reabsorption and contributing to acid-base homeostasis (Parkkila2000An).

In the lungs, CA IV aids in the dehydration of plasma bicarbonate to CO2, supporting efficient respiration (Waheed2015Carbonic). In the brain, it is expressed on cerebral capillaries and contributes to extracellular buffering, which is vital for neuronal function (Waheed2015Carbonic). CA IV also plays a role in the gastrointestinal tract, where it is involved in water and salt resorption (Waheed2015Carbonic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or altered expression of the CA4 gene, which encodes carbonic anhydrase 4, have been implicated in various diseases. In the context of thyroid cancer, CA4 has been identified as a potential biomarker for distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid nodules. A study found that a loss of CA4 immunoreactivity is associated with malignancy, suggesting its role in thyroid cancer diagnosis (Davidov2014Carbonic).

Alterations in CA4 expression have also been linked to plant disease resistance. In Arabidopsis, CA4, along with CA1, modulates disease resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. The ca1ca4 double mutant exhibits enhanced resistance, indicating that CA4 may negatively regulate certain defense responses, possibly through salicylic acid-mediated pathways (Zhou2020Carbonic).

While the context does not provide specific information on human diseases directly caused by CA4 mutations, it is known from other sources that such mutations can lead to conditions like retinitis pigmentosa and glaucoma, due to disruptions in normal acid-base balance and fluid transport in tissues. However, these specific conditions are not detailed in the provided context.

## Interactions
Carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4) is known to participate in interactions with other proteins, particularly in the context of bicarbonate transport. CA4, also referred to as carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV), interacts with the human NBC1 sodium/bicarbonate co-transporter (NBC1b). This interaction occurs specifically at the fourth extracellular loop (EC4) of NBC1, and is crucial for the full activity of NBC1. The interaction was demonstrated through coimmunoprecipitations and GST pull-down assays, which showed that CAIV binds to NBC1b, enhancing its transport activity. The G767T mutation in NBC1 disrupts this interaction, indicating the importance of the amino acids 766-768 in NBC1 for CAIV binding (Alvarez2003Direct).

CAIV is part of a bicarbonate transport metabolon, a complex that facilitates bicarbonate transport by localizing CAIV close to the NBC1 transport site. This interaction is proposed to enhance the rate of bicarbonate transport by NBC1, particularly during cellular HCO3- influx and efflux (Alvarez2003Direct). The interaction between CAIV and NBC1b is not disrupted by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide, suggesting that the inhibitor affects CAIV's catalytic activity rather than its interaction with NBC1b (Alvarez2003Direct).
