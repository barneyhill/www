# HYAL1

## Overview
HYAL1 is a gene that encodes the enzyme hyaluronidase 1, a member of the hyaluronidase family of enzymes. This enzyme is primarily involved in the degradation of hyaluronan (HA), a major component of the extracellular matrix, through its endolytic activity. Hyaluronidase 1 is categorized as a lysosomal enzyme, functioning optimally at acidic pH levels to break down HA into smaller oligosaccharides, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including tissue remodeling, cell migration, and proliferation (Joy2018Metabolism). The HYAL1 gene is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms with varying enzymatic activities (Lokeshwar2002Regulation). Alterations in HYAL1 expression and function have been implicated in several pathological conditions, including mucopolysaccharidosis type IX and various cancers, highlighting its clinical significance as both a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target (Yoffou2011Subtype; TriggsRaine2015Biology).

## Structure
The HYAL1 protein is composed of 435 amino acids and features a two-domain architecture. The primary structure includes a catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain, connected by a flexible peptide linker (Jedrzejas2005Structures). The catalytic domain adopts a (β/α)8 TIM barrel fold, which is crucial for substrate binding and enzymatic activity (Jedrzejas2005Structures). This domain contains conserved residues such as Glu131, which is essential for catalysis, and other residues like Asp129, Tyr202, Tyr247, and Trp321 that are involved in substrate positioning (Jedrzejas2005Structures; Lokeshwar2002Regulation).

The C-terminal domain of HYAL1 is distinct and varies among hyaluronidases, suggesting unique functions. It includes a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by a helix (Jedrzejas2005Structures). The C-terminal domain also contains six cysteine residues that may form disulfide bridges, contributing to the protein's stability (Hofinger2007Recombinant).

HYAL1 undergoes alternative mRNA splicing, resulting in multiple splice variants with different lengths and enzymatic activities. Some variants lack a critical 30-amino acid sequence necessary for full enzymatic function (Lokeshwar2002Regulation). The protein is also subject to post-translational modifications, such as N-glycosylation, which affects its molecular mass and activity (Hofinger2007Recombinant).

## Function
HYAL1, or hyaluronidase 1, is a secreted enzyme that plays a critical role in the catabolism of hyaluronan (HA) within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of somatic tissues. It is primarily active at an acidic pH, functioning within lysosomes to degrade HA into smaller sugar units, which are then extruded into the cytoplasm for various cellular reactions (Joy2018Metabolism). HYAL1 operates through an endolytic mechanism, working in conjunction with other enzymes such as β-glucuronidase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase to break down HA into tetrasaccharides and eventually into individual sugars (Joy2018Metabolism).

The enzyme is involved in maintaining tissue homeostasis and morphogenesis by regulating the turnover and recycling of HA, impacting biological processes like cell migration, proliferation, and tissue remodeling (Joy2018Metabolism). HYAL1's activity is crucial for the structural integrity of tissues and the modulation of the extracellular environment, contributing to processes such as wound healing and angiogenesis (Garantziotis2019Hyaluronan). Its role in HA degradation also influences immune responses and has been implicated in pathological conditions, including cancer and mucopolysaccharidosis type IX (Garantziotis2019Hyaluronan).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the HYAL1 gene are associated with several clinical conditions. HYAL1 deficiency is linked to mucopolysaccharidosis IX, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by symptoms such as mild short stature, facial dysmorphism, and multiple periarticular soft tissue masses. This condition is marked by elevated serum hyaluronan (HA) levels and a deficiency of acid pH optimum hyaluronidase activity. Specific genetic mutations associated with this deficiency include a 1361del37ins14 mutation and a c.G1412A (p.Glu268Lys) mutation, which result in a lack of detectable HYAL1 activity (TriggsRaine2015Biology).

In the context of cancer, HYAL1 expression is notably elevated in certain subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), particularly in clear cell and mucinous subtypes. This elevated expression is inversely correlated with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression, suggesting a potential role for HYAL1 as a biomarker or therapeutic target in these cancer subtypes. The enzyme's activity is associated with tumor progression and metastasis in various cancers, including bladder, prostate, and head and neck cancers (Yoffou2011Subtype). In ovarian cancer, HYAL1 expression is slightly reduced in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues, with a fold change of 0.69 (Riecks2022The).

## Interactions
HYAL1, a human hyaluronidase enzyme, is involved in various interactions that influence its activity and function. The enzyme's activity can be modulated by interactions with hyaluronic acid-presenting nanoparticles (HA-NP), which inhibit HYAL1 by transforming its substrate into an efficient inhibitor. This interaction is facilitated by the high local concentration of hyaluronic acid on the nanoparticle surface, which binds strongly to HYAL1, as confirmed by surface plasmon resonance analysis (Duan2020Hyaluronic‐Acid‐Presenting).

HYAL1 also interacts with polysaccharides through hydrogen bonds at its binding center. Specific residues such as Asp129, Glu131, and Trp321 are involved in these interactions, which are crucial for the enzyme's function. The binding affinities of various polysaccharide complexes with HYAL1 are stronger than those of individual disaccharides, indicating the importance of these interactions in stabilizing the enzyme-substrate complex (Krzemińska2022Influence).

In cancer research, HYAL1's expression and activity have been linked to cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The enzyme's expression can influence the levels of cell cycle regulators like cdc25c, cyclin B1, and cdc2/p34, affecting cell proliferation and apoptosis in cancer cells (Lokeshwar2005HYAL1). However, specific physical interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed in the available context.
