# CELF2

## Overview
CELF2, or CUGBP Elav-like family member 2, is a gene that encodes an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of various RNA processing events, including alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and translation. The CELF2 protein is characterized by its three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which enable it to bind GU-rich RNA sequences and influence pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA decay (Wang2015Antagonistic). As a member of the CELF protein family, CELF2 plays a crucial role in cellular homeostasis and response to environmental stimuli by modulating RNA metabolism. Its activity is implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression and cardiovascular disorders, highlighting its significance in maintaining cellular function and its potential as a therapeutic target (Dasgupta2011The; Yeung2019CELF2).

## Structure
CELF2, a member of the CELF (CUGBP Elav-like family) proteins, is involved in RNA binding and regulation of alternative splicing. The protein contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), which are crucial for its primary structure. These RRMs are responsible for binding to GU-rich RNA sequences, playing a significant role in the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA decay (Wang2015Antagonistic).

The secondary structure of CELF2 includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets within these RRMs, which facilitate its interaction with RNA. The tertiary structure involves the folding of these motifs, allowing CELF2 to effectively bind and regulate its RNA targets. Although specific details on the quaternary structure of CELF2 are not provided, the protein's function is influenced by its ability to interact with other RNA-binding proteins, such as MBNL, in a competitive manner (Wang2015Antagonistic).

CELF2 may undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which can affect its function and localization within the cell. The existence of multiple splice variant isoforms of CELF2 suggests that these variants may have distinct roles in cellular processes, contributing to the protein's functional diversity (Wang2015Antagonistic).

## Function
CELF2 (CUGBP Elav-like family member 2) is an RNA-binding protein that plays a significant role in various RNA processing events in human cells. In the nucleus, CELF2 is involved in alternative splicing by interacting with the U2 snRNP complex, enhancing complex A formation on certain exons, and inhibiting exon inclusion by displacing U2AF, which is crucial for U2 snRNP assembly at the branch site (Dasgupta2011The). CELF2 also regulates RNA editing, particularly C to U editing of apolipoprotein B (APOB) mRNA, by forming a complex with APOBEC-1 and ACF, thereby inhibiting editing (Dasgupta2011The).

In the cytoplasm, CELF2 binds to A/U-rich sequences in the 3' UTR of certain mRNAs, such as COX-2, stabilizing them while inhibiting their translation. This stabilization is crucial for processes like radiation response, as COX-2 provides protective effects against ionizing radiation (Dasgupta2011The; Barreau2006Mammalian). CELF2 also regulates mRNA stability and translation of other transcripts, such as MCL1, an anti-apoptotic factor (Dasgupta2011The).

CELF2 is also a key regulator of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in human cells. It competes with 3' end processing factors, such as CFI and CstF, for binding to RNA substrates, influencing the use of polyadenylation sites and affecting mRNA stability, translation, and localization (Chatrikhi2019RNA). CELF2's activity in APA is part of a broader program of cellular regulation, impacting mRNA and protein expression in response to cellular signals (Chatrikhi2019RNA).

## Clinical Significance
CELF2 (CUGBP Elav-like family member 2) is implicated in various diseases due to its role in RNA processing and regulation. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), CELF2 is frequently dysregulated, with its loss leading to enhanced self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells towards myeloid cells, accelerating leukemia development. The loss of CELF2 stabilizes FAT10 mRNA, promoting the activation of the AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is associated with increased cell proliferation and AML progression (Guo2024Loss).

CELF2 expression is also downregulated in several cancers, including ovarian, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In pancreatic cancer, low CELF2 levels are linked to increased tumor proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. CELF2 affects the alternative splicing of the CD44 gene, influencing tumorigenesis and the ERAD pathway, which impacts apoptosis and cell stemness (Lai2022N6-methyladenosine-mediated). In NSCLC, CELF2 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting the PREX2-PTEN interaction, crucial for the PTEN/PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby reducing tumor growth (Yeung2019CELF2).

CELF2 is also associated with genetic disorders affecting the heart, such as Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD6) and partial monosomy 10p, although its direct role in these conditions remains to be fully elucidated (Dasgupta2011The).

## Interactions
CELF2, an RNA-binding protein, participates in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids, influencing multiple cellular processes. In colorectal cancer cells, CELF2 binds to AU-rich sequences in the 3' untranslated regions of autophagy-related mRNAs, such as Beclin-1 (BECN1), ATG5, and ATG12, enhancing their stability and promoting autophagy (New2019Pleotropic). In non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), CELF2 interacts with PREX2, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, reducing its association with PTEN, a tumor suppressor. This interaction enhances PTEN activity, leading to decreased PI3-K/Akt signaling and reduced cell proliferation (Yeung2019CELF2).

In breast cancer cells, CELF2 interacts with NFATc1, a protein involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth. Overexpression of CELF2 reduces NFATc1 levels, inhibiting cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis (Zhou2021RNA‑binding). CELF2 also binds to the long non-coding RNA MRVI1-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma, stabilizing SKA1 mRNA and promoting cancer progression (Tuo2023Hypoxiainduced). These interactions highlight CELF2's role in regulating mRNA stability and protein interactions, impacting cancer progression and cellular homeostasis.
