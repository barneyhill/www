# TINCR

## Overview
TINCR, or Terminal Differentiation-Induced Non-Coding RNA, is a gene that encodes a ubiquitin-like microprotein known as TINCR ubiquitin domain containing (TUBL). Initially identified as a long non-coding RNA, TINCR has been recognized for its significant role in epithelial differentiation and skin homeostasis. The TINCR protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like fold domain, which suggests its involvement in protein interactions, potentially acting as a recognition module for phospholipids, negatively-charged protein regions, or nucleic acids (MorgadoPalacin2023The). Functionally, TINCR is crucial for keratinocyte proliferation and wound healing, and it interacts with key proteins such as CDC42 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and epithelial cell polarity (Boix2022pTINCR). Additionally, TINCR is a direct target of the P53 tumor suppressor gene, indicating its role in the DNA damage response and genomic integrity maintenance (MorgadoPalacin2023The). Beyond its physiological roles, TINCR is implicated in various cancers, acting as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the cancer type, and influencing cancer progression through interactions with signaling pathways like Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK (GhafouriFard2020TINCR:).

## Structure
The TINCR protein, encoded by the TINCR gene, has been structurally characterized to reveal a ubiquitin-like (UBL) fold domain. This domain consists of four β-strands forming a single β-sheet and one α-helix (MorgadoPalacin2023The). Notably, TINCR lacks the characteristic C-terminal di-Glycine motif required for covalent protein conjugation, which is typical in other ubiquitin-like proteins, classifying it as a Type II UBL (Boix2022pTINCR). A prominent feature of TINCR is a 15-residue long, highly conserved, positively charged N-terminal extension, referred to as the 'cap,' which is visible only in one protomer of the dimeric structure (MorgadoPalacin2023The).

The tertiary structure of TINCR was determined through X-ray diffraction at a resolution of 2.12 Å, revealing two protomers forming a dimer in the asymmetric unit, with an α-helical cap visible in one protomer (MorgadoPalacin2023The). The protein's structure has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 7MRJ (MorgadoPalacin2023The). TINCR's structure suggests a role in protein interactions, potentially acting as a recognition module for phospholipids, negatively-charged protein regions, or nucleic acids (MorgadoPalacin2023The).

## Function
The TINCR gene, initially identified as a long non-coding RNA, encodes a ubiquitin-like microprotein that plays a significant role in epithelial differentiation and skin homeostasis. In healthy human cells, TINCR is involved in keratinocyte proliferation and wound healing by promoting cell cycle progression. The protein encoded by TINCR, known as TUBL, is crucial for maintaining skin integrity and facilitating wound healing through its role in keratinocyte proliferation (Nita2021A).

TINCR is also implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and epithelial cell polarity through its interaction with CDC42, a Rho-GTPase. This interaction enhances the SUMOylation and activation of CDC42, triggering a pro-differentiation cascade essential for maintaining epithelial cell identity and differentiation (Boix2022pTINCR).

Additionally, TINCR is a direct target of the P53 tumor suppressor gene and is upregulated in response to UV-induced DNA damage. This suggests a role in the DNA damage response and in maintaining genomic integrity in the skin (MorgadoPalacin2023The). TINCR's involvement in these processes highlights its importance in skin health and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Clinical Significance
The TINCR gene plays a significant role in various cancers, with its expression levels and mutations impacting disease progression and patient outcomes. In breast cancer, TINCR is upregulated, promoting cell proliferation and metastasis, and is associated with poor prognosis. It acts as an oncogene by stabilizing OAS1 mRNA through interaction with STAU1, influencing cell proliferation and migration (Lu2021The). In contrast, TINCR functions as a tumor suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Loss of TINCR expression in SCC is linked to aggressive tumor characteristics and poor outcomes. Mutations and deletions in TINCR are prevalent in SCC, and its reexpression can impair tumor growth (MorgadoPalacin2023The).

TINCR's expression varies across different cancer types, being upregulated in gastric, esophageal, bladder, and breast cancers, while downregulated in glioma, retinoblastoma, and prostate cancer. These expression changes correlate with clinical outcomes, influencing survival rates and cancer progression (GhafouriFard2020TINCR:). TINCR also interacts with various signaling pathways, such as Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK, affecting cancer cell behavior (GhafouriFard2020TINCR:; Sharma2020Long).

## Interactions
TINCR, a long non-coding RNA, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that influence cancer progression and cellular differentiation. In hepatocellular carcinoma, TINCR interacts with T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), inhibiting its activity and maintaining the phosphorylation of STAT3, which promotes tumor aggressiveness (Tang2021Long). This interaction is crucial for the regulation of STAT3 signaling pathways, affecting cell growth, apoptosis, migration, and invasion (Tang2021Long).

In breast cancer, TINCR is part of a positive-feedback loop involving STAT3 and EGFR. It acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) that sponges miR-503-5p, thereby upregulating EGFR expression and its downstream signaling pathways (Wang2021LncRNA). TINCR also interacts with STAU1 in breast cancer cells, participating in Staufen-mediated mRNA decay (SMD) and affecting mRNA stability (Lu2021The).

Additionally, TINCR encodes a microprotein, pTINCR, which interacts with SUMO proteins and CDC42, promoting epithelial differentiation and acting as a tumor suppressor in epithelial cancers (Boix2022pTINCR). These interactions highlight TINCR's multifaceted role in cancer biology and cellular processes.
