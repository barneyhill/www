# GALNT9

## Overview
The GALNT9 gene encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 9, which belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases. This enzyme is primarily involved in the initiation of mucin-type O-GalNAc glycosylation, a critical post-translational modification process that occurs in the Golgi apparatus. The glycosylation process facilitated by GALNT9 is essential for the proper folding, stability, and function of proteins, thereby influencing cellular communication and development (Pangeni2015The; Peng2024GALNT9; Chia2016Short). GALNT9 is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a significant role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and mitochondrial function (Peng2024GALNT9; Kato2021Polypeptide). The gene's involvement in various cellular processes underscores its importance in maintaining cellular integrity and protecting against cytotoxicity, with implications in several diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (GallardoGómez2023Serum; Peng2024GALNT9; Bu2023Whole).

## Function
The GALNT9 gene encodes the enzyme polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 9, which is involved in the initiation of mucin-type O-GalNAc glycosylation. This process involves the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine residues in proteins, a crucial post-translational modification that occurs in the Golgi apparatus (Pangeni2015The; Peng2024GALNT9). This glycosylation is essential for the proper folding, stability, and function of proteins, influencing cellular communication and development (Chia2016Short).

GALNT9 is predominantly expressed in the brain, particularly in regions such as the cerebellum, frontal lobe, and temporal lobe, and plays a significant role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis and mitochondrial function (Peng2024GALNT9; Kato2021Polypeptide). It helps regulate mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces reactive oxygen species accumulation, which is vital for ATP production and cellular integrity (Peng2024GALNT9). GALNT9 also influences calcium homeostasis and prevents the prolonged opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, thereby protecting against necrotic cell death (Peng2024GALNT9). These functions underscore GALNT9's role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protecting against cytotoxicity in healthy human cells (Peng2024GALNT9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the GALNT9 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In the context of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), rare variants in GALNT9 have been associated with an increased risk of the disease in a Middle Eastern cohort. The study identified rare inactivating variants (RIVs) in GALNT9, which were significantly more prevalent in PTC cases compared to controls, suggesting a potential role in the genetic predisposition to this type of cancer (Bu2023Whole).

GALNT9 is also involved in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies have shown that GALNT9 levels and its glycosylation products are reduced in the brains of mice treated with MPTP, a compound used to model PD. This reduction is associated with PD-like variations, indicating that GALNT9 may play a role in the pathogenesis of PD by influencing protein aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction (Peng2024GALNT9).

Additionally, GALNT9 has been identified as a potential biomarker for colorectal cancer (CRC) and advanced adenomas (AA). Serum methylation of GALNT9, along with other genes, has shown high sensitivity and specificity in detecting advanced neoplasia, suggesting its utility in noninvasive cancer screening (GallardoGómez2023Serum).
