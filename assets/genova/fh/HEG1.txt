# HEG1

## Overview
The HEG1 gene encodes the heart development protein with EGF-like domains 1, a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular development and function. This protein is characterized by its complex structure, including a serine/threonine-rich region and multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, which contribute to its function in endothelial cells (Tsuji2017HEG1). HEG1 is crucial for maintaining vascular integrity by interacting with proteins such as KRIT1 and Rasip1, which are essential for endothelial cell junction stability and response to hemodynamic forces (de2016Heart; LopezRamirez2019Pharmacological). Mutations in the HEG1 gene can lead to cardiovascular malformations and are implicated in various diseases, including malignant mesothelioma and hepatocellular carcinoma, highlighting its significance as a potential therapeutic target (Lu2020Generation; Zhao2019HEG1).

## Structure
The HEG1 protein is a mucin-like membrane protein characterized by a complex molecular structure. It is a type I membrane protein with a long serine/threonine-rich region, which constitutes approximately 70% of the mature peptide. This region is followed by three epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, an unknown region, two extracellular juxtamembrane regions, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain (Tsuji2017HEG1). The protein is heavily glycosylated, particularly with O-linked glycans, contributing to its large molecular size of 400 kDa, despite a predicted size of 150 kDa (Matsuura2018Identification; Tsuji2017HEG1).

The HEG1 protein's cytoplasmic tail interacts with the KRIT1 protein, specifically binding to the KRIT1 FERM domain in a hydrophobic groove between the F1 and F3 subdomains. This interaction is crucial for anchoring KRIT1 at endothelial cell junctions (Gingras2012Structural). The HEG1 protein also contains a specific epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody SKM9-2, located at the sequence 893-SKSPSLVSLPT-903, which is modified with disialylated core 1 O-linked glycans (Matsuura2018Identification). The protein has two transcript variants, with or without exon 6, both expressed in mesothelioma cell lines (Tsuji2017HEG1).

## Function
The HEG1 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in cardiovascular development and function, particularly in endothelial cells. HEG1 is essential for maintaining vascular integrity by anchoring Rasip1, a Rap1-binding protein, at endothelial cell-cell junctions. This interaction is mediated by a specific 9-residue sequence in HEG1, which is necessary for Rasip1's localization to these junctions, inhibition of Rho Kinase (ROCK) activity, and maintenance of endothelial cell junctional integrity (de2016Heart).

HEG1 also interacts with KRIT1, another protein involved in cardiovascular development, through its cytoplasmic domain. This interaction recruits KRIT1 to cell-cell junctions, supporting heart development and controlling endothelial cell sensitivity to hemodynamic forces. The HEG1-KRIT1 complex plays a role in regulating the expression of transcription factors KLF4 and KLF2, which are important for endothelial function and response to blood flow (Lopez‐Ramirez2021Inhibition; LopezRamirez2019Pharmacological).

In zebrafish, mutations in the heg1 gene result in cardiovascular malformations, highlighting its importance in maintaining the stability of vascular connections and overall cardiovascular health (Lu2020Generation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HEG1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In the cardiovascular system, mutations in HEG1 can lead to significant malformations, such as dilated cardiomyopathy and thrombosis. These mutations result in symptoms like atrial ventricular enlargement, heart rate slowing, venous thrombosis, and slow blood flow, which resemble human heart failure and thrombosis phenotypes (Lu2020Generation). The zebrafish model with a heg1 mutation exhibits cardiovascular abnormalities, including blood accumulation in heart chambers, dilation of the dorsal aorta, and reduced heart rate, which are indicative of heart failure similar to human conditions (Lu2020Generation).

In cancer, HEG1 is implicated in malignant mesothelioma (MM) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In MM, HEG1 supports cell proliferation and survival, with its suppression leading to decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis and autophagy (Fujii2020HEG1responsive; Tsuji2017HEG1). In HCC, HEG1 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis, promoting cancer invasion, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (Zhao2019HEG1). These findings suggest that HEG1 is a potential therapeutic target in both cardiovascular diseases and certain cancers.

## Interactions
HEG1 (heart development protein with EGF-like domains 1) is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in cardiovascular development through its interactions with other proteins. One of the primary interactions of HEG1 is with KRIT1 (Krev interaction trapped protein 1), also known as CCM1. This interaction is mediated by the binding of the HEG1 cytoplasmic tail to the FERM domain of KRIT1, which is essential for anchoring KRIT1 at endothelial cell junctions. The interaction is characterized by the accommodation of the C-terminal Tyr-Phe dipeptide of HEG1 in a hydrophobic pocket of KRIT1 (Gingras2012Structural).

The HEG1-KRIT1 interaction is significant for maintaining endothelial cell junction integrity and is crucial for cardiovascular development, as evidenced by studies in zebrafish (Gingras2012Structural). This interaction also influences the localization of KRIT1 to cell-cell junctions and affects signaling pathways such as RhoA/Rho kinase, which are important for endothelial cell function (Gingras2012Structural).

HEG1 also interacts with CCM2, another component of the cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) protein complex, further highlighting its role in vascular integrity and endothelial cell junction maintenance (Donat2018Heg1).
