# FRMD3

## Overview
FRMD3 is a gene that encodes the protein FERM domain containing 3, which is a member of the protein 4.1 family. This protein is characterized by the presence of a FERM domain, which facilitates interactions with transmembrane proteins and actin filaments, playing a pivotal role in maintaining cellular integrity and structure (Buffon2015FRMD3). The FERM domain is crucial for linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, thereby influencing cell shape and movement. FRMD3 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, brain, and skeletal muscle, and is involved in diverse cellular processes, particularly in nephron function and the formation of slit diaphragms in the kidney (Buffon2015FRMD3). The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as vimentin and ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, highlight its role in cellular processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell proliferation (Shao2023FRMD3). Mutations in the FRMD3 gene have been linked to diseases such as diabetic nephropathy and breast cancer, underscoring its clinical significance (Buffon2016rs1888747; Shao2023FRMD3).

## Function
The FRMD3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the protein 4.1 family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining cell shape and integrity. This protein contains a FERM domain, which is involved in interactions with transmembrane proteins and actin filaments, contributing to cellular integrity and structure (Buffon2015FRMD3). The FERM domain is essential for linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, influencing cell shape and movement. FRMD3 is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, brain, and skeletal muscle, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes (Buffon2015FRMD3).

In the kidney, FRMD3 is particularly important for nephron function, where it contributes to the formation of slit diaphragms between podocyte foot processes in the glomerulus, which are crucial for blood filtration (Buffon2015FRMD3). The protein's expression is decreased in models of diabetic kidney disease, suggesting a role in maintaining kidney function and integrity (Buffon2015FRMD3).

Although the specific molecular activities of FRMD3 in healthy cells are not fully elucidated, its involvement in cytoskeletal organization and cell signaling is evident. The protein's interactions with membrane-related proteins and lipids suggest a role in maintaining cellular structure and function (Shao2023FRMD3).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the FRMD3 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The rs1888747 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the FRMD3 gene is significantly associated with DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This association persists even after adjusting for various clinical factors, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition to DKD linked to this SNP (Buffon2016rs1888747). The CC genotype of rs1888747 is noted to confer protection against DKD development, although no significant differences in FRMD3 gene or protein expression were observed between different genotypes (Buffon2016rs1888747).

In the Pakistani population, the rs1888747 SNP in the FRMD3 gene is associated with DN, with a genotypic mutation from AG to AC affecting allele frequencies. This SNP is involved in creating a transcription factor binding site that participates in the bone morphogenetic protein pathway, which is implicated in DN progression (Riaz2024Assessment). The FRMD3 gene has also been identified as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, where its downregulation is associated with disease progression and poor survival outcomes. FRMD3 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis through the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of vimentin, a process crucial for cancer cell invasion (Shao2023FRMD3).

## Interactions
FRMD3 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes. In breast cancer cells, FRMD3 interacts with vimentin, a key regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This interaction is mediated through FRMD3's ubiquitin-like domain, which binds to the head domain of vimentin, promoting its polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This process is crucial for the downregulation of focal adhesion complex proteins and the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (Shao2023FRMD3).

FRMD3 also interacts with the ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) in the presence of vimentin. This interaction facilitates the recruitment of UBE3A to vimentin, enhancing its ubiquitination and degradation. The absence of the ubiquitin-like domain in FRMD3 abolishes its ability to bind vimentin and mediate its ubiquitination, highlighting the importance of this domain in FRMD3's function (Shao2023FRMD3).

In addition to its role in breast cancer, FRMD3 is part of the protein 4.1 family, which interacts with cytoskeletal components such as actin filaments. The FERM domain of FRMD3 is known to bind the cytoplasmic tails of integral membrane proteins, contributing to cell integrity and shape (Buffon2015FRMD3).
