# C12orf42

## Overview
C12orf42 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes the protein known as chromosome 12 open reading frame 42. This protein is involved in various cellular processes and has been implicated in several diseases, including pancreatic cancer and coronary artery diseases. The C12orf42 protein is particularly noted for its interaction with the TRIM58 protein, which may play a significant role in the development of pancreatic cancer (Sun2021Aberrantly). Additionally, C12orf42 has been identified as a DNA methylation-driven gene in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, where its hypermethylation is associated with poorer survival outcomes, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for early cancer diagnosis (Sun2021Aberrantly; Zhang2020Identification). The gene is also involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways, indicating a possible functional role in disease pathogenesis (Zhang2020Identification). Despite its associations with various conditions, the precise biological functions and interactions of the C12orf42 protein remain an active area of research.

## Function


## Clinical Significance
C12orf42 has been implicated in several diseases and conditions through alterations in its methylation and expression levels. In pancreatic cancer, particularly pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), C12orf42 is identified as a DNA methylation-driven gene. It is hypermethylated in PAAD, which correlates with its potential as a biomarker for early cancer diagnosis. The gene's hypermethylation is associated with poorer survival outcomes in patients, suggesting its role in cancer progression (Sun2021Aberrantly; Zhang2020Identification). 

C12orf42 is also involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways, which are enriched in PAAD samples with high DNA methylation of the gene. This indicates a potential functional role in the disease's pathogenesis (Zhang2020Identification). 

In the context of coronary artery diseases, C12orf42 is located near SNPs associated with restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention. These SNPs may affect the regulation of C12orf42, although the gene's direct involvement in restenosis remains unclear (Sampietro2011A). 

Research is ongoing to further elucidate the clinical significance of C12orf42, particularly in relation to its epigenetic alterations and interactions in various diseases.

## Interactions
C12orf42 is a gene located on chromosome 12 that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes. In the context of pancreatic cancer, the C12orf42 protein has been identified to interact with the TRIM58 protein. This interaction was revealed through a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network constructed using the STRING database, which suggests that these interactions may play a crucial role in the development of pancreatic cancer (Sun2021Aberrantly).

In studies related to c-reactive protein (CRP) loci, C12orf42 was identified as part of a biologically-prioritized candidate gene set used for network analysis. However, these studies did not provide specific information on the physical interactions of the C12orf42 protein with other proteins or nucleic acids (Vaez2015In).

In proteomic analyses of human spermatozoa, C12orf42 was identified as one of the 'missing' proteins according to NextProt criteria. However, the studies did not provide specific details on the physical interactions of C12orf42 with other proteins or nucleic acids (Schiza2019Identification).
