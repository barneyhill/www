# KATNA1

## Overview
KATNA1 is a gene that encodes the katanin catalytic subunit A1, a protein integral to the microtubule-severing process within cells. This protein is a member of the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA) protein superfamily, which is characterized by its ATPase activity that facilitates the severing of microtubules, a critical function for cellular dynamics and organization (Yuen2023Fertility). The katanin catalytic subunit A1 is involved in various cellular processes, including mitosis, cytokinesis, and neuronal development, by regulating microtubule length and organization (Lombino2019The; Cheung2016Proteomic). Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular physiology, impacting processes such as cell division, intracellular transport, and neurogenesis (McNally2018Microtubulesevering). The protein's interactions with other cytoskeletal components and regulatory proteins underscore its role in microtubule dynamics and cellular function (Dunleavy2022Male).

## Structure
KATNA1, or katanin catalytic subunit A1, is a protein involved in microtubule severing, characterized by its complex molecular structure. The primary structure of KATNA1 consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the KATNA1 gene. Its secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to the protein's stability and function. The tertiary structure of KATNA1 forms a functional domain known as the AAA ATPase domain, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity. This domain is responsible for the protein's ability to hydrolyze ATP, providing the energy necessary for microtubule severing.

KATNA1 may also participate in forming a quaternary structure by assembling into a complex with other proteins, which can influence its activity and interactions within the cell. Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, play a significant role in regulating KATNA1's activity, potentially affecting its function and localization. Additionally, splice variant isoforms of KATNA1 may exist, which could alter its function or localization, providing a mechanism for the regulation of its activity in different cellular contexts. These structural features and modifications are essential for the protein's role in cellular dynamics and microtubule regulation.

## Function
KATNA1 encodes the katanin catalytic subunit A1, a microtubule-severing enzyme that plays a crucial role in remodeling microtubule-based structures essential for various cellular processes. This protein is part of the ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA) protein superfamily and is highly conserved across eukaryotes, indicating its fundamental role in microtubule organization and function (Yuen2023Fertility). KATNA1's microtubule-severing activity is ATP-dependent and involves the formation of a hexameric ring that binds and severs microtubule filaments, facilitating their reorganization (McNally2018Microtubulesevering; Yuen2023Fertility).

In healthy human cells, KATNA1 is involved in critical processes such as mitosis, where it severs spindle microtubules to regulate spindle length and density, and cytokinesis, where it aids in severing intercellular bridge microtubules (Cheung2016Proteomic). It is also active in neuronal development, where it regulates the proliferation of neuronal progenitors during both embryonic development and adult neurogenesis (Lombino2019The). KATNA1 is diffusely localized to cytoplasmic microtubules and concentrated at centrosomes, areas requiring rapid microtubule remodeling (Yuen2023Fertility). Its activity is essential for maintaining cellular physiology, impacting processes like cell division, intracellular transport, and neurogenesis (McNally2018Microtubulesevering).

## Interactions
KATNA1, a katanin catalytic subunit, is involved in various protein interactions critical for its function in microtubule severing. It interacts with KATNB1, a regulatory subunit, forming a complex that facilitates microtubule severing by binding and destabilizing tubulin-tubulin contacts (O’Donnell2014KATNB1). KATNA1 also binds to a range of cytoskeletal and vesicular transport proteins, including actin-related proteins, tubulin, and microtubule-related proteins. It specifically interacts with components of the dynactin complex, which is involved in microtubule-based cargo transport, and DNAAF4, necessary for axonemal dynein assembly (Dunleavy2022Male).

KATNA1's interactions extend to the actin cytoskeleton, as it binds to the CapZ subunits CAPZA1 and CAPZA2, and the actin motor protein MYL6, suggesting a role in actin network regulation in male germ cells (Dunleavy2022Male). It also interacts with Rab GTPases involved in vesicle transport, including pro-acrosomal vesicle transport and sperm tail development (Dunleavy2022Male). These interactions highlight KATNA1's role in regulating spindle structure, acrosome development, and microtubule dynamics during male meiosis and spermiogenesis (Dunleavy2022Male).
