# FITM1

## Overview
FITM1, or fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 1, is a gene that encodes a transmembrane protein involved in lipid metabolism and the formation of lipid droplets within cells. This protein is characterized by its six transmembrane domains and is primarily localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a pivotal role in the partitioning of triglycerides into lipid droplets, crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic homeostasis (Wang2022Fat). FITM1 is predominantly expressed in oxidative tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle, where it contributes to energy metabolism by facilitating the rapid mobilization of triglycerides (Wang2022Fat). The protein's function is regulated by transcription factors like PGC-1α and MyoD1, which enhance its expression in muscle cells, indicating its involvement in muscle development and energy metabolism (Wang2022Fat). Alterations in FITM1 expression have been linked to various metabolic disorders and liver-related diseases, underscoring its clinical significance (CastillejoLópez2024A; Chen2020A).

## Structure
FITM1 is a transmembrane protein involved in lipid droplet formation and lipid metabolism. It is characterized by having six transmembrane domains, with both the N- and C-termini localized to the cytosol (Wang2022Fat; Gross2010Structural). The protein consists of 292 amino acids and is encoded by a gene located at 14q12, which includes two exons and one intron (Wang2022Fat). FITM1 shares 50% similarity in amino acid sequence with FITM2, another member of the fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein family, but does not have homology to known proteins or protein domains, making it unique (Wang2022Fat).

The FITM1 protein sequence contains the active site of lipid phosphatase/phosphotransferase (LPT) enzymes, which may play a role in its function in lipid metabolism (Wang2022Fat). While specific details on the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of FITM1 are not provided, the presence of multiple transmembrane domains suggests a complex folding pattern typical of membrane proteins. The protein may undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which could influence its activity and interactions within the cell (Wang2022Fat).

## Function
FITM1 (fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 1) is a crucial component in lipid metabolism, primarily involved in the formation and regulation of lipid droplets within cells. It is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein that facilitates the partitioning of triglycerides (TGs) into lipid droplets, a process essential for maintaining cellular energy balance and metabolic homeostasis (Wang2022Fat; Kadereit2008Evolutionarily). FITM1 is highly expressed in oxidative tissues such as the heart and skeletal muscle, where it plays a significant role in energy metabolism by generating small lipid droplets that allow for rapid mobilization of triglycerides during increased ATP demand (Wang2022Fat).

The protein's activity is regulated by transcription factors such as PGC-1α and MyoD1, which enhance its expression and promote the formation of lipid droplets in muscle cells, indicating its involvement in muscle development and energy metabolism (Wang2022Fat). FITM1's ability to bind triglycerides and diacylglycerols, although weaker than FITM2, is crucial for the nucleation and assembly of lipid droplets, underscoring its role in lipid droplet biogenesis (Wang2022Fat).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FITM1 gene have been linked to several diseases and conditions, particularly those related to lipid metabolism. In non-viral hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), low expression of FITM1 is associated with worse survival outcomes, suggesting its role as a tumor suppressor gene. The gene's hypermethylation in tumor tissues correlates with reduced expression and poorer prognosis, indicating that FITM1's downregulation may contribute to HCC progression by affecting lipid homeostasis (Chen2020A).

FITM1 is also implicated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Studies have shown that downregulation of FITM1 is consistent with differential gene expression analyses between mild and advanced NAFLD, suggesting its involvement in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, a hallmark of NAFLD (CastillejoLópez2024A).

In the context of parental eNOS deficiency, FITM1 expression was found to be significantly correlated with liver fat ratio in female offspring, indicating its potential role in lipid metabolism and phenotypic changes related to fat content in the liver (Zhang2023Parental). These findings highlight the clinical significance of FITM1 in metabolic disorders and liver-related diseases.
