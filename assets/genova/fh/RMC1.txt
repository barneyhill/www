# RMC1

## Overview
The RMC1 gene encodes the protein known as the regulator of MON1-CCZ1, which plays a crucial role in cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of endosomal trafficking. This protein is categorized as a regulatory protein, and it is involved in the modulation of the MON1-CCZ1 complex, which is essential for the conversion of early endosomes to late endosomes, a critical step in the endocytic pathway. The RMC1 protein's function is vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring proper intracellular transport and signaling. Mutations or dysregulation of the RMC1 gene have been implicated in various pathological conditions, highlighting its significance in cellular physiology and potential as a therapeutic target (Qiu2020aarFDC).
