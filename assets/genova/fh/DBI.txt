# DBI

## Overview
The DBI gene encodes the diazepam binding inhibitor, also known as acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), a small, highly conserved protein involved in multiple physiological processes. This protein is categorized as a binding protein due to its role in modulating the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex and binding acyl-CoA esters, which are crucial for lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Kolmer1995The; Kolmer1994TissueSpecific). DBI is expressed in various tissues and is involved in neurotransmission, mitochondrial function, and steroidogenesis, highlighting its importance in both central nervous system activities and metabolic pathways (Joseph2020Metabolic; Guidotti1983Isolation). The protein's interactions with GABA_A receptors and mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) underscore its multifaceted role in cellular processes, including neurogenesis and appetite regulation (Barbaccia1990DBI; Joseph2020Metabolic). Alterations in DBI expression have been linked to neurological and metabolic disorders, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Joseph2021Effects; Niu2003Multiple).

## Structure
The diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), also known as acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), is a small, highly conserved protein consisting of 86 amino acids (Tonon2020Endozepines; Knudsen1993The). Its primary structure includes a sequence with 15 lysine residues, and it is highly conserved across species, indicating strong evolutionary pressure to maintain its structure (Tonon2020Endozepines).

The secondary structure of DBI is characterized by four alpha-helices, arranged in a left-handed anti-parallel bundle, forming a boomerang-like shape (Tonon2020Endozepines; Knudsen1993The). These helices are organized in an up-down-down-up direction, separated by coils, and interact through hydrophobic interactions and salt bridges (Tonon2020Endozepines).

The tertiary structure of DBI is described as a shallow bowl-like structure with a hydrophilic rim and non-polar surfaces, which facilitates the binding of long-chain acyl-CoA esters at the inner surface of the bowl (Tonon2020Endozepines). The protein functions as a monomer, indicating no quaternary structure (Rose1992Molecular).

DBI is part of a multigene family known as acyl-CoA binding domain-containing proteins (ACBDs) and has no sequence homology with fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) (Alquier2021From). The protein's structure and function are crucial for its role in lipid metabolism and modulation of GABA receptors.

## Function
The diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), also known as acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), is a multifunctional protein involved in several critical biological processes in healthy human cells. DBI plays a significant role in modulating the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, which is crucial for GABAergic neurotransmission in the brain. This modulation affects anxiety and seizure susceptibility by influencing the receptor's response to endogenous and exogenous ligands (Kolmer1995The).

DBI is also involved in lipid metabolism by binding acyl-CoA esters, which are essential for various metabolic processes. This binding activity helps regulate the availability of acyl-CoA for metabolic pathways, thereby influencing cellular energy homeostasis (Kolmer1994TissueSpecific). The protein is active in both the cytosol and mitochondria, where it plays a role in mitochondrial steroidogenesis by facilitating cholesterol delivery to the inner mitochondrial membrane, a critical step in steroid hormone production (Kolmer1995The).

In addition to its roles in neurotransmission and metabolism, DBI has been shown to decrease glucose-stimulated insulin release, indicating its involvement in glucose homeostasis (Kolmer1995The). The protein's diverse functions underscore its importance in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the DBI gene, also known as acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), have been implicated in various neurological and metabolic disorders. In schizophrenia, increased DBI-like immunoreactivity has been observed in paranoid subtypes, while decreased DBI protein levels have been noted in the hippocampi of patients, although no direct disease association with specific mutations was found (Niu2003Multiple). In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), particularly in individuals with severe language impairment, DBI protein levels are significantly reduced, suggesting a potential role in the pathophysiology of ASD (Pichitpunpong2019Phenotypic).

DBI is also involved in metabolic conditions. Its levels correlate with body mass index (BMI) and are associated with obesity and anorexia nervosa. In mice, knockout of the Acbp/Dbi gene in adipose tissue prevents weight gain induced by a high-fat diet, indicating its role in lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis (Joseph2021Effects). In cancer, DBI expression is linked to tumor growth and maintenance of cancer stem cells, particularly in bladder cancer, where it is associated with higher histological grades and tumor heterogeneity (Yao2022SingleCell). These findings suggest that DBI could be a potential therapeutic target in various diseases.

## Interactions
The diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), also known as acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP), is involved in several interactions with other proteins, particularly influencing the function of GABA_A receptors. DBI acts as a competitive inhibitor at benzodiazepine recognition sites on GABA_A receptors, displacing ligands such as diazepam and flunitrazepam, which suggests a modulatory role in GABAergic transmission (Guidotti1983Isolation). DBI and its derived peptides, such as octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), interact with GABA_A receptor subtypes, influencing their activity and modulating behavioral responses (Barbaccia1990DBI; Ferrero1986Study).

DBI also interacts with the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO), another benzodiazepine receptor, indicating its role in mitochondrial function and steroid synthesis (Joseph2020Metabolic). The protein's interaction with acyl-CoA molecules is crucial for its role in lipid metabolism, although mutations affecting acyl-CoA binding do not alter its appetite-stimulatory effects, suggesting distinct pathways for its metabolic and behavioral roles (Joseph2020Metabolic). These interactions highlight DBI's multifaceted role in cellular processes, including neurogenesis, appetite regulation, and lipid homeostasis.
