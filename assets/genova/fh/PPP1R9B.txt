# PPP1R9B

## Overview
The PPP1R9B gene encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 9B, commonly known as spinophilin or neurabin-2, which is a multifunctional scaffold protein involved in the regulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity and cytoskeletal organization. Spinophilin is characterized by its ability to bind actin and interact with a variety of proteins, including PP1, through its multiple functional domains, such as actin-binding domains, a PDZ domain, and a coiled-coil domain. These interactions are crucial for its role in synaptic signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cellular architecture. In the nervous system, spinophilin is essential for synaptic plasticity and neuronal migration, while in other tissues, it contributes to cell adhesion and motility. The protein's regulatory functions are significant in maintaining normal cellular processes and preventing pathological conditions, such as cancer, where its expression is often altered (Ferrer2015120; Bielas2007Spinophilin; Meng2009PPP1R9B).

## Structure
The PPP1R9B gene encodes the protein neurabin-2, also known as spinophilin, which is involved in cytoskeletal organization and synaptic signaling. The protein has a predicted molecular weight of 89,500 but an observed mass of 130,000 kDa, indicating potential post-translational modifications or structural complexities (Meng2009PPP1R9B). Spinophilin contains several functional domains, including two N-terminal actin-binding domains, a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-binding site, a PDZ domain, and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (Bielas2007Spinophilin; Meng2009PPP1R9B). These domains facilitate its role in targeting PP1 to specific subcellular locations and in regulating actin assembly, which is crucial for maintaining cellular architecture and function (Meng2009PPP1R9B).

The PDZ domain is known for mediating protein-protein interactions, which is essential for its role in synaptic signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics (Bielas2007Spinophilin). The actin-binding domains contribute to the protein's ability to modulate the actin cytoskeleton, which is vital for processes such as synapse formation and axonal outgrowth (Bielas2007Spinophilin; Meng2009PPP1R9B). The coiled-coil domain likely facilitates oligomerization or interaction with other proteins, although specific details on quaternary structure are not provided in the context.

## Function
The PPP1R9B gene encodes spinophilin, a multifunctional protein that plays a significant role in the regulation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity and cytoskeletal organization in healthy human cells. Spinophilin acts as a scaffold protein, targeting PP1 to specific subcellular locations, which is crucial for its regulatory functions (Ferrer2015120; Molina‐Pinelo2011Down‐regulation). It interacts with over 30 partner proteins, including cytoskeletal and cell adhesion molecules, enzymes, and membrane receptors, influencing various cellular processes (Molina‐Pinelo2011Down‐regulation).

In the nervous system, spinophilin is involved in regulating spine morphology and density, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal migration. It binds to F-actin, contributing to the organization and modulation of the molecular architecture of dendritic spines, which affects synaptic signaling and plasticity (Feng2000Spinophilin; Allen1997Spinophilin). Spinophilin also facilitates the dephosphorylation of doublecortin by PP1, which is important for microtubule bundling and the structural integrity of neurons (Bielas2007Spinophilin).

Spinophilin's role extends to linking the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, which is crucial for cellular events such as cell adhesion, motility, and shape determination (Satoh1998NeurabinIISpinophilin). Its regulatory functions are essential for maintaining normal cellular functions and preventing uncontrolled cell proliferation (Ferrer2015120).

## Clinical Significance
The PPP1R9B gene, also known as spinophilin, plays a significant role in various cancers, particularly breast cancer. Alterations in its expression are linked to aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis. In breast cancer, the loss of spinophilin is associated with an increase in cancer stem cell-like populations, especially in estrogen receptor-negative and triple-negative tumors, which are known for their aggressive nature and poor response to chemotherapy (Ferrer2015120). This loss correlates with higher histological grades and an increase in CD44+/CD24- cells, which are identified as tumor-initiating cells with stem/progenitor cell properties (Ferrer2015120).

Spinophilin downregulation leads to increased levels of stem cell transcription factors such as Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, and KLF4, enhancing the stem-like properties of cancer cells (Ferrer2015120). This suggests that spinophilin acts as a tumor suppressor, and its loss may contribute to tumor aggressiveness by increasing the cancer stem cell population (Ferrer2015120). Beyond breast cancer, reduced spinophilin expression is also observed in lung, ovarian, and colorectal carcinomas, where it correlates with malignant grade and p53 mutations (Ferrer2015120). These findings highlight the clinical significance of PPP1R9B in cancer progression and patient prognosis.

## Interactions
PPP1R9B, also known as neurabin-2 or spinophilin, is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its function in cellular processes. It interacts with Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) catalytic subunits, specifically PPP1CA and PPP1CC, through binding motifs such as RKIHF, RVRF, and KEIEF, which are essential for its role as a PP1 regulator in the brain (Esteves2012Protein; Esteves2012Proteina). This interaction is significant for synaptic transmission and the regulation of glutamate receptors, as PPP1R9B anchors PP1 near AMPA and NMDA receptors, affecting postsynaptic glutamatergic neurotransmission (Esteves2012Protein).

PPP1R9B also plays a role in the natural killer immunological synapse (NKIS) by interacting with actin filaments, which is crucial for cytoskeletal organization and NKIS formation. Its recruitment to the NKIS is induced by CD18 ligation, leading to actin deposition at the cell-bead interface, a critical event in cell-cell contact establishment (Meng2009PPP1R9B). Additionally, PPP1R9B forms a complex with TFEB, a protein involved in autophagy, and this interaction is essential for the dephosphorylation and activation of TFEB (Liang2023Lysine). These interactions highlight PPP1R9B's role in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and synaptic signaling.
