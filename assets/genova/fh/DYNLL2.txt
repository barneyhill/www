# DYNLL2

## Overview
DYNLL2 is a gene that encodes the protein dynein light chain LC8-type 2, a highly conserved eukaryotic hub protein involved in various cellular processes. This protein is a component of the dynein motor complex, which plays a critical role in intracellular transport by facilitating the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules. DYNLL2 is characterized by its homodimeric structure, which is essential for its function as a hub protein, allowing it to interact with a wide range of other proteins. These interactions are crucial for processes such as nuclear pore complex assembly, DNA repair, and ciliary protein trafficking. The gene has been implicated in clinical contexts, including cancer prognosis and muscle development, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Jiang2021TRIM68; Rao2024Structure; Bodor2014DYNLL2).

## Structure
The DYNLL2 protein, also known as LC8 dynein light chain, is a conserved homodimeric eukaryotic hub protein involved in various cellular processes. Its primary structure is highly conserved across evolution, consisting of a sequence of amino acids that form a stable homodimeric structure crucial for its function as a hub protein (Bodor2014DYNLL2).

In terms of secondary structure, DYNLL2 comprises five β-strands that form two core β-sheets. Each β-sheet is flanked on one side by two α-helices, while the other side forms the dimer interface. The β3-strand of one subunit pairs with the β2"-strand of the other subunit in an antiparallel mode, stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and side chain hydrogen bonds (Bodor2014DYNLL2).

The tertiary structure involves the formation of two equivalent grooves that serve as target binding pockets for the dimer. The quaternary structure is characterized by the stable homodimeric form of DYNLL2, which is essential for its function (Bodor2014DYNLL2).

DYNLL2 interacts with various proteins, often involving a disorder-to-order transition in the binding motifs of its partners, such as the myosin 5a tail, which folds into a β-sheet upon complex formation (Bodor2014DYNLL2).

## Function
DYNLL2, or dynein light chain LC8-type 2, is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structural organization and function of the dynein motor complex in eukaryotic cells. It is involved in intracellular transport processes, facilitating the movement of organelles, vesicles, and other cargo along microtubules. DYNLL2 functions as a component of the dynein complex by promoting the dimerization of the intermediate chain (IC), which is essential for its binding to the heavy chain (HC) of dynein. This interaction enhances the structural order of the IC, contributing to the stability and regulation of the dynein complex (Rao2024Structure).

In mammals, DYNLL2 is one of two homologs of LC8, with subtle differences in binding to partners, although distinct functionalities have not been established. It interacts with a wide range of proteins, often characterized by a threonine-glutamine-threonine (TQT) motif, making it a central hub for dimerization. These interactions are crucial for various cellular processes, including the nuclear pore complex, DNA double-strand break response, and interactions with viruses (Rao2024Structure). DYNLL2 is also involved in ciliary protein trafficking and retrograde transport, although its specific role in these processes remains unclear (Rao2024Structure).

## Clinical Significance
The DYNLL2 gene has been implicated in various clinical contexts, particularly in cancer prognosis and muscle development. In osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, DYNLL2 is identified as a potential biomarker for prognosis. Studies have shown that high expression levels of DYNLL2 are associated with improved 5-year survival rates in osteosarcoma patients, suggesting its role in cancer progression and patient outcomes (Jiang2021TRIM68). The gene's expression is significantly higher in osteosarcoma tissues compared to normal tissues, indicating its involvement in tumor biology (Jiang2021TRIM68).

In the context of muscle development, DYNLL2 is a key regulator in chicken breast muscle, where it is involved in myoblast differentiation. It is regulated by miR-148a-3p, which can reduce DYNLL2 expression, thereby promoting muscle differentiation. This interaction highlights the gene's role in muscle development, although the study does not directly address human diseases (Li2022Weighted).

While DYNLL2's role in neurological disorders is suggested by its involvement in intracellular transport, specific diseases resulting from mutations or expression changes in humans are not detailed in the provided context. The gene's interactions and expression levels are crucial in understanding its clinical significance across different conditions.

## Interactions
DYNLL2, also known as dynein light chain LC8-type 2, is a conserved homodimeric eukaryotic hub protein involved in various cellular processes through its interactions with multiple proteins. It is known to bind to over 70 proteins, including myosin 5a (Myo5a), a motor protein involved in cargo transport. The interaction between DYNLL2 and Myo5a involves the binding of DYNLL2 to an extended linear motif of the Myo5a tail, which undergoes a disorder-to-order transition, forming a β-strand upon binding. This interaction is characterized by structural plasticity and involves specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Bodor2014DYNLL2).

DYNLL2 also interacts with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and apoptotic factors, playing roles in nitric oxide signaling and apoptosis, respectively. The protein functions as a dimer, with each monomer forming grooves for target protein binding, which is crucial for the assembly and structural integrity of dynein motor complexes (King2008DyneinIndependent).

In addition to its role in protein interactions, DYNLL2 is regulated by microRNAs, such as miR-148a-3p, which can bind to its 3'UTR and modulate its expression, influencing processes like myoblast differentiation (Li2022Weighted).
