# GIPC1

## Overview
GIPC1, or GAIP interacting protein, C-terminus 1, is a gene that encodes the protein GIPC PDZ domain containing family member 1. This protein is characterized by its PDZ domain, which classifies it as an adaptor protein involved in various cellular processes. GIPC1 plays a pivotal role in the trafficking and signaling of transmembrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors, by interacting with the motor protein myosin VI. It is integral to endosomal trafficking, receptor recycling, and the activation of signaling pathways such as PI3K-AKT, which are essential for cellular functions like migration, angiogenesis, and cytokinesis (Katoh2013Functional). The protein's interactions with cytoskeletal components and its presence in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane underscore its importance in maintaining cellular organization and communication (Katoh2013Functional; Chittenden2010Therapeutic). GIPC1's involvement in these processes highlights its significance in cellular homeostasis and its potential implications in cancer biology, where its altered expression is linked to tumor progression and metastasis (Katoh2013Functional; Chittenden2010Therapeutic).

## Structure
The GIPC1 protein, also known as GAIP interacting protein, C-terminus 1, is characterized by a specific domain architecture that includes a GIPC homology 1 (GH1) domain, a PDZ domain, and a GIPC homology 2 (GH2) domain. The GH1 domain adopts an ubiquitin-like fold composed of four beta-strands and one alpha-helix, despite lacking sequence similarity to ubiquitin (Shang2017Structure). The PDZ domain has a typical PDZ fold with five beta-strands and two alpha-helices, facilitating interactions with the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (PBM) in cargo proteins (Shang2017Structure; CarreteroOrtega2019GIPC). The GH2 domain forms a four-helix globular fold and is involved in binding to myosin VI (Shang2017Structure; Dubois2021Pressure).

GIPC1 forms a domain-swapped dimer, where two molecules exchange the last beta-strand between their GH1 domains, creating a dimer interface. This configuration results in the PDZ domain of one molecule being in close proximity to the GH1 domain of the dimer partner, forming an integrated structural module (Shang2017Structure). The protein is in an autoinhibited conformation, with the GH2 domain partially blocking the PBM-binding groove in the PDZ domain, hindering binding to PBM-containing cargo proteins and myosin VI (Shang2017Structure). The interaction between GIPC1 and myosin VI is regulated by cargo binding to the PDZ domain, suggesting a steric or allosteric communication mechanism (Shang2017Structure).

## Function
GIPC1 is a PDZ domain-containing protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in healthy human cells. It functions as an adaptor protein, facilitating the interaction and trafficking of transmembrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), through its interaction with the motor protein myosin VI (MYO6) (Katoh2013Functional). GIPC1 is involved in endosomal trafficking, signaling, and recycling of these receptors, which is essential for processes such as cell migration, angiogenesis, and cytokinesis (Katoh2013Functional).

In addition to its role in receptor trafficking, GIPC1 is involved in the activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by clustering RTKs and APPL1 on early endosomes, and it modulates GPCR signaling by interacting with RGS19 (Katoh2013Functional). GIPC1 also plays a role in the stabilization and cell-surface expression of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), which is crucial for cellular growth and development (Katoh2013Functional).

GIPC1 is active in the cytoplasm and at the cell membrane, contributing to cellular organization and function by interacting with cytoskeletal components and influencing cellular communication and trafficking (Katoh2013Functional; Chittenden2010Therapeutic). Its involvement in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and function in healthy human cells (Katoh2013Functional).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression and function of the GIPC1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cancer. GIPC1 is highly expressed in several human malignancies, including breast, ovarian, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. Its overexpression is associated with tumor proliferation and invasion, making it a potential therapeutic target (Katoh2013Functional; Chittenden2010Therapeutic). In breast and colorectal cancer cells, GIPC1 is essential for cell survival and oncogenic transformation, with its knockdown leading to apoptosis and impaired colony formation (Chittenden2010Therapeutic).

In ovarian cancer, GIPC1 expression levels correlate with tumor invasiveness, and its detection using specific antibodies could serve as a sensitive marker for early-stage malignancies (Yavelsky2008Native). In prostate cancer, GIPC1 contributes to radioresistance, suggesting that targeting this gene could improve treatment outcomes for high-risk patients (Singer2012Impact).

Mutations in GIPC1, such as the F319L missense mutation, have been identified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, indicating its potential role in cancer biology (Katoh2013Functional). These findings underscore the importance of GIPC1 in cancer progression and its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.

## Interactions
GIPC1, a PDZ domain-containing protein, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that are crucial for its role in cellular processes. It interacts with a variety of transmembrane proteins, including integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like IGF1R and NTRK1, and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as ADRB1 and DRD2 (Katoh2013Functional). The PDZ domain of GIPC1 facilitates these interactions, although its interaction with the metastasis inducer MACC1 is independent of this domain. Instead, the interaction with MACC1 involves the C-terminal region of GIPC1 and the SH3 domain of MACC1 (Siegel2023GIPC1).

GIPC1 also interacts with cytosolic signaling regulators such as APPL1 and RGS19, and viral proteins like HBc and HPV-18 E6 (Katoh2013Functional). It plays a role in endosomal trafficking by interacting with myosin VI, where the GH2 domain of GIPC1 is crucial for this interaction (Shang2017Structure). The interaction with PlexinD1, which involves the PDZ domain of GIPC1, is important for regulating PlexinD1 signaling (Shang2017Structure). GIPC1's involvement in these interactions highlights its role as an adaptor protein in various cellular signaling and trafficking pathways.
