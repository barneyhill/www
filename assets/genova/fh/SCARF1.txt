# SCARF1

## Overview
SCARF1, or scavenger receptor class F member 1, is a gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein involved in various physiological processes, particularly in the immune system. The protein, also referred to as SCARF1, is characterized by its extracellular region containing epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, which are essential for its ligand-binding capabilities (Wang2023Structure). SCARF1 plays a crucial role in the clearance of apoptotic cells, a process known as efferocytosis, thereby preventing inflammation and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Jorge2021SCARF1induced). It is expressed on the surface of several cell types, including endothelial cells and macrophages, and is involved in interactions with a variety of ligands, such as complement C1q and calreticulin, facilitating immune responses and cellular homeostasis (WickerPlanquart2020Molecular). SCARF1's involvement in immune processes and its potential implications in diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and hepatocellular carcinoma underscore its clinical significance (Liao2021Hypermethylationmediated; Jorge2021SCARF1induced).

## Structure
SCARF1 (scavenger receptor class F member 1) is a type I transmembrane protein characterized by its extracellular region containing several epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, which contribute to its long-curved conformation (Patten2018SCARF1:; Wang2023Structure). The protein's ectodomain is crucial for ligand binding, particularly modified low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), and features positively charged residues that facilitate this interaction (Wang2023Structure). The EGF-like domains are stabilized by hydrogen and disulfide bonds, forming a bow-like conformation in certain fragments (Wang2023Structure).

SCARF1 forms homodimers, with dimerization mediated by interactions such as hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions between specific residues (Wang2023Structure). The protein's quaternary structure is important for its function, as the dimeric form enhances its ability to recognize lipoproteins on the cell surface (Wang2023Structure).

Post-translational modifications, such as S-acylation, may target SCARF1 to lipid rafts, influencing its localization and function (Murshid2020Immunological). SCARF1 also exists in different isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can affect its structural and functional properties (Patten2018SCARF1:).

## Function
SCARF1, or scavenger receptor class F member 1, is a type I transmembrane protein that plays a significant role in maintaining homeostasis and immunity in healthy human cells. It is expressed on the surface of various cell types, including endothelial cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, and is distributed in organs such as the heart, liver, kidney, and spleen (Wang2023Structure). SCARF1 is primarily involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells, a process known as efferocytosis, which is crucial for preventing inflammation and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Patten2018SCARF1:; Jorge2021SCARF1induced).

The receptor binds to a wide range of ligands, including complement C1q and calreticulin, facilitating the removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytic cells (Patten2018SCARF1:; WickerPlanquart2020Molecular). SCARF1 also interacts with Toll-like receptors to elicit proinflammatory responses and contributes to adaptive immunity by aiding in the uptake and presentation of antigens to T cells (Patten2018SCARF1:; Murshid2020Immunological).

In addition to its role in immune processes, SCARF1 is implicated in the extravasation of leukocytes during inflammation and may influence the development of atherosclerosis (Wang2023Structure). Its ability to bind a diverse array of ligands underscores its multifaceted role in cellular and organismal homeostasis.

## Clinical Significance
The SCARF1 gene is clinically significant due to its role in various diseases, particularly autoimmune disorders and cancer. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), SCARF1 is implicated in the impaired clearance of apoptotic cells, a process known as efferocytosis. Autoantibodies targeting SCARF1 are found in approximately 26% of SLE patients, correlating with defects in apoptotic cell removal and contributing to the disease's pathogenesis (Jorge2021SCARF1induced). These autoantibodies may block SCARF1 function, leading to inflammation and autoimmunity (Jorge2021SCARF1induced).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the lncRNA-SCARF1 is down-regulated due to hypermethylation, which is associated with increased tumor proliferation and migration. This suggests that lncRNA-SCARF1 could serve as a prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target in HCC (Liao2021Hypermethylationmediated). SCARF1 is also upregulated in chronic liver disease, where it may play a role in liver pathology and immune response regulation (Patten2017SCARF1). These findings highlight the importance of SCARF1 in maintaining immune homeostasis and its potential involvement in disease progression when its function is altered.

## Interactions
SCARF1, or scavenger receptor class F member 1, is involved in various interactions with proteins and nucleic acids that play significant roles in immune response and cellular processes. SCARF1 interacts with heat shock proteins (HSPs), facilitating the entry of antigenic polypeptides into antigen processing pathways, which is crucial for T cell activation and immune response (Murshid2020Immunological). It also associates with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src, promoting endocytosis and phagocytosis, and is involved in cell signaling within lipid rafts of mononuclear phagocytes (Murshid2020Immunological).

SCARF1 forms homodimers, which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions, particularly involving residues S88, Y94, and F82 (Wang2023Structure). These dimeric forms enhance the binding of modified lipoproteins on the cell surface (Wang2023Structure). SCARF1 also interacts with calreticulin and apoptotic cells, facilitating the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (Wang2023Structure). Additionally, SCARF1 is involved in the recruitment of CD4+ T cells to the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium, where it co-localizes with filamentous actin and ICAM-1, components of endothelial docking structures (Patten2017SCARF1). These interactions highlight SCARF1's role in immune surveillance and cellular homeostasis.
