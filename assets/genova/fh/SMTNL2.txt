# SMTNL2

## Overview
The SMTNL2 gene encodes the smoothelin-like 2 protein, which is a critical component in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, particularly within epithelial cells. This protein is characterized by its distinct structural domains, including a coiled-coil N-terminal region, a central disordered complex region, and a C-terminal globular calponin homology domain, which facilitate its interaction with actin and other regulatory proteins (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike). Smoothelin-like 2 functions primarily as an actin-binding protein, playing a pivotal role in stabilizing the apical actin cortex during epithelial morphogenesis by modulating the activity of actin-regulating proteins such as coronin-1B and cortactin (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike). Beyond its role in epithelial cells, SMTNL2 is also implicated in muscle cell differentiation and regeneration, highlighting its broader significance in cellular structure and function (Li2019Proteomicsbased). The gene's expression and methylation status have been linked to various clinical conditions, including diabetic kidney disease and heart failure, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Marumo2020Methylation; Wang2024Identification).

## Structure
The Smoothelin-like 2 (SMTNL2) protein is characterized by a distinct molecular structure that includes several key domains. The protein comprises a coiled-coil (CC) N-terminal region, a central disordered complex region (CR), and a C-terminal globular calponin homology (CH) domain (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike). These domains are crucial for its function in actin regulation, as SMTNL2 interacts with actin through its CH and CC domains, indicating its role in stabilizing the apical actin cortex during epithelial morphogenesis (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike).

The N-terminal CC region is particularly important for binding with other actin regulatory proteins, such as coronin-1B (CORO1B) and cortactin (CTTN), which are involved in actin turnover and stabilization (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike). SMTNL2's interaction with CORO1B is influenced by the phosphorylation state of CORO1B, with SMTNL2 preferentially binding to a phosphomimetic mutant of CORO1B, suggesting a regulatory mechanism through post-translational modifications (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike).

The protein's structure allows it to play a significant role in epithelial morphogenesis by maintaining the integrity of the apical actin cortex, which is essential for the proper function and stability of epithelial cells (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike).

## Function
The SMTNL2 gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in stabilizing the apical actin cortex during epithelial morphogenesis. SMTNL2 is part of an apical network of actin regulators and functions by inhibiting coronin-1b (CORO1B), a protein involved in actin debranching and depolymerization. This inhibition is essential for maintaining the integrity of the apical cortex, promoting proper epithelial cell maturation and structure (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike).

SMTNL2 interacts with actin filaments and slows down apical actin turnover, functioning through Arp2/3 modulators like CORO1B and cortactin. This interaction is crucial for preventing fast actin turnover and facilitating cortex maturation, thereby playing a critical role in maintaining epithelial cell structure (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike).

In addition to its role in epithelial cells, SMTNL2 is involved in muscle cell differentiation and regeneration. It promotes the transition from myoblasts to myotubes in differentiating C2C12 cells by binding with mitogen-activated protein kinases, suggesting its involvement in muscle cell differentiation and regeneration (Li2019Proteomicsbased). SMTNL2's interaction with b-actin is also explored, highlighting its potential role in actin polymerization, which is crucial for maintaining the structure and function of epithelial cells (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the SMTNL2 gene have been associated with several diseases and conditions. In the context of diabetic kidney disease, SMTNL2 methylation levels in urine have been identified as a potential biomarker for monitoring kidney function decline. Lower methylation levels of SMTNL2 correlate with a larger annual decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), suggesting its utility in predicting renal function deterioration in diabetic patients (Marumo2020Methylation). The study by Marumo et al. indicates that SMTNL2 methylation levels can improve the discrimination of patients with diabetes who experience a faster decline in eGFR, offering a non-invasive method for early detection and stratification of patients at risk for diabetic kidney disease (Marumo2020Methylation).

In heart failure, SMTNL2 is one of the genes found to be highly expressed in patients, potentially promoting the progression of the disease. The study by Wang et al. identified SMTNL2 as a hub gene associated with heart failure, with its expression levels serving as a risk factor for patients. The accuracy of SMTNL2 as a biomarker for heart failure was validated using ROC curves, indicating its potential clinical significance (Wang2024Identification). These findings suggest that SMTNL2 may play a role in the progression of heart failure and could serve as a target for therapeutic interventions.

## Interactions
Smoothelin-like 2 (SMTNL2) is involved in several protein interactions that are crucial for its role in epithelial morphogenesis. SMTNL2 interacts with actin regulatory proteins, specifically coronin-1B (CORO1B) and cortactin (CTTN), forming a complex in the apical domain of epithelial cells. This interaction is essential for stabilizing the apical actin cortex by inhibiting CORO1B, which regulates actin turnover by antagonizing CTTN and the Arp2/3 complex (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike). SMTNL2 preferentially binds to a phosphomimetic mutant of CORO1B, suggesting that it sequesters CORO1B to prevent its inhibition of Arp2/3, thereby reducing actin turnover (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike).

SMTNL2 also interacts with human beta-actin (b-actin), as demonstrated through pull-down binding assays and F-actin co-sedimentation assays. These interactions are relevant to the stabilization of the actin cortex during epithelial morphogenesis (Hachimi2021Smoothelinlike). Additionally, SMTNL2's role in actin nucleation is suggested to be regulated by its phosphorylation at specific sites by JNK, which may influence its interaction with CORO1B and CTTN, facilitating Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation (Benoit2021Cytoskeleton). These interactions highlight SMTNL2's critical function in maintaining cellular structure and integrity.
