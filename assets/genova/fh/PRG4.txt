# PRG4

## Overview
Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) is a gene that encodes the protein lubricin, a mucin-like glycoprotein with significant roles in joint lubrication and tissue homeostasis. Lubricin is primarily synthesized by chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts and is secreted into the synovial fluid, where it functions as a boundary lubricant, reducing friction and protecting cartilage surfaces from wear and damage (Rhee2005The; Das2018Proteoglycan). Beyond its mechanical role, lubricin also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by interacting with cell surface receptors such as CD44 and toll-like receptors, thereby modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining tissue equilibrium (Das2018Proteoglycan). Mutations in the PRG4 gene are linked to Camptodactyly-Arthropathy-Coxa Vara-Pericarditis (CACP) syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by joint and skeletal abnormalities (Johnson2020Syndrome). Additionally, decreased levels of lubricin are associated with osteoarthritis, underscoring its importance in joint health (Ciullini2013CACP).

## Structure
Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), also known as lubricin, is a mucin-like glycoprotein characterized by a complex molecular structure. The primary structure of PRG4 includes a core protein of approximately 1400 amino acid residues, with extensive O-linked glycosylation contributing to over 50% of its mass (Schmidt2009Disulfidebonded). This glycosylation is crucial for its lubricating properties and is primarily located in the central mucin-like domain (Abubacker2015FullLength).

PRG4 contains cysteine-rich globular domains at both the N- and C-termini, which facilitate the formation of intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds, contributing to its quaternary structure as disulfide-bonded multimers (Steele2013Molecular; Schmidt2009Disulfidebonded). These multimers are essential for its biological function in synovial fluid, where they act as boundary lubricants (Schmidt2009Disulfidebonded).

The protein also undergoes post-translational modifications, including proteolytic cleavage, which generates functional fragments such as a 12-14 kDa C-terminal peptide critical for its role in synovial fluid (Steele2013Molecular). PRG4 exhibits multiple isoforms due to alternative splicing, which can result in variations in molecular weight and function (Steele2013Molecular).

## Function
Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), also known as lubricin, is a glycoprotein encoded by the PRG4 gene, playing a crucial role in maintaining joint health and tissue homeostasis. In healthy human cells, PRG4 is primarily involved in the lubrication of articulating cartilage within joints, reducing friction and protecting cartilage surfaces from damage. It is synthesized and secreted by chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts into the synovial fluid, where it acts as a boundary lubricant (Rhee2005The; Das2018Proteoglycan).

PRG4 also functions as an anti-inflammatory agent by interacting with various cell surface receptors, including CD44, toll-like receptors (TLRs), and L-selectin. This interaction helps buffer the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines, maintaining a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, and thus contributing to tissue homeostasis (Das2018Proteoglycan). PRG4's ability to modulate inflammation is supported by its inverse relationship with pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and TNFα, and a proportional relationship with anti-inflammatory mediators such as TGF-β and INF-γ (Das2018Proteoglycan).

In addition to its lubricating and anti-inflammatory roles, PRG4 inhibits synovial cell overgrowth and prevents protein deposition on cartilage surfaces, thereby protecting joints from deterioration and maintaining the integrity of cartilage surfaces (Rhee2005The).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the PRG4 gene, which encodes the glycoprotein lubricin, are primarily associated with Camptodactyly-Arthropathy-Coxa Vara-Pericarditis (CACP) syndrome. This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by a combination of symptoms including camptodactyly, non-inflammatory arthropathy, coxa vara deformity, and pericardial effusion. The condition often presents in early childhood and can be misdiagnosed as juvenile idiopathic arthritis due to overlapping symptoms, although it is distinguished by the absence of inflammatory markers and specific radiological features (Maniscalco2022Pseudorheumatic; Johnson2020Syndrome; Bağrul2023A).

CACP syndrome results from mutations that lead to defective or absent lubricin, impairing joint lubrication and causing synovial hyperplasia and cartilage damage. The syndrome is more prevalent in certain ethnic populations, particularly among consanguineous families (Maniscalco2022Pseudorheumatic). There is no effective treatment for the arthropathy associated with CACP syndrome, and patients typically do not respond to anti-inflammatory medications. Management is primarily symptomatic, with physiotherapy and surgical interventions providing some benefits (Bağrul2023A).

In addition to CACP syndrome, reduced levels of PRG4 are associated with osteoarthritis, highlighting its role in maintaining cartilage integrity and joint function (Ciullini2013CACP).

## Interactions
Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4), also known as lubricin, is involved in several key interactions with other proteins, primarily through its binding to the CD44 receptor. This interaction is significant in modulating inflammatory responses and joint lubrication. PRG4 binds to CD44 in a concentration-dependent manner, exhibiting a higher binding affinity than hyaluronic acid (HA). This binding is crucial for its role in suppressing cytokine-induced proliferation of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA FLS) and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) translocation, which is a key pathway in inflammation (Alquraini2017The; Al‐Sharif2015LubricinProteoglycan).

PRG4 also interacts with toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4), which are involved in immune response modulation. This interaction reduces receptor activation by agonists and decreases TLR2 and TLR4 activation induced by synovial fluid from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients (Alquraini2015The).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), PRG4 enhances the effectiveness of anticancer drugs like sorafenib and regorafenib through its interaction with CD44, suggesting a potential therapeutic role. This interaction is necessary for the observed synergistic effects in drug sensitivity (Dituri2020Proteoglycan4). PRG4's interaction with CD44 also involves competition with hyaluronan, affecting intracellular signaling and cell proliferation (Dituri2020Proteoglycan4).
