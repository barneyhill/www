# CYLD

## Overview
The CYLD gene encodes the CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase, a protein that functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme, primarily involved in the regulation of various cellular processes through the removal of lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from specific substrates. This protein is categorized as a deubiquitinase and plays a critical role in modulating signaling pathways such as NF-κB, which is essential for controlling cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis (Trompouki2003CYLD; Massoumi2010Ubiquitin). The CYLD protein is characterized by its structural domains, including three N-terminal CAP-Gly domains and a C-terminal ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain, which confer its deubiquitinating activity (Yang2016CYLD; Komander2008The). Mutations in the CYLD gene are linked to several hereditary conditions and various cancers, underscoring its significance as a tumor suppressor (Cui2021CYLD; van2010Identification). The regulation of CYLD's activity is achieved through transcriptional and post-translational modifications, ensuring its proper function in maintaining cellular homeostasis (Massoumi2010Ubiquitin).

## Structure
The CYLD protein is composed of 956 amino acids and features several key structural domains. Its primary structure includes three N-terminal CAP-Gly domains and a C-terminal ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) domain, which is crucial for its deubiquitinase activity (Yang2016CYLD; Komander2008The). The USP domain spans residues 583-956 and is organized into subdomains known as Thumb, Palm, and Fingers, with a unique B box module inserted within the Palm subdomain (Komander2008The).

The secondary structure of CYLD includes 6-7% α-helix, 26-29% β-sheet, and 31-33% unordered regions (Johari2018Catalytic). The tertiary structure of the USP domain reveals a distinctive architecture that provides specificity for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, with a catalytic triad of Cys601, His871, and Asp889 (Massoumi2010Ubiquitin; Komander2008The). The B box domain, which resembles RING and B box proteins, plays a role in the protein's cytoplasmic localization (Komander2008The).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, regulate CYLD's activity (Massoumi2010Ubiquitin). The presence of splice variant isoforms can result in different phenotypes, as observed in Cyld-knockout mice (Yang2016CYLD).

## Function
The CYLD gene encodes a deubiquitylating enzyme that plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes in healthy human cells. CYLD primarily functions by removing lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains from specific substrates, which is essential for controlling cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is involved in the regulation of the NF-kB signaling pathway by deubiquitylating TNF receptor-associated factors such as TRAF2 and TRAF6, thereby inhibiting NF-kB activation and promoting programmed cell death (Trompouki2003CYLD; Massoumi2010Ubiquitin). This regulation is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive inflammation (Massoumi2010Ubiquitin).

CYLD also influences cell cycle progression by delaying the G1/S transition through the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression, which is crucial for controlling cell proliferation (Yang2016CYLD). It interacts with microtubules, affecting their dynamics and stability, which is important for processes such as cell migration and mitotic spindle assembly (Yang2016CYLD). CYLD's activity is regulated through various mechanisms, including transcriptional and post-translational modifications, ensuring its proper function in cellular homeostasis (Massoumi2010Ubiquitin).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CYLD gene are associated with several hereditary and sporadic conditions. CYLD cutaneous syndrome, which includes familial cylindromatosis, Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, and multiple familial trichoepithelioma, is characterized by benign skin tumors such as cylindromas, trichoepitheliomas, and spiradenomas, primarily in the head and neck region (Arefi2019Diverse; van2010Identification). These conditions often involve germline mutations in CYLD, leading to loss of function and tumor development (Arruda2019A).

In cancer, CYLD mutations are implicated in the progression of various types, particularly those associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. CYLD alterations are more frequent in HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) compared to HPV-negative cases (Cui2021CYLD). Loss of CYLD function is linked to increased tumorigenesis and malignant transformation in several cancers, including skin, lung, and gastric carcinomas (Cui2021CYLD).

CYLD also plays a role in regulating inflammation and tumorigenesis through pathways like NF-κB and JNK. CYLD-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to colitis-associated tumorigenesis, highlighting its tumor suppressor function (Zhang2006Impaired). In melanoma, CYLD loss accelerates tumor onset and enhances cell migration (Cui2021CYLD).

## Interactions
The CYLD protein interacts with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular processes through its deubiquitinating activity. It interacts with ubiquitin adapters such as p62 and OPTN, targeting substrates like TRAF6 and RIPK1 in NF-κB signaling pathways (Lork2017CYLD). CYLD also associates with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch to modulate the ubiquitination of TAK1, influencing inflammatory signaling (Lork2017CYLD). It binds with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HOIP, part of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, facilitated by SPATA2, which enhances CYLD's deubiquitinating activity (Lork2017CYLD).

CYLD interacts with microtubules and microtubule-binding proteins through its CAP-Gly domains, affecting microtubule dynamics and stability (Yang2016CYLD). It binds to tubulin and microtubules, with its first CAP-Gly domain showing the highest affinity (Yang2016CYLD). CYLD also interacts with EB1 and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), influencing microtubule assembly and stability (Yang2016CYLD).

In NF-κB signaling, CYLD interacts with NEMO, TRAF2, and TRAF6, deubiquitinating these proteins to regulate NF-κB activation (Trompouki2003CYLD). It also binds to Bcl-3, preventing its nuclear translocation and activation (Yang2016CYLD). These interactions highlight CYLD's role in modulating key signaling pathways and cellular structures.
