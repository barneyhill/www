# BIRC6

## Overview
BIRC6, or baculoviral IAP repeat containing 6, is a gene that encodes a large protein known as BRUCE or Apollon, which is categorized as a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and ubiquitin ligase (E2/E3). This protein plays a crucial role in regulating apoptosis and autophagy, two fundamental cellular processes that maintain cellular homeostasis and survival. The BIRC6 protein is characterized by its complex structure, which includes a ubiquitin-like domain, a ubiquitin-conjugating domain, and a baculoviral IAP repeat domain, among others. These structural features enable BIRC6 to interact with and regulate various pro-apoptotic factors, such as SMAC/DIABLO and caspase-9, thereby inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell survival (Hao2004Apollon; Liu2024Molecular). BIRC6 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is implicated in several cancers, where its dysregulation can contribute to tumor progression and resistance to therapy (Gómez2021Exploring; Eskandari2023Evaluation).

## Structure
The BIRC6 protein, also known as BRUCE or Apollon, is a large membrane-associated protein with a molecular weight of approximately 530 kDa. It forms an antiparallel U-shaped dimer, as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) at a resolution of 3.6 Å (Liu2024Molecular; Liu2022Structural). The protein's structure includes multiple domains, such as a ubiquitin-like domain (UBL), a ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, and a single baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain (Ehrmann2022Structural; Liu2024Molecular).

The BIRC6 dimer is stabilized by armadillo-repeat domains (ArmRDs), which consist of 31 armadillo repeats (ArmRs) with several insertion sequences, including jelly-roll-like domains (JRL1 and JRL2), a coiled-coil motif (CC), and a long helical motif (LH) (Liu2024Molecular; Liu2022Structural). The N-terminal region contains a WD40 repeat (WDR) β-propeller domain and a BIR-stabilizing domain (BSD) (Liu2024Molecular).

BIRC6 functions as both a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ubiquitin ligase (E3), promoting the ubiquitylation and degradation of pro-apoptotic factors and autophagic proteins (Liu2024Molecular). The protein's interaction with LC3 involves an LC3-interacting region, which may be exposed following dimer disruption (Liu2022Structural). The structure and function of BIRC6 are regulated by its interaction with SMAC, which affects both apoptotic and autophagic pathways (Ehrmann2022Structural).

## Function
BIRC6, also known as Apollon or BRUCE, is a large protein that plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis and autophagy in human cells. It functions as both a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and ubiquitin ligase (E2/E3), facilitating the ubiquitylation and degradation of pro-apoptotic factors such as SMAC/DIABLO and caspase-9, thereby inhibiting apoptosis (Hao2004Apollon; Liu2024Molecular). BIRC6 contains a baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR) domain and a ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain, which are essential for its interaction with these pro-apoptotic proteins (Liu2024Molecular).

In healthy cells, BIRC6 is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis by controlling the balance between cell death and survival mechanisms. It interacts with the autophagic protein LC3, promoting its ubiquitylation and degradation, which inhibits autophagy (Liu2024Molecular). BIRC6's ability to bind and degrade these proteins is crucial for preventing unwanted cell death and ensuring normal cellular function and development (Hao2004Apollon).

BIRC6 is ubiquitously expressed in human cells and is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy, playing a vital role in cell survival and stress response (Hao2004Apollon; Liu2024Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the BIRC6 gene, also known as baculoviral IAP repeat containing 6, have been implicated in various cancers. In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), BIRC6 is overexpressed, promoting cell proliferation by regulating cyclin D1 and interacting with cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) (Eskandari2023Evaluation). This overexpression is also observed in other cancers such as gastric carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and primary breast cancer, suggesting a role in carcinogenesis (Eskandari2023Evaluation).

In prostate cancer, high BIRC6 expression is associated with advanced pathological stages and poor survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhuang2018Baculoviral). BIRC6 also contributes to drug resistance in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) by mediating resistance to imatinib, a cancer drug, independently of the Mcl-1 protein (Okumu2017BIRC6).

In breast cancer, BIRC6 gene amplifications correlate with higher mRNA expression levels and are linked to more aggressive tumor phenotypes, particularly in estrogen receptor-negative and progesterone receptor-negative samples. High BIRC6 expression is associated with increased expression of metastasis markers and poor prognosis (Gómez2021Exploring). These findings highlight BIRC6's role in tumor progression and resistance to therapy.

## Interactions
BIRC6, also known as BRUCE, is a large protein that interacts with several key proteins involved in apoptosis and autophagy. It binds to the tumor suppressor protein p53, facilitating its degradation through ubiquitination, which contributes to carcinogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Tang2014BIRC6). BIRC6 also interacts with pro-apoptotic factors such as caspases, Smac, and HtrA2. It uses a single BIR domain and an extended central cavity to position these factors in a mutually exclusive manner, driven by differential affinities (Hunkeler2023Structures). Smac binds tightly to BIRC6, displacing caspases and inhibiting BIRC6's anti-apoptotic function (Dietz2022Structural; Hunkeler2023Structures). 

BIRC6 also interacts with the autophagy protein LC3B, negatively regulating autophagy by ubiquitinating and depleting LC3B (Ehrmann2022Structural). The interaction with Smac involves a tripartite mechanism, which includes binding at the BIR domain and electrostatic interactions, effectively inhibiting BIRC6's activity against LC3B and other substrates (Ehrmann2022Structural). These interactions highlight BIRC6's role in balancing apoptosis and autophagy, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions in cancer (Liu2024Molecular).
