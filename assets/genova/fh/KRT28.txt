# KRT28

## Overview
KRT28 is a gene that encodes the protein keratin 28, a type I cytokeratin, which is part of the keratin family of fibrous structural proteins. Keratin 28 is primarily expressed in the hair inner-root-sheath, where it plays a crucial role in the structural integrity and function of hair follicles. The protein is characterized by its central α-helical rod domain, which facilitates the formation of coiled-coil dimers, a common feature among keratins that allows for the assembly into higher-order filamentous structures (Ho2022Update; Werner2020Epithelial). These structural properties are essential for the protein's function in maintaining the mechanical resilience of epithelial cells. KRT28 has evolved from type I keratins in Amphibia ancestors, highlighting its specialized role in vertebrate hair follicle biology (Ho2022Update; Jones2020Assessing).

## Structure
Keratin 28 (KRT28) is a type I cytokeratin, part of the keratin family of fibrous structural proteins. The primary structure of KRT28 consists of a central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. This α-helical domain is organized in a heptad repeat pattern, which facilitates the formation of coiled-coil dimers, a characteristic feature of keratin proteins (Ho2022Update; Werner2020Epithelial). These dimers can further assemble into antiparallel tetramers, which are the basic building blocks for higher-order filamentous structures, contributing to the protein's tertiary and quaternary structures (Ho2022Update).

KRT28, like other keratins, undergoes post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its function and assembly into intermediate filaments (Werner2020Epithelial). These modifications play a role in regulating the dynamics of keratin assembly and its interaction with other cellular components. The expression of KRT28 is tissue-specific, primarily found in the hair inner-root-sheath, and it has evolved from type I keratins in Amphibia ancestors, indicating its specialized role in hair follicle structure and function (Ho2022Update; Jones2020Assessing).
