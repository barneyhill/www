# CD70

## Overview
CD70 is a gene that encodes the CD70 protein, a type II transmembrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily. The CD70 protein plays a pivotal role in the immune system by acting as the sole ligand for the CD27 receptor, which is involved in the activation and regulation of T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. Structurally, CD70 forms a homotrimeric complex that interacts with CD27 in a 3:3 stoichiometry, facilitating critical immune signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, survival, and cytokine production (Izawa2016Inherited; Liu2021Structural). The CD70-CD27 axis is essential for effective immune responses, particularly in the context of viral infections such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Izawa2016Inherited). Dysregulation or mutations in the CD70 gene can lead to immune deficiencies and are implicated in various malignancies, highlighting its clinical significance in both immune function and cancer (Ruf2015pVHLHIFRegulated; Khodzhaev2020Lymphoma).

## Structure
The CD70 protein is a type II transmembrane protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. It forms a stable homotrimer in solution, which is characteristic of its quaternary structure (Liu2021Structural). The primary structure of CD70 includes a TNF homology domain and a stalk region, with specific residues such as N63, T65, C133, C168, P135, and D165 being crucial for its expression and stability (Liu2021Structural). The secondary structure is characterized by a 'jelly-roll' fold built around two beta sheets, typical for TNF ligand trimeric assemblies (Liu2021Structural).

The tertiary structure of CD70 involves unique disulfide bonds, such as C115-C151 and C133-C168, which help maintain the protein's conformation and stabilize the CD27-binding interface (Liu2021Structural). The protein also features N-linked glycan modifications extending from residues N63 and N170, with core fucosylation at N63 (Liu2021Structural). These glycans play a role in shielding the disulfide bond between C168 and C133, which is unique among known TNF ligand structures (Liu2021Structural). The interaction between CD70 and its receptor CD27 involves a 3:3 stoichiometry, with CD70 forming a trimeric complex necessary for its function in T cell activation (Liu2021Structural).

## Function
The CD70 protein, encoded by the CD70 gene, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily and serves as the sole ligand for the CD27 receptor. In healthy human cells, CD70 is transiently expressed on activated macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, B cells, and T cells. Its primary function is to engage with CD27, initiating signaling pathways that are crucial for immune cell activation and function (Izawa2016Inherited; Liu2021Structural).

The interaction between CD70 and CD27 is essential for T-cell activation, proliferation, and survival. This signaling involves the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), such as TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF5, which mediate downstream effects like Janus kinase (JNK) activation and NF-κB pathway modulation. These pathways are vital for the proliferation and cytokine secretion of T cells, as well as their prolonged survival (Liu2021Structural).

CD70 also plays a significant role in B-cell activation and NK cell survival through reverse signaling mechanisms involving PI3K and MEK pathways. This reverse signaling is crucial for immune responses, including the generation of plasma cells and immunoglobulin production (Abolhassani2021Specific; Liu2021Structural). The CD70-CD27 axis is particularly important in the immune response to viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, by facilitating T-cell expansion and cytotoxic effector functions (Izawa2016Inherited).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the CD70 gene are associated with several immune deficiencies and malignancies, particularly those related to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infections. CD70 deficiency can lead to impaired immune responses, resulting in conditions such as lymphoproliferative disorders and EBV-associated lymphomas, including Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (Izawa2016Inherited; Khodzhaev2020Lymphoma). A specific mutation, p.R179X, results in a truncated CD70 protein that is not expressed on the cell surface, leading to a phenotype similar to CD27 deficiency, characterized by high susceptibility to EBV infections (Izawa2016Inherited).

In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), CD70 expression is frequently upregulated due to the dysregulation of the pVHL/HIF pathway. This overexpression is associated with the infiltration of CD27+ lymphocytes and increased serum levels of soluble CD27, correlating with more aggressive tumor behavior and poorer patient outcomes (Ruf2015pVHLHIFRegulated). The CD70-CD27 interaction is crucial for immune surveillance, and its disruption can lead to severe EBV-induced diseases and recurrent infections (Ghosh2020Extended). These findings highlight the clinical significance of CD70 in both immune regulation and cancer development.

## Interactions
CD70, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family, primarily interacts with its receptor CD27. This interaction is crucial for immune regulation, involving T cell activation, proliferation, and survival. The CD70 protein forms a trimeric structure in solution and binds to CD27, forming a 3:3 stoichiometry complex where three CD27 monomers interact with a CD70 homotrimer. The binding interface between CD70 and CD27 is extensive, burying 2440 Å² of solvent-accessible surface area, and is characterized by six ionic interactions and a network of 16 potential hydrogen bonds. These interactions involve specific residues from both proteins, contributing to the stability of the complex (Liu2021Structural).

The interaction between CD70 and CD27 is modulated by structural features such as disulfide bonds and glycosylation sites on CD70, which influence the conformation and stability of the complex. The disulfide bond between C168 and C133 in CD70, although not directly interacting with CD27, likely affects the interaction's conformation. Glycosylation at N170 is crucial for CD70's stability, as mutations in these regions can lead to failed protein expression (Liu2021Structural). CD70's interaction with CD27 is also involved in enhancing the cytotoxic activity of T cells through the perforin/granzyme B pathway (YAMADA2002Involvement).
