# ASAP3

## Overview
ASAP3 is a gene that encodes the protein ArfGAP with SH3 domain, ankyrin repeat, and PH domain 3, which is a focal adhesion-associated Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP). This protein is involved in the regulation of actin stress fibers and plays a crucial role in cell migration and invasion. It is characterized by several functional domains, including the BAR, PH, ArfGAP, and ankyrin repeat domains, which contribute to its role in membrane binding, curvature, and protein-protein interactions. The protein's activity is lipid-dependent, with phosphoinositides such as PI(4,5)P2 being significant for its function. ASAP3 interacts with small GTPases like Arf6, influencing cytoskeletal organization and membrane trafficking, and is implicated in various cellular processes, including wound healing and cancer cell invasion (Qian2017ASAP3; Ha2008ASAP3).

## Structure
ASAP3 is a protein characterized by several functional domains, including the BAR (Bin, Amphiphysin, and Rvs) domain, PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain, ArfGAP domain, and ankyrin repeat (ANK) domain. The BAR and PH domains form a homodimer with a curved structure, which is crucial for membrane binding and curvature, particularly in the context of microvilli structure in gastric parietal cells (Qian2017ASAP3). The ArfGAP domain is involved in regulating GTPase activity, specifically interacting with Arf6, which plays a role in actin assembly and membrane remodeling (Qian2017ASAP3; Ha2008ASAP3). The ankyrin repeats contribute to protein-protein interactions, stabilizing the complex formed with Arf6 (Qian2017ASAP3).

ASAP3 lacks the SH3 domain found in related proteins like ASAP1 and ASAP2, which differentiates its cellular functions, particularly in cell migration and invasion (Ha2008ASAP3). The protein's activity is lipid-dependent, with PI(4,5)P2 identified as a relevant activating lipid, highlighting the importance of the PH domain in its function (Ha2008ASAP3). The protein's structure and domain composition suggest a role in maintaining actin stress fibers and influencing cell migration dynamics (Ha2008ASAP3).

## Function
ASAP3 is a focal adhesion-associated Arf GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that plays a significant role in cell migration and invasion. It is involved in the regulation of actin stress fibers, which are crucial for maintaining cell shape and motility. ASAP3 specifically acts on Arf5, with its activity being stimulated by phosphoinositides such as PI(4,5)P2. The protein's PH domain is essential for its GAP activity, which influences cytoskeletal organization and membrane trafficking (Ha2008ASAP3).

In healthy human cells, ASAP3 is associated with focal adhesions, where it colocalizes with markers like vinculin and paxillin. It does not affect the structure of focal adhesions directly but is involved in the regulation of actin stress fibers. Reduction of ASAP3 expression disrupts the actin stress fiber network and decreases phosphorylated myosin levels, which can be restored by expressing siRNA-resistant ASAP3 (Ha2008ASAP3).

ASAP3's role in cell motility is highlighted by its involvement in processes such as wound healing and cell invasion, as demonstrated in studies using cancer cell lines. However, it does not appear to influence cell proliferation in these contexts (Ha2008ASAP3).

## Clinical Significance
ASAP3 has been implicated in various cancers due to alterations in its expression levels. In lung adenocarcinoma, ASAP3 is significantly upregulated, correlating with larger tumors, lymph node metastasis, poor differentiation, and advanced TNM stage. Patients with high ASAP3 expression have shorter overall survival times, suggesting its role in tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis (ASAP3; Zhang2019&lt; p&gt). Similarly, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), higher ASAP3 expression is associated with shorter survival times and increased invasiveness of cancer cells, indicating its potential as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target (Fan2013ASAP3).

In colorectal cancer (CRC), ASAP3 expression is elevated and linked to advanced cancer stages and poor prognosis. It interacts with the NF-kB pathway, promoting tumor growth and metastasis, and serves as a potential biomarker for CRC progression (Tian2017Upregulation).

In gliomas, ASAP3 is overexpressed, particularly in glioblastoma multiforme, and is associated with worse overall and progression-free survival. Its expression correlates with the NOTCH signaling pathway, suggesting a role in tumor cell adhesion and migration (Su2022The). These findings highlight ASAP3's clinical significance in cancer progression and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
ASAP3 is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. It interacts with Arf6, a small GTPase, through its ArfGAP and ANK domains, which are crucial for regulating actin assembly and microvilli structure in gastric parietal cells (Qian2017ASAP3). The interaction with Arf6 is linked to the regulation of gastric acid secretion, as ASAP3 deficiency leads to hyperactivation of Arf6, resulting in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and altered microvilli structure (Qian2017ASAP3).

ASAP3 also interacts with the b1 integrin tail, a process mediated by growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) and influenced by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, which phosphorylates tyrosine 733 on ASAP3 (Vitali2017Arf). This interaction is thought to play a role in integrin recycling, although the exact mechanism remains speculative (Vitali2017Arf).

In the context of cell adhesion, ASAP3 is associated with focal adhesions, structures that mediate cell attachment and movement. However, it is not found in podosomes, which are related to cell migration and invasion (Campa2008Arf). These interactions highlight ASAP3's role in cellular dynamics and its potential as a therapeutic target.
