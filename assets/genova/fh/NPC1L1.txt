# NPC1L1

## Overview
The NPC1L1 gene encodes the NPC1 like intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 protein, which is a critical polytopic membrane protein involved in cholesterol absorption and homeostasis. This protein is primarily located in the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, where it facilitates the uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol, playing a vital role in maintaining cholesterol balance within the body (Davis2009Niemann–Pick). Structurally, NPC1L1 is characterized by 13 transmembrane helices and several functional domains, including a sterol-sensing domain crucial for cholesterol binding and transport (Wang2009Membrane; Huang2020CryoEM). The protein's function is regulated by cellular cholesterol levels and is subject to inhibition by pharmacological agents such as ezetimibe, which underscores its significance in therapeutic strategies for hypercholesterolemia and related metabolic disorders (Betters2010NPC1L1). Mutations in the NPC1L1 gene have been linked to variations in cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular disease risk, highlighting its clinical importance (Unknownauthors2015MutationsinNPC1L1andcoronaryheartdisease).

## Structure
The NPC1L1 protein is a critical component in cholesterol absorption, characterized by a complex molecular structure. It is a polytopic membrane protein with 13 transmembrane helices, and its NH2-terminus is located in the lumen, while the COOH-terminus projects into the cytosol (Wang2009Membrane). The protein includes several domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD), middle luminal domain (MLD), C-terminal domain (CTD), and a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) located between transmembrane helices 3 and 7 (Wang2009Membrane; Huang2020CryoEM).

The NTD is composed of nine helices and a mixed three-strand β-sheet, connected to the first transmembrane segment through a proline-rich segment (Huang2020CryoEM). The SSD is crucial for cholesterol binding and transport, featuring a V-shaped hydrophobic cavity accessible from both luminal domains and the lipid bilayer (Huang2020CryoEM). The protein's structure allows for the formation of a continuous tunnel connecting the NTD to the SSD, facilitating cholesterol transport (Huang2020CryoEM).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, and NPC1L1 has splice variant isoforms that can affect its function and localization (Wang2009Membrane). The protein's structural flexibility and domain interactions are essential for its role in cholesterol absorption and its inhibition by drugs like ezetimibe (Huang2020CryoEM).

## Function
The NPC1L1 protein is a critical component in cholesterol transport and homeostasis in human cells. It is primarily located at the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, where it facilitates the uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol from the intestinal lumen into the cells (Davis2004NiemannPick; Davis2009Niemann–Pick). This process is essential for the absorption of cholesterol, which is a vital structural component of cell membranes and a precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids (Jia2011NiemannPick).

NPC1L1 operates through a clathrin-mediated endocytic process, where it interacts with the μ2 subunit of adaptor protein complex 2 and clathrin, indicating its role in cholesterol uptake is clathrin-mediated (Jia2011NiemannPick). The protein's activity is regulated by cellular cholesterol content, and its expression is downregulated by high-cholesterol diets (Davis2009Niemann–Pick).

In addition to its role in the intestine, NPC1L1 is expressed in the liver, where it is involved in the regulation of biliary cholesterol excretion, potentially preventing excessive cholesterol loss by retrieving cholesterol from bile (Jia2011NiemannPick). The inhibition of NPC1L1 by ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, underscores its importance in cholesterol metabolism and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia and related metabolic disorders (Davis2004NiemannPick; Betters2010NPC1L1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NPC1L1 gene have significant clinical implications, particularly in cholesterol metabolism and related diseases. Inactivating mutations in NPC1L1 are associated with reduced plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and a decreased risk of coronary heart disease. Carriers of these mutations exhibit a 53% reduction in coronary heart disease risk, highlighting the protective cardiovascular effects of reduced NPC1L1 activity (Unknownauthors2015MutationsinNPC1L1andcoronaryheartdisease; Pirillo2016NiemannPick).

Alterations in NPC1L1 expression or function can also impact metabolic disorders. NPC1L1 is implicated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), where its hepatic expression exacerbates diet-induced steatosis. Inhibition of NPC1L1 with ezetimibe has been shown to prevent steatosis and improve metabolic conditions such as insulin resistance and obesity in animal models (Toyoda2019Pathophysiological; Betters2010NPC1L1).

Genetic variants in NPC1L1 can influence cholesterol absorption efficiency, affecting plasma LDL-C levels and potentially leading to coronary heart disease. Some variants, like rs4720470, increase the risk of premature coronary disease, while others lower LDL-C levels and reduce cardiovascular risk (Zhao2021Effect; Cohen2006Multiple). These findings underscore the gene's role in cholesterol-related pathologies and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
NPC1L1 interacts with several proteins that are crucial for its role in cholesterol absorption. It is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where it interacts with the clathrin heavy chain and the μ2 subunit of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2). This interaction is facilitated by the YXXØ motif in NPC1L1, which is essential for its endocytic pathway (Pirillo2016NiemannPick; Jia2011NiemannPick). NPC1L1 also forms complexes with flotillin, a lipid raft protein, to create cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains necessary for initiating endocytosis (Pirillo2016NiemannPick).

The protein's interaction with ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, is significant. Ezetimibe binds directly to NPC1L1, blocking its endocytosis and inhibiting cholesterol uptake (Wang2009Membrane). This interaction is specific to NPC1L1, as evidenced by the absence of ezetimibe binding in NPC1L1-null mice (Jia2011NiemannPick). Ezetimibe may also inhibit NPC1L1 by stabilizing inter-domain interactions, thereby blocking cholesterol transport (Saha2020Interdomain). These interactions highlight the critical role of NPC1L1 in cholesterol metabolism and its regulation by pharmacological agents.
