# FANCG

## Overview
FANCG is a gene that encodes the FA complementation group G protein, a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is involved in DNA repair processes. The FA complementation group G protein is characterized by the presence of multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which facilitate protein-protein interactions essential for the assembly and stabilization of the FA protein core complex (Blom2004Multiple). As a part of the nuclear core complex, FANCG plays a significant role in the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, key steps in the DNA repair process (Wilson2008FANCG; Hussain2003Direct). Mutations in the FANCG gene are associated with Fanconi anemia, a disorder characterized by bone marrow failure and increased cancer risk, highlighting the gene's critical role in maintaining genomic stability (Auerbach2003Spectrum; Demuth2000Spectrum).

## Structure
The FANCG protein is characterized by the presence of multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are 34-amino-acid sequences that form a right-handed superhelical structure. These motifs facilitate protein-protein interactions and are crucial for the assembly and stabilization of the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein core complex (Blom2004Multiple). FANCG contains at least seven TPR motifs, which cover a major part of the protein and are essential for its function (Blom2004Multiple).

The interaction between FANCG and other FA proteins, such as FANCA, is mediated by these TPR motifs. Specific regions of FANCG, including residues 209-581, are necessary for its interaction with FANCA (Blom2004Multiple). The FANCA-FANCG complex forms a 2:2 hetero-tetramer, with FANCG molecules positioned at the ends of FANCA's N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Jeong2020Structural).

Mutations in the TPR motifs, such as G521E and G546R, can disrupt the protein's function, leading to instability and failure to correct cellular defects in FA-G cells (Blom2004Multiple). These structural features highlight the importance of TPR motifs in the molecular function of FANCG within the FA pathway.

## Function
The FANCG protein is a crucial component of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, which is essential for DNA repair processes, particularly in response to DNA crosslinking damage. FANCG is part of a nuclear core complex that includes other FA proteins such as FANCA and FANCC. This complex is vital for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, key steps in the DNA repair process (Wilson2008FANCG; Hussain2003Direct). FANCG interacts directly with FANCA, stabilizing both proteins and facilitating their nuclear accumulation, which is necessary for the formation of a functional DNA repair complex (Thompson2005How; de2000The).

FANCG also plays a role in homologous recombination repair (HRR) by forming a complex with BRCA2, FANCD2, and XRCC3, known as the D1-D2-G-X3 complex. This complex is essential for maintaining chromosome stability and is involved in the repair of broken replication forks (Wilson2008FANCG). The phosphorylation of FANCG at serine 7 is critical for its interaction with BRCA2 and XRCC3, highlighting its role in facilitating protein-protein interactions necessary for DNA repair (Wilson2008FANCG). Through these interactions, FANCG contributes to genomic stability and prevents chromosomal breakage in healthy human cells (GarciaHiguera1999Fanconi).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the FANCG gene are associated with Fanconi anemia (FA), a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder. FA is characterized by progressive bone marrow failure, increased risk of malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia, and various congenital abnormalities including growth retardation, skeletal defects, and skin hyperpigmentation (Auerbach2003Spectrum; Demuth2000Spectrum). The FANCG gene, also known as XRCC9, plays a crucial role in DNA repair, particularly in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks, which is a hallmark of FA (Demuth2000Spectrum).

Mutations in FANCG often result in protein truncation due to small deletions, insertions, or splice site mutations, leading to frame shifts and premature termination of translation (Demuth2000Spectrum). Specific mutations, such as the founder mutation E105X in German patients, are associated with an earlier onset of hematological disorders in FA-G patients (Demuth2000Spectrum). Ethnic-specific mutations have been identified, suggesting founder effects in certain populations (Auerbach2003Spectrum).

Alterations in FANCG expression or its interactions can disrupt DNA repair, contributing to genomic instability and disease. The FANCG protein is part of a nuclear complex with FANCA and FANCC, essential for maintaining chromosome stability and proper DNA repair functions (GarciaHiguera1999Fanconi).

## Interactions
FANCG, a protein involved in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, participates in several critical protein interactions essential for DNA repair processes. It forms a nuclear complex with FANCA and FANCC, which is crucial for DNA repair mechanisms, particularly in response to DNA cross-linking agents (GarciaHiguera1999Fanconi). FANCG interacts with the ERCC1-XPF endonuclease, a key player in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). This interaction is facilitated by FANCG's tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, which are important for protein-protein interactions (Wang2010The).

FANCG also interacts with BRCA2, FANCD2, and XRCC3, forming a complex involved in homologous recombination repair (HRR). The phosphorylation of FANCG at serine 7 is essential for these interactions, indicating its role as a scaffold for assembling or stabilizing protein complexes (Wilson2008FANCG). Additionally, FANCG interacts with CYP2E1, suggesting a role in protecting against oxidative DNA damage (Futaki2002The).

The protein also mediates interactions within the FA protein complex, interacting with FANCA and FANCF, and is necessary for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 (Gordon2003Fanconi; Medhurst2001Direct). These interactions highlight FANCG's central role in maintaining chromosome stability and facilitating DNA repair.
