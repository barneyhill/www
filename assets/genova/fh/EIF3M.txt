# EIF3M

## Overview
EIF3M is a gene that encodes the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit M (eIF3m), a critical component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. This complex is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells, acting as a scaffold to facilitate the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit with mRNA and initiator tRNA (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:; Valášek2017Embraced). The eIF3m protein is involved in the structural integrity and function of the eIF3 complex, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression and cellular growth (Valášek2017Embraced). It is particularly significant in the translation of a wide array of mRNAs, underscoring its importance in global protein synthesis (Zhou2005PCI). EIF3M's involvement in various cellular processes and its overexpression in certain cancers, such as colon adenocarcinoma and gliomas, highlight its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker (Wang2019High; Chai2019Systematically).

## Function
EIF3M is a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, which plays a crucial role in the initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. In healthy human cells, EIF3M is involved in the assembly of the 40S ribosomal subunit with mRNA and initiator tRNA, facilitating the start of translation (Valášek2017Embraced). The eIF3 complex acts as a scaffold, organizing interactions among several initiation factors on the 40S subunit, which is essential for the recruitment of mRNA and the scanning for the AUG start codon (Hinnebusch2006eIF3:).

EIF3M is active in the cytoplasm, where it contributes to the regulation of gene expression and cellular growth (Valášek2017Embraced). It is necessary for maintaining the structural integrity and translation initiation function of the eIF3 complex, which is vital for cellular protein synthesis and polysome formation (Wang2019High). The presence of EIF3M in the eIF3 complex is essential for the translation of a wide array of mRNAs, indicating its critical role in global protein synthesis (Zhou2005PCI). This function is crucial for cell viability and the proper execution of cellular processes.

## Clinical Significance
EIF3M has been implicated in various cancers, particularly colon adenocarcinoma. Studies have shown that EIF3M expression is significantly higher in colon adenocarcinoma tissues compared to normal colon tissues. This overexpression is associated with larger tumor size and advanced Dukes' stage, serving as an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with colon adenocarcinoma (Wang2019High). The Oncomine database analysis supports these findings, indicating higher EIF3M expression in colon adenocarcinoma compared to other gastrointestinal tumors (Wang2019High).

EIF3M is also involved in regulating tumorigenesis-related genes and pathways, such as the AKT/PI3K/mTOR pathway. Silencing EIF3M induces apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target (Wang2019High). Beyond colon cancer, EIF3M overexpression has been observed in other cancer types, including testicular seminoma cells, indicating its broader role in oncogenesis (Valášek2017Embraced).

In gliomas, EIF3M is identified as a risky subunit, with its expression levels significantly correlated with poorer overall survival, highlighting its prognostic value in these tumors (Chai2019Systematically).

## Interactions
EIF3M, a subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex, plays a crucial role in protein synthesis by interacting with various components of the translation machinery. EIF3M is part of a distinct eIF3 complex that includes core eIF3 subunits but lacks eIF3d and eIF3e, indicating its unique role within the eIF3 complex (Zhou2005PCI). It is involved in the structural assembly of the eIF3 complex, contributing to the octamer formation alongside other subunits such as eIF3a, eIF3b, eIF3c, and eIF3f (Valášek2017Embraced).

EIF3M interacts with a broad range of mRNAs, suggesting its involvement in global translation initiation. It associates with a larger number of mRNAs compared to eIF3e, highlighting its essential role in protein synthesis (Zhou2005PCI). The eIF3m complex is crucial for the formation of the 43S preinitiation complex by binding to the 40S ribosome and facilitating the loading of the Met-tRNA/eIF2•GTP ternary complex (Zhou2005PCI).

In the context of triple-negative breast cancer, eIF3m is implicated in maintaining the integrity of the eIF3 complex, which is essential for RNA transport and translation initiation. It interacts with ribosomes and mRNAs, potentially influencing the expression of oncogenes (Han2020Roles).
