# GPR34

## Overview
GPR34 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 34, a member of the rhodopsin-like class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This receptor is characterized by its seven transmembrane domains and is primarily involved in immune modulation and cellular signaling. GPR34 is activated by lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS), a lipid molecule, and is predominantly expressed in immune cells such as microglia, mast cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages. The receptor plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including immune response regulation and tissue repair. Structurally, GPR34 features a unique ligand-binding pocket and interacts with the Gi protein to mediate intracellular signaling pathways. Clinically, alterations in the GPR34 gene have been associated with lymphoid malignancies, including marginal zone lymphoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (14; Baens2011t(X; Liu2023Structural; Schöneberg2018The)(p11.4;q32.33) page 1 of 2).

## Structure
GPR34 is a classical rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) characterized by hallmark motifs such as the DRY sequence at the C terminus of transmembrane helix 3 (TM3), a disulfide bond between extracellular loops 1 and 2 (ECL1-2), and the N/DPXXY motif in TM7. The receptor forms a compact bundle of α-helices, with a notably long TM5. The N terminus contains three putative N-glycosylation sites, which have been experimentally confirmed to be glycosylated. GPR34 lacks a signal peptide for membrane insertion, relying on basic amino acid residues flanking TM1 for proper insertion (Schöneberg2018The).

The GPR34 gene is primarily intronless in its protein-coding sequence, but splice variants exist that impact the coding region, including a cryptic intron that shortens the N terminus by 23 amino acids. These variants contribute to protein diversity, with alternative transcription start sites, splicing, and translation initiation sites being functionally tolerated (Schöneberg2018The).

Structurally, GPR34 has a unique binding pocket that includes an inner polar subpocket and a lateral hydrophobic subpocket. The ligand-entry mechanism involves entering the binding pocket from the lateral cleft between TM4 and TM5 (Liu2023Structural). The receptor's structure is conserved due to its stable synteny with CASK (Schöneberg2018The).

## Function
GPR34 is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a significant role in immune modulation and cellular signaling in healthy human cells. It is primarily expressed in immune cells such as microglia, mast cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages, where it is involved in immune and neurological processes (Liu2023Structural). GPR34 is activated by lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS), a lipid molecule that interacts with the receptor's ligand-binding pocket, which is open towards the membrane, allowing lipidic agonists to enter (Izume2023Structural). The receptor's activation involves specific interactions with charged residues, facilitating the binding of LysoPS and leading to receptor activation (Izume2023Structural).

In terms of cellular function, GPR34 is implicated in processes such as delayed hypersensitivity, dendritic cell apoptosis, and tissue repair, particularly by sensing LysoPS released by apoptotic cells (Liu2023Structural). The receptor's activation is linked to intracellular signaling pathways that include ERK, CREB, AP-1, PKC, and NF-B, which are involved in cell proliferation and immune response regulation (Ansell2012t(X; 14)(p11;q32) page 5 of 6). These molecular activities underscore GPR34's role in maintaining immune homeostasis and responding to cellular stressors.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the GPR34 gene have been implicated in various lymphoid malignancies. In marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), the t(X;14)(p11.4;q32.33) translocation is associated with significant up-regulation of GPR34, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease through activation of the NF-kB pathway (14; Baens2011t(X)(p11.4;q32.33) page 1 of 2). In mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, GPR34 mutations, often nonsense or frameshift changes, are found predominantly in the salivary gland and are linked to deregulation through chromosomal translocations (Moody2018Novel). These mutations can lead to constitutive receptor activation, contributing to lymphoma development (MartinezCliment2018Gprotein).

GPR34 is also involved in leukemogenesis, particularly in Bcr-Abl-positive leukemia, where its dysregulation affects the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, influencing cell proliferation and survival (Zuo2014Gprotein). Overexpression of GPR34 in lymphoma cells results in increased cell proliferation and activation of signaling pathways such as ERK and PKC, suggesting its role in tumor growth (Ansell2012t(X; 14)(p11;q32) page 0 of 6). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GPR34 in various cancers, suggesting it as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

## Interactions
GPR34 interacts with the Gi protein, forming a complex that is crucial for its signaling function. The interaction between GPR34 and Gi involves specific structural features, such as the inward displacement of the extracellular portion of TM6, which facilitates the formation of a central core interaction. This interaction is characterized by unique features at the GPR34-Gi interface, particularly at the intracellular loop 2 (ICL2), which affects the orientation of the α5-helix of Gi. Unlike other GPCR-Gi complexes, the hydrophobic residues in ICL2 of GPR34 do not fit into the typical hydrophobic pocket of Gi, resulting in a distinct perpendicular orientation of the α5-helix (Izume2023Structural).

The GPR34-Gi complex is stabilized by the addition of Nb35 or scFv16, which are used in structural studies to maintain the integrity of the complex during analysis (Liu2023Structural). The interaction with Gi is essential for GPR34's role in modulating cAMP levels via the Gi pathway, and mutations at the G protein-coupling sites can impair GPR34 activity, underscoring the importance of these interactions for receptor function (Liu2023Structural). There is no mention of GPR34 interacting with nucleic acids in the provided context.
