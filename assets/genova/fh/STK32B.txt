# STK32B

## Overview
STK32B is a gene that encodes the protein serine/threonine kinase 32B, a member of the kinase family involved in the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on target proteins. This post-translational modification is essential for regulating various cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. The protein encoded by STK32B, also known as YANK2, is primarily active in the cytoplasm and is implicated in neuronal functions and development, potentially influencing pathways such as olfactory signaling, calcium ion transmembrane transport, and axon guidance (Liao2020Transcriptomic; Temtamy2008Long). While the specific roles of STK32B in healthy cells are not fully characterized, its involvement in these pathways suggests a significant role in the nervous system's function and health. Additionally, alterations in STK32B expression have been linked to various diseases, highlighting its potential clinical significance (Liao2020Transcriptomic).

## Structure


## Function
STK32B (serine/threonine kinase 32B) is a protein-coding gene involved in phosphorylation, a critical process for regulating cellular activities. As a kinase, STK32B transfers phosphate groups to serine/threonine residues on target proteins, influencing various signal transduction pathways, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to external stimuli. STK32B is active in the cytoplasm, where it may impact neuronal functions and development (Temtamy2008Long).

The gene is transcribed and translated into YANK2, a serine/threonine kinase, although its specific function in healthy cells is not well characterized (Liao2020Transcriptomic). The protein's role in cell biology includes potential involvement in olfactory signaling, calcium ion transmembrane transport, and axon guidance, as suggested by studies on its overexpression (Liao2020Transcriptomic). These pathways are significant for neuronal communication and development, indicating that STK32B may play a role in the nervous system's function and health. Despite these insights, the precise molecular activities and organismal outcomes of STK32B in healthy human cells remain to be fully elucidated.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the STK32B gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In essential tremor (ET), a common movement disorder, overexpression of STK32B is associated with dysregulation in pathways such as olfactory signaling and calcium ion transmembrane transport. This dysregulation may contribute to symptoms like olfactory loss and tremors in ET patients. The gene's overexpression also affects the expression of other genes linked to ET, such as FUS and calcium voltage-gated channel genes CACNA1C and CACNA1A, suggesting a complex role in the disease's pathogenesis (Liao2020Transcriptomic).

In Ellis–van Creveld (EvC) syndrome, a genetic deletion involving STK32B, along with other genes, has been identified. This deletion is associated with borderline intelligence, suggesting that the loss of STK32B may contribute to mild intellectual deficits. The deletion is mediated by recombination between LINE-1 elements, highlighting the gene's potential involvement in neurological development and function (Temtamy2008Long). These findings indicate that STK32B may have pleiotropic effects, influencing both neurological and cardiovascular systems, and its dysregulation can lead to diverse clinical manifestations.
