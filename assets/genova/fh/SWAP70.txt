# SWAP70

## Overview
SWAP70 is a gene that encodes the protein known as switching B cell complex subunit SWAP70, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell signaling. The SWAP70 protein is characterized by its multidomain structure, including an EF-hand motif, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which facilitate its interactions with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) and actin filaments (Sivalenka2008SWAP‐70; Kriplani2019SWAP70). This protein plays a critical role in the organization of actin filaments, influencing cell shape, motility, and immune responses, particularly in B lymphocytes (Gupta2003Molecular; Chiyomaru2011SWAP70). SWAP70's interactions with proteins such as Rac1 and its involvement in cellular processes like membrane ruffling underscore its importance in cellular dynamics and signaling pathways (Ihara2006Direct). Additionally, alterations in SWAP70 expression and mutations have been linked to oncogenic transformation and autoimmune diseases, highlighting its clinical significance (Kwon2020Genomewide; Fukui2010A).

## Structure
The SWAP70 protein is a multidomain protein with several key structural features. It contains an N-terminal EF-hand motif, which is potentially involved in calcium binding, and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), facilitating its membrane localization (Sivalenka2008SWAP‐70; Kriplani2019SWAP70). The PH domain is crucial for SWAP70's function, as mutations affecting PIP3 binding impair its localization to membrane ruffles (Sivalenka2008SWAP‐70). The protein also includes a Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is involved in guanine nucleotide exchange, although its activity in catalyzing exchange is debated (Kriplani2019SWAP70). The C-terminal region contains an actin-binding motif essential for its interaction with F-actin, particularly non-muscle actin, which is significant for processes like membrane ruffling (Kriplani2019SWAP70; Ihara2006Direct).

SWAP70 forms stable oligomers, with dimerization being necessary for its function in F-actin bundling. The dimerization region is near the C-terminus, with specific residues such as R546 playing a crucial role (Betaneli2020Mechanism). The protein's translocation to the cytoplasmic membrane and its dimerization are mediated by PIP3 and non-phosphorylated Y426 (Betaneli2020Mechanism).

## Function
SWAP70 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell signaling. It is involved in the organization of actin filaments, which influences cell shape and motility. SWAP70 is primarily active in the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it contributes to processes such as B cell activation and migration, impacting immune response and development (Gupta2003Molecular; Chiyomaru2011SWAP70).

In healthy human cells, SWAP70 is associated with a subset of actin filaments in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles of motile cells. It alters actin organization and lamellipodial morphology, which is essential for cell adhesion, homotopic cell aggregation, and migration (Chiyomaru2011SWAP70). SWAP70's unique domain structure, with a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain at the N-terminus of the Dbl-homology (DH) domain, distinguishes it from other Rho-GEFs and is critical for its function in actin dynamics (Gupta2003Molecular).

SWAP70 is primarily expressed in activated mature B lymphocytes, with lower levels in mast cells and fibroblasts. Its expression pattern is linked to its role in antibody production and mast cell development, as evidenced by defects observed in SWAP70-deficient mice (Gupta2003Molecular).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the SWAP70 gene have been implicated in various diseases and pathological conditions. The SWAP-70-374 mutant, characterized by specific point mutations, has been shown to transform mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), leading to morphological changes, rapid growth, and loss of contact inhibition, which are indicative of oncogenic transformation. This suggests a potential role for SWAP-70 mutations in cancer development (Fukui2010A). The mutant form SWAP-70-374 localizes to the plasma membrane without external stimulation and exhibits a higher affinity for F-actin, which may contribute to its role in cellular transformation (Fukui2010A).

SWAP70 has also been associated with autoimmune diseases. A genome-wide association study identified SWAP70 as a susceptibility locus for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a Korean population, suggesting its involvement in RA pathogenesis. Genetic defects in SWAP70 have been linked to lupus-like symptoms and the accumulation of regulatory T cells in experimental murine models, indicating a potential role in autoimmune disorders (Kwon2020Genomewide). These findings highlight the clinical significance of SWAP70 in both cancer and autoimmune diseases.

## Interactions
SWAP70 interacts with several proteins and plays a significant role in cellular processes through these interactions. It binds to activated Rac1, a small GTPase, acting as an effector in signaling pathways. This interaction is specific to the GTP-bound form of Rac1, indicating that SWAP70 functions downstream of Rac1 in cellular signaling (Ihara2006Direct). SWAP70 also directly binds to F-actin, particularly through its C-terminal region, which is crucial for its role in membrane ruffling and actin cytoskeleton dynamics (Ihara2006Direct).

The protein's interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) is essential for its membrane association and subsequent dimerization, which is necessary for its function in F-actin bundling (Betaneli2020Mechanism). SWAP70's dimerization is facilitated by specific amino acid residues, such as R546, which are critical for its ability to bundle F-actin (Betaneli2020Mechanism).

In the context of cancer, SWAP70 has been shown to regulate the expression of CD44s, a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cellular adhesion and movement, suggesting a regulatory relationship that affects glioblastoma cell migration and invasion (Shi2019SWAP70). These interactions highlight SWAP70's multifaceted role in cellular dynamics and signaling.
