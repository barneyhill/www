# NDRG1

## Overview
NDRG1 (N-myc downstream regulated gene 1) is a gene that encodes a cytoplasmic protein involved in a variety of cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and stress response. The protein, also known as N-myc downstream regulated 1, is characterized by a central α/β hydrolase fold and is part of the NDRG protein family, which includes NDRG2 and NDRG3 (Mustonen2021Crystal; Beniamino2022The). NDRG1 plays a significant role in myelination and tumor suppression, and it is known to interact with lipid membranes and undergo conformational changes (Mustonen2021Crystal). The protein is involved in key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and interacts with proteins like β-catenin and E-cadherin, which are crucial for cell adhesion and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Sun2013Metastasis; Fang2014Molecular). NDRG1's clinical significance is underscored by its association with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Lom (HMSNL) and its dual role in cancer as both a tumor suppressor and promoter, depending on the context (Xu2022Clinical; Hunter2003Mutation).

## Structure
The NDRG1 protein, encoded by the NDRG1 gene, is characterized by a central α/β hydrolase fold, a structural motif common to the NDRG protein family, which includes NDRG2 and NDRG3 (Mustonen2021Crystal; Beniamino2022The). This fold consists of a central beta sheet surrounded by alpha helices, forming a globular core domain (Mustonen2021Crystal). The protein has a short N-terminal region and a flexible C-terminal region, both of which are predominantly disordered (Beniamino2022The). The C-terminal region, referred to as hNDRG1*C, contains 83 residues rich in charged residues and includes a repeated decapeptide sequence that binds transition metal ions such as Ni(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Mn(II), and Co(II) (Beniamino2022The).

NDRG1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which regulates its biological functions and subcellular localization (Mustonen2021Crystal; Beniamino2022The). The protein is involved in various cellular processes, such as myelination and tumor suppression, and interacts with lipid membranes, undergoing conformational changes upon interaction (Mustonen2021Crystal). NDRG1 is expressed in myelin-forming cells and is crucial for myelin formation and maintenance (Mustonen2021Crystal).

## Function
NDRG1 (N-myc downstream regulated 1) is a gene that encodes a protein involved in various cellular processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and stress response. In healthy human cells, NDRG1 is associated with cellular differentiation and low proliferative activity, particularly in differentiated epithelial cells across various tissues such as the digestive tract, reproductive system, and skin (Lachat2002Expression). The protein is primarily localized in the cytoplasm but also associates with the cell membrane and nucleus, playing a role in cell adhesion and being present at adherens junctions (Lachat2002Expression).

NDRG1 is upregulated under anoxic conditions, with mRNA levels increasing significantly during anoxia, suggesting a role in cellular adaptation to hypoxic stress (Lachat2002Expression). The protein is involved in the regulation of cell growth arrest and terminal differentiation, as its expression is upregulated in differentiating cells that cease to proliferate (Piquemal1999Differential). NDRG1 is also phosphorylated by SGK1 and GSK3, which is crucial for its function in cellular signaling pathways (MURRAY2004Exploitation). This phosphorylation process involves specific threonine and serine residues, indicating a regulatory mechanism in cellular processes (MURRAY2004Exploitation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the NDRG1 gene are associated with several diseases and conditions. In hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Lom (HMSNL), a severe form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, specific mutations such as R148X and IVS8^1G4A have been identified. These mutations lead to severe demyelinating neuropathy, with the R148X mutation being a founder mutation among the Romani population (Hunter2003Mutation).

In cancer, NDRG1 plays a complex role, acting as both a tumor suppressor and promoter depending on the context. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), NDRG1 shows a high mutation rate and its hypermethylation is associated with better clinical prognosis (Xu2022Clinical). In breast cancer, NDRG1 is considered a tumor suppressor, with its expression modulated by DNA methylation. Aberrant methylation correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor clinical outcomes (Han2013Aberrant). In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), down-regulation of NDRG1 is linked to metastasis and poor prognosis, as it induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (de2020NDRG1).

NDRG1's expression levels and interactions also influence cancer progression, with its dysregulation affecting cell growth, differentiation, and stress responses (Bae2013The).

## Interactions
N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is involved in various protein interactions that contribute to its role in cellular processes and cancer progression. NDRG1 interacts with β-catenin and E-cadherin, which are crucial for cell adhesion and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. These interactions help stabilize adherens junctions, enhancing cell adhesion and potentially inhibiting metastasis (Sun2013Metastasis; Fang2014Molecular).

NDRG1 also interacts with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a molecular chaperone involved in protein stabilization. This interaction suggests that Hsp90 regulates NDRG1 both transcriptionally and post-translationally, although NDRG1 is not a classic client protein of Hsp90 (Banz2009Hsp90).

In the context of signaling pathways, NDRG1 is involved in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by interacting with PTEN, a tumor suppressor. This interaction leads to the inhibition of AKT activity, contributing to its role as a metastasis suppressor (Sun2013Metastasis). NDRG1 also modulates the NF-κB signaling pathway by affecting the phosphorylation of IκBα, thereby influencing cell adhesion and migration (Sun2013Metastasis).

These interactions highlight NDRG1's multifaceted role in regulating key cellular processes and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
