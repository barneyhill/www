# CAPZA3

## Overview
The CAPZA3 gene encodes the protein capping actin protein of muscle Z-line subunit alpha 3, which is a critical component of the capping protein complex involved in actin filament dynamics. This protein functions as a capping protein, specifically binding to the barbed ends of actin filaments to regulate their growth and stability, which is essential for various cellular processes, particularly in the context of spermatogenesis (Geyer2009A). CAPZA3 is predominantly expressed in the testis and plays a significant role in sperm development by contributing to the organization and localization of actin filaments in spermatids, as well as facilitating the acrosome reaction necessary for fertilization (Sosnik2010Analysis). The protein's interaction with CAPZB3, forming a heterodimer, underscores its specialized function in the testis, highlighting its importance in male fertility (Geyer2009A).

## Function
The CAPZA3 gene encodes a protein that is part of the capping protein complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating actin filament dynamics by binding to the barbed ends of actin filaments. This binding prevents the addition or loss of actin subunits, thereby maintaining the organization and stability of actin filaments, which are essential for various cellular processes (Geyer2009A). In healthy human cells, CAPZA3 is specifically expressed in the testis and is involved in the proper localization and organization of actin filaments during spermatogenesis. It is particularly associated with the acrosome and post-acrosomal regions in spermatids, contributing to sperm development (Geyer2009A).

CAPZA3 is also implicated in the acrosome reaction, a critical process for fertilization, where it stabilizes polymerized actin, facilitating the movement of proteins necessary for sperm-egg fusion (Sosnik2010Analysis). The protein's dynamic localization during the acrosome reaction suggests its role in actin stabilization, which is crucial for sperm capacitation and successful fertilization (Sosnik2010Analysis). The CAPZA3 protein's function in actin dynamics is vital for maintaining the structural integrity of sperm cells, highlighting its importance in male fertility (Geyer2009A).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
CAPZA3 is known to form a heterodimer with CAPZB3, a testis-specific isoform of CAPZB, in mouse spermatids. This interaction is crucial for regulating actin dynamics by capping the barbed ends of F-actin filaments, which is essential for the proper organization of the cytoskeleton in spermatids (Geyer2009A). The CAPZA3 and CAPZB3 heterodimer is suggested to be spermatid-specific, indicating a potential physical interaction between these proteins during spermatid development (Geyer2009A).

A missense mutation in the Capza3 gene, specifically the substitution of lysine for methionine (M44K), affects the localization of CAPZA3 in spermatids, leading to disorganized F-actin networks and defective spermatid morphology. This mutation may alter the tertiary structure of CAPZA3 or its interaction with CAPZB3 and F-actin, although CAPZA3 protein levels remain unchanged (Geyer2009A). The study suggests that the novel N-terminal regions of CAPZA3 and CAPZB3 might be involved in targeting or anchoring the heterodimer in spermatids, a feature common to spermatid-specific proteins (Geyer2009A). However, further studies are needed to fully understand the impact of this mutation on CAPZA3's structure and function.
