# GOLGA6L22

## Overview
GOLGA6L22 is a gene that encodes the protein golgin A6 family like 22, which is part of the golgin family of proteins. These proteins are typically involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus, a critical organelle responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for secretion or use within the cell. While the specific functions of golgin A6 family like 22 remain to be fully elucidated, its involvement in cellular processes is suggested by its expression patterns and genetic variations. The gene has been associated with various physiological and pathological conditions, including its amplification in certain cancers and its differential expression in lipid metabolism, indicating its potential role in tumorigenesis and cardiovascular health (Li2023Wholeexome; Abbas2024Leveraging).

## Clinical Significance
GOLGA6L22 has been implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression and copy number variations. In rectal neuroendocrine tumors (R-NETs), GOLGA6L22 is frequently amplified, suggesting a potential role in tumorigenesis. This amplification is part of a broader pattern of copy number variations observed in these tumors, which are associated with pathways like P53 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, crucial for cancer development and progression (Li2023Wholeexome).

In a study focusing on LDL cholesterol levels in African Americans, GOLGA6L22 was identified as one of the differentially expressed mRNAs across various LDL subclasses. This suggests a potential link between GOLGA6L22 expression and lipid metabolism, which could have implications for cardiovascular health (Abbas2024Leveraging).

Additionally, in the Mexican tetra fish, GOLGA6L22 shows increased copy numbers in cave populations compared to surface populations, although the clinical significance of this finding in humans remains unclear (Pokrovac2023The). These studies highlight the diverse roles of GOLGA6L22 in different biological contexts and its potential impact on disease.
