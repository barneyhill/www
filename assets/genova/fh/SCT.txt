# SCT

## Overview
The SCT gene encodes the peptide hormone secretin, which is a member of the secretin/glucagon superfamily. Secretin is a 27-amino acid peptide primarily involved in the regulation of digestive processes, particularly in the stimulation of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic fluid secretion, which is crucial for neutralizing gastric acid in the duodenum. The SCT gene is located on chromosome 11p15.5 and is characterized by a conserved four-exon structure among mammals, underscoring its evolutionary significance. Secretin functions by binding to its receptor, the secretin receptor (SCTR), a class B G-protein-coupled receptor, initiating signaling pathways that influence various physiological processes, including renal water reabsorption and potential neuroendocrine roles. The hormone's involvement in both gastrointestinal and neurological functions highlights its clinical significance, with implications in disorders such as chronic pancreatitis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and autism spectrum disorders (Chu2011Secretin; Nishijima2006Secretin; Whitmore2000Human).

## Structure
The human secretin (SCT) protein is a 27-amino acid peptide hormone encoded by the SCT gene, which is located on chromosome 11p15.5 (Whitmore2000Human). The primary structure of secretin is highly conserved across species, with slight variations among human, canine, rodent, and rabbit secretins compared to the identical structure found in porcine, bovine, and guinea pig secretins (Whitmore2000Human). The mature secretin peptide is encoded entirely by the second exon of the SCT gene, which spans 713 base pairs of genomic DNA (Whitmore2000Human).

Secretin belongs to the secretin/glucagon superfamily, which includes peptides with significant structural homology, characterized by a random N-terminal structure and a C-terminal alpha helix (Tam2014MOLECULAR). The peptide is often amidated at the C-terminus, a common post-translational modification that may influence its biological activity (Wang2012Characterization). The gene structure of secretin is similar to that of other members of the secretin-glucagon family, where the active peptides are encoded by a single exon (Whitmore2000Human). The SCT gene's four-exon structure is conserved among mammals, indicating its evolutionary importance (Whitmore2000Human).

## Function
The SCT gene encodes the hormone secretin, a 27-amino acid peptide primarily involved in the regulation of digestive processes. Secretin is produced by enteroendocrine S cells in the proximal small intestine and plays a crucial role in stimulating the secretion of bicarbonate-rich pancreatic fluids. This secretion is essential for neutralizing gastric acid in the duodenum, facilitating an optimal pH for digestive enzyme activity (Whitmore2000Human). Secretin also influences bile production in the liver and modulates gastric acid secretion, contributing to the overall regulation of the gastrointestinal environment (Whitmore2000Human).

In addition to its digestive functions, secretin is involved in renal water reabsorption. It binds to its receptor, SCTR, in the kidneys, activating a signaling cascade that includes adenylyl cyclase, cAMP, and protein kinase A (PKA). This pathway enhances the expression and translocation of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) to the apical membrane of renal collecting duct cells, promoting water reabsorption and maintaining fluid balance (Chu2011Secretin). Secretin's expression in the brain suggests potential neuroendocrine roles, possibly acting as a neurotransmitter or hormone, although these functions are less well understood (Whitmore2000Human).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the SCT gene, which encodes the hormone secretin, have significant clinical implications. Secretin plays a crucial role in maintaining water homeostasis and pH balance in the duodenum. Disruptions in SCT expression or function can lead to various gastrointestinal disorders. For instance, abnormal secretin levels are associated with pancreatic disorders, where the hormone's regulatory function on pancreatic secretions is compromised. This can result in conditions such as chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic insufficiency.

Secretin is also implicated in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a condition characterized by excessive gastric acid production due to gastrin-secreting tumors. Altered secretin signaling can exacerbate the symptoms of this syndrome by failing to adequately inhibit gastric acid secretion.

In the realm of neuroendocrine tumors, secretin's role in modulating hormone release suggests that its dysregulation may contribute to tumor development or progression. Additionally, secretin's involvement in neurological pathways has been linked to autism spectrum disorders, indicating that alterations in SCT expression or function could influence neurodevelopmental processes. These associations highlight the importance of secretin in both gastrointestinal and neurological health.

## Interactions
Secretin (SCT) interacts with its receptor, the secretin receptor (SCTR), which is a class B G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This interaction is crucial for the activation of intracellular signaling pathways. The binding of secretin to its receptor involves specific spatial approximations between the amino terminus of secretin and the extracellular loops of the receptor. Studies using cysteine trapping have identified that secretin forms disulfide bonds with specific cysteine residues in the receptor, particularly in the extracellular loops ECL2 and ECL3, indicating a dynamic and flexible ligand-receptor interface (Dong2012Mapping).

The interaction between secretin and its receptor is essential for the receptor's activation and subsequent signaling. This process involves the elevation of intracellular cAMP levels through coupling with adenylate cyclase via a Gs heteromeric G-protein. The secretin receptor also affects phospholipase C activation, intercellular calcium release, and MAP kinase activation through Gq- and Gi-proteins (Nishijima2006Secretin). These interactions are significant for the receptor's role in various physiological processes, including synaptic plasticity and social behavior, as observed in studies with secretin receptor-deficient mice (Nishijima2006Secretin).
