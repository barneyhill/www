# INSYN2B

## Overview
The INSYN2B gene encodes the protein inhibitory synaptic factor family member 2B, which is involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission. This protein is categorized as a synaptic regulatory protein and plays a crucial role in modulating inhibitory synaptic activity within the central nervous system. The precise mechanisms by which INSYN2B influences synaptic function are still under investigation, but it is believed to interact with various synaptic proteins to maintain synaptic balance and plasticity. Understanding the function and interactions of INSYN2B is essential for elucidating its role in neurological processes and potential implications in neuropsychiatric disorders (Qiu2020aarFDC).
