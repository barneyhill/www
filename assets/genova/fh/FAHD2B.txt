# FAHD2B

## Overview
FAHD2B is a gene that encodes the protein fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase domain containing 2B, which is a member of the FAA hydrolase protein family. This protein is primarily involved in cellular metabolic processes, particularly within the mitochondria, where it contributes to metabolite repair. The FAHD2B protein exhibits oxaloacetate tautomerase (OAT) activity, facilitating the conversion of enol-oxaloacetate to keto-oxaloacetate, a reaction essential for the proper functioning of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This conversion is crucial as enol-oxaloacetate is a potent inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, an enzyme vital for the TCA cycle and aerobic respiration (Zmuda2024A). While the protein's role in energy metabolism is recognized, further research is needed to fully elucidate its specific molecular activities and cellular localization in healthy human cells (Zmuda2024A).

## Structure


## Function
FAHD2B is a gene that encodes a protein involved in cellular metabolic processes, particularly within the mitochondria. The FAHD2B protein is part of the 'FAA hydrolase' protein family, which is structurally conserved across the three domains of life. In humans, FAHD2B is localized to the mitochondria, where it plays a role in metabolite repair by facilitating the conversion of enol-oxaloacetate (enol-OAA) to keto-oxaloacetate (keto-OAA) through its oxaloacetate tautomerase (OAT) activity. This conversion is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as enol-OAA is a potent inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), an enzyme critical for the TCA cycle and aerobic respiration (Zmuda2024A).

The FAHD2B protein, along with other FAHD enzymes, is suggested to have a broader role in maintaining low concentrations of oxaloacetate across different cellular compartments, which is important for energy metabolism and organismal physiology. Despite its significant role in these processes, the specific molecular activities and cellular localization of FAHD2B in healthy human cells are not fully characterized (Zmuda2024A).
