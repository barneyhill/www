a member of the GATA family of zinc-finger transcription factors. Members of this family recognize the GATA motif which is present in the promoters of many genes. This protein is thought to regulate genes involved in embryogenesis and in myocardial differentiation and function, and is necessary for normal testicular development. Mutations in this gene have been associated with cardiac septal defects. Additionally, alterations in gene expression have been associated with several cancer types. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
