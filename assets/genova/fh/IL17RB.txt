# IL17RB

## Overview
IL17RB is a gene that encodes the interleukin 17 receptor B (IL-17RB), a transmembrane receptor protein that is part of the IL-17 receptor family. This receptor is primarily involved in immune response regulation by binding to cytokines IL-17B and IL-17E (also known as IL-25), which are crucial for promoting type 2 immune responses. IL-17RB is characterized by its SEFIR domain, which facilitates homotypic dimerization and recruitment of signaling proteins, and a TRAF6-binding domain that activates the NF-κB pathway. The receptor is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, liver, and epithelial cells, and plays a significant role in mucosal immunity and inflammatory responses. IL-17RB's interactions with adaptor proteins like Act1 and DAZAP2 are essential for its function in complex signaling networks, impacting conditions such as cancer and immune-related diseases (Bastid2020The; Gaffen2009Structure; Lavorgna2015A; Popova2012Smurf2).

## Structure
The IL-17RB protein is a transmembrane protein consisting of 462 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 47.9 kDa. It is part of the IL-17 receptor family and contains a SEFIR domain in its cytoplasmic region, which is crucial for homotypic dimerization and recruitment of signaling proteins (Bastid2020The). The SEFIR domain also facilitates binding with the adaptor protein ACT1, which is essential for downstream signaling (Gaffen2009Structure).

IL-17RB possesses a TRAF6-binding domain in its cytoplasmic tail, which is not present in IL-17RA. This domain is involved in the activation of the NF-κB pathway, independent of ligand binding (Bastid2020The; Gaffen2009Structure). The extracellular domain of IL-17RB is highly spliced, although the specific roles of these splice variants have not been fully evaluated (Gaffen2009Structure).

Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation may occur, although specific sites and their functional implications are not detailed in the available literature. The protein's structure and its interactions with ligands like IL-17B and IL-17E are critical for its role in immune signaling and potential involvement in cancer progression (Bastid2020The).

## Function
IL17RB (interleukin 17 receptor B) is a receptor that primarily binds to cytokines IL-17B and IL-17E (also known as IL-25), playing a significant role in immune response regulation. In healthy human cells, IL17RB is involved in promoting type 2 immune responses, which are crucial for defense against parasitic infections and allergic inflammation. This receptor forms a heterodimeric complex with IL-17RA to mediate signaling pathways that activate NF-kB and MAPK, leading to the production of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. These cytokines are important for eosinophil recruitment and the expulsion of helminths (Lavorgna2015A; Gu2013IL17).

IL17RB is expressed in various tissues, including the kidney, liver, and peripheral organs, as well as in memory and effector T lymphocytes. It is also present on epithelial cells, where it contributes to mucosal immunity by regulating the expression of chemokines and cytokines that attract immune cells to sites of infection or inflammation (Teng2019Decreased; Lavorgna2015A). The receptor's activity is modulated by the recruitment of adaptor proteins like Act1, which facilitates downstream signaling cascades essential for immune regulation (Borowczyk2021IL25).

## Clinical Significance
IL17RB, the receptor for cytokines IL-17B and IL-17E, plays a significant role in cancer and immune-related conditions. Alterations in IL17RB expression have been linked to cancer progression, particularly in breast cancer, where elevated IL-17B/IL-17RB signaling is associated with increased tumorigenicity. This is mediated through the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, upregulation of Bcl-2, and HER2 amplification, contributing to worse cancer outcomes (Meehan2022Interleukin17). IL17RB is also considered a target for cancer therapy, as its expression on cancer stem cells (CSCs) can be exploited for targeted treatments, suggesting its potential as a marker for cancer therapy (Huangfu2023The).

While the context does not provide specific details on diseases directly resulting from mutations in the IL17RB gene, it highlights the receptor's involvement in modulating immune pathways that could impact conditions like asthma and inflammatory bowel disease. The receptor's role in these diseases is likely due to its function in inflammatory and immune responses, although specific mutations or expression changes are not detailed in the provided context (Meehan2022Interleukin17).

## Interactions
IL17RB, or interleukin 17 receptor B, is known to interact with several proteins, playing a significant role in immune signaling pathways. One of its key interactions is with DAZAP2, a novel binding partner identified through Yeast Two-Hybrid screening. DAZAP2 binds to IL17RB via two SH2-binding domains, which are essential for this interaction. The binding site on IL17RB is located between amino acids 329 and 347 within its cytoplasmic tail. This interaction is crucial for the accumulation of DAZAP2 in the cytoplasm of macrophages upon IL17E stimulation (Popova2012Smurf2).

DAZAP2 also interacts with Smurf2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to the proteasomal degradation of DAZAP2. This suggests a regulatory mechanism where Smurf2 modulates IL17RB by degrading its adaptor protein DAZAP2 (Popova2012Smurf2). Additionally, TRAF6 binds to IL17RB independently of the ligand and participates in NF-kB activation, indicating its role in signal transduction (Popova2012Smurf2). The adaptor molecule Act1 is also involved in IL17RB signal transduction, highlighting the receptor's role in complex signaling networks (Popova2012Smurf2).
