# STUM

## Overview
The STUM gene encodes the protein stum, mechanosensory transduction mediator homolog, which plays a crucial role in the mechanosensory transduction pathway. This protein is involved in the conversion of mechanical stimuli into neural signals, a process essential for the perception of touch and proprioception. Stum is categorized as a transmembrane protein, indicating its role in facilitating communication across the cell membrane. The gene and its encoded protein are subjects of interest due to their potential implications in sensory disorders and their involvement in the ADCK5-SOX9-PTTG1 pathway (Qiu2020aarFDC).
