# TMPRSS11E

## Overview
TMPRSS11E is a gene that encodes the protein transmembrane serine protease 11E, a type II transmembrane serine protease. This protein is characterized by its serine protease domain, which includes a conserved catalytic triad essential for its enzymatic function (Escalante2021Structural). TMPRSS11E is involved in various cellular processes, including the cleavage of peptide bonds in proteins, which influences cellular communication and tissue integrity (Li2022Elevated). The protein is notably upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it contributes to tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation and migration (Li2022Elevated). TMPRSS11E's role in oncogenic signaling pathways, such as the PAR2-EGFR-STAT3 pathway, underscores its significance in cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target (Li2022Elevated).

## Structure
TMPRSS11E is a type II transmembrane serine protease, characterized by a serine protease domain that includes a conserved catalytic triad composed of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Escalante2021Structural). The protein is membrane-anchored, with its expression upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues (Li2022Elevated). 

The molecular structure of TMPRSS11E includes a trypsin-like serine protease domain, which is a common feature among members of the transmembrane serine protease family (Escalante2021Structural). The protein undergoes post-translational modifications, such as proteolytic cleavage at a canonical activation motif, converting it from a zymogen to an active protease (Li2022Elevated). 

While specific details about the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of TMPRSS11E are not provided, the protein is related to the TTSP family, which often includes domains like LDL receptor class A or scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains (Muley2021SARSCoV2). The structural modeling of TMPRSS11E and other TMPRSS family members has been conducted using homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations to identify potential binding sites and key amino acids for drug targeting (Escalante2021Structural).

## Function
TMPRSS11E, also known as DESC1, is a type II transmembrane serine protease that plays a significant role in cellular processes through its proteolytic activity. This enzyme is anchored to the cell membrane, where it is involved in the cleavage of peptide bonds in proteins, influencing cellular communication and tissue integrity. TMPRSS11E is particularly active on the cell surface, where it can participate in the activation of other proteins or the processing of extracellular matrix components, thereby impacting cell signaling and tissue remodeling (Li2022Elevated).

In the context of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TMPRSS11E is upregulated and contributes to tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth. Its catalytic activity is crucial for these effects, as demonstrated by the loss of tumor growth when a mutant form lacking catalytic function is expressed (Li2022Elevated). The protease is also involved in the activation of the PAR2-EGFR-STAT3 pathway, suggesting a role in oncogenic signaling (Li2022Elevated). These findings highlight the importance of TMPRSS11E in both normal physiological processes and pathological conditions, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

## Clinical Significance
TMPRSS11E is implicated in several cancers, notably non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where its expression is significantly upregulated. This upregulation is associated with increased tumor stage and size, and patients with high TMPRSS11E expression have lower survival rates. The gene promotes cell proliferation, migration, and tumor growth, and its knockdown reduces tumor growth, highlighting its protumorigenic role (Li2022Elevated). TMPRSS11E is also involved in the PAR2-EGFR-STAT3 signaling pathway, contributing to oncogenesis through a positive feedback loop (Li2022Elevated).

In breast cancer, TMPRSS11E variants have been linked to cancer risk and survival. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMPRSS11E are associated with invasive breast cancer survival, suggesting a role in cancer prognosis (Luostari2014Type). In colon cancer, high TMPRSS11E expression correlates with poor survival, and its downregulation reduces cell proliferation and migration (Wu2022Development).

TMPRSS11E is also part of a prognostic model for lung adenocarcinoma, where its expression is upregulated, indicating a potential role in disease progression and response to immunotherapy (Shu2023Identification). These findings suggest TMPRSS11E as a potential therapeutic target and biomarker in various cancers.

## Interactions
TMPRSS11E, a membrane-anchored serine protease, is involved in several protein interactions that influence cellular processes. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TMPRSS11E interacts with the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), cleaving it to activate the PAR2-EGFR-STAT3 signaling pathway. This interaction suggests a positive feedback loop that enhances oncogenic signaling, promoting cancer cell proliferation and migration (Li2022Elevated). The transcription factor STAT3 is also identified as a regulator of TMPRSS11E expression, binding to its promoter and influencing its transcriptional activity. This interaction is crucial for the progression of NSCLC, as high levels of phosphorylated STAT3 correlate with poor prognosis (Li2022Elevated).

In the context of multiple myeloma (MM), TMPRSS11E is explored as a target for CAR T-cell therapy. It is used in combination with TNFRSF8 (CD30) to enhance T-cell activation through a split-CAR design. This approach requires the simultaneous engagement of both antigens, which significantly enhances T-cell activation and minimizes off-target effects, highlighting TMPRSS11E's role as a costimulatory receptor in this therapeutic strategy (Anderson2023Cell). These interactions underscore TMPRSS11E's involvement in critical signaling pathways and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer.
