# TRAPPC5

## Overview
TRAPPC5 is a gene that encodes the trafficking protein particle complex subunit 5, a component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complexes, which are essential for intracellular transport processes. The protein encoded by TRAPPC5 is involved in the TRAPP II and III complexes, functioning as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for small GTPases, such as Rab1 and Rab18, which are critical for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi traffic (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). These complexes play a significant role in vesicle-mediated transport, impacting cellular processes like secretion, membrane dynamics, endocytosis, and autophagy (Brunet2014In). TRAPPC5, through its interactions within the TRAPPII complex, contributes to the structural integrity and function of the complex, highlighting its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting (Jenkins2020The).

## Function
TRAPPC5 is a component of the TRAPP (trafficking protein particle) complexes, which are involved in intracellular transport processes. In humans, TRAPPC5 is part of the core set of proteins in the TRAPP II and III complexes. These complexes function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for small GTPases, such as Rab1 and Rab18, which are crucial for ER-to-Golgi traffic (Sacher2018TRAPPopathies:). The TRAPP complexes are implicated in the tethering process, although their role as direct tethers has not been definitively demonstrated. Instead, they are suggested to facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rab proteins, thereby activating them to mediate vesicle transport (Brunet2014In).

TRAPPC5, as part of these complexes, plays a role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and proper protein sorting, impacting processes like secretion and membrane dynamics. The TRAPP complexes, including TRAPPC5, are involved in the early secretory pathway, endocytosis, and autophagy, highlighting their importance in vesicle-mediated transport within cells (Brunet2014In). While specific functions of TRAPPC5 in healthy human cells are not detailed, its involvement in these complexes suggests a critical role in cellular transport mechanisms.

## Interactions
TRAPPC5 is a component of the TRAPPII complex, which is involved in membrane trafficking processes. Within the TRAPPII complex, TRAPPC5 interacts with several other subunits, including TRAPPC3 and TRAPPC2, as revealed by chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry. These interactions suggest that TRAPPC5 is part of the TRAPP core subunits, contributing to the structural integrity and function of the complex (Jenkins2020The).

TRAPPC5 also interacts with TRAPPC9 and TRAPPC10, indicating an extended shared interface within the TRAPPII complex. This interaction network is crucial for the complex's role as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rab GTPases, which are key regulators of vesicle trafficking (Jenkins2020The).

Although TRAPPC5 is not proposed to be in direct contact with Rab substrates, it is in contact with the C-terminal region of TRAPPC4. This suggests that TRAPPC5 may undergo an allosteric conformational change upon Rab binding, which could influence the activity of the TRAPPII complex (Jenkins2020The). These interactions highlight the importance of TRAPPC5 in maintaining the functional architecture of the TRAPPII complex and its role in cellular trafficking pathways.
