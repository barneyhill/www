# CXorf51B

## Overview
CXorf51B is a gene located on the X chromosome that encodes the protein known as chromosome X open reading frame 51B. This protein is categorized as a hypothetical protein, as its specific biological functions and interactions remain largely uncharacterized in the scientific literature. While the precise role of CXorf51B in cellular processes is not yet fully understood, it is hypothesized to be involved in various cellular pathways due to its expression patterns and potential interactions with other proteins. Further research is necessary to elucidate the functional significance of CXorf51B and its encoded protein in human health and disease.
