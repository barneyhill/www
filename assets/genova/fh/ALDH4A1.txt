# ALDH4A1

## Overview
The ALDH4A1 gene encodes the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase 4 family member A1, which is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the catabolism of proline and hydroxyproline. This enzyme is part of the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily and plays a crucial role in amino acid metabolism and energy production by catalyzing the NAD+-dependent oxidation of L-glutamate-γ-semialdehyde to L-glutamate. Structurally, the protein exhibits a classic ALDH fold and typically forms a homodimer, which is essential for its enzymatic function. ALDH4A1 is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress by metabolizing aldehydes. Mutations in this gene are linked to hyperprolinemia type II, a metabolic disorder characterized by neurological and psychiatric symptoms due to the accumulation of proline and pyrroline-5-carboxylate (Bogner2021Structural; Baumgartner2016Disorders; Srivastava2012The).

## Structure
The ALDH4A1 protein, also known as δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, exhibits a classic aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) fold, consisting of three main domains: the NAD+-binding domain, the catalytic domain, and the oligomerization domain (Srivastava2012The; Tanner2019Structural). The NAD+-binding domain features a Rossmann fold, characterized by a parallel 5-stranded β-sheet, which is crucial for binding NAD+ (Tanner2019Structural). The catalytic domain is an α/β structure that provides the essential cysteine nucleophile necessary for the enzyme's activity (Srivastava2012The; Tanner2019Structural). The oligomerization domain is a β-substructure that facilitates dimerization and higher-order assembly (Tanner2019Structural).

In terms of quaternary structure, human ALDH4A1 typically forms a homodimer, unlike some bacterial counterparts that can form hexamers (Srivastava2012The; Luo2013Structural). The dimerization is mediated by a domain-swapped assembly with an intermolecular β-sheet and extensive nonpolar and electrostatic interactions (Srivastava2012The). The enzyme's active site is located between the NAD+-binding and catalytic domains, where it facilitates the oxidation of glutamate semialdehyde to glutamate (Tanner2019Structural). The protein's structure is crucial for its function in proline catabolism, and mutations affecting its structure can lead to metabolic disorders such as type II hyperprolinemia (Srivastava2012The).

## Function
ALDH4A1 encodes an enzyme that plays a critical role in the catabolism of proline and hydroxyproline, which are important for amino acid metabolism and energy production in mammals. This enzyme catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of L-glutamate-γ-semialdehyde to L-glutamate in proline metabolism and 4-hydroxy-L-glutamate-γ-semialdehyde to 4-erythro-hydroxy-L-glutamate in hydroxyproline metabolism (Bogner2021Structural). ALDH4A1 is active in the mitochondria, where it contributes to cellular detoxification by metabolizing aldehydes, thus maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing oxidative stress (Bogner2021Structural).

The enzyme is involved in the final steps of these metabolic pathways, with the initial steps being catalyzed by distinct proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) enzymes. Structurally, ALDH4A1 belongs to the ALDH superfamily and follows a compulsory ordered kinetic mechanism where NAD+ binds before glutamate semialdehyde, and L-glutamate dissociates before NADH (Bogner2021Structural). This enzyme's activity is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial function and energy supply, particularly in muscle tissues, and its genetic variants have been associated with muscle health over the lifespan (Villa2022Genetic).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ALDH4A1 gene are associated with hyperprolinemia type II (HPII), a rare autosomal recessive disorder. This condition results from a deficiency in the enzyme Δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, leading to the accumulation of proline and pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) in the body (Baumgartner2016Disorders; van2013Long‐term). Clinically, HPII is characterized by neurological symptoms such as recurrent seizures, which are responsive to vitamin B6 treatment, as the accumulating P5C acts as a vitamin B6 antagonist (Baumgartner2016Disorders). Other symptoms include mental retardation, behavioral problems, and mitochondrial dysfunction (van2013Long‐term).

The disorder is linked to various psychiatric phenotypes, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and psychosis spectrum disorders (Namavar2021Psychiatric). Genetic variations in ALDH4A1 have also been associated with age-related muscle decline, suggesting a role in muscle health over the lifespan (Villa2022Genetic). The gene's involvement in proline metabolism and its impact on cellular detoxification processes may contribute to oxidative stress-related conditions (Mitsubuchi2014Biochemical). Genetic analysis is crucial for diagnosing atypical manifestations of HPII, as seen in cases with novel mutations (Motte2019Novel).
