Members of this family share a conserved motif termed, baculovirus IAP repeat, which is necessary for their anti-apoptotic function. This protein functions through binding to tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors TRAF1 and TRAF2 and inhibits apoptosis induced by menadione, a potent inducer of free radicals, and interleukin 1-beta converting enzyme. This protein also inhibits at least two members of the caspase family of cell-death proteases, caspase-3 and caspase-7. Mutations in this gene are the cause of X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes of this gene are found on chromosomes 2 and 11.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011].", "symbol": "XIAP", "taxid": 9606, "type_of_gene": "protein-coding", "umls": {"cui": "C1337109"}, "unigene": ["Hs.736565", "Hs.356076"], "uniprot": {"Swiss-Prot": "P98170", "TrEMBL": ["B1AKU2", "B2R9R2"]}, "wikipedia": {"url_stub": "XIAP"}}
