# B4GALT4

## Overview
B4GALT4 is a gene that encodes the enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 4, a member of the glycosyltransferase family. This enzyme is integral to the glycosylation process, specifically catalyzing the transfer of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine, forming a beta-1,4 linkage. This activity is crucial for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which play significant roles in cellular functions such as cell-cell communication, protein stability, and immune response (Hennet2002The). The B4GALT4 protein is a type II transmembrane protein localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the maturation and modification of glycoproteins (Gabius2018The). It is characterized by its unique activity profile, as it is not inhibited by high concentrations of GlcNAc, distinguishing it from other beta-1,4-galactosyltransferases (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation). The gene is expressed in all human tissues, with the highest expression levels in the placenta and pancreas, underscoring its essential role in various physiological processes (Hennet2002The).

## Structure
The B4GALT4 protein is a type II integral membrane protein, characterized by a short N-terminal cytosolic tail, a transmembrane anchor, and a C-terminal catalytic domain (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation). It belongs to the CAZy glycosyltransferase family 7 and is involved in transferring galactose to sugar moieties of proteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation). The protein has two critical N-glycosylation sites at Asn220 and Asn335, which are essential for its enzymatic activity and proper localization within the Golgi apparatus (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation). These N-glycans are necessary for producing a stable and active protein, and their absence leads to mislocalization and loss of function (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation).

B4GALT4 is involved in keratan sulfate synthesis, and its activity is not inhibited by high concentrations of GlcNAc, showing a unique activity profile compared to other B4GalTs (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation). The protein's structure includes conserved cysteine residues and sequence motifs, suggesting it may have arisen from gene duplication events (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation). However, specific details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structure of B4GALT4 are not provided in the available context.

## Function
B4GALT4 (beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 4) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the glycosylation process, where it catalyzes the transfer of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine, forming a beta-1,4 linkage. This enzymatic activity is essential for the synthesis of glycoproteins and glycolipids, which are important for various cellular functions, including cell-cell communication, protein stability, and immune response (Hennet2002The). B4GALT4 is primarily active in the Golgi apparatus, where it contributes to the maturation and modification of glycoproteins (Gabius2018The).

The B4GALT4 gene is expressed in all human tissues, with the highest mRNA levels observed in the placenta and pancreas. The enzyme is specific toward GlcNAcb-based acceptors and shows activity with both glycoprotein and glycolipid acceptors, such as Lc3 and Lc5. Notably, B4GALT4 does not exhibit lactose synthase activity, distinguishing it from some other members of the beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase family. In comparative studies, B4GALT4 has been identified as the most efficient enzyme in catalyzing the extension of poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains on GlcNAc(b1-6) branched O-glycans (Hennet2002The).

## Interactions
B4GALT4 interacts with the UDP-Gal transporter (UGT1) in the Golgi apparatus, as demonstrated by a split luciferase complementation assay. This interaction is dependent on the proper localization of B4GALT4 to the Golgi, as mutant variants that fail to localize there, such as MT3 and MT23, do not interact with UGT1 (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation). The presence of N-glycans at Asn220 and Asn335 is crucial for the stability, enzymatic activity, and Golgi localization of B4GALT4, which in turn affects its ability to interact with other proteins (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation).

B4GALT4 also interacts with the protein SLC35A2, although the presence or absence of N-glycans on B4GALT4 influences this interaction. The study utilized mutagenesis and CRISPR-Cas9 technology to explore these interactions, highlighting the importance of glycosylation in mediating protein interactions within the Golgi apparatus (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation). Despite these findings, no significant changes in N-glycosylation were observed in B4GALT4-deficient cell lines when assessing interactions with SLC35A2 (Shauchuk2020Nglycosylation).
