# PPIAL4G

## Overview
PPIAL4G is a gene that encodes the protein peptidylprolyl isomerase A like 4G, which belongs to the peptidylprolyl isomerase family. This family of proteins is known for its role in catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides, which is crucial for protein folding and function. PPIAL4G has been implicated in various biological processes and diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The protein encoded by PPIAL4G is involved in complex protein interaction networks and has been identified in mutation hotspots, particularly in melanoma, suggesting its potential role in oncogenesis (Miller2015PanCancer; Miller2015Protein). Additionally, alterations in PPIAL4G expression and structure have been associated with clinical outcomes in diseases such as lung adenocarcinoma and BRCA1-associated ovarian cancer, highlighting its significance in disease pathogenesis and progression (Yoshihara2010Germline; Kou2022Somatic).

## Clinical Significance
PPIAL4G has been implicated in various diseases through mutations and alterations in its expression. In BRCA1-associated ovarian cancer, PPIAL4G is part of a unique germline copy number variation (CNV) region, suggesting that structural variations in this gene may contribute to the distinct biological characteristics of BRCA1-mutated cells. This highlights the potential role of PPIAL4G in modifying the cancer phenotype in these patients (Yoshihara2010Germline).

In the context of lung adenocarcinoma, PPIAL4G has been identified as having significant amplification in patients with tumor progression. This amplification is associated with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis, indicating that alterations in PPIAL4G may contribute to the clinical outcomes of these patients (Kou2022Somatic).

PPIAL4G also features in a pan-cancer analysis of mutation hotspots, where a mutation at residue R37C in the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain was identified. Although the specific clinical significance of this mutation in PPIAL4G is not detailed, the domain's involvement in protein folding suggests potential implications in cancer (Miller2015PanCancer). However, further research is needed to fully understand the clinical impact of these mutations.

## Interactions
PPIAL4G, a member of the peptidylprolyl isomerase family, is involved in protein interactions that are significant in various biological contexts. In the study of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS), PPIAL4G was identified as a differentially expressed non-coding RNA in fibroblasts from sALS patients. Although specific protein interactions involving PPIAL4G were not detailed, the study highlighted the importance of gene expression regulation and identified pathways related to inflammation, lipid metabolism, and synaptic transmission (Morello2023A).

In cancer research, PPIAL4G was noted for having a mutation hotspot in the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain, specifically the R37C mutation, which was predominantly found in melanoma samples. This mutation is part of a hotspot with other genes such as PPIG, PPIA, PPIE, and PPIL2, suggesting a potential role in cancer-related processes, although specific interactions were not detailed (Miller2015PanCancer; Miller2015Protein).

Additionally, PPIAL4G was identified as an interacting protein with DCHS1 in the context of endometrial cancer, although specific details of this interaction were not provided (Meijuan2024Dachsous). These findings suggest that PPIAL4G may participate in complex protein interaction networks relevant to disease pathogenesis.
