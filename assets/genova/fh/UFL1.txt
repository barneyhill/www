# UFL1

## Overview
UFL1 is a gene that encodes the protein UFM1 specific ligase 1, a pivotal component of the UFMylation pathway, which is a post-translational modification system analogous to ubiquitination. This protein functions as an E3 ligase, although it lacks the conventional HECT and RING domains typically found in such enzymes. Instead, UFM1 specific ligase 1 features unique structural elements, including an N-terminal region crucial for its interaction with other proteins in the UFMylation pathway, such as UFC1 and DDRGK1 (Jiang2023UFL1; Ishimura2023Mechanistic). The protein plays a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), by facilitating the conjugation of UFM1 to target proteins. This process is essential for protein quality control, ER stress regulation, and the unfolded protein response (UPR), thereby supporting cellular survival under stress conditions (Jiang2023UFL1; Xie2019Ufl1RCAD). UFL1's involvement extends to various cellular stress responses, including DNA damage repair and autophagy, underscoring its importance in genomic integrity and cellular health (Jiang2023UFL1).

## Structure
UFL1, also known as UFM1 specific ligase 1, is a protein involved in the UFMylation pathway, which is crucial for various cellular processes. The primary structure of UFL1 consists of 794 amino acids, with a molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa (Jiang2023UFL1). Unlike typical E3 ligases, UFL1 lacks specific functional domains such as HECT and RING domains. Instead, it features an N-terminal region that is essential for binding to UFC1 and DDRGK1 (Jiang2023UFL1).

The secondary structure of UFL1 includes several α-helices and winged-helix (WH) domains. The N-terminal region contains two α-helices, with the first helix playing a critical role in binding UFC1 (Banerjee2022Structural; Ishimura2023Mechanistic). UFL1 also contains five tandem WH domains, which are involved in interactions with other proteins such as UFBP1 and CDK5RAP3 (Makhlouf2024The; Ishimura2023Mechanistic).

In terms of tertiary and quaternary structure, UFL1 forms a complex with UFBP1 and CDK5RAP3, creating a stable and catalytically competent structure with UFC1. This complex is crucial for the UFMylation process, facilitating the transfer of UFM1 onto substrates like RPL26 (Makhlouf2024The). The N-terminal helix of UFL1 is flexible, allowing it to adopt multiple conformations necessary for its catalytic activity (Makhlouf2024The).

## Function
UFL1, also known as UFM1 specific ligase 1, is a crucial component of the UFMylation system, a post-translational modification process similar to ubiquitination. This system is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where UFL1 is highly enriched. UFL1 facilitates the conjugation of UFM1 to target proteins, a process that is vital for protein quality control, including folding, secretion, and degradation of misfolded proteins (Jiang2023UFL1; Xie2019Ufl1RCAD).

In healthy human cells, UFL1 plays a significant role in regulating ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR), which are critical for cellular survival under stress conditions. It is involved in the UFMylation of ribosomal protein L26, which is important for co-translational protein translocation into the ER, ensuring efficient protein biogenesis (Jiang2023UFL1). UFL1 also contributes to the maintenance of calcium homeostasis and supports the synthesis and secretion of proteins, particularly in secretory cells like pancreatic and plasma cells (Jiang2023UFL1).

UFL1's activity is not limited to the ER; it also plays a role in various cellular stress responses, including DNA damage repair and autophagy, highlighting its importance in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular health (Jiang2023UFL1).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or dysregulation of the UFL1 gene have been implicated in various diseases due to its role in maintaining endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis. In cardiac health, UFL1 is crucial for protecting against heart failure by regulating ER stress and maintaining protein quality control. Deficiency in UFL1 leads to increased ER stress, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure, as evidenced by studies on UFL1 knockout mice, which show progressive cardiac dysfunction and increased susceptibility to pressure overload-induced heart failure (Li2018Ufm1Specific).

In the context of kidney function, UFL1 deficiency results in kidney atrophy and dysfunction, characterized by increased apoptosis and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). This suggests that UFL1 is essential for renal health, and its deficiency can lead to metabolic disorders and kidney disease (Zhou2021Ufl1).

UFL1 also plays a role in cancer, particularly in breast cancer, where it is involved in the ufmylation of ASC1, a process important for tumor formation. Alterations in UFL1 expression can lead to increased ER stress and inflammation, contributing to tumorigenesis (Xie2019Ufl1RCAD). In renal cell carcinoma, downregulation of UFL1 is associated with poorer survival outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic marker (Zhou2021Ufl1).

## Interactions
UFL1, also known as UFM1-specific ligase 1, is involved in several critical protein interactions. It is a key component of the UFM1 conjugation system, interacting with UFC1, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and UBA5, an E1 activating enzyme, to facilitate the ufmylation process. UFL1's N-terminal helix is crucial for binding to UFC1, and it competes with UBA5 for this interaction, highlighting a regulatory mechanism in the ufmylation pathway (Banerjee2022Structural).

UFL1 also forms part of the UREL complex, interacting with the 60S ribosomal subunit. It specifically engages with ribosomal proteins such as RPL10a and RPL26, and 28S rRNA helices, playing a role in ribosome recognition and modification (Makhlouf2024The). The interaction with RPL26 is particularly important for UFM1 transfer, a process facilitated by the catalytic module of the UREL complex (Makhlouf2024The).

UFL1 interacts with DDRGK1, which acts as an adaptor protein anchoring UFL1 to the ER membrane, forming a scaffold-type ligase complex. This interaction is essential for the transfer of UFM1 onto substrates (Jiang2023UFL1). UFL1 also interacts with CDK5RAP3, which stabilizes the UREL complex and aids in ribosome binding (Makhlouf2024The).
