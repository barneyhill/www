# MKKS

## Overview
The MKKS gene encodes the MKKS centrosomal shuttling protein, also known as BBS6, which is a member of the group II chaperonin family. This protein plays a pivotal role in centrosomal function and intracellular trafficking, particularly in the context of ciliary transport and cell division. The MKKS protein is characterized by its dynamic shuttling between the centrosome and the cytosol, a process essential for maintaining cellular organization and function. It is a crucial component of the BBSome complex, which is involved in the transport of molecules necessary for sensory processes, such as rhodopsin. Mutations in the MKKS gene are linked to Bardet-Biedl syndrome and McKusick-Kaufman syndrome, leading to a range of clinical manifestations due to the disruption of normal protein function and stability (Hirayama2008MKKS; Stone2000Mutation).

## Structure
The MKKS protein, also known as BBS6, is encoded by the MKKS gene and is involved in centrosomal shuttling and ciliary transport. The primary structure of MKKS consists of a sequence of 570 amino acids (Stone2000Mutation). It shares significant similarity with group II chaperonins, indicating an evolutionary link to the chaperonin family (Hirayama2008MKKS). The MKKS protein contains a group II chaperonin-like domain, which is crucial for its function in protein folding and centrosomal shuttling (Akimoto2013Translational).

The secondary structure of MKKS includes alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of chaperonin proteins, although specific details are not provided in the context. The tertiary structure is modeled based on the thermosome from Thermoplasma acidophilum, a multi-subunit assembly with two stacked octameric rings (Stone2000Mutation). The quaternary structure involves its interaction with other chaperonin-like proteins, such as BBS10 and BBS12, and CCT chaperonins, forming a complex essential for the assembly of the BBSome (Akimoto2013Translational).

MKKS undergoes post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, which targets it for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, particularly when mutated (Hirayama2008MKKS). The presence of splice variants and isoforms is suggested by the alternative polyadenylation and upstream open reading frames in the MKKS mRNA (Akimoto2013Translational).

## Function
The MKKS gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in centrosome function and intracellular trafficking in healthy human cells. The MKKS protein is known for its rapid shuttling between the centrosome and the cytosol, a process that is essential for maintaining proper cellular organization and function. This dynamic movement is facilitated by motor-driven transport processes, highlighting the protein's high mobility and solubility (Hirayama2008MKKS).

MKKS is a part of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) family of proteins, which are implicated in ciliary function and intracellular transport. The protein is involved in the transport of molecules such as rhodopsin, which is critical for photoreceptor function, indicating its role in sensory processes (Hirayama2008MKKS). In the context of centrosomal activities, MKKS is essential for proper cell division, particularly during cytokinesis. It is a centrosomal component required for resolving the intercellular bridge during cell division, ensuring normal centrosome numbers and preventing defects such as multinucleation (Kim2005MKKSBBS6).

Mutations in MKKS can lead to mislocalization and rapid degradation of the protein, disrupting its normal function and contributing to the pathology of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Hirayama2008MKKS).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the MKKS gene, also known as BBS6, are associated with several genetic disorders, most notably Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKKS). BBS is characterized by a range of symptoms including obesity, retinal dystrophy, polydactyly, renal malformations, and learning difficulties. Mutations in MKKS can lead to the production of non-functional proteins, contributing to the clinical manifestations of BBS (Hirayama2008MKKS; Katsanis2000Mutations). The MKKS gene encodes a protein involved in intracellular transport and centrosome shuttling, and mutations often result in the protein's mislocalization and degradation, which is mediated by the co-chaperone protein CHIP (Hirayama2008MKKS).

In McKusick-Kaufman syndrome, MKKS mutations are linked to developmental anomalies such as hydrometrocolpos, postaxial polydactyly, and congenital heart disease. These mutations can disrupt the protein's function, particularly affecting ATP hydrolysis, which is crucial for its role as a chaperonin (Stone2000Mutation). The genetic variability and incomplete penetrance of MKKS-related disorders suggest that other genetic or environmental factors may influence the phenotypic expression of these mutations (Stone2000Mutation).

## Interactions
MKKS, also known as BBS6, is a centrosome-shuttling protein that participates in several critical protein interactions. It is involved in the assembly of the BBSome complex, a multiprotein complex essential for ciliary function. MKKS interacts with other BBS proteins, including BBS1, BBS2, and BBS4, facilitating their proper localization and function within the cilia (Tian2023Organization). 

MKKS forms a complex with chaperonin-like proteins BBS10 and BBS12, as well as CCT/TRiC family chaperonins, which are crucial for the assembly and stability of the BBSome. This interaction is essential for the proper association of BBSome subunits, such as BBS2 and BBS7, with the complex (Seo2010BBS6). 

MKKS also interacts with molecular chaperones like HSP70, HSC70, and HSP90, which recognize and assist in the degradation of MKKS mutants through CHIP-mediated ubiquitination. This interaction is particularly significant for the degradation of unstable MKKS mutants, which are prone to forming insoluble structures (Hirayama2008MKKS). These interactions highlight the role of MKKS in protein quality control and its involvement in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
