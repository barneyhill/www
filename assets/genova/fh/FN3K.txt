# FN3K

## Overview
The FN3K gene encodes the enzyme fructosamine 3 kinase, a crucial component in the deglycation pathway, which is responsible for the removal of sugar moieties from glycated proteins. This enzyme is classified as a kinase due to its role in phosphorylating fructosamines, thereby facilitating their detachment from proteins and preventing the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that can lead to cellular damage and oxidative stress (Beeraka2021The; Avemaria2015Possible). FN3K is particularly active in tissues with long-lived proteins, such as erythrocytes, lens, and brain, where it helps maintain protein function and cellular homeostasis (Avemaria2015Possible). The enzyme's activity is modulated by its structural configuration, including a unique dimeric form that enhances its function (Shrestha2020A; Garg2024The). FN3K's interactions with various metabolic pathways and its involvement in disease contexts, such as cancer and diabetes, underscore its significance in both normal physiology and pathological conditions (Beeraka2023Screening; Avemaria2015Possible).

## Structure
The human fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) is an enzyme involved in the deglycation of glycated proteins, playing a crucial role in cellular homeostasis. The primary structure of FN3K consists of a sequence of amino acids encoded by the FN3K gene. The secondary structure includes alpha helices and beta sheets, which contribute to its enzymatic activity (Shrestha2020A). 

The tertiary structure of FN3K forms a specific 3D conformation necessary for its function. This structure is characterized by a unique dimeric configuration, where the ATP binding P-loop and adjoining beta strands are swapped between two chains, stabilized by inter-chain disulfide bonds. These disulfide bonds act as redox switches, regulating FN3K activity and dimerization (Shrestha2020A). 

FN3K's quaternary structure involves the formation of a domain-swapped dimer, which is more active than its monomeric form. This dimerization might be facilitated by post-translational modifications or eukaryotic chaperones (Garg2024The). The enzyme shows a preference for ATP over ADP, as evidenced by thermal stability assays (Garg2024The). 

FN3K may also undergo post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, which can influence its activity and function (Shrestha2020A).

## Function
Fructosamine 3 kinase (FN3K) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the deglycation process, which involves the removal of sugar moieties from proteins. This process is essential for maintaining protein function and preventing the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which can lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage (Beeraka2021The). FN3K phosphorylates fructosamines on the third carbon of their sugar moiety, making them unstable and causing them to detach from proteins, thereby maintaining protein function and integrity (Avemaria2015Possible).

FN3K is particularly active in tissues with long-lived proteins, such as erythrocytes, lens, and brain, where it helps in detoxifying harmful compounds into inert products (Avemaria2015Possible). In human erythrocytes, FN3K mediates the phosphorylation of sorbitol or fructose, generating sorbitol-3-phosphate and fructose-3-phosphate, respectively (Beeraka2021The). This activity is crucial in tissues with a high concentration of protein-bound fructosamines, suggesting its role in recycling FN3K activity in the deglycation pathway to mitigate AGE formation during metabolic diseases (Beeraka2021The).

FN3K's activity is significant in maintaining cellular homeostasis and metabolic regulation, contributing to the protection against oxidative stress and the maintenance of protein function in healthy human cells (Scumaci2023Epigenetic).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the FN3K gene have been implicated in various diseases, particularly in cancer and diabetes. In breast cancer, FN3K expression is significantly higher in the luminal B subtype and stage IV cancers, correlating with larger tumor sizes and poorer overall survival. This suggests that FN3K may serve as a prognostic marker in breast cancer, with its expression influencing patient outcomes (Beeraka2024Expression). FN3K's interaction with the Nrf2-Keap1 antioxidant signaling pathway is crucial, as it modulates Nrf2 activity, which is involved in cancer cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy (Beeraka2021The; Beeraka2023Screening).

In colorectal cancer, FN3K mRNA levels are significantly lower in cancerous tissues compared to normal mucosa, indicating a potential loss of its protective enzymatic function in cancer cells (Notarnicola2010Reduced). This reduction in FN3K activity may contribute to increased susceptibility to cancer and other disorders related to carbonyl stress.

In diabetes, FN3K is involved in the deglycation of proteins, a process that repairs proteins by removing fructosamines. Variability in FN3K activity has been associated with polymorphisms in the FN3K gene, which may influence its function and impact diabetic complications (Avemaria2015Possible).

## Interactions
Fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) is involved in various protein interactions that influence cellular processes. FN3K interacts with proteins involved in fatty acid and pyruvate metabolism, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). These interactions were identified through immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses, suggesting FN3K's role in core metabolic pathways (Shrestha2024Multiomics). FN3K also interacts with NAD compounds, with its activity being inhibited by NADH, indicating a regulatory mechanism in metabolic pathways (Shrestha2024Multiomics).

In cancer cells, FN3K is involved in the regulation of the Nrf2-Keap1 antioxidant signaling pathway. It deglycates Nrf2, enhancing its activity and contributing to the antioxidant defense mechanisms in cancer cells. This interaction is significant in the context of breast cancer, where FN3K expression is modulated by various anticancer drugs, affecting Nrf2-driven signaling (Beeraka2023Screening).

FN3K's interactions extend to its subcellular localization, being present in the nucleus, mitochondria, and cytoplasm, which suggests its involvement in diverse cellular functions and regulatory pathways (Shrestha2024Multiomics). These interactions highlight FN3K's multifaceted role in cellular metabolism and stress response.
