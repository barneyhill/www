# EPB41L2

## Overview
EPB41L2 is a gene that encodes the protein erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 2, which is a member of the protein 4.1 family. This family is known for its role in maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes by linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. The EPB41L2 protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and motility, and is particularly significant in the localization and solubility of the SREB1 protein at the plasma membrane (Kaafarani2023Proximity). It interacts with several proteins, including orphan G protein-coupled receptors, and plays a crucial role in the structural organization of the cell cortex, influencing cell polarity and stability (Schulz2010Changes; Kaafarani2023Proximity). The gene has clinical significance, with implications in diseases such as childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer, where its expression levels and interactions can affect disease progression and treatment outcomes (Jiang2021Exosomal; Menyhárt2019Gene; Fernandes2022Correlation).

## Function
EPB41L2, also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 2, is a member of the protein 4.1 family, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of cell membranes by linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. This protein is involved in various cellular processes, including cell signaling, adhesion, and motility. EPB41L2 is particularly important in the localization and solubility of the SREB1 protein at the plasma membrane. It forms complexes with other proteins near the plasma membrane, modifying the membrane environment to increase the solubility of SREB1 when detergents are used. Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting analyses have shown that EPB41L2 colocalizes with SREB1 at the plasma membrane, especially in domains facing other cells, suggesting a role in cell-cell contact (Kaafarani2023Proximity).

EPB41L2 is also involved in the structural organization of the cell cortex, contributing to cell polarity, adhesion, and motility by forming nodes that connect components of the cortical cytoskeleton, such as spectrins, actin, and transmembrane proteins (Schulz2010Changes). This organization is essential for maintaining the mechanical stability and function of the cell cortex, influencing cellular responses to extracellular signals.

## Clinical Significance
The EPB41L2 gene has been implicated in several diseases and conditions due to mutations, altered expression levels, or changes in its normal interactions. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), polymorphisms in the EPB41L2 gene, particularly the rs915172 variant, have been associated with disease incidence. A lower frequency of this variant correlates with a higher incidence of ALL, suggesting it may act as a protective factor against the disease (Han2010Genomewide; Fernandes2022Correlation).

In colorectal cancer, circEPB41L2, a circular RNA derived from the EPB41L2 gene, is downregulated in patients. This RNA acts as a molecular sponge for miR-21-5p and miR-942-5p, influencing the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway. Overexpression of circEPB41L2 has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and promote apoptosis, indicating its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Jiang2021Exosomal).

In ovarian cancer, EPB41L2 is upregulated in patients resistant to topotecan treatment, a second-line therapy. This upregulation is associated with worse progression-free survival outcomes, suggesting EPB41L2 as a potential biomarker for resistance to this chemotherapy (Menyhárt2019Gene).

Additionally, a novel fusion gene involving EPB41L2, NFIB-EPB41L2, has been identified in adenoid cystic carcinoma, potentially contributing to tumorigenesis by enhancing MYB expression (Shibata2021Detection).

## Interactions
EPB41L2, also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 2, is involved in several protein interactions, particularly with the SREB receptors, which are orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in the brain. EPB41L2 has been identified as a significant interactor with SREB1, SREB2, and SREB3, as well as CMKLR1, through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, indicating a physical interaction with these receptors (Kaafarani2023Proximity).

The interaction between EPB41L2 and SREB1 is particularly notable. Immunofluorescence microscopy has shown that EPB41L2 and SREB1 colocalize at the plasma membrane, suggesting that EPB41L2 plays a role in the localization and solubilization of SREB1. Overexpression of EPB41L2 increases the solubility of SREB1, while knockdown of EPB41L2 reduces SREB1 levels at the plasma membrane (Kaafarani2023Proximity).

EPB41L2 is part of the 4.1 protein family, characterized by a FERM domain, which facilitates interactions between plasma membrane proteins and the cytoskeleton. This structural feature supports its role in maintaining cell shape and stability, as well as its involvement in receptor-mediated signaling pathways (Kaafarani2023Proximity). The study did not report any interactions of EPB41L2 with nucleic acids (Kaafarani2023Proximity).
