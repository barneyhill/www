# ZFP41

## Overview
ZFP41 is a gene that encodes the ZFP41 zinc finger protein, which is part of the zinc finger protein family known for their role in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Zinc finger proteins are characterized by the presence of zinc finger motifs, which facilitate their interaction with DNA, RNA, or other proteins, thereby influencing various cellular processes. The ZFP41 protein is implicated in several biological pathways and has been associated with various diseases, including cancer and psychiatric disorders. Its involvement in cancer is highlighted by its identification as a 'missing protein' in malignant melanoma and its hypermethylation in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression (Arai2017DNA; Sanchez2019Novel). Additionally, alterations in ZFP41 have been linked to genomic losses in myeloproliferative neoplasms and differential methylation in schizophrenia, indicating its potential significance in these conditions (Castellani2015DNA; Arefi2014Genomic).

## Clinical Significance
ZFP41, a zinc finger protein, has been implicated in various diseases and conditions due to alterations in its expression or interactions. In the context of cancer, ZFP41 was identified as a 'missing protein' in stage 3 malignant melanoma, suggesting its potential role in cancer progression. This study marked the first evidence of ZFP41 at the protein level in melanoma, indicating a need for further research to explore its role in melanoma progression (Sanchez2019Novel).

In myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), ZFP41 is located in a region associated with genomic losses on chromosome 8q24.3, observed in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Ph-negative MPN. This suggests that the loss of ZFP41 may be involved in the pathogenesis of these conditions (Arefi2014Genomic).

ZFP41 has also been identified as one of the top hypermethylated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), indicating its potential involvement in liver cancer progression through epigenetic modifications (Arai2017DNA). In schizophrenia, ZFP41 was noted to have nearby differentially methylated regions in monozygotic twins discordant for the disorder, suggesting a possible link to psychosis-related pathways (Castellani2015DNA).
