# ADCY5

## Overview
ADCY5 is a gene that encodes the protein adenylate cyclase 5, a membrane-bound enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular signaling by converting ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP) in response to G-protein signaling. Adenylate cyclase 5 is categorized as a transmembrane enzyme, characterized by its two transmembrane domains and two major cytoplasmic domains, which are essential for its catalytic activity (Chen2014Gain‐of‐function; Tänzler2023Effects). The enzyme is involved in various physiological processes, including energy balance, neurotransmission, and cardiac function, and is highly expressed in tissues such as pancreatic beta cells and the central nervous system (Devasani2022Expression; Hodson2014ADCY5). Mutations in the ADCY5 gene have been linked to hyperkinetic movement disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Chen2015ADCY5; Carecchio2017ADCY5related).

## Structure
ADCY5, or adenylate cyclase 5, is a membrane-bound enzyme characterized by its complex molecular structure. It consists of two transmembrane domains, M1 and M2, each comprising six helices of hydrophobic amino acids, which anchor the enzyme to the cell membrane (Chen2014Gain‐of‐function; Tänzler2023Effects). The protein also includes two major cytoplasmic domains, C1 and C2, which are crucial for forming the ATP-binding site within a catalytic pocket (Chen2014Gain‐of‐function; Tänzler2023Effects). These domains are further divided into catalytic (C1a, C2a) and regulatory (C1b, C2b) subdomains (Dessauer2017International).

The catalytic domains of ADCY5 form a heterodimeric structure, which is essential for its enzymatic activity (Dessauer2017International). The interaction between the C1 and C2 domains is critical for the enzyme's function, and specific mutations in these regions can significantly alter its activity (Chen2014Gain‐of‐function; Tänzler2023Effects). The quaternary structure involves the interaction of these domains, stabilized by forskolin binding, which enhances cAMP synthesis (Dessauer2017International).

Mutations such as R418W and A726T have been identified, affecting the enzyme's response to β-adrenergic receptor stimulation and altering the ATP-binding pocket structure (Tänzler2023Effects). These mutations are associated with increased cAMP production and are linked to kinetic disorders (Tänzler2023Effects).

## Function
The ADCY5 gene encodes adenylate cyclase 5, an enzyme that plays a critical role in converting ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP) in response to G-protein signaling. This process is essential for various cellular functions, including energy balance, neurotransmission, and cardiac function. In human cells, ADCY5 is highly expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where it is crucial for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. It links glucose-derived signals to intracellular calcium rises, which are necessary for insulin granule exocytosis (Hodson2014ADCY5). ADCY5 is also involved in the regulation of insulin secretion by affecting cAMP signaling pathways, although it does not participate in the insulin secretion response to incretin hormones like GLP-1 (Hodson2014ADCY5).

In the central nervous system, ADCY5 is upregulated during neuronal differentiation and is involved in neuronal maturation and function. It plays a role in regulating anxiety and stress responses, as well as striatum-dependent learning and motor activity (Devasani2022Expression). ADCY5 is also active in the heart, where its deletion has been shown to improve basal left ventricular function and protect against chronic beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation (Dessauer2017International).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the ADCY5 gene are associated with a range of hyperkinetic movement disorders, including familial dyskinesia with facial myokymia (FDFM) and ADCY5-related dyskinesia. These disorders are characterized by involuntary movements such as chorea, dystonia, and myoclonus, often with facial involvement (Chen2015ADCY5; Chen2014Gain‐of‐function). The mutations can lead to gain-of-function effects, resulting in increased adenylyl cyclase activity and elevated cAMP levels, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders (Chen2014Gain‐of‐function).

Specific mutations, such as p.R418W and p.A726T, have been linked to varying severities of the disorder, with some causing relatively mild symptoms and others leading to more severe manifestations (Carecchio2017ADCY5related; Chen2015ADCY5). The phenotypic variability is partly attributed to genotype-phenotype correlations and somatic mosaicism, which can result in a less severe phenotype (Carecchio2017ADCY5related; Chen2015ADCY5).

ADCY5-related movement disorders often present in infancy or childhood and can include delayed developmental milestones, axial hypotonia, and episodic exacerbations of dyskinesias, particularly during sleep transitions (Carecchio2017ADCY5related; Chen2015ADCY5). The condition is sometimes misdiagnosed as other movement disorders, such as cerebral palsy, due to overlapping symptoms (Chen2015ADCY5).

## Interactions
ADCY5, or adenylate cyclase 5, is known to interact with various proteins, playing a significant role in cellular signaling pathways. One of the key interactions is with A-kinase anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79), which scaffolds ADCY5 to AMPA receptors. This interaction is crucial for the spatial regulation of cAMP signaling pathways and is mediated by specific regions of AKAP79, particularly residues 77-108. Disruption of this interaction can lead to decreased AMPA receptor-associated AC activity (Efendiev2010AKAP79).

ADCY5 also interacts with G-protein subunits, such as Gαs, which enhances cAMP production. Mutations in ADCY5, like R418W and A726T, can lead to increased cAMP production and altered interactions with Gαi/o-coupled receptors, affecting downstream signaling (Doyle2019Functional). Additionally, ADCY5 is regulated by protein kinase C (PKC), which can stimulate its activity, and by regulator of G-protein signaling proteins, such as RGS9-2, which modulate its activity (Dessauer2017International).

These interactions highlight the complex regulatory mechanisms involving ADCY5, which are essential for its role in signal transduction and the modulation of cAMP levels within cells.
