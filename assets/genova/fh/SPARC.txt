# SPARC

## Overview
SPARC (secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich), also known as osteonectin, is a gene that encodes a matricellular protein involved in the regulation of cell-matrix interactions and tissue remodeling. The SPARC protein is characterized by its multi-domain structure, which includes an acidic N-terminal domain, a follistatin-like domain, and an extracellular calcium-binding domain, each contributing to its diverse biological functions (Mason1986Evidence; McVey1988Characterization). As a matricellular protein, SPARC does not primarily serve as a structural component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) but rather modulates cell behavior and ECM assembly through interactions with various ECM proteins and cell surface receptors (Bradshaw2012Diverse). It plays a critical role in processes such as wound healing, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling, and is implicated in pathological conditions including cancer and fibrosis, where its expression and function can be significantly altered (Clark2008A; Yang2007Frequent).

## Structure
The SPARC protein, also known as osteonectin, is a multi-domain matricellular protein involved in cell-matrix interactions and tissue remodeling. It is composed of three major domains: an acidic N-terminal domain, a follistatin-like domain, and an extracellular calcium-binding (EC) domain. The N-terminal domain is rich in glutamic acid residues, which contribute to its calcium-binding properties (Mason1986Evidence; McVey1988Characterization). The follistatin-like domain contains a cysteine-rich module with 10 conserved cysteine residues and an N-glycosylation site, which is involved in inhibiting cell proliferation and disrupting focal adhesions (Lane1994The; Martinek2007Is).

The EC domain, located at the C-terminus, contains two EF-hand motifs that bind calcium ions with high affinity, forming a helix-loop-helix structure. This domain is crucial for SPARC's interaction with collagen and its anti-spreading activity in human urothelial cells (Delostrinos2005The; Martinek2007Is). The protein's structure is stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds, contributing to its protease-resistant core (Mason1986Evidence).

SPARC undergoes post-translational modifications, including glycosylation and phosphorylation, which influence its function and interactions (McVey1988Characterization). The protein is secreted by various tissues and is highly conserved across species, indicating its essential role in extracellular matrix processes (McVey1988Characterization).

## Function
SPARC (secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich), also known as osteonectin, is a matricellular protein that plays a crucial role in modulating cell-matrix interactions. It is involved in the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein deposition and assembly, influencing the organization and composition of the ECM by binding to collagens and other ECM components (Lane1994The; Bradshaw2012Diverse). SPARC affects cell morphology by inhibiting cell spreading and inducing cell rounding, which disrupts focal adhesions and alters cytoskeletal elements (Lane1994The). It also regulates cell proliferation by inhibiting DNA synthesis in endothelial cells, causing growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (Lane1994The).

SPARC is active in various tissues, including bone, cartilage, and fibroblasts, and is involved in both ossified and non-ossified tissues (Lane1994The). It modulates growth factor signaling by interacting with cell surface receptors and growth factors such as VEGF, bFGF, and TGF-β1, influencing receptor activation and downstream signaling pathways (Bradshaw2012Diverse). SPARC's role in ECM assembly and cell-matrix interactions is critical for processes like tissue remodeling, wound healing, and angiogenesis (Clark2008A).

## Clinical Significance
The SPARC gene, also known as osteonectin, plays a significant role in various diseases due to its involvement in tissue remodeling and cellular interactions. In cancer, SPARC is often implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. Its expression is frequently downregulated in colorectal and gastric cancers due to promoter hypermethylation, which is associated with poor prognosis and rapid disease progression (Yang2007Frequent; Chen2014Aberrant). In colorectal cancer, low SPARC levels are linked to chemotherapy resistance, but treatment with demethylating agents can restore its expression and improve therapeutic outcomes (Cheetham2008SPARC; Tai2005Genomewide).

SPARC is also involved in systemic sclerosis (SSc), where specific polymorphisms in the SPARC gene are associated with increased susceptibility to the disease. These polymorphisms can lead to higher SPARC expression, contributing to the fibrotic phenotype observed in SSc (Zhou2002Association). In gastrointestinal cancers, SPARC's methylation status serves as a potential diagnostic marker, with its aberrant expression linked to cancer development and progression (Nagaraju2013SPARC). Overall, alterations in SPARC expression and interactions have significant implications for disease progression and treatment resistance across various conditions.

## Interactions
SPARC (secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich) is involved in various interactions with proteins within the extracellular matrix (ECM). It binds to integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a serine/threonine kinase, influencing cellular contractile elements and fibronectin matrix assembly. This interaction is crucial for fibronectin-induced ILK activation and downstream signaling, affecting cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization (Barker2005SPARC). SPARC also interacts with several ECM proteins, including thrombospondin 1, vitronectin, entactin/nidogen, and various types of collagen, such as types I, II, III, IV, and V. These interactions suggest SPARC's role in regulating cell interaction with the extracellular environment during development and in response to injury (Bradshaw2001SPARC).

SPARC's interaction with collagen is particularly significant, as it binds to collagens in a calcium-dependent manner, influencing their assembly in the ECM. This binding can affect the engagement of collagen with cell-surface receptors, potentially modulating collagen fibril formation and stability (Bradshaw2009The). SPARC also interacts with the scavenger receptor stabilin-1, which internalizes SPARC and targets it for degradation, potentially regulating its concentration in inflamed tissues (Workman2011Identification).
