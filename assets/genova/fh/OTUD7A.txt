# OTUD7A

## Overview
OTUD7A is a gene that encodes the protein OTU deubiquitinase 7A, which is a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family. This protein plays a pivotal role in cellular protein homeostasis by removing ubiquitin from specific substrates, thereby regulating proteasome activity and protein turnover. OTU deubiquitinase 7A is particularly significant in neurodevelopment, where it is involved in synapse formation and function, influencing dendritic spine density and morphology. The protein's interactions with Ankyrin proteins and its role in stabilizing oncogenic proteins like EWS-FLI1 highlight its diverse functional implications. Disruptions in OTUD7A are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome, which is associated with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and epilepsy (Unda2022Impaired; Su2021SPOP; Uddin2018OTUD7A).

## Structure


## Function
OTUD7A (OTU deubiquitinase 7A) is a gene encoding a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein homeostasis through its deubiquitinating activity. This protein is involved in the removal of ubiquitin from specific substrates, a process essential for regulating proteasome activity and maintaining cellular protein balance. OTUD7A is particularly important for the assembly and function of proteasome complexes, such as the PA28-20S complex, which are critical for protein degradation and turnover (Garret2020Report).

In healthy human cells, OTUD7A is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, where it influences various cellular processes, including synapse formation and function. It is localized to dendritic spines and synaptic compartments, suggesting a role in synaptic development and plasticity (Uddin2018OTUD7A; Yin2018Otud7a). The protein's activity is crucial for maintaining dendritic spine density and morphology, which are vital for proper neuronal connectivity and function (Uddin2018OTUD7A).

OTUD7A's involvement in these molecular processes underscores its significance in neurodevelopment and its potential impact on neurological health, as disruptions in its function are linked to various neurodevelopmental disorders (Uddin2018OTUD7A).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the OTUD7A gene are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. This syndrome is linked to intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy, and schizophrenia. OTUD7A is considered a critical driver gene within this chromosomal region, contributing to the observed neurological deficits (Unda2022Impaired; Uddin2018OTUD7A). 

Loss-of-function mutations in OTUD7A can lead to significant synaptic and neuronal dysfunction. For instance, biallelic loss-of-function variants have been reported in a case of a child with profound hypotonia, severe intellectual disability, and seizures, suggesting a potential autosomal recessive disorder (Suzuki2020Biallelic). The gene's interactions with Ankyrin proteins, particularly Ankyrin-G and Ankyrin-B, are crucial for maintaining neuronal function. Disruptions in these interactions, such as those caused by patient mutations, can lead to neuronal dysfunction and are implicated in conditions like epilepsy and ASD (Unda2022Impaired; Scheefhals2023The).

OTUD7A's role in synaptic function is further highlighted by its involvement in regulating dendritic spine development. Its expression can rescue spine density and morphology defects in models of the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome, underscoring its importance in neurodevelopment (Uddin2018OTUD7A).

## Interactions
OTUD7A (OTU deubiquitinase 7A) is involved in several critical protein-protein interactions that are essential for its role in neurodevelopment and disease mechanisms. It interacts with Ankyrin proteins, specifically Ankyrin-G and Ankyrin-B, which are crucial for neuronal function. Ankyrin-G is a master regulator of the axon initial segment (AIS) and is involved in the organization of ion channels and structural proteins, while Ankyrin-B is associated with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders and is involved in axon growth and branching (Unda2022Impaired). The interaction between OTUD7A and these Ankyrin proteins is affected by patient mutations, which may contribute to the neuronal phenotypes observed in the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (Unda2022Impaired).

OTUD7A also plays a role in regulating the stability of the EWS-FLI1 protein, a fusion oncogene critical for the growth of Ewing sarcoma cells. It stabilizes EWS-FLI1 by deubiquitinating it, thereby opposing the degradation process mediated by the E3 ligase SPOP (Su2021SPOP). This interaction is specific to Ewing sarcoma cells, as OTUD7A depletion reduces EWS-FLI1 protein levels and impedes tumor growth (Su2021SPOP).
