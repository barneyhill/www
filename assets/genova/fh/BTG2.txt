# BTG2

## Overview
BTG2, also known as BTG anti-proliferation factor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the BTG/Tob family, which is characterized by its role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. The BTG2 protein functions primarily as a transcriptional coactivator and is involved in various cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and mRNA deadenylation. It is known for its tumor suppressor activity, influencing gene expression through interactions with transcription factors and nuclear receptors. The protein's structure includes an N-terminal APRO domain, which facilitates interactions with other proteins such as the poly(A) binding protein PABPC1 and the CAF1 deadenylase subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, playing a crucial role in mRNA decay and gene expression regulation (Mauxion2009BTGTOB; Amine2021A). BTG2's expression is modulated by p53, particularly in response to DNA damage, underscoring its importance in maintaining genomic stability and cellular quiescence (MAO2014BTG2:). Its clinical significance is highlighted by its altered expression in various cancers, where it often acts as a tumor suppressor, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Takahashi2011Breast; MAO2014BTG2:).

## Structure
The BTG2 protein is a member of the BTG/Tob family, characterized by the presence of an N-terminal APRO domain, which includes conserved motifs such as boxA, boxB, and boxC. The APRO domain is approximately 120 amino acids long and forms a unique globular structure composed of five α-helices and four β-strands, arranged in a novel topology (Mauxion2009BTGTOB). The boxC motif, an 11 amino-acid sequence (DGSICVLYEEA), is crucial for interaction with the poly(A) binding protein PABPC1, facilitating mRNA deadenylation (Amine2021A).

BTG2 interacts with the CAF1 deadenylase subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex through its APRO domain, maintaining its conformation upon binding (Amine2021A). The protein also interacts with PRMT1, although this interaction does not require the boxC motif (Amine2021A). BTG2 is involved in cellular processes such as differentiation and tumor suppression, and it is a substrate for post-translational modifications like phosphorylation, which can influence its stability and activity (Mauxion2009BTGTOB). The protein typically functions as a monomer, lacking a quaternary structure.

## Function
BTG2, also known as BTG anti-proliferation factor 2, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis. In healthy human cells, BTG2 functions as a transcriptional coactivator and is involved in the regulation of mRNA abundance. It interacts with transcription factors such as Homeobox B9 and nuclear receptors like androgen and estrogen receptors, influencing gene expression (Kim2022Emerging).

BTG2 plays a critical role in maintaining cellular quiescence by controlling the cell cycle. It suppresses cell growth by downregulating cyclin D1, inhibiting retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation, and causing G1 arrest. This suppression is facilitated through its interaction with histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC4, and HDAC9 (Yuniati2018Tumor). BTG2 also induces G2/M arrest independently of p53 and is involved in cellular senescence by antagonizing Pin1 (Kim2022Emerging).

The protein is active in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, with its function influenced by its intracellular location (Kim2022Emerging). BTG2 is also involved in DNA damage repair, with its expression being upregulated by p53 during DNA damage, leading to cell cycle arrest and potentially promoting DNA repair (MAO2014BTG2:). It is essential for neurogenesis during adulthood, with its expression induced during this process (Yuniati2018Tumor).

## Clinical Significance
BTG2 (BTG anti-proliferation factor 2) is a tumor suppressor gene with significant clinical implications in various cancers. Alterations in BTG2 expression are linked to the progression and prognosis of several cancer types. In breast cancer, decreased BTG2 expression is associated with higher tumor grade, increased tumor size, and poor overall survival. This downregulation enhances cell motility, tumor growth, and metastasis by stabilizing HER ligands and activating HER2 and HER3 receptors, leading to elevated AKT phosphorylation (Takahashi2011Breast; Kawakubo2004Expression). In prostate cancer, loss of BTG2 is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, contributing to cancer progression (MAO2014BTG2:).

In bladder cancer, high BTG2 expression correlates with poor cancer-specific survival, suggesting a complex role where BTG2 may enhance the migratory potential of cancer cells (Wagener2013Endogenous). In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, BTG2 is significantly downregulated, indicating its potential as a molecular marker for this cancer type (Struckmann2004Impaired). These findings highlight the critical role of BTG2 expression levels and interactions in cancer development and progression.

## Interactions
BTG2 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in mRNA deadenylation and transcription regulation. It directly interacts with the CAF1 deadenylase, a subunit of the CCR4-NOT complex, through its APRO domain. This interaction is crucial for BTG2's role in mRNA deadenylation, which involves the shortening of the poly(A) tail of mRNA, leading to mRNA decay and regulation of gene expression (Stupfler2016BTG2). BTG2 also interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1. This interaction is mediated by the APRO domain of BTG2 and the first RRM domain of PABPC1, and it is sufficient to stimulate CAF1 deadenylase activity in vitro (Stupfler2016BTG2; Amine2021A).

The interaction between BTG2 and PABPC1 is facilitated by a conserved boxC motif within the APRO domain, which is necessary and sufficient for binding to PABPC1's RRM domains (Amine2021A). BTG2 also interacts with PRMT1, although this interaction does not require the boxC motif (Amine2021A). Additionally, BTG2 forms complexes with hCCR4, hCAF1, and hPOP2 in mammalian cells, suggesting its involvement in transcription regulation pathways (Morel2003BTG2).
