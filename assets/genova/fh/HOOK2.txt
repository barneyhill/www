# HOOK2

## Overview
HOOK2 is a gene that encodes the hook microtubule tethering protein 2, a crucial component in cellular processes involving microtubule dynamics and intracellular transport. The protein is categorized as a microtubule-binding protein and is integral to the organization and function of the cytoskeleton. It facilitates the tethering of organelles to microtubules, thereby playing a pivotal role in their intracellular movement and positioning. HOOK2 is particularly active in the centrosomes and Golgi apparatus, where it is essential for cell division and maintaining cellular architecture. The protein's interactions with the PAR complex and other centrosomal proteins underscore its importance in processes such as polarized cell migration, ciliogenesis, and aggresome formation, which are vital for cellular homeostasis and function (PallesiPocachard2016Hook2; Szebenyi2007Hook2).

## Function
HOOK2 is a microtubule-binding protein that plays a significant role in intracellular transport and cytoskeletal organization. It functions by linking organelles to microtubules, facilitating their movement within cells. In particular, HOOK2 is active in the cytoplasm, especially in centrosomes and the Golgi apparatus, where it is crucial for cell division and maintaining cellular structure (PallesiPocachard2016Hook2).

HOOK2 interacts with the PAR complex, which includes PAR6α, aPKC, and PAR3, to control centrosome orientation during polarized cell migration. It acts as an adaptor to recruit the PAR complex to the centrosome, which is essential for the polarized re-orientation of the Golgi apparatus towards the migration front (PallesiPocachard2016Hook2). The C-terminal domain of HOOK2 interacts with the aPKC-binding domain of PAR6α, localizing PAR6α to the centrosome and impacting pericentriolar and microtubule organization (PallesiPocachard2016Hook2).

HOOK2 is also involved in processes like endosome/lysosome processing, Golgi apparatus organization, and centrosomal function. It plays a role in ciliogenesis in association with PCM1 and Rab8a, linking the PAR polarity complex and the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) to facilitate signal transmission for Golgi re-orientation during directional migration (PallesiPocachard2016Hook2).

## Clinical Significance
HOOK2 is implicated in several cellular processes, and its dysregulation can contribute to disease pathogenesis. Alterations in HOOK2 expression or function have been associated with conditions involving protein aggregation. Specifically, HOOK2 plays a role in the formation of aggresomes, which are cellular structures that sequester misfolded proteins. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of potentially toxic protein aggregates. Disruption of HOOK2 function can lead to impaired aggresome formation, which may be relevant in diseases characterized by protein aggregation (Szebenyi2007Hook2).

In the context of Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD), a study identified HOOK2 as potentially interacting with EPS8, suggesting its involvement in HHD-related processes. This interaction may influence cellular pathways that are altered in HHD, although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (Zhang2018Altered).

While direct links between HOOK2 mutations and specific diseases are not extensively documented, its role in microtubule organization and intracellular transport suggests that dysregulation could impact cellular functions, potentially contributing to conditions involving microtubule dysfunction or protein aggregation (Szebenyi2007Hook2).

## Interactions
HOOK2, a microtubule-binding protein, is involved in various protein interactions that are crucial for its cellular functions. It interacts with PAR6α, a component of the PAR complex, which is essential for centrosome orientation during polarized cell migration. This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal portion of HOOK2 and is necessary for the centrosomal localization of PAR6α (PallesiPocachard2016Hook2). HOOK2 also acts as an adaptor, facilitating the binding of aPKC to PAR6α and recruiting the PAR6α/PAR3/aPKC complex to the centrosome (PallesiPocachard2016Hook2).

HOOK2 interacts with several centrosomal proteins, including CENP-F and centriolin, which are important for its localization and function at the centrosome (Moynihan2009Murine; Dwivedi2019Incorporating). It also associates with PCM1, although this interaction appears to be independent of PCM1's levels and localization (PallesiPocachard2016Hook2).

In the context of aggresome formation, HOOK2 is involved in the recruitment of dynein, a motor protein necessary for aggresome formation, to the centrosome. Although a direct interaction with dynein has not been demonstrated, HOOK2 may function as a transient linker or attachment factor during the loading of cargo onto the dynein/dynactin complex (Szebenyi2007Hook2).
