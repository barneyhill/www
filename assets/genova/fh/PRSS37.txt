# PRSS37

## Overview
PRSS37 is a gene that encodes the protein serine protease 37, which is a testis-specific serine protease involved in male fertility. The protein is localized in the acrosome region of sperm and plays a crucial role in the acrosome reaction, a process essential for fertilization. As a serine protease, it functions as a protein chaperone, influencing the expression and stabilization of proteins necessary for sperm motility and migration, such as ADAM3. The absence or reduced levels of PRSS37 are associated with impaired sperm function and unexplained male infertility, highlighting its importance in natural fertilization processes (Sutton2023Molecular; Liu2016Low). The gene's expression is specific to the testis, and its protein product is involved in critical interactions that facilitate sperm migration and zona pellucida binding, making it a potential target for non-hormonal male contraception and a biomarker for diagnosing male infertility (Shen2013Prss37; Freitas2019Isoformspecific).

## Function
PRSS37 is a testis-specific gene that encodes a protein localized in the acrosome region of human sperm, playing a critical role in male fertility. The protein is involved in the acrosome reaction, a vital process for fertilization, where it contributes to the proper activation of the proacrosin/acrosin system, essential for sperm function during fertilization (Liu2016Low). PRSS37 acts as a protein chaperone, influencing the expression of other proteins necessary for sperm migration, such as ADAM3, and affects sperm motility and migration through the uterotubal junction (UTJ) (Sutton2023Molecular). 

In healthy human cells, PRSS37 is crucial for the stabilization and processing of proteins involved in sperm migration and fertilization, ensuring successful sperm transit through the female reproductive tract (Sutton2023Molecular). The protein's presence in the acrosome and its reduction after the acrosome reaction suggest its involvement in the molecular processes that facilitate sperm-egg recognition and binding (Liu2016Low). Low levels of PRSS37 are associated with unexplained male infertility, indicating its importance in maintaining normal sperm function and fertilization capability (Liu2016Low).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the PRSS37 gene have been linked to unexplained male infertility (UMI). Studies have shown that PRSS37 mRNA is specifically expressed in the testis, and the protein is localized in the acrosome region of sperm. In cases of UMI, PRSS37 protein levels are significantly lower compared to those in men with proven fertility or sperm donors. This reduction in PRSS37 is associated with abnormal activation of the proacrosin/acrosin system and premature proteolysis of ADAM2, which may impair sperm's functional competence in vivo (Liu2016Low). Despite these issues, in vitro fertilization outcomes are not significantly affected by low PRSS37 levels, suggesting that its role is more critical in natural fertilization processes (Liu2016Low).

In mouse models, the absence of PRSS37 leads to male infertility due to defects in sperm migration from the uterus to the oviduct and reduced sperm-zona binding abilities. This is linked to the absence of mature ADAM3 protein, which is crucial for sperm function (Shen2013Prss37). These findings highlight the potential of PRSS37 as a biomarker for diagnosing male infertility and as a target for therapeutic interventions (Liu2016Low).

## Interactions
PRSS37, a serine protease, is involved in several protein interactions crucial for male fertility. It plays a significant role in the stabilization and processing of proteins on the sperm surface. Notably, PRSS37 is required for the proper processing of ADAM3, a protein essential for sperm migration and zona pellucida binding, which are critical steps in fertilization (Sutton2023Molecular; Shen2013Prss37). The absence of PRSS37 leads to a lack of mature ADAM3 in sperm, resulting in impaired sperm migration and reduced fertilization rates (Shen2013Prss37).

PRSS37 also interacts with other proteins such as TMPRSS12, which is involved in sperm motility and migration (Sutton2023Molecular). Proteomic analysis has shown that several proteins, including ADAM6, SLXL1, SPATA20, and TRIM36, are more abundantly expressed in heterozygous mice compared to knockout mice, suggesting their interaction with PRSS37 and importance in male fertility (Sutton2023Molecular). Additionally, PRSS37 is identified as an interactor of GSK3A and GSK3B, proteins associated with sperm motility-related functions (Freitas2019Isoformspecific). These interactions highlight the critical role of PRSS37 in maintaining the functional integrity of sperm and its potential as a target for non-hormonal male contraception.
