# GPATCH3

## Overview
GPATCH3 is a gene that encodes the protein G-patch domain containing 3, which plays a significant role in the regulation of RNA processing and the innate immune response. The protein is characterized by the presence of a G-patch domain, which is implicated in RNA binding and processing activities. GPATCH3 functions as a negative regulator of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated antiviral signaling pathways by disrupting the assembly of the VISA signalosome, thereby modulating the production of type I interferons (IFNs) essential for antiviral responses (Nie2017GPATCH3). The protein is localized in the nucleus, cytosol, and mitochondria, indicating its involvement in diverse cellular processes beyond immune regulation (Nie2017GPATCH3).

## Structure


## Function
GPATCH3 (G-patch domain containing 3) is a protein involved in the regulation of RNA processing, particularly in the context of the innate immune response. It functions as a negative regulator of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated antiviral signaling pathways. GPATCH3 impairs the induction of antiviral genes by disrupting the assembly of the VISA signalosome, a critical adaptor complex in the RLR signaling pathway. This disruption reduces the production of type I interferons (IFNs), which are essential for antiviral responses (Nie2017GPATCH3).

The protein is recruited to the VISA signalosome in a virus infection-dependent manner, where it interferes with the association of VISA with downstream signaling components such as TBK1 and TRAF6. This interference occurs without affecting the oligomerization or aggregation of VISA itself, indicating a specific regulatory role in modulating immune responses to prevent excessive activation (Nie2017GPATCH3).

GPATCH3 is constitutively localized in the nucleus, cytosol, and mitochondria, suggesting its involvement in various cellular processes beyond immune regulation. Its interaction with VISA is dependent on the transmembrane domain of VISA, highlighting a specific mechanism by which GPATCH3 exerts its regulatory function (Nie2017GPATCH3).

## Interactions
GPATCH3 is known to interact with the mitochondrial protein VISA (also known as MAVS, IPS-1, or Cardif) in a manner dependent on viral infection. This interaction disrupts the assembly of the VISA/TRAF6/TBK1 signalosome, which is essential for the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) and the subsequent antiviral response. GPATCH3 specifically binds to VISA, but not to other proteins such as RIG-I, MDA5, or IRF3, indicating a selective interaction that is crucial for its inhibitory function in antiviral signaling pathways (Nie2017GPATCH3).

The interaction between GPATCH3 and VISA is enhanced following viral infection, suggesting that GPATCH3's binding to VISA is critical for its role in negatively regulating the RLR-mediated signaling pathway. Domain mapping analysis has shown that the full-length spatial conformation of GPATCH3 is necessary for binding to VISA, as no specific domain is solely responsible for this interaction. GPATCH3 associates with full-length VISA and its truncations containing the C-terminal transmembrane domain, but not with VISA truncations lacking this domain, indicating the importance of the transmembrane domain for their interaction (Nie2017GPATCH3).
