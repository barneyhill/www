# GPAT4

## Overview
GPAT4, or glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 4, is a gene that encodes a critical enzyme involved in lipid metabolism. The protein product of GPAT4 is a transmembrane enzyme located primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycerolipids. This enzyme facilitates the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate to form lysophosphatidic acid, a precursor for the synthesis of various lipids essential for energy storage and membrane formation (Liu2024Identifying; Zhu2019CHP1). GPAT4 is expressed in several tissues, including the liver, brown adipose tissue, and testis, and plays a significant role in lipid homeostasis and energy balance (Nagle2008Identification; Takeuchi2009Biochemistry). Its activity is regulated by interactions with calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1), which is necessary for its enzymatic function (Zhu2019CHP1). Alterations in GPAT4 expression or function have been linked to metabolic disorders, highlighting its importance in maintaining lipid balance and its potential as a therapeutic target (Shiozaki2020GPAT4Generated; Cooper2015Glycerol3phosphate).

## Function
GPAT4 (glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 4) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in lipid biosynthesis, specifically in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) and glycerolipids. It catalyzes the initial step in the conversion of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by attaching an acyl group to the sn-1 position of G3P. This reaction is the first and rate-limiting step in TAG synthesis, which is essential for energy storage and membrane lipid production in cells (Liu2024Identifying; Zhu2019CHP1).

GPAT4 is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and accounts for a significant portion of GPAT activity in the liver, contributing to about 50% of the total activity. It is also highly expressed in brown adipose tissue and testis, with moderate expression in the liver, kidney, brain, intestine, and white adipose tissue (Nagle2008Identification; Takeuchi2009Biochemistry).

The enzyme is involved in the synthesis of membrane lipids and triacylglycerols, which are crucial for cell membrane formation and lipid droplet storage. GPAT4's activity is regulated by the protein CHP1, which is necessary for its catalytic function (Zhu2019CHP1). GPAT4-deficient mice exhibit subdermal lipodystrophy and resistance to diet-induced obesity, highlighting its role in fat storage and metabolism (Liu2024Identifying).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the GPAT4 gene have been implicated in various metabolic disorders. GPAT4 is involved in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG), and its deficiency can lead to significant metabolic changes. In mice lacking GPAT4, there is a reduction in TAG content in the liver and brown adipose tissue, which suggests its crucial role in lipid metabolism (Nagle2008Identification). These mice also exhibit increased fatty acid oxidation and higher metabolic rates, which protect them from high-fat diet-induced obesity, indicating that GPAT4 plays a role in energy balance and obesity resistance (Cooper2015Glycerol3phosphate).

GPAT4-generated saturated lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) have been linked to lipotoxicity and vascular calcification. These LPAs inhibit autophagy, leading to abnormal omegasome formation and contributing to vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and calcification (Shiozaki2020GPAT4Generated). The disruption of autophagic processes by GPAT4-generated LPAs suggests a potential role in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases related to autophagy inhibition, such as cardiovascular diseases (Shiozaki2020GPAT4Generated). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GPAT4 in lipid-related disorders and its potential as a therapeutic target.

## Interactions
GPAT4 interacts with calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1), a crucial interaction for glycerolipid synthesis. CHP1 binds to and activates GPAT4, which is essential for the enzyme's catalytic activity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This interaction is mediated by the myristoyl moiety of CHP1, which is necessary for GPAT4's activity, although it does not affect the localization of GPAT4 within the ER (Zhu2019CHP1). The interaction between CHP1 and GPAT4 is specific to ER GPATs and does not occur with mitochondrial GPATs. This specificity was confirmed through mass spectrometric analysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Zhu2019CHP1).

The N terminus of GPAT4, particularly the amino acid region 113-126, is necessary for its interaction with CHP1. This interaction is crucial for the stability of both proteins, as the loss of either reduces the levels of the other, although mRNA levels remain unchanged (Zhu2019CHP1). The interaction between CHP1 and GPAT4 is essential for maintaining GPAT enzyme activity, as the loss of CHP1 reduces GPAT activity to levels observed in GPAT4 and GPAT3 double knockout cells (Zhu2019CHP1).
