# ACRBP

## Overview
The ACRBP gene encodes the acrosin binding protein, which is primarily involved in reproductive biology and is categorized as a binding protein. This protein plays a pivotal role in the acrosome reaction, a critical process in sperm function and fertilization, by regulating proacrosin autoactivation necessary for the dispersal of acrosomal contents. ACRBP is predominantly expressed in the acrosome of spermatozoa, where it facilitates sperm capacitation and binding to the zona pellucida, essential steps for successful fertilization (Kato2021ACRBP; Tardif2012Alteration). Beyond its reproductive functions, ACRBP is also implicated in cancer biology, particularly in ovarian cancer, where its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance. As a cancer-testis antigen, ACRBP is being investigated as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy, given its restricted expression in normal tissues outside of the testis (Lin2021Cancer‐testis; Safavi2018In).

## Function
The ACRBP (acrosin binding protein) gene encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in sperm function and fertility, particularly in the acrosome reaction, which is essential for fertilization. ACRBP is involved in the regulation of proacrosin autoactivation, a process necessary for the dispersal of acrosomal contents during the acrosome reaction. This reaction facilitates the penetration of the sperm through the egg's protective layers, enabling successful fertilization (Tardif2012Alteration).

In healthy human cells, ACRBP is localized to the acrosome of spermatozoa, where it mediates the activation of proacrosin, a serine protease crucial for the acrosome reaction. This protein is synthesized as a precursor and processed into a mature form, which is essential for normal sperm function and fertilization (Tardif2012Alteration). ACRBP is also involved in sperm capacitation and the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida, which are critical steps in fertilization. It is a principal tyrosine-phosphorylated protein during capacitation, and its presence on the sperm head is necessary for effective sperm-zona pellucida binding (Kato2021ACRBP). The protein's role in these processes highlights its importance in reproductive biology and its potential impact on fertility.

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ACRBP gene are clinically significant in several cancers, particularly ovarian cancer. ACRBP is overexpressed in ovarian cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, and this high expression is associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in patients (Lin2021Cancer‐testis). The gene's expression correlates with advanced stages of the disease and chemotherapy resistance, indicating its role in tumor progression and poor prognosis (Lin2021Cancer‐testis). ACRBP's interaction with the nuclear and mitotic apparatus protein NuMA is crucial for maintaining mitotic spindle function, which is essential for cancer cell proliferation. Overexpression of ACRBP can lead to paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer, as it helps normalize mitotic spindle function and counteracts the mitotic pathology driven by NuMA (Whitehurst2010Tumor).

In addition to ovarian cancer, ACRBP is being explored as a target for cancer immunotherapy due to its classification as a cancer-testis antigen, which is typically expressed in various tumors but not in normal tissues except the testis (Safavi2018In). This makes ACRBP a potential target for therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in cancer treatment (Lin2021Cancer‐testis).

## Interactions
The human gene ACRBP (acrosin binding protein) is known to physically and functionally interact with the nuclear and mitotic apparatus protein NuMA. This interaction was identified through nano-HPLC mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous ACRBP complexes and validated by immunoblotting anti-ACRBP immunoprecipitates from PEO4 cells with an anti-NuMA antibody. NuMA is an essential component of the mitotic spindle, and its overexpression in cancers can disrupt centrosome integrity and increase genomic instability. ACRBP expression appears to restrain NuMA protein accumulation, as depletion of ACRBP results in elevated NuMA protein levels. The interaction between ACRBP and NuMA is crucial for maintaining effective NuMA concentrations necessary for robust mitotic progression (Whitehurst2010Tumor).

In the context of sperm function, ACRBP interacts with proacrosin/acrosin and zonadhesin, suggesting their movement from the acrosome to the sperm surface. These interactions are important for the acrosome reaction and sperm binding to the zona pellucida in a porcine model. ACRBP is involved in regulating calcium levels through its interaction with SERCA pumps, which are crucial for the acrosome reaction and sperm binding (Kato2021ACRBP).
