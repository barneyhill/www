# REG3A

## Overview
REG3A, or regenerating islet-derived protein 3-alpha, is a gene that encodes a C-type lectin protein involved in various physiological processes, including antimicrobial defense and tissue regeneration. The protein, also referred to as REG3A, is predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a critical role in maintaining mucosal integrity by segregating microbiota from the host surface and exerting bactericidal effects against Gram-positive bacteria through pore formation in bacterial membranes (Han2019Lipopolysaccharides; Chen2019Four). Beyond its antimicrobial functions, REG3A is implicated in tissue repair and inflammation modulation, particularly in the gut, and has been associated with glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity (Gonzalez2023Antimicrobial). The protein's expression and activity are regulated by various factors, including bacterial colonization and proteolytic processing, highlighting its dynamic role in health and disease (Shin2019Reg3).

## Structure
REG3A, also known as regenerating islet-derived protein 3-alpha, is a C-type lectin with a specific molecular structure that contributes to its function. The primary structure of REG3A consists of a defined amino acid sequence that forms the basis for its higher-order structures. The secondary structure of REG3A typically includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common in lectin proteins. The tertiary structure of REG3A results in a stable, three-dimensional conformation that features a carbohydrate recognition domain, crucial for its lectin activity (Han2019Lipopolysaccharides).

The quaternary structure of REG3A is less well-defined, but it is known to form hexamer complexes, which are related to its bactericidal activity. These hexamers can stack to create a transmembrane channel that is effective against Gram-positive bacteria (Han2019Lipopolysaccharides). Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, may occur and can influence the stability and function of the protein. REG3A's interaction with lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) can inhibit its self-aggregation, highlighting the importance of specific amino acid residues in these interactions (Han2019Lipopolysaccharides). These structural features are integral to REG3A's role in antimicrobial activity and tissue regeneration.

## Function
REG3A, also known as regenerating islet-derived protein 3-alpha, is a C-type lectin primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a crucial role in antimicrobial defense. In healthy human cells, REG3A is involved in maintaining the spatial segregation of microbiota from the host mucosal surface, thereby contributing to the innate immune response. It achieves this by binding to peptidoglycan carbohydrate backbones on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria, forming hexamers that create pores in bacterial membranes, leading to bacterial cell death (Chen2019Four).

REG3A is also implicated in tissue regeneration and repair, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. It is expressed in the small intestine and is upregulated in response to inflammation, suggesting a role in attenuating inflammation and restoring gut microbiota balance (Chen2019Four). The protein's expression is influenced by bacterial colonization and is stable in healthy individuals, with its activity being regulated through trypsin-dependent proteolytic processing (Shin2019Reg3).

In addition to its antimicrobial functions, REG3A may play a role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, as studies in mice have shown its involvement in regulating glucose uptake and reducing oxidative stress in skeletal muscle (Gonzalez2023Antimicrobial).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the REG3A gene have been implicated in various diseases and conditions. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), REG3A mRNA is overexpressed, suggesting a role in mucosal regeneration (Wang2021The). In diabetes, REG3A expression is decreased in the skin of patients and experimental models, indicating its involvement in the disease's pathology (Wang2021The). 

In cancer, REG3A exhibits dual roles. It is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), where it promotes tumorigenic behavior by enhancing cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and activating the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Silencing REG3A in TNBC cells reduces these cancerous behaviors and induces apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target (Jin2024Increased). Conversely, in gastric cancer, REG3A is significantly downregulated, often due to DNA methylation, which silences its expression. This downregulation is a frequent event in gastric adenocarcinomas and may contribute to the disease's development (Choi2007Downregulation).

In pancreatic diseases, REG3A is involved in acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM), a precursor to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It is overexpressed in ADM areas, suggesting a role in early PDAC tumorigenesis (Zhang2021REG3AREG3B).

## Interactions
REG3A interacts with several proteins and nucleic acids, playing significant roles in various biological processes. It binds to the receptor EXTL3 on acinar cells, which is crucial for promoting acinar to ductal metaplasia (ADM) through the activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. This interaction is essential for the induction and maintenance of ADM, a precursor to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (Zhang2021REG3AREG3B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have confirmed the physical interaction between REG3B, a homolog of REG3A, and EXTL3, highlighting the importance of this receptor in mediating REG3A's effects (Zhang2021REG3AREG3B).

In breast cancer cells, REG3A is involved in maintaining the integrity of mTOR complexes, specifically mTORC1 and mTORC2, by promoting their association with Raptor and Rictor, respectively. This interaction is crucial for the activation of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which is linked to cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (Jin2024Increased).

REG3A's transcriptional activation is also influenced by the long non-coding RNA REG1CP, which recruits the FANCJ helicase to the REG3A promoter. This recruitment enhances RNA polymerase II enrichment, promoting REG3A transcription in colorectal cancer cells (Yari2019LncRNA).
