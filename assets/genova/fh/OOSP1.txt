# OOSP1

## Overview
The OOSP1 gene encodes the oocyte secreted protein 1, a secreted glycoprotein that plays a significant role in the female reproductive system. This protein is primarily expressed in oocytes and is characterized by its structural similarity to placental-specific protein 1 (PLAC1), sharing conserved cysteine residues that suggest the formation of disulfide bonds crucial for its three-dimensional conformation (Yan2001Oosp1). The presence of a zona-pellucida-like domain at the N-terminal indicates its potential involvement in molecular interactions within the reproductive system (Abbasi2020CRISPRCas9Mediated). Glycosylation is a key post-translational modification of OOSP1, influencing its stability and function (Yan2001Oosp1). The gene is part of an ovary-specific genomic cluster, underscoring its specialized role in reproductive biology (Abbasi2020CRISPRCas9Mediated).

## Structure
The OOSP1 protein is a secreted glycoprotein encoded by the OOSP1 gene. Its primary structure consists of 202 amino acids, including a 21-amino acid signal peptide sequence that directs the protein for secretion (Yan2001Oosp1). The protein contains five putative N-linked glycosylation consensus sequences, indicating that glycosylation is a significant post-translational modification that likely influences its function and stability (Yan2001Oosp1). 

The tertiary structure of OOSP1 is suggested to be similar to that of placental-specific protein 1 (PLAC1), as four of the six cysteines in both proteins are conserved, which implies the formation of three disulfide bonds that contribute to the protein's 3D folding (Yan2001Oosp1). The presence of a zona-pellucida-like domain at the N-terminal is noted, which may play a role in its interaction with other molecules within the reproductive system (Abbasi2020CRISPRCas9Mediated). 

The OOSP1 gene is part of an ovary-specific genomic cluster, and its expression is enriched in the female reproductive system, particularly in oocytes (Abbasi2020CRISPRCas9Mediated). The protein's structure and modifications are crucial for its role in reproductive processes.
