# OR2T6

## Overview
The OR2T6 gene encodes the protein olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily T member 6, which is part of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. These receptors are typically involved in the detection of odor molecules, playing a crucial role in the sense of smell. However, OR2T6 has been implicated in various non-olfactory functions, particularly in the context of cancer biology. The protein encoded by OR2T6 is involved in cellular signaling pathways that influence cell proliferation, migration, and survival, notably through the MAPK/ERK pathway. This receptor's expression and activity have been linked to the progression of certain cancers, including breast cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Li2019The; Tong2021Ectopic).

## Clinical Significance
The OR2T6 gene has been implicated in breast cancer progression. It is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared to normal tissues and is associated with higher TNM staging, positive lymph node metastasis, and poorer overall and disease-free survival rates in patients (Li2019The). OR2T6 enhances the proliferation, invasion, and migration of breast cancer cells while inhibiting apoptosis, primarily through the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway and the promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Li2019The; Tong2021Ectopic). 

In addition to its role in breast cancer, OR2T6 has been identified with a recurrent synonymous mutation in melanoma, although the clinical significance of this mutation remains unclear (Gartner2013Wholegenome). The gene has also been associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) in a multiethnic population, where low-frequency variants of OR2T6 appeared at higher frequencies in controls, suggesting a potential protective effect (Leslie2017Association). 

Epigenetic changes in OR2T6, such as hypomethylation at the promoter site, have been observed in breast cancer, indicating a potential link between its methylation status and cancer development (Fessahaye2021Breast).
