# IDO2

## Overview
Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO2) is a gene located on chromosome 8 in humans, encoding the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2. This enzyme is a member of the dioxygenase family and plays a crucial role in the catabolism of tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway, which is significant for immune regulation and homeostasis (Fatokun2013Indoleamine; Dolšak2021Indoleamine). IDO2 is structurally similar to its counterpart IDO1, sharing 43% sequence identity, yet it exhibits distinct functional characteristics, such as constitutive expression in dendritic cells and independence from inflammatory stimuli (Trabanelli2014The; Yeung2015Role). The enzyme is involved in various physiological processes, including the generation of regulatory T cells and modulation of immune responses, and is implicated in several pathological conditions, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases (Mondanelli2021Current; Trabanelli2014The). IDO2's interactions and regulatory mechanisms suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in immune-related disorders and oncology (Suvieri2023Membrane; Li2021The).

## Structure
IDO2, or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2, is a protein encoded by the IDO2 gene, which is located on chromosome 8 in humans. The protein consists of 420 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 47 kDa (Fatokun2013Indoleamine; Dolšak2021Indoleamine). IDO2 shares 43% sequence identity with IDO1, indicating a significant degree of structural similarity (Yeung2015Role).

The primary structure of IDO2 includes specific amino acid substitutions compared to IDO1, such as His130, Leu133, Ile168, and Thr171, which result in a 15% increase in the volume of the A pocket. These substitutions affect interactions within the protein, such as the loss of π-π stacking due to the replacement of Phe164 with Ile133 (Dolšak2021Indoleamine).

The secondary structure of IDO2 likely includes alpha-helices and beta-sheets, typical of dioxygenase enzymes, although specific details are not provided in the available literature. The tertiary structure, which would describe the 3D folding of the protein, remains uncharacterized due to the absence of a crystal structure for IDO2 (Dolšak2021Indoleamine).

IDO2 is expressed in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, brain, and epididymis, and is involved in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism (Pallotta2021Indoleamine; Dolšak2021Indoleamine). The protein's function and activity may be influenced by post-translational modifications and splice variants, although specific modifications are not detailed in the current literature.

## Function
IDO2 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2) is an enzyme involved in the catabolism of tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway, which plays a significant role in immune regulation. Unlike its counterpart IDO1, IDO2 is constitutively expressed in human dendritic cells (DCs) and is not influenced by inflammatory stimuli, suggesting a stable role in maintaining immune tolerance (Trabanelli2014The). IDO2 contributes to the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are crucial for immune homeostasis and tolerance, by supporting the homeostatic generation of these cells in a SOCS3-independent manner (Trabanelli2014The).

IDO2 is expressed in both myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and its expression is not dependent on the inflammatory mediator PGE2, unlike IDO1 (Trabanelli2014The). This constitutive expression allows IDO2 to provide a stable mechanism of immune privilege, enabling dendritic cells to generate Tregs and maintain tolerance without being influenced by the inflammatory environment (Trabanelli2014The). The enzyme's activity in the kynurenine pathway involves the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine, a process that can modulate immune responses by affecting T-cell function (Fatokun2013Indoleamine).

## Clinical Significance
IDO2 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2) has been implicated in various diseases due to mutations, altered expression levels, and changes in its interactions. In cancer, IDO2 expression is upregulated in several types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where it is associated with poor prognosis and increased cancer risk (Mondanelli2021Current; Suvieri2023Membrane). Genetic variations, such as the R248W and Y359STOP polymorphisms, significantly reduce or abolish IDO2's enzymatic activity, impacting its role in cancer pathogenesis (Metz2007Novel; Witkiewicz2009Genotyping). These SNPs are linked to increased NSCLC risk and influence treatment outcomes in PDAC (Mondanelli2021Current).

In autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, IDO2 plays a role in immune modulation. It is crucial for the induction of T regulatory cells and influences inflammatory responses, with its deficiency affecting disease severity in conditions like autoimmune arthritis and psoriasis (Mondanelli2021Current). In the context of aspergillosis, IDO2 SNPs are associated with the condition in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, suggesting a role in immune response regulation (Napolioni2019Genetic). These findings highlight IDO2's potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in cancer and immune-related diseases.

## Interactions
IDO2 (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 2) is involved in various interactions that suggest its role extends beyond tryptophan metabolism. It is known to localize at the membrane in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells, where it may function as a signaling molecule. This is supported by its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues, indicating potential interactions with kinases and involvement in signaling pathways (Suvieri2023Membrane). IDO2 possesses two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs), which are similar to those found in IDO1, suggesting possible interactions with immune signaling components, although it lacks the YENM motif that facilitates binding to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (Suvieri2023Membrane).

IDO2's role in immune modulation is further highlighted by its involvement in cytokine signaling and its association with PD-L1 expression, which is linked to immune evasion in tumors (Li2021The). The enzyme's expression is also influenced by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), indicating a regulatory interaction that may affect immune responses and cancer progression (Li2021The). These interactions suggest that IDO2 may participate in complex signaling networks that influence both immune responses and tumor development.
