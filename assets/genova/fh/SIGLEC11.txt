# SIGLEC11

## Overview
SIGLEC11 is a gene that encodes the protein sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 11, a member of the Siglec family, which is characterized by its ability to bind sialic acid-containing ligands. This protein is primarily expressed on microglial cells in the human brain and plays a significant role in modulating immune responses and maintaining neural tissue homeostasis. As a receptor, Siglec-11 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) that is involved in inhibitory signaling pathways, contributing to the regulation of inflammation and neuroprotection. The protein's interaction with polysialic acid (polySia) is particularly noteworthy, as it influences brain functions and immune responses, including interactions with pathogenic bacteria and amyloid plaques in neurodegenerative diseases (Schwarz2017Paired; Hane2020Humanspecific; Lin2021Functions).

## Structure
Siglec-11 is a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) family, characterized by its ability to recognize sialic acid-containing ligands. The primary structure of Siglec-11 includes immunoglobulin-like domains, which are typical of the Siglec family (Movsisyan2020Structural). The secondary structure involves beta sheets, which form part of the V-set domain responsible for sialic acid recognition (Movsisyan2020Structural). 

In terms of tertiary structure, Siglec-11's folding is crucial for its ligand-binding capabilities, although specific details on the tertiary structure are not fully elucidated in the available literature. The quaternary structure may involve dimerization, a common feature in the Siglec family, but specific details for Siglec-11 are not provided.

Post-translational modifications of Siglec-11 include glycosylation, which is essential for its stability and function. Specific N-glycosylation sites are crucial for the stability of Siglec-11, and it is prone to aggregation independent of disulfide bond formation (Hane2020Humanspecific). The human-specific microglial form of Siglec-11, known as hSiglec-11(4D), is an alternate splice variant that lacks the exon encoding the last C2-set domain of the extracellular portion, enhancing its binding to polysialic acid (Hane2020Humanspecific).

## Function
Siglec-11 is a sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin primarily expressed on microglia in the human brain. It plays a crucial role in modulating inflammatory responses and maintaining neural tissue homeostasis. Siglec-11 interacts with sialic acid-containing ligands on neuronal cells, which helps suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduce microglial phagocytosis of apoptotic neuronal material, thereby providing neuroprotection and preventing neurotoxicity (Schwarz2014Human-Specific; Macauley2014Siglec-mediated; Lin2021Functions).

The protein contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), which is involved in inhibitory signaling pathways. This motif recruits tyrosine phosphatases such as SHP-1 and SHP-2, leading to the suppression of activating signal transduction and contributing to the regulation of inflammation (Cao2008SIGLEC16; Lin2021Functions). Siglec-11's interaction with polysialic acid (polySia) is particularly significant, as it binds more effectively to polySia than other forms, influencing polysialic acid-mediated brain functions (Hane2020Humanspecific).

In healthy human cells, Siglec-11's role in immune regulation is essential for preventing excessive inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis, which is vital for brain health and function (Schwarz2017Paired; Lin2021Functions).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression or function of the SIGLEC11 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions, particularly those affecting the brain. SIGLEC11 is primarily expressed in microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, and plays a role in modulating immune responses and inflammation. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, SIGLEC11's interaction with amyloid plaques may contribute to the evasion of immune clearance, potentially exacerbating plaque accumulation and disease progression (Lin2021Functions). 

The gene's expression is also relevant in cancer, where SIGLEC11 mRNA is downregulated in most cancer types, except for glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, sarcoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma (Chen2020Tumor). In lung adenocarcinoma, decreased SIGLEC11 expression is associated with poor overall survival, suggesting its potential role as a prognostic marker (Zhang2021Integrative). 

Additionally, SIGLEC11 has been linked to immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment, which may influence cancer progression and immune evasion (Chen2020Tumor). The gene's evolutionary history, involving gene conversion events with SIGLEC16, suggests a complex role in brain immunity and potential implications in mental disorders like schizophrenia (Hayakawa2017Coevolution).

## Interactions
SIGLEC11, a member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins family, is involved in various interactions that modulate immune responses. It is primarily expressed on microglial cells in the brain and interacts with polysialic acid (polySia) on neuronal cells, which may influence neuroprotective functions and reduce microglial neurotoxicity (Hane2020Humanspecific; Lin2021Functions). This interaction is significant in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, where SIGLEC11's binding to gangliosides on neurons may affect the clearance of amyloid plaques (Lin2021Functions).

SIGLEC11 also interacts with the polysialic acid capsule of pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli K1, which uses this interaction to evade immune responses by engaging SIGLEC11 on microglia, leading to increased bacterial survival (Schwarz2017Paired). This interaction is specific to the capsulated form of E. coli K1, as demonstrated by experiments showing that the acapsular mutant does not bind effectively to SIGLEC11 (Schwarz2017Paired).

The receptor is also involved in immune regulation through its interactions with paired receptors such as SIGLEC16, which can modulate inflammatory responses in the presence of pathogens (Schwarz2017Paired).
