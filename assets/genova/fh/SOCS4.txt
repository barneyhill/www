# SOCS4

## Overview
SOCS4 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 4) is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the suppressor of cytokine signaling family, which is integral to the negative regulation of cytokine signaling pathways. The SOCS4 protein is characterized by a central SH2 domain and a conserved C-terminal SOCS box, which are essential for its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase in targeting proteins for ubiquitination and degradation (Feng2011The). This protein is primarily involved in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, particularly in relation to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), where it mediates a negative feedback mechanism by associating with phosphorylated tyrosine residues (Kazi2014SOCS). SOCS4 is active in the cytoplasm and interacts with various signaling molecules, playing a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation (Kazi2014SOCS). Its involvement in immune response regulation, particularly during influenza infection, highlights its significance in modulating T cell activation and trafficking (Kedzierski2014Suppressor). Despite its established roles, the full spectrum of SOCS4's functions in healthy human cells and its broader implications in cell biology remain subjects of ongoing research (Kazi2014SOCS).

## Structure
The SOCS4 protein is part of the suppressor of cytokine signaling family, characterized by a central SH2 domain and a conserved C-terminal SOCS box, which are crucial for its function in cytokine signaling regulation (Feng2011The). The N-terminal domain of SOCS4 is largely disordered, with a specific region (residues 86-155) that is more ordered and conserved across species (Feng2011The). This region is predicted to adopt a helical structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol, as indicated by circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies (Feng2011The).

The N-terminal domains of SOCS4 contain numerous eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs), which are potential functional binding sites and may play a role in protein interactions and ubiquitination processes (Feng2011The). These motifs are mostly located in the disordered N-terminal domain and can be affected by single point mutations (Feng2011The). The SOCS4 protein is involved in forming an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting proteins for ubiquitination and degradation (Feng2011The). The presence of these motifs and the structural characteristics of the N-terminal domain suggest a role in mediating interactions with other proteins, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and interleukin-4 receptor (Feng2011The).

## Function
SOCS4 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 4) is a member of the SOCS family, which plays a critical role in the negative regulation of cytokine signaling pathways. SOCS4 is primarily involved in the regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, particularly in relation to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). It functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, suggesting its role in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of EGFR, although direct evidence for this mechanism is still lacking (Kazi2014SOCS). SOCS4 associates with EGFR through the phosphotyrosine residue pY1092 and regulates its degradation, indicating a negative feedback mechanism in receptor signaling (Kazi2014SOCS).

In cellular processes, SOCS4 is involved in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation by modulating signaling pathways. It is primarily active in the cytoplasm, where it interacts with various signaling molecules to exert its regulatory functions. Despite its significant role in EGFR signaling, the specific function of SOCS4 in healthy human cells remains less well-defined, and its broader implications in cell biology and organismal outcomes are still under investigation (Kazi2014SOCS).

## Clinical Significance


## Interactions
SOCS4, or Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 4, is involved in various protein interactions that play a role in cytokine signaling regulation. SOCS4 interacts with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on signaling intermediates, such as receptor subunits and Janus kinases (JAKs), through its SH2 domain, inhibiting cytokine signaling pathways (Feng2011The). The SOCS box domain of SOCS4 facilitates the formation of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting proteins for degradation (Feng2011The).

In the context of ovarian follicle activation, SOCS4 interacts with proteins such as Cardiotrophin-like Cytokine (CLC), Poly (rC) Binding Protein 1 (PCBP1), and Cytosolic Malate Dehydrogenase (MDH1), which are involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Sutherland2011Suppressor). These interactions suggest that SOCS4 may mediate the activation of the JAK1/STAT3 pathway by influencing these proteins (Sutherland2011Suppressor).

SOCS4 also plays a role in immune response regulation during influenza infection. It is involved in the modulation of T cell activation and trafficking, affecting the activation and signaling of T cell receptors (TCRs) (Kedzierski2014Suppressor). This interaction is crucial for managing the inflammatory response and enhancing viral clearance during infection (Kedzierski2014Suppressor).
