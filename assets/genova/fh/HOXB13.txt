# HOXB13

## Overview
The HOXB13 gene encodes the homeobox B13 protein, a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression during cellular differentiation and development, particularly within the prostate. As a member of the homeobox gene family, the HOXB13 protein is characterized by a homeobox domain, which facilitates its DNA-binding capability and transcriptional regulatory functions. This protein is integral to maintaining normal cellular differentiation and preventing uncontrolled cell growth, acting as a repressor of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cells. Mutations in the HOXB13 gene, such as the G84E variant, have been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer and other malignancies, underscoring its clinical significance. The gene's expression and interactions with various cofactors are crucial for its role in both normal physiological processes and disease states, highlighting its importance in cancer research and potential therapeutic interventions (Cross2007Functional; Jung2004HOXB13; Stott‐Miller2012HOXB13).

## Structure
The HOXB13 protein is a transcription factor encoded by the HOXB13 gene, consisting of 284 amino acids. It features a homeobox domain, a 60-amino acid region responsible for DNA binding and transcription regulation, located between amino acids 216 and 275 (Chandrasekaran2017Computational). The homeobox domain is characterized by a helix-turn-helix motif, which is typical for proteins in the homeobox gene family.

The complete 3D structure of HOXB13 is not available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), but computational modeling has been used to predict its structure. The model 'hoxb13.B99990026.pdb' was generated using MODELLER v9.17 and validated with a Ramachandran Plot, showing 88.7% of residues in favored regions, indicating a reliable structure (Chandrasekaran2017Computational). PDBsum analysis identified three alpha helices, three helix-helix interactions, 18 beta, and 40 gamma turns, aligning with the homeobox domain characteristics (Chandrasekaran2017Computational).

Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, have been suggested to play a role in modulating the activity, stability, and interactions of HOX proteins, including HOXB13, although specific modifications for HOXB13 are not detailed (Draime2018Posttranslational). The presence of splice variant isoforms that could affect the function and localization of HOXB13 is also noted, though specific variants are not described in the provided context.

## Function
The HOXB13 gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a significant role in the regulation of gene expression during cell differentiation and development, particularly in the prostate. In healthy human cells, HOXB13 is involved in maintaining normal cellular differentiation and preventing uncontrolled cell growth. It functions as a regulator of terminal cellular differentiation in adult tissues that normally express it, such as the prostate and distal colon (Cross2007Functional).

HOXB13 interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) to modulate AR signaling, acting as a repressor of hormone-activated AR activity. This interaction is crucial for regulating the growth of prostate cells, as HOXB13 suppresses the growth of prostate cancer cells by downregulating androgen-stimulated expression of prostate-specific antigen (Jung2004HOXB13). The gene's expression is androgen-independent, and it is active in the nucleus, where it influences cell proliferation and differentiation (Edwards2004Expression).

In the context of prostate development, HOXB13 is essential for the differentiation and secretory function of the ventral prostate, ensuring the proper identity and function of prostate tissue (Economides2003Hoxb13is). Its role in these processes highlights its importance in maintaining normal prostate function and preventing neoplastic transformations.

## Clinical Significance
Mutations in the HOXB13 gene are significantly associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, particularly the G84E mutation. This mutation is prevalent in individuals of European descent and is linked to early-onset and familial prostate cancer. Carriers of the G84E mutation have a higher likelihood of developing prostate cancer, with studies indicating a 3.3 to 4.5-fold increased risk compared to non-carriers (BeebeDimmer2015The; Stott‐Miller2012HOXB13). The mutation is also associated with other malignancies, including bladder cancer and leukemia (BeebeDimmer2015The).

In colorectal cancer, HOXB13 is often down-regulated, which inhibits β-catenin/TCF mediated signaling. The G84E mutation is also observed in colorectal cancer patients, suggesting a broader role in cancer predisposition (Botti2019Paralogous; Akbari2013Germline). In breast cancer, HOXB13 overexpression is linked to tamoxifen resistance in estrogen receptor-positive patients, and the HOXB13/IL17BR ratio serves as a predictive marker for treatment response (Botti2019Paralogous).

HOXB13 expression is altered in various other cancers, including uro-genital, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinoma, where it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Botti2019Paralogous). The gene's interaction with cofactors like MEIS is crucial, and mutations affecting these interactions may alter cancer risk (Li2019The).

## Interactions
HOXB13 is a transcription factor that engages in various protein interactions, playing a significant role in prostate cancer. It interacts with histone deacetylase HDAC3 through its MEIS domain, a crucial interaction for suppressing lipogenesis in prostate cancer cells. This interaction is disrupted by the G84E mutation in HOXB13, leading to increased expression of lipogenic regulators (Lu2022HOXB13). HOXB13 also interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, particularly with SMARCD2, which enhances chromatin accessibility and is significant in both androgen receptor (AR)-positive and AR-negative prostate cancer cells (Lingadahalli2023HOXB13).

In AR-positive cells, HOXB13 colocalizes with AR binding regions and interacts with AR cofactors like FOXA1 and NKX3-1. In AR-negative cells, it interacts with AP-1 transcription factors such as JUN/FOS (Lingadahalli2023HOXB13). HOXB13 also forms a complex with MEIS1, a TALE family homeodomain transcription factor, which stabilizes HOXB13 and contributes to its role in cellular proliferation (Johng2018HOXB13). These interactions highlight HOXB13's multifaceted role in gene regulation and prostate cancer progression.
