# ZFAND5

## Overview
ZFAND5 is a gene that encodes the zinc finger AN1-type containing 5 protein, which plays a pivotal role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a key pathway for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. The protein is characterized by its two zinc finger domains, AN1 and A20, which are essential for its function as an activator of the 26S proteasome. The AN1 domain enhances proteasomal peptidase activity, while the A20 domain binds ubiquitin chains, facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). ZFAND5 is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by promoting the breakdown of long-lived and potentially damaged proteins, thus preventing cellular stress (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). Its activity is particularly significant in tissues with high protein turnover, such as the heart and brain (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). Additionally, ZFAND5 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including cancer and congenital heart defects, highlighting its importance in both normal cellular function and disease states (Liu2022ZFAND5; Manshaei2020Genes).

## Structure
The ZFAND5 protein, also known as zinc finger AN1-type containing 5, is characterized by its two zinc finger domains: the N-terminal A20 domain and the C-terminal AN1 domain. The A20 domain is essential for binding ubiquitin chains, which is crucial for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). The AN1 domain is vital for stimulating proteasomal peptidase activity, although it cannot independently activate or bind to proteasomes (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). Mutations in the AN1 domain, such as C170A and C175A, impair the protein's ability to activate peptide hydrolysis, highlighting the importance of this domain in ZFAND5's function (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216).

The full-length ZFAND5 protein is necessary for its interaction with the 26S proteasome complex and for stimulating proteolysis, indicating that the complete structure is required for its activity (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). ZFAND5 induces conformational changes in the 26S proteasome, as evidenced by changes in electrophoretic mobility, although the exact binding site and sequence of these changes remain to be determined (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). The protein does not have deubiquitinase activity, and there are conflicting reports regarding its ubiquitin ligase activity (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216).

## Function
The ZFAND5 gene encodes a protein that functions as an activator of the 26S proteasome, a crucial component in the ubiquitin-proteasome system responsible for protein degradation in cells. ZFAND5 enhances the breakdown of ubiquitinated proteins by binding to both ubiquitin conjugates and the 26S proteasome, facilitating the degradation process (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). This protein is involved in maintaining protein homeostasis by stimulating proteasomal activity, which is essential for the regulation of protein turnover and cellular protein quality control (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216).

ZFAND5 contains two zinc finger domains, AN1 and A20, which are critical for its function. The AN1 domain is necessary for enhancing peptidase activity, while the A20 domain is required for binding to ubiquitin chains and stimulating the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). In healthy human cells, ZFAND5 promotes the breakdown of long-lived cellular proteins, thereby preventing the accumulation of misfolded or damaged proteins and reducing potential cellular stress (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). This activity is particularly important in tissues with high protein turnover rates, such as the heart and brain (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216).

## Clinical Significance
Alterations in the expression of the ZFAND5 gene have been implicated in several diseases and conditions. In perihilar cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA), high expression of ZFAND5 is associated with a poor prognosis, as it correlates with lower overall survival rates. This makes ZFAND5 an independent unfavorable prognostic biomarker for pCCA, with high expression linked to a 4.33-fold increased risk of pCCA-related death (Liu2022ZFAND5).

In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ZFAND5 is part of a regulatory network involving the LINC01093/miR-96-5p/ZFAND5/NF-κB signaling axis. Alterations in this network are significant in HCC pathogenesis, suggesting potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications (Zheng2019Integrated).

ZFAND5 has also been identified as a candidate gene in the genetic analysis of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a congenital heart defect. Ultra-rare variants in ZFAND5 are significantly enriched in individuals with TOF, indicating its potential role in the etiology of this condition (Manshaei2020Genes).

In oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), mutations in ZFAND5 are associated with a worse prognosis, particularly in advanced stages of the disease (Kuk2022Prognostic).

## Interactions
ZFAND5, also known as zinc finger AN1-type containing 5, is involved in several protein interactions that play a crucial role in protein degradation pathways. It acts as an activator of the 26S proteasome, enhancing its enzymatic activities by binding to ubiquitin conjugates and the proteasome itself. This interaction is essential for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and cellular proteins (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). ZFAND5 contains two zinc finger domains, AN1 and A20, which are critical for its function. The AN1 domain is necessary for stimulating peptidase activity, while the A20 domain binds ubiquitin chains, facilitating the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216).

ZFAND5 also interacts with the UBL domain of RAD23b, a shuttling factor, even in the absence of proteasomes, indicating its role in protein transport within the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Lee2018ZFAND5ZNF216). In the context of hepatocellular carcinoma, ZFAND5 is identified as a target of miR-96-5p, with its expression levels influencing patient prognosis. The protein is involved in pathways such as the NF-κB signaling pathway, highlighting its broader role in cellular signaling and stress responses (Zheng2019Integrated).
