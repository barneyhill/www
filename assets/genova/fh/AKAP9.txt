# AKAP9

## Overview
AKAP9, or A-kinase anchoring protein 9, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional scaffolding protein involved in various cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cellular signaling pathways. The protein encoded by AKAP9 is categorized as a scaffolding protein due to its role in organizing and anchoring other proteins, thereby facilitating complex cellular interactions and processes. AKAP9 is crucial for the proper organization and polymerization of microtubules, which are essential for maintaining cell structure and function. It also plays a significant role in enhancing endothelial barrier properties and is involved in the regulation of cellular adhesion and signaling pathways. The protein's interactions with other cellular components, such as centrosomal and Golgi apparatus proteins, underscore its importance in cellular organization and function. Mutations in the AKAP9 gene have been linked to various diseases, including cancer, cardiac conditions, and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Sehrawat2011AKAP9; Hu2016AKAP9; Jo2016Frameshift).

## Function
AKAP9 (A-kinase anchoring protein 9) is a crucial scaffolding protein involved in regulating microtubule dynamics and enhancing endothelial barrier properties. In healthy human cells, AKAP9 organizes microtubules into a radial network, facilitating proper microtubule polymerization and growth. It is essential for the binding of the plus-end-binding protein EB1 to growing microtubule ends, influencing microtubule growth rate and length (Sehrawat2011AKAP9). AKAP9 is also involved in microtubule nucleation at the cis-Golgi and may be required for anchoring and releasing microtubules from the centrosome (Sehrawat2011AKAP9).

AKAP9 plays a significant role in the Epac-mediated enhancement of endothelial barrier properties. It forms a complex with Epac1, promoting microtubule polymerization and is necessary for the increase in transendothelial electrical resistance in response to Epac activation by cAMP analogs (Sehrawat2011AKAP9). AKAP9 is primarily active in blood vessels and the epidermal layer of normal skin, indicating its tissue-specific roles (Sehrawat2011AKAP9).

Despite its involvement in microtubule dynamics, AKAP9 is not required for the localization of certain junctional proteins or for VE-cadherin homophilic adhesion, but it is necessary for de novo integrin-mediated adhesion, crucial for endothelial barrier properties (Sehrawat2011AKAP9).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and altered expression of the AKAP9 gene have been implicated in several diseases. In cancer, frameshift mutations in AKAP9 are associated with gastric and colorectal cancers, particularly those with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). These mutations are found in 11.7% of gastric cancers and 17.7% of colorectal cancers with MSI-H, but not in microsatellite stable or low MSI cancers (Jo2016Frameshift). AKAP9 is also linked to breast cancer risk, with specific polymorphisms such as M463I and N2792S associated with increased risk, particularly in familial cases (Frank2008Association).

In cardiac conditions, AKAP9 mutations are associated with Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), specifically type 11. These mutations affect the interaction between AKAP9 and the cardiac IKs channel, leading to prolonged QT intervals and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias (Huynh2022AKAP9Related). The gene is also linked to Alzheimer's disease in African Americans, where rare variants increase the risk by affecting tau phosphorylation, a key process in the disease's pathogenesis (Ikezu2018Tau). These findings highlight the diverse clinical significance of AKAP9 mutations across different diseases.

## Interactions
AKAP9, also known as A-kinase anchoring protein 9, is involved in various protein interactions that facilitate its role as a scaffolding protein. AKAP9 interacts with cdc42 interacting protein 4 (CIP4) at the Golgi apparatus, a significant interaction in the context of colorectal cancer development, as it is involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) crucial for cancer metastasis (Hu2016AKAP9). AKAP9 also forms a complex with AKAP6, tethering the Golgi apparatus to the nuclear envelope, which is essential for microtubule nucleation and organization (Vergarajauregui2020AKAP6).

AKAP9, through its isoform AKAP350, interacts with DNA-binding proteins such as nuclear factor 1 B (NFIB) and nucleolin (NCL). These interactions are mediated by DNA, as they are diminished in the presence of DNase-I, suggesting a potential association with nucleic acids (Dai2024CryoEM). AKAP350 also interacts with centrosomal proteins like CEP170 and CDK5RAP2, which are involved in microtubule nucleation and dynamics (Dai2024CryoEM). These interactions highlight AKAP9's role in organizing cellular structures and signaling pathways, contributing to its function in cellular processes such as cancer progression and microtubule organization.
