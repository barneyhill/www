# HDC

## Overview
The HDC gene encodes the enzyme histidine decarboxylase, which is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent L-amino acid decarboxylase. This enzyme is crucial for the biosynthesis of histamine from histidine, a process that plays a significant role in various physiological functions, including immune response, gastric acid secretion, and neurotransmission. Histidine decarboxylase is predominantly active in the cytoplasm of mast cells, basophils, and neurons, where it facilitates the production of histamine, a biogenic amine involved in numerous biological processes (Rodríguez‐Caso2003Local; MoyaGarcia2004Mammalian). The HDC gene's expression and the enzyme's activity are subject to complex regulatory mechanisms, which are influenced by factors such as gastrin and oxidative stress (MoyaGarcia2004Mammalian). Alterations in the HDC gene have been linked to various clinical conditions, including Tourette Syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, underscoring its importance in both physiological and pathological contexts (Wright2017Altered; Fernandez2012Rare).

## Structure
The human histidine decarboxylase (HDC) enzyme is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent L-amino acid decarboxylase. The primary structure of HDC consists of a polypeptide chain that undergoes post-translational processing to form a mature subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 53-55 kDa (ENGEL1996Experimental). The enzyme contains a PLP-binding site, specifically involving the residue Lys-308, which is crucial for its catalytic activity (ENGEL1996Experimental). 

The secondary structure of HDC includes regions that form alpha helices and beta sheets, typical of PLP-dependent enzymes, although specific details are not fully elucidated in the context provided. The tertiary structure involves the three-dimensional folding necessary for its enzymatic function, with the PLP-binding domain playing a central role (FLEMING2004Mapping).

HDC's quaternary structure may involve dimerization, as suggested by its classification among group II decarboxylases, which often form dimers (FLEMING2004Mapping). The enzyme also contains PEST regions, which are involved in protein degradation, indicating a regulatory mechanism for its stability and turnover (ENGEL1996Experimental). Splice variants of HDC result in different isoforms, although the specific functional implications of these variants are not detailed in the context provided (MoyaGarcia2004Mammalian).

## Function
Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of histidine to histamine, a biogenic amine involved in various physiological processes. In healthy human cells, HDC is primarily active in the cytoplasm, particularly in mast cells, basophils, and neurons (MoyaGarcia2004Mammalian). Histamine, the product of HDC activity, plays a crucial role in immune responses, gastric acid secretion, neurotransmission, and cell proliferation (Rodríguez‐Caso2003Local; MoyaGarcia2004Mammalian).

HDC is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme and is part of the evolutionary group II of L-amino acid decarboxylases. Its catalytic mechanism involves several steps, including the formation of a Schiff base and decarboxylation (Rodríguez‐Caso2003Local). The enzyme's activity is regulated through complex mechanisms, including transcriptional and translational control, and is influenced by factors such as gastrin and oxidative stress (MoyaGarcia2004Mammalian).

In the context of gastric physiology, HDC is essential for normal gastric acid secretion, as it produces histamine, which acts on H2 receptors to stimulate acid production (Samuelson2003Insights). The enzyme's role in histamine production is also significant in the regulation of lymphatic vessel function, particularly in response to flow conditions (Nizamutdinova2014Involvement).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations and alterations in the expression of the HDC gene, which encodes the enzyme histidine decarboxylase, have been implicated in several clinical conditions. In Tourette Syndrome (TS), rare copy number variants (CNVs) that disrupt the HDC gene have been identified, suggesting a role in the disorder's etiology. The histaminergic pathways, in which HDC is involved, are thought to contribute to the genesis or modulation of tics in TS (Fernandez2012Rare). A specific nonsense mutation, W317X, in the HDC gene was found in a multigenerational family with TS, indicating a potential genetic link, although this association was not confirmed in all populations (Pagliaroli2016From).

In autism spectrum disorder (ASD), altered expression of the HDC gene has been observed, with potential implications for neuroinflammation and shared pathogenesis with TS (Wright2017Altered). HDC knockout mice, used as a model for TS, exhibit tic-like behaviors and white matter abnormalities, further supporting the gene's clinical significance in neuropsychiatric disorders (Jindachomthong2022White).

Beyond neurological conditions, polymorphic variants of the HDC gene have been associated with allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, chronic heart failure, and breast cancer, highlighting its broader clinical impact (Kucher2019Association).
