# FAM117A

## Overview
FAM117A is a gene that encodes a protein belonging to the family with sequence similarity 117 member A. This protein is characterized by its interaction with the protein kinase DYRK1A, suggesting a role in various cellular processes, including mRNA processing, transcription, and DNA damage response (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). The FAM117A protein shares high sequence similarity with GLCCI1, indicating potential functional roles in cellular regulation (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights). Clinically, FAM117A has been implicated in cancer biology, where it may function as a tumor suppressor, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma, and is associated with neurological processes due to its interaction with DYRK1A (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights; ananthapadmanabhan2015understanding). Further research is necessary to fully elucidate the biological and clinical roles of FAM117A.

## Clinical Significance
FAM117A has been implicated in various diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. In human cancer cell lines, FAM117A has been shown to suppress cell proliferation. Low levels of FAM117A expression are associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights). The gene's interaction with the kinase DYRK1A indicates that FAM117A may act as a downstream effector or regulator of DYRK1A function, which is significant given DYRK1A's involvement in neural proliferation and differentiation (ananthapadmanabhan2015understanding).

While the clinical significance of FAM117A mutations in specific diseases is not extensively detailed, its expression and interaction with DYRK1A suggest potential implications in neurological disorders. The gene's role in cancer and its association with DYRK1A warrant further investigation in animal models to better understand its impact on neurological development and cancer (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights). Despite its potential importance, the current literature does not provide specific examples of diseases directly caused by mutations in FAM117A, indicating a need for more research to elucidate its clinical significance fully.

## Interactions
FAM117A is known to interact with the protein kinase DYRK1A. This interaction was identified through a proteomic approach in T98G cells, where FAM117A was consistently detected in all biological replicates of DYRK1A immunoprecipitates. The association between FAM117A and DYRK1A was confirmed using reciprocal pull-down assays, indicating a strong and specific interaction (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization). 

While the specific interactions of FAM117A with other proteins or nucleic acids are not detailed, the interaction with DYRK1A suggests that FAM117A may play a role in the complex DYRK1A protein-protein interaction network. This network involves factors in mRNA processing, transcription, and DNA damage response, although the precise role of FAM117A within these processes remains to be elucidated (ananthapadmanabhan2020characterization).

The FAM117 family, which includes FAM117A, shares high sequence similarity with GLCCI1, a glucocorticoid-induced protein. This similarity suggests potential functional roles in cellular processes, although specific interactions of FAM117A beyond its association with DYRK1A have not been extensively characterized (Ananthapadmanabhan2023Insights). Further research is needed to fully understand the interactions and functions of FAM117A in various biological contexts.
