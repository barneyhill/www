# ABHD4

## Overview
ABHD4 is a gene that encodes the protein abhydrolase domain containing 4, which functions as an N-acyl phospholipase B. This protein is a member of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, characterized by a conserved structural fold that facilitates its enzymatic activity in lipid metabolism (Lord2013Mammalian; Bononi2021α/β-Hydrolase). ABHD4 plays a crucial role in the hydrolysis of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) and lyso-NAPEs, which are important for the biosynthesis of lipid mediators such as endocannabinoids (Simon2006Endocannabinoid; Lee2015ABHD4). The protein is predominantly active in the central nervous system, where it contributes to processes like synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection (László2020ABHD4dependent). Additionally, ABHD4 has been implicated in various clinical conditions, including acute coronary syndrome and cancer, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target (Agwa2021ABHD4Regulating; Yamanoi2016Suppression).

## Structure
The ABHD4 protein is encoded by the human ABHD4 gene and consists of 342 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of approximately 39 kDa (Lord2013Mammalian; Bononi2021α/β-Hydrolase). It is part of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, characterized by a common fold that includes an 8-stranded β-sheet core surrounded by α-helices and loops (Lord2013Mammalian). This structural motif is typical of enzymes with hydrolase activity, which is consistent with ABHD4's function as a lyso-N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine lipase (Lord2013Mammalian).

The protein's structure includes a catalytic center with a serine residue, which is crucial for its enzymatic activity (Sanders2017Molecular). Structural modeling has revealed that ABHD4 shares similarities with its paralog ABHD5, particularly in the spatial arrangement of key amino acids, although specific differences affect its lipase activation function (Sanders2017Molecular). The protein's phospholipase B activity is noted, with the S159 hydroxyl group at the catalytic center being spatially remote from other key residues (Sanders2017Molecular).

While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ABHD4 are not fully detailed, the protein's involvement in lipid metabolism and its structural similarities to other α/β-hydrolase family members suggest a complex and functionally significant architecture. There is no information on specific domains, prominent folds, or post-translational modifications provided in the available context.

## Function
The ABHD4 gene encodes a protein that functions as an N-acyl phospholipase B, playing a significant role in lipid metabolism within the mammalian central nervous system. This enzyme is involved in the hydrolysis of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) and lyso-NAPEs, which are atypical components of cell membranes and serve as biosynthetic precursors for lipid mediators such as endocannabinoids (Simon2006Endocannabinoid; Lee2015ABHD4). ABHD4 exhibits NAPE- and lysoNAPE-lipase activity, crucial for the production of lysoNAPEs and glycerophospho-NAEs (GP-NAEs), which are intermediates in the biosynthesis of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) (Simon2006Endocannabinoid; Lee2015ABHD4).

In healthy human cells, ABHD4 is active in various cellular compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum and cytosol, where it regulates the metabolism of multiple classes of N-acyl phospholipids (Lee2015ABHD4). This regulation is essential for maintaining lipid homeostasis and impacts processes such as synaptic plasticity, apoptosis, and neuroprotection (László2020ABHD4dependent). The enzyme's activity is particularly significant in the developing brain, where it is highly expressed in radial glia progenitor cells, although its expression decreases postnatally (László2020ABHD4dependent).

## Clinical Significance
ABHD4 has been implicated in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a major cardiovascular condition. Research indicates that ABHD4 expression is significantly upregulated in ACS patients compared to those with non-cardiac chest pain and healthy individuals. This upregulation is associated with the dysregulation of specific microRNAs, such as miRNA-197 and miRNA-221, which are involved in apoptosis and inflammatory responses, respectively. miRNA-197 is upregulated, while miRNA-221 is downregulated in ACS patients, suggesting a complex regulatory network influencing ABHD4 expression (Agwa2021ABHD4Regulating).

The study also highlights the potential of ABHD4-regulating RNAs as biomarkers for early detection of ACS, particularly in patients with unstable angina and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The RNA panel, including ABHD4 mRNA, offers high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing ACS from non-cardiac conditions (Agwa2021ABHD4Regulating).

While the clinical significance of ABHD4 in cancer is less clear, it is noted that suppression of ABHD4 increases resistance to anoikis in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a potential role in cancer biology (Yamanoi2016Suppression). Further research is needed to fully elucidate the clinical implications of ABHD4 expression alterations.
