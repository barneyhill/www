# RNF157

## Overview
RNF157 is a gene that encodes the protein ring finger protein 157, which is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays a significant role in neuronal survival and morphology. The RING domain of RNF157 is essential for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, facilitating the ubiquitination process that tags proteins for degradation or functional modification. This activity is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating various cellular processes, including dendrite growth and axon development. RNF157 interacts with several proteins, such as the adaptor protein Fe65, influencing amyloid precursor protein processing and neuronal health. Additionally, RNF157 is involved in immune regulation, particularly in CD4+ T cells, where it modulates immune responses and is implicated in autoimmune diseases. Alterations in RNF157 expression or function have been associated with neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders, highlighting its clinical significance (Matz2014Regulation; Kong2020Aa; Wang2023RNF157).

## Structure
RNF157 is characterized by the presence of a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain, which is crucial for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Matz2014Regulation). This domain facilitates the ubiquitination process, tagging proteins for degradation or functional modification (Matz2014Regulation). The protein is predominantly expressed in the brain and is localized in the cytoplasmic fraction of neurons (Matz2014Regulation).

The molecular structure of RNF157 includes an N-terminal region that interacts with the adaptor protein Fe65, excluding the RING domain (Matz2014Regulation). This interaction is significant for its role in neuronal survival and morphology. RNF157 is an acidic protein with a molecular weight of approximately 110 kDa (Matz2014Regulation).

Post-translational modifications of RNF157 include ubiquitination, which is essential for its function in neuronal regulation (Matz2014Regulation). The study does not provide detailed information on secondary, tertiary, or quaternary structures, nor does it mention splice variant isoforms. The evolutionary conservation of RNF157 suggests its importance in neuronal functions across species (Matz2014Regulation).

## Function
RNF157 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a crucial role in neuronal survival and morphology. It is involved in the ubiquitination process, tagging proteins for degradation, which is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. RNF157 supports neuronal survival in an E3 ligase-dependent manner, as its overexpression protects neurons from apoptosis, while a mutant lacking the RING domain does not (Matz2014Regulation). The protein also regulates dendrite growth and maintenance independently of its ligase activity, as its knockdown results in reduced dendritic length and simpler dendritic arbors (Matz2014Regulation).

RNF157 interacts with the adaptor protein Fe65, which is involved in amyloid precursor protein processing. This interaction is significant for neuronal health, as RNF157 ubiquitinates Fe65, leading to its proteasomal degradation, which is crucial for axon growth control (Matz2014Regulation). In CD4+ T cells, RNF157 promotes the degradation of HDAC1 through K48-linked ubiquitination, affecting the differentiation and function of these immune cells, which is important for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune responses (Wang2023RNF157). RNF157 is active in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, influencing various cellular processes and potentially impacting neurodegenerative processes (Matz2014Regulation).

## Clinical Significance
Mutations or alterations in the expression of the RNF157 gene have been implicated in several diseases, particularly autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorders. In the context of autoimmune diseases, RNF157 plays a critical role in modulating CD4+ T cell functions. Its deficiency is associated with enhanced progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). This is due to increased Th17 differentiation and decreased Th1 differentiation, which are influenced by altered cytokine levels and chemokine receptor expression in CD4+ T cells (Wang2023RNF157). In MS patients, lower levels of RNF157 correlate with higher levels of RORC expression, suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of MS (Wang2023RNF157).

In neurodegenerative diseases, RNF157 is crucial for neuronal survival and morphology. It regulates neuronal health by interacting with proteins like Fe65, influencing amyloid precursor protein processing and axon growth. Alterations in RNF157 expression or function could be linked to neurodegenerative conditions, as its ubiquitin ligase activity is essential for neuronal maintenance (Matz2014Regulation). Additionally, RNF157's role in the MEGF8-MGRN1/RNF157 complex affects Hedgehog signaling, which is implicated in congenital heart defects and heterotaxy (Kong2020Aa).

## Interactions
RNF157 interacts with several proteins, playing a significant role in neuronal survival and morphology. It binds to the adaptor protein Fe65, which is predominantly expressed in the brain and localizes to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of neurons. This interaction is crucial for neuronal survival, as RNF157's ligase activity is required for this process. RNF157 binds to the second PTB domain of Fe65, while Fe65 binds to an N-terminal region of RNF157, excluding the RING domain (Matz2014Regulation). RNF157 can ubiquitinate Fe65, forming K63-polyubiquitin chains, which are typically associated with functional modification or stabilization (Matz2014Regulation).

RNF157 also interacts with Tip110, a nuclear RNA-binding protein, to promote apoptosis. The Fe65-Tip110 interaction in the nucleus is essential for this apoptotic process (Matz2014Regulation). In the context of CD4+ T cells, RNF157 interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), promoting its degradation through K48-linked ubiquitination. This interaction is crucial for modulating CD4+ T cell functions and is implicated in autoimmune responses (Wang2023RNF157). These interactions highlight RNF157's role in various cellular processes through its protein-protein interactions.
