# FHL2

## Overview
FHL2, or Four and a Half LIM Domains 2, is a gene that encodes a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes. The protein, also referred to as FHL2, is characterized by its four complete LIM domains and one half LIM domain, which facilitate extensive protein-protein interactions. As a LIM-domain only protein, FHL2 serves as a versatile modulator of intracellular signaling pathways, influencing cellular functions such as gene expression, cell adhesion, and cytoskeleton dynamics. It is predominantly expressed in the heart, where it plays a critical role in cardiac physiology, including recovery from cardiac insults and modulation of cardiac hypertrophy. FHL2 also acts as a mechanotransducer, shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus in response to mechanical stimuli, thereby affecting gene expression related to cell proliferation. Its involvement in diverse cellular contexts, such as muscle differentiation and androgen receptor coactivation, underscores its significance in both normal physiology and disease states (Muller2000FHL2; Johannessen2006The; Tran2016Protein–protein).

## Structure
The FHL2 protein is composed of 279 amino acids and features four complete LIM domains and one half LIM domain, which are characterized by double zinc finger motifs that facilitate protein-protein interactions (Muller2000FHL2; Pašaliç2011FHL2). Each LIM domain consists of two zinc finger structures spaced by two amino acids, forming a compact structure with flexible linker domains (Tran2016Protein–protein). The zinc fingers in LIM domains 1-3 have loops of 16-18 residues, while LIM-4 has loops of 20 amino acids (Tran2016Protein–protein).

FHL2 acts as a protein interaction platform and is involved in modulating intracellular signaling pathways by interacting with various proteins (Tran2016Protein–protein). It is highly expressed in the heart and plays a role in cardiovascular health, being crucial for recovery from cardiac insults and associated with cardiac hypertrophy (Tran2016Protein–protein). FHL2 interacts with proteins throughout the cell, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane (Tran2016Protein–protein).

The protein can undergo post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, although phosphorylation by ERK2 has not been detected (Johannessen2006The). FHL2 also contains several potential phosphorylation sites and one O-glycosylation site (Johannessen2006The). The presence of multiple splice variants contributes to its functional diversity (Pašaliç2011FHL2).

## Function
FHL2, or four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 2, is involved in various cellular processes, acting as a multifunctional protein in healthy human cells. It interacts with over 50 different proteins, including receptors, structural proteins, and transcription factors, suggesting a broad role in cellular signaling and structural organization (Johannessen2006The). FHL2 is highly expressed in the heart, where it modulates cardiac physiology by interacting with the MAP kinase ERK2, potentially influencing cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular function through structural remodeling and energy consumption alterations (Johannessen2006The).

In muscle cells, FHL2 promotes myoblast differentiation and interacts with titin, a key sarcomere organizer, linking metabolic enzymes to titin and aiding in energy provision during muscle contraction (Johannessen2006The). It also acts as a coactivator for the androgen receptor (AR), enhancing AR-dependent transcription in a ligand-dependent manner, particularly in the heart and prostate (Muller2000FHL2).

FHL2 functions as a mechanotransducer, shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus in response to mechanical stimuli, and modulates gene expression related to cell proliferation (Fujimoto2024The). It is involved in the regulation of gene expression, cell adhesion, and cytoskeleton dynamics, influencing cell survival and mobility (Johannessen2006The).

## Clinical Significance
The FHL2 gene is implicated in various diseases and conditions through alterations in its expression levels and interactions. In cancer, FHL2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and is linked to cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor immune microenvironment. High FHL2 expression correlates with worse outcomes in several cancers, including LUAD, and is involved in processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cellular adhesion, which contribute to cancer metastasis and invasion (Pan2023Comprehensive). 

In cardiovascular health, FHL2 plays a role in cardiac hypertrophy and failure. It interacts with proteins in cardiomyocytes, influencing apoptosis and sarcomere assembly. FHL2-deficient mice exhibit exaggerated hypertrophic responses under β-adrenergic stimulation, suggesting a protective role against cardiac hypertrophy (Tran2016Protein–protein). 

FHL2 is also involved in kidney fibrosis, where its expression is upregulated by TGF-β1, promoting fibroblast activation and fibrosis. Knockdown of FHL2 reduces fibroblast activation and fibrosis, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target in chronic kidney diseases (Duan2020Deletion). 

In skeletal muscle, FHL2 promotes myoblast differentiation and is involved in autophagy, while in the liver, its overexpression can lead to inflammation and cirrhosis (Habibe2021How).

## Interactions
FHL2, a LIM-domain only protein, is involved in numerous protein-protein interactions that influence various cellular processes. It acts as a transcriptional coactivator by interacting with AP-1 components, specifically c-Jun and c-Fos, enhancing their transcriptional activity without affecting AP-1's DNA binding ability (Morlon2003The). FHL2 also interacts with the androgen receptor (AR), forming a complex in the presence of dihydrotestosterone, and requires the AR's H12 and H3 regions for binding (Muller2000FHL2).

FHL2 forms a ternary complex with CBP/p300 and β-catenin, enhancing β-catenin/TCF-mediated transcription. This interaction involves the acetylation of β-catenin by p300, which is crucial for their cooperative function (Labalette2004Interaction). FHL2 also binds to ADAM-17, a metalloproteinase, and the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a role in regulating ADAM-17's localization and activity (Canault2006FHL2).

In cardiomyocytes, FHL2 interacts with ERK2, affecting its nuclear translocation and gene expression (Tran2016Protein–protein). It also modulates TRAF6-mediated signaling by binding to TRAF6 and displacing it from RANK, impacting osteoclast formation and bone resorption (Johannessen2006The). These interactions highlight FHL2's role as a versatile modulator of cellular signaling pathways.
