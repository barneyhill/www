# NUSAP1

## Overview
NUSAP1, or nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1, is a gene that encodes a microtubule-binding protein crucial for mitotic processes. The NUSAP1 protein is involved in spindle assembly, stability, and chromosome segregation during cell division. It contains a conserved SAP domain and a microtubule-binding domain, which facilitate its interaction with chromatin and microtubules, respectively (Iyer2011What’s; Mills2017Nucleolar). The protein's function is regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and SUMOylation, which modulate its activity and localization (Damizia2023Distinct; Chou2011Phosphorylation). NUSAP1 is essential for maintaining genomic stability, and its dysregulation is implicated in various cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions (Chiu2023NUSAP1; Damizia2023Distinct).

## Structure
The human NUSAP1 protein is characterized by several distinct structural features. It contains a conserved SAP domain at its N-terminus, which is a putative DNA-binding motif that may help target NUSAP1 to mitotic chromosomes (Iyer2011What’s; Mills2017Nucleolar). The protein also includes a microtubule-binding domain, which is crucial for its role in spindle assembly and stability during mitosis (Mills2017Nucleolar; Damizia2023Distinct). 

NUSAP1 is subject to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and SUMOylation, which regulate its function. Phosphorylation by Cdk1 at specific sites within the microtubule-binding domain inhibits its binding to microtubules, a process that is reversed during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition to promote spindle midzone formation (Chou2011Phosphorylation). SUMOylation occurs at two consensus sites, K44 and K316, which are located in the SAP and microtubule-binding domains, respectively. These modifications influence NUSAP1's localization and interaction with chromatin and microtubules (Damizia2023Distinct).

The secondary structure of NUSAP1 is well-ordered, comprising mostly α-helices and coils, with some short stretches of extended β-sheets (Iyer2011What’s). The protein's three-dimensional structure is similar to the largest subunit of DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (Iyer2011What’s).

## Function
NUSAP1 (nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1) is a microtubule-binding protein that plays a critical role in mitosis, particularly in spindle assembly, stability, and chromosome segregation. During mitosis, NUSAP1 localizes to spindle microtubules, where it is involved in tethering microtubules to chromatin in a kinetochore-independent manner, ensuring proper chromosome alignment and segregation (Mills2017Nucleolar). The protein's function is regulated by phosphorylation, which modulates its affinity for microtubules, allowing for dynamic rearrangement necessary for mitotic spindle formation (Chou2011Phosphorylation).

NUSAP1 is also involved in chromatin-induced spindle formation during early embryogenesis, highlighting its essential role in cell proliferation and development (Vanden2010NuSAP). It interacts with the RanBP2-RanGAP1 SUMO E3 ligase complex, contributing to mitotic progression and chromosome segregation (Mills2017Nucleolar). The protein's expression is cell cycle-regulated, with high levels during the G2/M phase, and it is targeted for degradation by E3 ubiquitin ligases, ensuring its timely removal as cells exit mitosis (Mills2017Nucleolar).

In healthy human cells, NUSAP1 is crucial for maintaining genomic stability by ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and proper mitotic spindle dynamics (Damizia2023Distinct). Its absence or dysfunction can lead to mitotic arrest, abnormal spindle formation, and genomic instability, underscoring its importance in cell division (Chou2011Phosphorylation).

## Clinical Significance
The NUSAP1 gene is implicated in various cancers due to its altered expression levels and interactions. In prostate cancer, increased NUSAP1 expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, enhancing cell motility, invasion, and metastasis through pathways like WNT and Hedgehog signaling (Chiu2023NUSAP1). In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), NUSAP1 overexpression contributes to chemoresistance by enhancing DNA damage repair through its interaction with RAD51, a key enzyme in homologous recombination (Han2021Nucleolar). 

In gastric cancer, NUSAP1 is upregulated and correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor survival, promoting cell proliferation and invasion (Guo2021NUSAP1). Similarly, in triple-negative breast cancer, NUSAP1 overexpression is linked to poor prognosis and increased cancer cell proliferation and invasion via the Wnt/β-catenin and EMT pathways (Sun2020Overexpression). 

NUSAP1 also plays a role in astrocytoma aggressiveness by activating the Hedgehog signaling pathway, leading to increased tumor invasiveness (Wu2017Nucleolar). In ovarian cancer, high NUSAP1 expression is an independent risk factor for poor prognosis, associated with DNA repair pathways and immune cell infiltration (Gou2022Identification). These findings suggest that NUSAP1 is a potential therapeutic target across multiple cancer types.

## Interactions
NUSAP1 interacts with several proteins and complexes during mitosis, playing a crucial role in spindle stability and chromosome segregation. It interacts with the RanBP2-RanGAP1-UBC9 SUMO E3 ligase complex, a key player in mitotic progression. This interaction is cell cycle-dependent and is particularly significant during chromosome segregation (Mills2017Nucleolar). NUSAP1 is not a direct target for SUMOylation but may act as a regulatory subunit for the complex, potentially mediating substrate interactions or complex activation (Mills2017Nucleolar).

NUSAP1 also interacts with RANBP2, a nucleoporin with SUMO ligase activity, which stabilizes NUSAP1 at microtubule plus ends, protecting it from proteasome-dependent degradation. This interaction is crucial during the chromosome search-and-capture process and the spindle assembly checkpoint (Damizia2023Distinct). The interaction with RANBP2 and SUMO2/3 peptides at key mitotic sites suggests a regulatory mechanism for NUSAP1 activity (Damizia2023Distinct).

Additionally, NUSAP1 interacts with microtubule motor proteins such as Mitotic Centromere-Associated Kinesin (MCAK) and Kinesin-like DNA-binding protein Kid, modulating their activities to stabilize microtubule attachments and control chromosome orientation (Damizia2023Distinct). These interactions highlight NUSAP1's role in maintaining genomic stability during cell division.
