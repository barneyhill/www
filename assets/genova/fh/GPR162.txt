# GPR162

## Overview
GPR162 is a gene that encodes the G protein-coupled receptor 162, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which is characterized by its role in transmembrane signaling. The protein encoded by GPR162 is involved in critical cellular processes, particularly in the context of the immune response and DNA damage repair. It interacts with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, playing a pivotal role in the activation of immune responses and enhancing the DNA damage response, which is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. This interaction is significant in the context of cancer, where GPR162 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor and radiation sensitizer, making it a promising target for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving radiotherapy outcomes (Long2023GPR162).

## Clinical Significance
GPR162 has been identified as a potential tumor suppressor and radiation sensitizer in various cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, liver cancer, and breast cancer. Alterations in the expression of GPR162 are associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis. Low expression levels of GPR162 are observed in multiple solid tumors compared to normal tissues, and higher expression is linked to better prognosis in certain cancers (Long2023GPR162). In lung cancer, overexpression of GPR162 has been shown to slow cell proliferation, reduce colony formation, and inhibit tumor development, while its knockout or knockdown leads to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth (Long2023GPR162).

GPR162 interacts with the STING signaling pathway, enhancing the DNA damage response and increasing the sensitivity of tumors to radiotherapy. This interaction promotes the activation of type I interferon systems and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, which are crucial for immune responses (Long2023GPR162). The gene's role in activating the STING-dependent DNA damage pathway suggests its potential as a target for cancer therapy, particularly in enhancing the effects of radiotherapy (Long2023GPR162). These findings highlight the clinical significance of GPR162 in cancer treatment and its potential therapeutic implications.

## Interactions
GPR162, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, is involved in significant interactions with the protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes). This interaction occurs in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum and is crucial for activating the STING-dependent DNA damage response pathway. The interaction between GPR162 and STING has been confirmed through immunoprecipitation analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and confocal microscopy, demonstrating their co-localization in cell lines such as A549 and PC9 (Long2023GPR162).

GPR162 overexpression leads to increased protein levels of STING, p-IRF3, and p-TBK1, even in the absence of cGAS, indicating that GPR162 can activate the STING pathway independently of the classical cGAS-STING pathway (Long2023GPR162). This activation enhances the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines like CXCL10 and CXCL4, particularly after radiotherapy, suggesting a role in modulating the immune response (Long2023GPR162).

The interaction between GPR162 and STING is specific, as evidenced by the failure of the STING-R281L mutant to interact with GPR162, highlighting the specificity of the interaction sites (Long2023GPR162). These interactions position GPR162 as a potential target for enhancing radiotherapy outcomes by sensitizing tumors to radiation through its role in the DNA damage response and immune activation pathways (Long2023GPR162).
