# FBXO2

## Overview
FBXO2 is a gene that encodes the F-box protein 2, a member of the F-box protein family, which is characterized by the presence of an F-box motif. This motif is integral to the formation of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complexes, which are crucial for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Zhao2020FBXO2). F-box protein 2 is categorized as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing a pivotal role in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway by targeting glycosylated proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Ji2022FBXO2). The protein is particularly significant in neuronal cells, where it helps maintain protein homeostasis and is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (Randle2016Fbox; Ji2022FBXO2). The gene's expression and the protein's interactions with specific substrates underscore its importance in cellular regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target in disease contexts (Zhao2020FBXO2; Sun2018FBXO2).

## Structure
FBXO2, also known as F-box protein 2, is a member of the F-box protein family, characterized by the presence of an F-box motif, which is approximately 40 amino acids in length. This motif is crucial for protein-protein interactions, particularly in forming SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) complexes that are essential for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (Zhao2020FBXO2). The molecular structure of FBXO2 includes several distinct domains: the F-box domain, a PEST domain, and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) (Zhang2018EpsteinBarr). The F-box domain is located at the N-terminus, while the FBA (F-box associated) domain is situated at the C-terminus and is essential for recognizing glycoproteins (Che2020FBXO2).

The FBA domain is critical for the protein's function, as mutations in this domain, such as Tyr278A and Trp279A, abolish its glycoprotein-recognizing ability (Che2020FBXO2). FBXO2 specifically recognizes high-mannose glycoproteins, which are incomplete products of the N-glycosylation pathway (Zhang2018EpsteinBarr). The protein is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, where it targets glycosylated proteins for ubiquitination and degradation (Ji2022FBXO2). Post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, may regulate its activity, and splice variants could lead to different isoforms with distinct functions (Zhao2020FBXO2).

## Function
FBXO2 (F-box protein 2) is a component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which is crucial for protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This protein is involved in recognizing and binding specific substrates for ubiquitination, thereby regulating protein turnover. FBXO2 is particularly active in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it plays a significant role in maintaining protein homeostasis, especially in neuronal cells (Randle2016Fbox).

In healthy human cells, FBXO2 is originally described as a brain-specific protein and is also found in cochlear cells. Its expression is associated with the regulation of glycoprotein quality, as it recognizes high-mannose glycoproteins through its FBA domain (Zhang2018EpsteinBarr; Song2019Emerging). Knockout studies in mice have shown that the absence of FBXO2 can lead to age-related hearing loss, indicating its importance in auditory function (Zhang2018EpsteinBarr).

FBXO2's role in protein homeostasis is further highlighted by its involvement in targeting glycosylated proteins for degradation, which is essential for cellular processes and maintaining the balance of protein synthesis and degradation in specific tissues (Randle2016Fbox).

## Clinical Significance
FBXO2 has been implicated in various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases due to its role in protein degradation. In glioblastoma, FBXO2 is highly upregulated in recurrent tumors, correlating with poorer survival outcomes. Knockout studies in glioma models have shown increased survival and reduced tumor growth, suggesting a protumorigenic role for FBXO2 in glioblastoma (Buehler2022Quantitative).

In gastric cancer, high FBXO2 expression is associated with lymph node metastasis and shorter overall survival. It promotes proliferation and migration of cancer cells, and its knockdown reduces these activities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target (Sun2018FBXO2).

FBXO2 also plays a role in ovarian cancer by targeting the glycosylated form of the tumor suppressor protein SUN2 for degradation, which prevents apoptosis and promotes cell proliferation. This process is regulated by the transcription factor SOX6, forming a SOX6-FBXO2-SUN2 axis that contributes to cancer progression (Ji2022FBXO2).

In osteosarcoma, FBXO2 interacts with the STAT3 signaling pathway, enhancing tumorigenicity. Its overexpression increases proliferation, while knockout inhibits these processes, highlighting its oncogenic potential (Zhao2020FBXO2).

FBXO2 is also involved in neurodegenerative conditions, such as Niemann-Pick type C disease, where its deficiency exacerbates the disease phenotype by impairing lysosomal clearance (Liu2020Fbxo2).

## Interactions
FBXO2, a member of the F-box protein family, is involved in various protein interactions, primarily through its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. It interacts with glycoproteins that possess high-mannose glycans, facilitating their degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. This interaction is crucial for maintaining glycoprotein homeostasis in neurons and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by regulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels and processing (Atkin2014Fbox).

FBXO2 also interacts with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) glycoprotein B (gB), targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation. This interaction limits EBV infectivity by reducing gB levels on the plasma membrane, thereby decreasing viral entry and cell fusion (Zhang2018EpsteinBarr).

In cancer biology, FBXO2 interacts with glycosylated SUN2 in ovarian cancer cells, targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation, which may promote cancer progression (Ji2022FBXO2). In osteosarcoma cells, FBXO2 interacts with the interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6R), specifically stabilizing the IL6ST component, which enhances IL-6-induced STAT3 activation, contributing to tumorigenicity (Zhao2020FBXO2).
